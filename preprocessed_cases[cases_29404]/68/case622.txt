opinion on rehearing 
plaintiff sought to recover money owed it on a contract under which it supplied electrical equipment for a public works project.defendants claimed plaintiff was barred from recovering because it had waived its mechanic lien rights up through a date when the funds should have been paid.by grant of summary adjudication,the trial court determined plaintiff conditional waiver and release of its mechanic lien rights under civil code section,subdivision d,released lien rights only to the extent plaintiff had received payment and not up through the date stated on the release.
at trial on plaintiff remaining causes of action,the court granted judgment in favor of plaintiff on its claim for breach of a joint check agreement and also awarded statutory penalties.the trial court also dismissed a filed by defendants.
except to reverse and remand the award of statutory penalties,we affirm the judgment in all respects,but do so on different grounds than those relied upon by the trial court.
undisputed facts at summary adjudication motion 
in february,defendant city of chico the city contracted with defendant monterey mechanical company,monterey,to expand the city wastewater treatment control plant at a cost of approximately million.the agreement called for the city to pay monterey by means of progress payments and a final payment.the city agreed not to retain any amounts from the progress payments because monterey agreed to file a performance bond in lieu of agreeing to retentions.
the city contract also required monterey to furnish a bond in the amount of the contract price to guarantee payment of all claims filed against the project for labor and materials.monterey obtained the labor and materials bond from defendant fireman fund insurance company.
in april,monterey entered into a subcontract agreement with defendant stratton electric,stratton,to complete electrical work for the project at a cost of roughly million.the subcontract called for stratton to submit monthly invoices,and for monterey to make monthly progress payments to stratton in the amount of percent of the city estimate of the amount of work done on the project during the month.monterey would withhold the remaining percent of the amount owed as a retention to be paid upon final completion and acceptance of the work.
also,monterey was not required to pay stratton unless stratton provided releases executed by everyone who might have mechanic lien,stop notice or labor and material bond rights against the project arising out of work performed to that date under the subcontract with stratton.monterey did not require stratton to post a labor and materials bond to cover such claims.instead,the parties agreed stratton would use the joint check policy.
finally,the subcontract expressly required stratton and plaintiff tesco controls,tesco,to provide jointly a complete and operable installation of certain electrical work in accordance with monterey specifications.
by a purchase order dated february,stratton retained tesco to furnish certain electrical instruments and controls for the project at a cost of roughly.subsequent change orders increased the cost to.
in the purchase order,stratton agreed to pay tesco in monthly progress payments equal to percent of labor and materials which have been placed in position,with funds received by stratton from city for work performed by tesco as reflected in stratton applications for payment.capitalization omitted,italics added.the purchase order also awarded attorney fees to the prevailing party in a dispute arising under its terms.
in march,monterey and stratton entered into a joint check agreement for the express benefit of tesco by which monterey and stratton agreed to a method for paying tesco different from that established in the purchase order.according to the joint check agreement,any tesco invoice sent to stratton would be copied to monterey.monterey would pay tesco by negotiable check in the amount of such invoice and made payable to both tesco and stratton.italics added.stratton then would endorse the check and make it payable to tesco as payment in full of the related invoice.payments would be made when normal progress payments were due.the joint check agreement said nothing about retentions.
defendants admit tesco fully performed its obligations under the purchase order.however,after the project was completed,tesco remained underpaid by.defendants claim tesco released its lien rights to recover that amount by a release dated march,assertion which tesco denies.the disagreement arose as follows 
tesco began shipping equipment to the project site in november.its first invoice,dated november,was in the amount of.contrary to the terms of the joint check agreement,stratton paid this invoice in full by its own check dated january.however,by that time,tesco had invoiced additional shipments.as of january,billed on invoices from december through january,remained unpaid.
tesco continued shipping equipment in february,but received no payments that month.by march,tesco invoicing of equipment resulted in a balance owed of.on march,tesco received a check drawn directly by stratton in the amount of,but stratton asked tesco not to deposit the check for as long as days.the check never cleared the bank.
meanwhile,on march,tesco gave monterey a lien waiver and release conditioned upon receiving a progress payment of.the release,made under civil code section,subdivision d,cover ed a progress payment for labor,services,equipment or material furnished to stratton electric through only,
by joint check dated march,monterey paid to stratton and tesco,which tesco deposited in its bank.had stratton check for cleared the bank,it,along with monterey payment,would have brought tesco account current through january,assuming no retentions were withheld by defendants,and left an outstanding balance of owed tesco for materials and services invoiced as of march.instead,without that check clearing,unpaid invoices since december through march,totaled.if a retention was assumed on all of what tesco had invoiced up to march,tesco as of that date was owed.
during april and may,there were communications between tesco,stratton and monterey regarding the failure of stratton check to clear the bank and stratton inability to bring its accounts payable current.by letter dated may,tesco informed stratton it had to be paid for materials furnished through march.tesco warned stratton it would file a stop notice on the project if this amount was not paid in full by may.ultimately,monterey division manager,james troup,learned tesco was owed approximately through march and was threatening not to ship any more product until it was paid.
after further discussions,tesco issued a second conditional lien waiver and release form,this one dated may,whereby it agreed to release its mechanic lien rights upon payment from monterey of.the release covered equipment and services rendered through march.
on may,troup acknowledged the may release and agreed with wallace tessmer,president of tesco,that monterey would pay tesco immediately and approximately the first week of june.troup memorialized the agreement in a handwritten notation as follows agreed at tesco pay joint check now and plus or minus balance from release the first week of june.italics added.of significance here,troup acknowledged in his deposition tesco was not owed that much money for the current progress payment,so they agreed to spread the amount over two payments.
by joint check dated may,monterey paid stratton and tesco.it issued another joint check on june,payable to stratton and tesco in the amount of.tesco applied these payments to its oldest outstanding balances,including those for which stratton bounced check had been designated.its records thus showed,except for a percent retention,it had been paid in full for all services and materials provided through march.
tesco continued providing product and services,and completed shipping and invoicing its work by july.as of that date,tesco was owed,but it received no payment.in september,monterey received a progress payment from the city,but it made no payment to tesco.in november,tesco filed a stop notice with the city,and it initiated this action in february.stratton filed for chapter bankruptcy protection shortly thereafter.in june,monterey paid tesco,leaving tesco short,an amount equal to the amount of stratton bounced check.
procedural history 
tesco first amended complaint contains eight causes of action.the first four were alleged against stratton breach of written contract,open book account,account stated,and goods sold and delivered.stratton is not a party to this appeal.consequently,we will not address these four causes of action.
the fifth cause of action,enforcement of a stop notice,was alleged against stratton,monterey and the city.the sixth cause of action,recovery under the surety bond,was alleged against stratton,monterey and fireman fund.the seventh and eighth causes of action were both alleged against monterey breach of the joint check agreement,and a request for statutory penalties under business and professions code sections and,public contract code section,and,as later amended,public contract code section in lieu of business and professions code section.
monterey filed a,alleging breach of contract and misrepresentation by tesco and breach of contract and equitable indemnity against stratton.the also sought comparative indemnity from both tesco and stratton.
tesco moved for summary judgment or,alternatively,summary adjudication,to recover the approximately.defendants opposed,claiming the march,mechanic lien release barred tesco from recovering for work it provided up through january,including the work for which stratton unfunded check was intended to compensate.defendants also claimed monterey payment of was not intended to include payment for stratton bounced check 
the trial court granted tesco summary adjudication on its first six causes of action.it ruled the march,lien release waived tesco lien rights only up to the amount of the actually paid to tesco and not as to the rest of the money owed,and it was undisputed tesco had not been paid for the total amount owed.
trial proceeded without a jury on tesco seventh and eighth causes of action and on the.the trial court found in favor of tesco on its remaining causes of action and against monterey on its.it issued an amended statement of decision,including findings of fact,on may,and entered judgment in favor of tesco and against all defendants on july,awarding tesco plus interest,statutory penalties,attorney fees and costs.
monterey,fireman fund,and the city appeal the court judgment.they allege the trial court erred by determining on summary adjudication the march,lien release released tesco lien rights only to the extent of the it received from monterey and not for all work performed through january,regardless of payment granting a judgment finding monterey breached the joint check agreement awarding an excessive amount of prejudgment interest awarding statutory penalties and ruling against monterey cross cause of action against tesco for misrepresentation.

discussion 
iscope and effect of lien release 
defendants claim the trial court erred when it concluded the march lien release in the amount of released tesco lien rights only to that amount.they assert tesco,by issuing the release,waived all of its bond rights to recover money owed for services rendered through january,despite having not been paid for them.defendants also claim the march release worked an accord and satisfaction to settle the dispute over stratton bounced check,effectively releasing any claim tesco had to recover that amount.
while we conclude the trial court interpretation of the lien release was incorrect,we also conclude the lien release did not work an accord and satisfaction and,in fact,had no effect on tesco ability to assert its lien rights in this action.
background information 
our state constitution provides mechanics,persons furnishing materials,artisans,and laborers of every class,shall have a lien upon the property upon which they have bestowed labor or furnished material for the value of such labor done and material furnished and the legislature shall provide,by law,for the speedy and efficient enforcement of such liens.cal,art.xiv.as this court has said,the mechanic lien is the only creditors remedy stemming from constitutional command and our courts have uniformly classified the mechanics lien laws as remedial legislation,to be liberally construed for the protection of laborers and materialmen.citation.citation.s tate policy strongly supports the preservation of laws which give the laborer and materialman security for their claims.citation.clarke safeco ins.cal th,d.
by law,any waiver of a subcontractor mechanic lienrights is null and void unless the lien holder expressly waives his rights pursuant to a form prescribed by section,subdivision d tesco march,release was given in the form provided by section,subdivision d,a conditional waiver effective upon receipt of a progress payment.the march release,in compliance with the statute,read in relevant part as follows 
upon receipt by the undersigned of a check from monterey mechanical in the sum of payable to stratton electric and tesco controls,and when the check has been properly endorsed and has been paid by the bank upon which it is drawn,this document shall become effective to release any mechanic lien,stop notice or bond right the undersigned has on the job of city of chico.
this claim shall be released by the undersigned to the following extent this release covers a progress payment for labor,services,equipment or material furnished to stratton electric through only.
this release does not cover any retentions retained before or after the release date extras furnished before the release date for which payment has not been received or extras or items furnished after the release date this release of any mechanic lien,stop notice or bond right shall not otherwise affect the contract rights,including rights between parties to the contract based upon a recission sic,abandonment or breach of the contract,or the right of the undersigned to recovery sic compensation for furnished labor,services,equipment or material covered by this release if that furnished labor,services,equipment,or material was not compensated by the progress payment.before any recipient of this document relies on it,said party should verify evidence of payment to the undersigned.capitalization omitted,italics added see,subd.d.the release was signed by an authorized tesco representative.
relying primarily on the first two italicized sections,defendants claim the statutory release waived all lien rights for work provided up through january,and barred tesco from recovering for the amount of work which was not compensated by the time tesco issued the release.tesco,relying primarily on the last italicized section,argues the release is valid only to the extent it received payment,and the release did not waive its lien rights to the approximately worth of services rendered during that time period which was not paid.the trial court agreed with this argument.alternatively,tesco claims if the statutory release did waive its lien rights,it did not foreclose tesco ability to exercise lien rights on sums that became due after the release date.we agree with tesco alternative argument.
we interpret the statutory release according to the following rules we begin with the touchstone of statutory interpretation,namely,the probable intent of the legislature.to interpret statutory language,we must ascertain the intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.citation.in undertaking this determination,we are mindful of this court limited role in the process of interpreting enactments from the political branches of our state government.in interpreting statutes,we follow the legislature intent,as exhibited by the plain meaning of the actual words of the law,whatever may be thought of the wisdom,expediency,or policy of the act.citations.our first step is to scrutinize the actual words of the statute,giving them a plain and commonsense meaning.citations.citation.california teachers governing bd.of rialto unified school dist.cal th,d,california teachers.
we can not presume the legislature engaged in an idle act or enacted a superfluous statutory provision.citation.california teachers,supra,cal th at,d.in analyzing statutory language,we seek to give meaning to every word and phrase in the statute to accomplish a result consistent with the legislative purpose citations.ibid.
of course,we interpret a statute in context,examining other legislation on the same subject,to determine the legislature probable intent.citations.california teachers,supra,cal th at,d.the court may also review the statute legislative history,where c ommittee reports are often useful in determining the legislature intent.citation.id.at,d.
under the statutory language of the release,a subcontractor or materialman waives his mechanic lien,stop notice or bond right s in exchange for a progress payment for services and materials furnished through the date specified in the release,whether or not he receives compensation for all of those services and materials.however,the language retains for the same subcontractor a right to recover compensation for services and materials furnished through the date of his release for which he was not compensated.unable to resolve this apparent conflict definitively from that language,we turn to section legislative history for insight into the legislature intent.
mechanics liens relate back to the time work first commences on a project.the relation back feature of mechanics liens is of particular importance to construction lenders.lenders who have made loans after the commencement of work on a jobsite have found their loans subordinate to mechanics liens arising out of work performed or material delivered after trust deeds securing those loans were recorded because some work was performed or materials delivered before recordation.citations.accordingly,lenders typically require releases of existing lien rights before they will make progress payments on construction loans.citation.
in,however,the ability of construction lenders to obtain valid releases of liens was undercut by bentz plumbing heating favaloro d.bentz construed civil code section to render all lien waivers null and void.citation.the decision dried up construction loans and plunged construction lending in california into chaos.
in response,assemblyman bill lancaster introduced assembly bill in february,sponsored by the associated general contractors and southern california contractors association.the bill amended section to create four kinds of waiver and release of mechanic lien rights,and prescribed a form for each one.halbert lumber,lucky stores,th,d,fns.omitted halbert lumber.
the scope of a conditional lien release under section,subdivision d,as that statute then existed,came under review in the case of halbert lumber.in april,a framing company,subcontractor on a project to construct a supermarket,placed an order with a lumber company for two truckloads of glu lam beams for use in the project.the beams arrived on may and may.on may,the subcontractor demanded a release of the lumber company lien rights through may.the lumber company signed a conditional release waiving lien rights upon a progress payment of roughly for materials furnished to the subcontractor through may halbert lumber,supra,th at,d.
when it signed the release,the lumber company had not yet posted its invoices for the beams.the figure represented other shipments made by the lumber company to the subcontractor prior to the order for the beams.the lumber company did not know the beams had been delivered to the site when it signed the release.halbert lumber,supra,th at,d.
on june,the lumber company posted its invoice for the beams.it received payment for the,but was never paid the cost of the beams.the general contractor terminated its agreement with the subcontractor,and the latter eventually filed for bankruptcy.the lumber company sought to enforce a mechanic lien for the cost of the beams,but the trial court ruled the may release barred the lumber company from recovering.halbert lumber,supra,th at,d.
a unanimous court affirmed the judgment,concluding the scope of the lien release was determined by the date listed on the release,not by the amount actually paid.the court first determined the language of section,subdivision d,was too ambiguous and its legislative history too unclear to assist the court in interpreting the statute.it thus interpreted the statute so as to ascribe to it a reasonable and practical meaning it felt would avoid absurdity.it reasoned as follows 
l ien rights are a remedy available to workers and suppliers who have not been fully paid.if the release form prescribed in section,subdivision d,covered only suppliers who had no claim for further payment for materials delivered through the release date,the form would release nothing that otherwise would not be released anyway.a materials supplier could still assert a given payment was not for materials furnished to a customer through the release date,contrary to the recitation of the second sentence of the release form.no potential disputes over whether a given progress payment covered certain work or materials would be resolved,and the parties would remain uncertain of their rights,including the relative priority of any mechanic lien that might yet be filed.the reading urged by the lumber company would thus render section,subdivision d,an absurdity.it would make the release nothing more than a glorified receipt.while the intent of the legislature as to the precise scope of the conditional waiver release set forth in section,subdivision d is a bit murky,the general purpose of the statute is reasonably clear.assembly bill was introduced in the wake of bentz to provide for releases lenders and owners could rely on if a certain payment were indeed made 
if,as in this case,the payment specified in the release could be made and material suppliers were still able to assert mechanics liens,the release would be useless in paying material suppliers.no rights would be released that would not be released by virtue of the payment anyway.
moreover,pegging the scope of the release strictly to the extent of payment rather than all work or materials furnished through a certain date is impractical.lenders would need to physically monitor the progress of the work at the site in order to ascertain whether any given progress payment covered all the work and material which might potentially give rise to mechanic lien rights.unless every last piece of lumber were accounted for,lenders would be unable to be certain of the relative priority of their after they had loaned the money for a progress payment.halbert lumber,supra,th at,d,italics in original.
in,the legislature introduced two bills in response to halbert lumber,assembly bill and senate bill number.assembly bill stated its purpose was to supersede the holding in halbert lumber.assem.bill reg.sess.as introduced.if passed,it would have amended the conditional lien release of section,subdivision d,to state specifically the waiver released any mechanic lien,stop notice,or bond right to the extent of the amount of the progress payment set forth in the release.assem.bill,supra.assembly bill was never heard by committee and died.cal,art.iv,subd.c.
senate bill as introduced said nothing about halbert lumber,but it,too,if passed,would have amended the conditional lien release form to state specifically the waiver released rights only to the extent of the payment stated in the release.bill reg.sess.as introduced.
considering senate bill,the senate judiciary committee acknowledged the bill as introduced would overturn halbert lumber.com.on judiciary,analysis of bill reg.sess.as introduced.the associated general contractors of california,sponsors of the bill,asserted the case had created a dilemma for the construction industry.each time a contractor or supplier executed a conditional release for a progress payment,it would waive all lien and bond rights for all services furnished up to the date of the release,regardless of whether it had been paid.
bankers and title companies opposed the language in senate bill,claiming it would place them in the position of never knowing exactly for what they paid when they accepted a release and made a progress payment.they feared a subcontractor could sign a release,and then,at a later date,file a new lien for services that should have been but were not billed at the earlier time.com.on judiciary,analysis of bill,supra.
the senate judiciary committee staff,however,stated the main problem of halbert lumber was its effect on retention payments and extra work claims.claims of this nature are not financially resolved until the project is completed.under a strict reading of halbert lumber,all claims for such services would be waived if the subcontractor provided them prior to the release date.com.on judiciary,analysis of bill,supra.
regarding the loss of lien rights,staff noted that even though halbert lumber lost its mechanic lien rights with regard to the lumber beams,halbert could still recover the cost of the beams from the project owner in an equity action.it simply would not have the lien to leverage payment of the claim.however,the case went much further than necessary,and its other would create havoc yet,the proposed response to the case would appear to transform a release into a receipt for all practical purposes,and could cause great uncertainty for lenders and owners.com.on judiciary,analysis of bill,supra,italics added.
responding to its staff concern,the senate judiciary committee amended senate bill.it omitted the language limiting the scope of the release to the amount of the payment stated in the release.in its place,it specified certain matters excluded from the release such as retentions and rights based upon a breach of the contract.it also added the following this release of any mechanic lien,stop notice,or bond right shall not otherwise affect the right of the undersigned to recover compensation for furnished labor,services,equipment,or material covered by this release if that furnished labor,services,equipment,or material was not compensated by the progress payment.bill reg.sess.as amended june.the full senate unanimously approved the bill as amended and forwarded it to the assembly.bill reg.sess.approved by june.
the assembly judiciary committee staff,explaining the proposed bill,described the senate amendment as allowing a subcontractor who executed a release but was ultimately not paid for services rendered prior to the date of the release to proceed on general contract law to collect without the existence of mechanic lien rights.assem.com.on judiciary,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended june.
lenders were still concerned with the senate amendment,claiming the exemption from the release was too broad.they believed a release that did not waive all rights besides lien rights exposed them to unreasonable risk.id.
the assembly judiciary committee apparently did not agree with the lenders.except to clarify the release of lien rights did not otherwise affect the contract rights of the subcontractor,it approved the bill as it had been amended in the senate.bill reg.sess.as amended.the full assembly subsequently approved the bill as amended.bill reg.sess.approved by assem.the senate also approved the bill as amended by the assembly,and the governor signed the bill into law.bill reg.sess.approved by,see stats,ch.
the preceding discussion demonstrates the legislature intended to respond to halbert lumber,but the legislature did not intend to change the conditional release under section,subdivision d,into a glorified receipt.instead,the legislature attempted to balance the competing interests.see jones construction superior court th,d.it crafted a release that waived mechanic lien rights,bond rights,and stop notice rights for services rendered and materials provided up to the date stated on the receipt,even if those services and materials were not compensated by the progress payment.however,waiver was limited only to those express lien rights.by executing the release,the subcontractor or materialman did not waive his rights to pursue compensation for unpaid services and materials under the terms of the contract or as otherwise provided by law or equity.defendants incorrectly argue the release worked as an accord and satisfaction of the outstanding balance.
we find tesco,by executing the lien release dated march,waived its mechanic lien rights,bond rights,and stop notice rights for services rendered and materials supplied up to january.the trial court erred by concluding tesco waiver was effective only as to the it received in payment.however,this determination does not end our analysis.
tesco claims it in fact pursued its remedies to recover the amount of stratton bounced check by continuing to negotiate with monterey and stratton and by threatening to stop all further shipments.it argues the undisputed facts show monterey paid to bring tesco current through march,and that amount included payment of stratton bounced check.this action,tesco argues,is for moneys that were earned and became due after march.thus,the march release is irrelevant to recovering balances that were incurred after march.tesco did not release lien rights for those moneys.on this point,we agree with tesco.
the undisputed facts presented at the hearing on the summary adjudication motion demonstrate monterey agreed,except for a percent retention,to make tesco whole through march,including paying the stratton check had failed to pay.in his deposition,monterey division manager,james troup,stated he understood in early may that tesco would stop shipments unless they were paid approximately,which was the total amount unpaid through march.supporting his understanding that amount included the stratton failed to pay,troup acknowledged was more than what tesco was due for that particular billing period.thus,he agreed to pay the over two payments.moreover,the amount monterey mechanical paid tesco matched exactly what was owed through march if a percent retention was taken,as monterey contract with stratton and stratton purchase order with tesco contemplated 
monterey thus made tesco current through march,including the amount of stratton bounced check.that tesco waived its lien rights against that particular money by its march,release has no effect on tesco authority to exercise its lien rights on subsequent unpaid balances.by this suit,tesco is not seeking to enforce its waived lien rights against the bounced check.monterey fully discharged that debt.tesco seeks to recover the approximately it undisputedly provided in goods and services after march which monterey refuses to pay.nothing in the march release or any other document included in this record prohibits tesco from exercising its mechanic lien rights to do so.the trial court judgment in favor of tesco on its fifth and sixth causes of action is affirmed.
breach of joint check agreement 
in its seventh cause of action,tesco alleged monterey breached the joint check agreement by not paying tesco by means of joint checks made payable to it and stratton upon presentation of tesco invoices.the trial court awarded judgment in favor of tesco on this cause of action,ordering monterey to pay tesco plus interest.
monterey,in a disjointed and brief argument,claims the trial court decision is incorrect.it argues tesco breached the agreement first by accepting direct checks from stratton in january and march.it also claims the court decision converted the joint check agreement from simply an agreement on the method of payment into an unconditional obligation to pay.the obligation to pay,monterey argues,was as set forth in the subcontract between monterey and stratton,not the joint check agreement.we affirm the trial court ruling on this issue.
before monterey and stratton executed the joint check agreement,tesco right to payment derived from the purchase order agreement between it and stratton.in that agreement,it was stratton who agreed to pay tesco in monthly progress payments based on the amount of materials tesco had placed in position at the project,subject to a percent retention.
subsequently,in the joint check agreement,monterey agreed with stratton,for the express benefit of tesco,to pay tesco based on tesco invoices and to pay those invoices in full at the same time normal progress payments were due.the trial court determined tesco had submitted all of its invoices to stratton and monterey,and in invoiced equipment and services remained unpaid.substantial evidence supports these determinations.
in fact,monterey conceded it did not comply with the joint check agreement but paid stratton only on the basis of percentage completion and the lien releases stratton obtained from tesco,not on tesco invoices.monterey disputed ever receiving an invoice from tesco,but when asked whether it would have made any difference in its method of paying tesco if monterey had received copies of tesco invoices,monterey troup replied,no.
monterey claim that tesco breached the joint check agreement first by accepting a direct payment from stratton is specious.the agreement was expressly between monterey and stratton for the benefit of tesco.tesco receipt of money owed it did not void monterey continuing obligation to pay tesco by joint check in the full amount of each tesco invoice when normal progress payments were due.monterey admittedly did not comply with this obligation.substantial evidence supports the trial court determination monterey breached the joint check agreement.
prejudgment interest 
the trial court awarded tesco interest from september.it reasoned tesco last invoice was dated july,and progress payments on tesco outstanding balance would have been due on or about september.monterey argues the court imposed interest before tesco was due to be paid under the terms of the purchase order and before there was any breach.
monterey argument ignores its obligations under the joint check agreement.this specific agreement altered the terms of payment originally established under the purchase order.it was reasonable for the court to assume a progress payment based on tesco last invoice of july would have been made by september.the facts show the payment was not made.we will not disturb the court ruling on this issue.
statutory penalties 
monterey claims the trial court erred when it imposed penalties against it under business and professions code section and public contract code section,tesco eighth cause of action.we agree in part.
background information 
california has a series of prompt payment statutes that require general contractors to pay their subcontractors within specified,short time periods,and that impose monetary penalties for violations.business and professions code section and public contract code section are two of those statutes.business and professions code section requires a general contractor,unless otherwise agreed to by the parties in writing,to pay its subcontractors their respective shares of a progress payment within days of receiving the payment from the project owner.if the general contractor fails to timely pay,the subcontractor may recover a penalty in the amount of percent of the amount due per month for every month the payment is not made.bus.
public contract code section requires a general contractor to pay its subcontractors their respective shares of the retention proceeds within seven days after receiving the proceeds from the public entity that owns the project.pub.contract code,subd.d.if the general contractor fails to pay the retention timely,the subcontractor may recover a penalty in the amount of percent of the improperly withheld amount,in lieu of any interest otherwise due.pub.contract code,subd.f.
in the event there is a bona fide dispute over the amount owed,both statutes authorize the general contractor to withhold up to percent of the disputed amount.bus,pub.contract code,subd.e.both statutes award attorney fees and costs to the prevailing party in an action to collect amounts wrongfully withheld.bus,pub.contract code,subd.f.
in this matter,the trial court imposed penalties against monterey under both statutes.it determined tesco was a subcontractor of monterey tesco was owed both a progress payment and a retention payment by monterey monterey had been paid for the progress payments and retentions it owed tesco and monterey had a good faith dispute with tesco but it withheld more than the percent allowed under the statutes.
before us,monterey argues the trial court incorrectly determined tesco was a subcontractor of monterey tesco proved monterey had been paid for the progress payments and retentions it owed tesco and monterey withheld more than percent of the amount in dispute.monterey also claims the purchase order established payment terms different than those imposed by business and professions code section.we assess each argument.
tesco as subcontractor of monterey 
in addition to the undisputed facts discussed above,the trial court after trial determined stratton defaulted on its subcontract with monterey in september of.although tesco had completed invoicing for its services,tesco work under the purchase order apparently was not yet completed.that month,ed moore,monterey project manager,told tesco he desired to work with tesco to complete the project.he stated if tesco could complete certain items leading up to a particular test,he could apply for a progress billing for tesco.
tesco continued working on the project through the end of,and completed change orders after that.meanwhile,monterey terminated stratton from the project in march.stratton declared bankruptcy on april.tesco then worked directly for monterey,completing change orders given it by monterey through june.the city signed a notice of completion on the project on january.
from these findings,the trial court determined tesco became a subcontractor of monterey at some point around april,but no later than may.from the point monterey terminated stratton,the court reasoned,tesco became a subcontractor to monterey under what the court said was an implied contract,but in fact was an oral contract.tesco thus should have been paid directly by monterey within the times required by the prompt payment statutes.substantial evidence supports this determination
