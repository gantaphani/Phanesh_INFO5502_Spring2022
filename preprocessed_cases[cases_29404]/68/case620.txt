pacific gas and electric company.pacific gas and electric company pg e is a public utility corporation organized under the laws of the state of california,which provides natural gas and electric service to customers throughout northern and central california.pg e was an active party to the cpuc proceedings in which the decisions on review were issued and which pg e claims directly and adversely affect it.accordingly pg e has been given amicus curiae status by order of this court.
background of related cases and proceedings.
in september of in southern california edison public utilities com.th,d,this court reviewed the core issue involved in the decisions before us at the present time,namely,the lawfulness of wholesale qf power contracts required of utilities at administratively determined prices.for convenience this court refers to our september decision as edison ii.for information purposes and logical context we refer to the prior opinion of this court also decided in as edison edison i is this court decision in august of entitled southern california edison public utilities com.th,d.
in edison ii this court reviewed the updated pricing formula for qf contracts.that pricing formula established what is commonly referred to as avoided cost srac.the formula is of key importance because utilities,like edison and pg e,must purchase power from qfs as required by congressional mandate under purpa,but at a price that must not exceed the utility avoidable or avoided costs.in other words,the utility is mandated to purchase alternative qf power but can not be ordered to pay more for the qf power than it would otherwise cost the utility to generate or purchase that power from other established sources.in enacting purpa in the congressional intent was clear congress desired to reduce dependence on foreign sources of power by encouraging the development of alternative sources of domestic power delineated as qfs.but in fairness to established utilities,congress declared that the mandated purchases from qfs did not include paying more for energy than could be avoided by accessing more traditional sources with comparably lower energy prices.
congress relegated to the individual states the task of implementing purpa in accordance with congressional intent.coextensive with srac,cpuc developed what is known as standard offer which required utilities to purchase alternative sources of power from qfs by entering into contracts with qfs pursuant to the terms and conditions contained in.in edison ii this court reviewed and affirmed the srac pricing formula as applied to the contracts.
edison now takes issue with the srac formula in view of the mandate from the cpuc that edison renew existing contracts based upon the presently existing formula.in essence,edison is contending that such contracts exceed its avoided costs,thereby resulting in a violation of purpa.
contentions of the parties.
in its petition edison summarizes its contentions in this writ proceeding as follows before ordering edison to enter into the qf contracts at issue,the commission had a duty to ascertain and affirmatively find that the pricing it imposed on edison ratepayers under the contracts complied with purpa avoided cost limitation.the commission failed to make the requisite findings in the decisions.indeed,it could not have done so because the record before the commission indisputably established that the payment formula used in the contracts mandated by the commission yields prices that systematically exceed edison avoided cost.therefore,the decisions unlawfully exceed the commission limited grant of jurisdiction under federal law insofar as they order edison to enter the contracts at issue.emphasis in original.
in its answer to edison petition,cpuc states in capsule form its contentions as follows as srac pricing is not at issue in the procurement proceeding and the decisions simply extend an interim methodology that had been adopted in a previous decision,there is no basis for concluding that the decisions have made srac pricing determinations in violation of purpa.moreover,even if avoided cost pricing for qfs were an issue which it is not,the commission has acted lawfully.in,the commission specifically noted that it considered the evidence regarding srac pricing presented by the parties and concluded that the evidence in this proceeding has not demonstrated that srac prices are in violation of the purpa avoided cost standard.
indeed,since the decisions have made no changes to the findings in and regarding srac pricing,edison challenge to the decisions is in effect a challenge to,which adopted the srac formula,and,which extended certain expired or qf contracts on an interim basis.however,edison is barred from raising such a challenge.the validity of the srac formula was upheld in southern cal.edison public utilities,supra,th,d.it is now a final decision si
