the regional bell operating companies bocs,split off from in the antitrust settlement,provide most local telephone service.section of the telecommunications act of the act,offers the bocs a deal such a company can enter the long distance business in a state within its service area if it takes specified steps to open the market to competition.sbc communications,a provider of local service in kansas and oklahoma,applied to the federal communications commission for authorization to enter the long distance market in those states.various long distance providers,including the five appellants before us,objected.the fcc granted the authorization,see joint application by sbc communications,et for provision of interlata services in kansas and oklahoma,the order,and this appeal followed.see b giving this court exclusive jurisdiction over challenges to the commission orders.
the full regulatory context of a application is set forth comprehensively in our decision affirming the fcc approval of bell atlantic application for new york.fcc,affirming bell atlantic new york order,wl new york order.here we state only the bare bones.the act entitles each of the bocs to begin offering long distance service originating outside their areas immediately.see b.but for authority to offer in region long distance service,service originating in a state where it provided local service,the act requires a boc to apply for commission approval.id.b.the commission then has days to decide whether the boc has shown that it is in compliance with the statutory prerequisites.id.d.
first,the boc must satisfy either track a or track b names derived from subparagraphs of c.for track a it must show that it provides network access to one or more unaffiliated competing providers of telephone exchange service to residential and business subscribers.id.c a.if no competing provider has requested such access,the boc may invoke track b,showing that it is ready and willing to provide its competitors with network access and interconnectivity under terms approved by the state commission.id.c b.
besides prevailing on track a or b,the boc must establish that its offering of interconnection and access to competitive local exchange companies clecs meets the fourteen requirements of a competitive checklist contained in c b.many of these requirements are simply incorporations by reference of obligations independently imposed on the bocs by of the act,id.c b i ii,and enforced by state regulatory commissions pursuant to.the required interconnection and access must be available on terms and at rates.see,id.c,d.finally,the boc must convince the fcc that the requested authorization is consistent with the public interest,convenience,and necessity.id.d c.
sbc filed an application for long distance service authorization in both kansas and oklahoma on october.its petition relied on the network element rates that were set by the kansas corporation commission and the oklahoma corporation commission in proceedings implementing sbc duties under.see order at.numerous the department of justice,the kansas commission and the oklahoma commission,and the five comments.the state commissions weighed in on the side of sbc.doj recommendations endorsed neither denial nor approval of the applications,but instead urged the fcc to scrutinize particular aspects of the petition,including sbc prices for network elements.
on january,days after the application was filed,and for the first time in a situation involving predominantly rural fcc released its order granting sbc the authorizations.see order.
the commission found first that sbc had satisfied track a in both kansas and oklahoma because the company was supplying network access to one or more unaffiliated competitors providing residential and business customers with service.order see also c a.
next the commission concluded that sbc had fully met the requirements of the competitive checklist in both states.evidence in the record was virtually uncontested with respect to eleven of the fourteen checklist items.order.as for the remaining three items,the commission considered and rejected commenters contentions that sbc failed to provide network elements and interconnection to clecs at rates.see order.
appellants raised two arguments that are novel in litigation.pointing to the rather low level of residential service by clecs,they argued that the unbundled network element une rates could not have genuinely conformed to the cost requirement,or else competition would have flourished,or at least not proven so modest.further,pointing to submissions of evidence that sbc une rates were too high to provide profitable residential service,they argued that sbc was engaged in a price squeeze charging prices for inputs that precluded competition from firms relying on those inputs,and that accordingly the commission could not find that authorization of its entry into the long distance market was consistent with the public interest,as required by d c.the commission rather summarily rejected both claims.order.
appellants here pursue three basic arguments.first,they make the arguments summarized above about the relation between une rates and low volumes of residential service.second,they make a series of detailed attacks on the commission findings that the une rates were.finally,they say that the fcc improperly relied on ex parte communications in its kansas track a determination,which was,in any event,independently erroneous.we consider the arguments in that order.we conclude that appellants have made out a case for a remand to the commission only on the public interest aspect of the first issue.
local competition,possible price squeeze and the public interest.
in contrast to the situation in the other two states where the fcc has previously granted long distance authority to a requesting boc new york and texas,oklahoma and kansas have local telephone markets characterized by relatively low volumes of residential competition from firms.order.appellants also point to evidence they submitted,evidently uncontradicted in the record,that competition in the residential market that was dependent on unes at sbc prices could not succeed.they argue that the low volumes and the evidence of the impossibility of profitable competition both contradict the commission finding of rates and undermine its conclusion that granting sbc applications was consistent with the public interest.
the commission standard for cost telric or total incremental cost is one that might normally be expected to generate competition.in principle,there is no reason to think the boc real costs could be lower.in an otherwise undistorted market,firms capable of efficiently supplying the elements should be able to compete.appellants proposal that the commission consider the volume of competition as a for its cost finding is therefore understandable.
but we can hardly find the commission rejection of appellants proposal unreasonable.the statute imposes no volume requirements for satisfaction of track a,so that it would be odd for the commission to use low volume to defeat a finding of rates.and it would be reasonable for the commission to treat any questions raised by the low volumes,or by the appellants evidence showing the difficulty of making a profit under sbc rates,as subsumed within the issue of telric compliance.see at t,at.as the appellants concede,the lack of competition they allude to is neither a direct nor a conclusive proof of a checklist violation.appellants br.at the justice department argued that the low volumes compel led a closer look at whether sbc rates were properly costbased,evaluation of the department of justice doj report at,and the fcc did just that,as we shall see.
appellants repackage the data on volumes and potential profitability as an attack on the commission public interest finding.concededly,congress did not expressly consider whether such data could prevent a public interest finding or even require further inquiries by the commission.see chevron natural resources defense council,d.but appellants in substance argue that the only reasonable construction of the requirement calls at least for such an inquiry.they point to price squeeze decisions,construing provisions in statutes that are not explicitly aimed at fostering competition,which found asserted grounds for failing to follow up similar claims.see,ferc.with a statute that proclaims competition as the congressional purpose,purpose statement,stat,it follows a fortiori,appellants say,that the commission should pursue their price squeeze claim,or at the very least explain why the public interest does not require it to do so.after all,the words public interest in a regulatory statute take meaning from the purposes of the regulatory legislation.naacp fpc,d.
in fact,the commission gave appellants claim rather a.first,the commission said that under its reading of the act,the profitability considerations raised by appellants were irrelevant because the act directed it to assure that the rates were,not to determine whether a competitor can make a profit by entering the market.order see also id.this,of course,is unresponsive.the issue is not guarantees of profitability,but whether the une pricing selected here doomed competitors to failure.
second,the commission reasoned that consideration of the claims would have exceeded the commission authority under the act,because it would have required the fcc to invade state commissions exclusive jurisdiction over retail rates.order were we to focus on profitability,we would have to consider the level of a state retail rates,something which is within the state jurisdictional authority,not the commission.but the supreme court rejected precisely this argument in fpc conway,d.there the federal power commission had refused to hear evidence on the theory that it was powerless to eliminate any such squeeze,as retail rates fell in the exclusive jurisdiction of state commissions.id.at.at.the supreme court responded that the remedy,if any,could take the form of the commission fixing the wholesale rates,which were under its jurisdiction,at a lower level within the zone of reasonableness.id.at.at internal quotation marks omitted.
the commission makes a related argument in its brief,saying that any claim is effectively rebutted by the commission finding that une rates were.that is true to the extent that an agency can pinpoint telric rates as we suggested earlier,in an undistorted market perfect telric rates would seem inconsistent with any price squeeze.but to the extent that an agency can confidently identify telric rates only within some band,like those involved under conventional just and reasonable regulation,the possibility exists that the agency has chosen too high a point within the band.as the court said in conway 
this argument,however,assumes that ratemaking is an exact science and that there is only one level at which a wholesale rate can be said to be just and reasonable h owever,there is no single rate,but a wide zone of reasonableness 
conway,at.at.
finally,the commission observes,f actors beyond a boc control,such as individual clec entry strategies for instance,might explain a low residential customer base.order.this is,of course,correct in principle,although it may leave the inquisitive wondering why firms would forego what superficially appear to be promising opportunities for profit.but the observation is no basis for rejecting a proffer of evidence that the ceiling level for une by the state commissions and approved by the fcc profitable entry.
at oral argument commission counsel offered another analysis,not explicitly mentioned in the order.he suggested that state commissions have historically set relatively low residential rates,especially rural ones,allowing the incumbent monopoly to make it up in other aspects of their business.compare city of batavia ferc,conway does not require the commission to set a wholesale rate so that wholesale customers are guaranteed the ability to compete in the retail market.it may be,for instance,that the state commission is not allowing an adequate rate of return.if so,the commission is not obliged to follow,and indeed may not follow suit,for the rates it sets must fall within the zone of reasonableness.this was in part contested by appellants counsel,who suggested that even with state commission regulation it would be possible to offer certain enhanced services only une rates were capped at correct telric levels,or,in the alternative formulation,at lower levels within the correct telric range.
in any event commission counsel observation is not a ground for rejecting appellants claim we can affirm only on the commission reasoning.see sec chenery.we therefore remand the case to the commission for reconsideration of this issue.of course conway itself merely holds that the commission must weigh anticompetitive effects along with other factors in setting rates.kansas cities ferc,citing conway,at.at.here,as the act aims directly at stimulating competition,the public interest criterion may weigh more heavily towards addressing potential price squeeze.but the commission reasoning,when it is proffered,will presumably help establish the reasonable range for interpretations of the statutory criterion.
in closing we note two points,without evaluation.first,the potential scale of a serious price squeeze inquiry may present a problem we have already recognized that congress limit constrains the scope of the commission inquiries,at.second,if the commission is correct in reading track a to require only a minimal volume of competition to be present,see order,and that reading is not challenged here though its application is,it may reflect a recognition that the residential market may not be attractive to competitors even if une costs are at the lower end of telric assuming it to have a material range.see city of batavia,at.while we remand for consideration of this issue,we do not vacate the order.see,nrc,the decision whether to vacate depends on the seriousness of the order deficiencies and thus the extent of doubt whether the agency chose correctly and the disruptive consequences of an interim change that may itself be changed.
specific attacks on the commission une rate findings.
general background.there is no dispute here on the basic principle governing the rates at which a boc must offer unbundled network elements.the act gives the commission general authority to promulgate rules necessary to implement the statute,while entrusting the individual state commissions with the application of those principles in the process of approving interconnection agreements and rates pursuant to.see iowa utils,d,at.in august the fcc adopted general rules,including the telric standard.see first report and order,implementation of local competition provisions in the telecommunications act of.
a rather than a historical measure,telric bases rates on the cost of operating a hypothetical network built with the most efficient technology available.iowa utils,at.at.telric is not a specific formula,but rather a collection of methodological principles,at internal quotation marks omitted.as it allows the states wide latitude to account for local technological,environmental,regulatory,and economic conditions,its application may result in different rates in different states.id.internal quotation marks omitted.when the commission adjudicates applications,it does de novo review of state determinations.instead,it makes a general assessment of compliance with telric principles.id.
specifically,the commission has said that it will not reject an application unless basic telric principles are violated or the state commission makes clear errors in factual findings on matters so substantial that the end result falls outside the range that the reasonable application of telric principles would produce.order quoting new york order,at.
we review the commission decision on telric compliance under the arbitrary and capricious standard.a.in we identified three reasons why special deference was in order for our review of a finding by the commission that the issues at stake were ones involving a high level of technical expertise in an area of rapidly changing technological and competitive circumstances that the commission itself was reviewing a state agency with considerable expertise and that enormous flexibility was built into telric.at.these reasons of course continue to apply,and so shall the deference.
thus,a challenger can prevail here by making one of two showings.first,he may demonstrate that the fcc acted arbitrarily and capriciously in finding that the state commission followed basic telric principles.alternatively,he may point to specific factual errors made by the state commission,and demonstrate either that the fcc failed to consider these errors or that it arbitrarily determined that the rates were nevertheless within the range acceptable under telric.
kansas charges.a clec leasing a network element from the boc incurs two types of charges.recurring charges are assessed for the use of the network element in question over some time period.charges are for activity of processing orders for unes and for physically providing them initially.under the fcc rules,telric applies to both.see e.our inquiry in this section focuses on sbc charges in kansas.
the key dispute revolves around the factor.even with the best technology available,each stage in the various automatic processes may fail,requiring more expensive manual intervention.when this occurs,a service order is said to fall out.kansas commission,charges order see also order comparing a service charge for orders with a charge associated with manual processing.
at the outset of its proceeding,the kansas commission found itself faced with what it deemed unrealistic cost proposals submitted by both parties sbc and the long distance providers.over a period it conducted extensive workshops,hearings,and other types of discovery aimed at obtaining an accurate estimate of sbc une costs.order.finally,it ordered both sides to rerun their telric recurring and cost studies using certain prescribed inputs and cost assumptions that the commission thought would better approximate efficient network design and operation.see id.
for charges this attempted solution proved defective.making an estimate that probably would occur about of the time in a system,the commission directed the two sides to their studies on this aspect yet again,using this figure.kansas commission,reconsideration order kansas commission,charges order.both sides,however,applied the factor creatively so as to inflate or understate the net rate of manual processing,as would suit their respective cases.kansas commission,charges order c,noting that in the case of one particular network element,sbc unfounded assumptions ballooned the cumulative factor to.although the exact nature of fudging is obscure,see id.c,here makes no claim to have complied precisely with the commission order.
concerned with preventing further delay in the already lengthy proceedings,and frustrated by the carriers failure to follow its directions,the commission decided to set nonrecurring rates based on information previously received in this matter and its best judgment.kansas commission,charges order.to fix the majority of rates it split the baby,adopting a weighted average of the and sbc proposals.kansas commission,charges order revised attachment b at.in weighting the studies so that the final price fell toward the low end of the range of possible prices,id,the commission aimed to avoid reward ing an inefficient service provider,id.it set the remaining rates by adopting either sbc or cost proposals,or by relying on similar rates from comparable jurisdictions.
sbc initial application to the fcc relied on the charges calculated as described above.responding to comments filed by the department of justice and private commenters,which noted that many of the charges were a good deal higher than the corresponding rates in texas,sbc proposed to lower its rates in kansas by.sbc december,ex parte letter at,joint appendix see also order.the kansas commission adopted these cuts on january.order.in light of these additional voluntary reductions,the commission reasoned that it need not reach a conclusion as to whether the carriers failure to follow the kansas commission directions in running cost studies resulted in rates that violate telric.order.in its opinion,the cuts eliminated any remaining concerns about the rates in kansas.
appellants claim the fcc could not properly find these rates,as they are the product of a crude settlement method,trimmed by an arbitrary haircut.accusing the kansas commission of acting out of pressure to support sbc application,the appellants say that the kansas commission should have required sbc to continue its studies until they reflected accurate and cost data.appellants br.at quoting kansas commission,charges order internal quotation marks omitted.appellants often cite to pages in the kansas commission rulings where the commission finds fault with sbc studies,never mentioning that the same pages allocate seemingly equal fault to.
appellants complaints overlook the procedural context of the kansas proceeding.the commission stated that the burden of producing cost studies squarely fell upon and swbt,kansas commission,charges order appellants have not contested this or mentioned it.given that calculation of costs for a hypothetical network requires far more pervasive use of predictive judgments than does standard ratemaking,some such allocation was likely essential.especially in the rural states,the burden on regulatory resources might otherwise have proven overwhelming.order.perhaps might have legitimately protested the assignment of any burden to the protesters,but it appears not to have done so.
in fact the kansas commission diligently labored for several years scrutinizing and sbc submissions to the extent that it believed those studies contained errors,it made adjustments.as the appellants concede,the kansas commission identified the many flaws in sbc cost studies.appellants repl.br.at.in such instances it would then use inputs,in some instances those proposed by,that it found more reasonable,accordingly reducing sbc charges for service orders and several kinds of loops.order.
as we have seen,however,sound application of a rate proved comparatively intractable.appellants argue that the weighted formula,even when coupled with the cut,was mathematically incapable of bringing sbc exaggerated ratios down to the correct level.but in fact appellants waited until their reply brief before deigning to offer any detailed numbers in support of their complaint.see id.at.further,we note that if the calculations were so simple,surely itself could have offered the kansas commission some easy way of bringing sbc its line with the criterion.in at t,rejecting insistence that switching costs should have been adjusted to reflect newly discovered information,we endorsed the new york agency observation that its computations were the result of a complex analysis that does not lend itself to simple arithmetic correction through the adjustment of a single input.at internal quotes omitted.here,too,we can not fault the fcc for approving the kansas commission compromise resolution of an issue that the parties behavior had left a muddle.
nor are we persuaded by appellants suggestion that because some of sbc charges even after its discount remain significantly higher in kansas than in texas,such charges are not.first,even if the appellants calculations were properly done,only two of the five une rates on which appellants rely in this and higher in kansas the other order charge,analog line switch port,and central office identical in both states.clarke supp.decl.ex,cols.f j.second,sbc submitted evidence indicating that if the relevant charges were amortized over a reasonable period of time,the total monthly une costs for clecs serving comparable exchanges would be lower in kansas than in texas.order.although appellants dispute the latter conclusion,saying that it was generated by selectively comparing charges in urban areas of kansas to those in more costly suburban texas,appellants reply br,their own citations see,do not clearly establish a fallacy in sbc contention.
even if the two states rates in fact differ,the fcc identified a likely cause.whereas the texas commission had explicitly rejected sbc claimed entitlement to a t
