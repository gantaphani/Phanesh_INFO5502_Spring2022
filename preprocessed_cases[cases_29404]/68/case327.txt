petitioners,a geographically diverse group of electric utility companies,raise a series of challenges to several federal communications commission fcc guidelines implementing the amendments to the pole attachments act.after carefully reviewing petitioners claims,and after the benefit of oral argument,we hold that the fcc erred when it issued guidelines stating that the pole attachments act coverage extends to electric transmission facilities and that utilities must expand the capacity of their facilities to ensure that attaching entities have access to those facilities.on each of petitioners remaining challenges to the fcc guidelines,we decline to disturb the fcc determinations.
background 
from the inception of the cable television industry,cable television companies have attached their distribution cables to utility poles owned and maintained by power and telephone companies.as a practical matter,cable companies have had little choice but to do so.the start up costs of constructing an entirely new set of poles and other distribution facilities for cable television cables are prohibitive,and when coupled with the difficulties of obtaining regulatory approval for a distinct set of utility poles,the barriers to such construction are insurmountable.therefore,cable companies have long rented space from utilities on their extant poles and conduits.ownership of the only facilities available gave the utilities a superior bargaining position when renting space to cable providers,and the pole attachments act passed in reflects congress decision to regulate this relationship.
the pole attachments act gave the fcc the authority to regulate the rates,terms,and conditions for pole attachments to provide that such rates,terms,and conditions are just and reasonable in any state that does not already have such regulations in place.id.b.this act established a set of guidelines for the fcc to use in determining whether the rates and terms of pole attachments were just and reasonable,and based upon these guidelines,the fcc promulgated a series of rules regulating the practice.
importantly,the fcc regulatory authority pursuant to the pole attachments act was limited it could not mandate that utilities make their poles available to cable providers,but rather could merely regulate the rates charged those cable providers that were voluntarily given access to poles.voluntary access was hardly an issue at the time.indeed,utilities were anxious to lease surplus portions of their poles to cable providers,and thus get some return on what would otherwise be surplus plant.the problem that the pole attachments act sought to address was the potentially unfair prices utilities could extract from cable companies for leasing space,not any problems associated with the denial of access to the cable companies.
by,the economic landscape surrounding pole attachments had undergone a fundamental change.electric utilities saw the telecommunications arena as a logical and potentially lucrative choice for the diversification of their businesses.cable companies were fearful that the utilities prospective entry into the telecommunications market would endanger their pole attachments,as utilities would be unwilling to rent space on their poles to competing entities.congress elected to address both of these matters in the telecommunications act.
the telecommunications act authorized expanded competition in telecommunications markets,permitting utilities to enter that rapidly expanding field.congress recognized,however,that utilities would lose the incentive to voluntarily enter into pole attachment agreements with telecommunications and cable television companies that were now their competitors congress thus added a nondiscriminatory access provision to the pole attachments act,requiring any utility that uses its poles,ducts,conduits,or for wire communications to provide cable television or telecommunications companies with access to that space on a nondiscriminatory basis.id.f.a utility may only deny such entities access on a basis where there is insufficient capacity and for reasons of safety,reliability and generally applicable engineering purposes.id.f.
shortly after the passage of the telecommunications act,the fcc issued a series of regulations designed to implement the legislation.the bulk of the regulations,contained in the fcc first report and order,addressed issues relating to the deregulation of local telephone exchanges.however,the first report and order also promulgated guidelines seeking to implement the telecommunications act provisions modifying the pole attachments act petitioners filed petitions seeking reconsideration of some of the fcc findings in the order.after considering these requests for changes in the first report and order,the fcc issued its order on reconsideration in.petitioners brought the instant action objecting to the following determinations initially made in the first report and order and affirmed upon reconsideration 
that the act covers electric transmission facilities,as opposed to merely any pole,duct,conduit,or owned or controlled by utilities 
that utilities must expand pole capacity to accommodate requests for attachment in situations where it is agreed that there is insufficient capacity on a given pole to permit pole attachments 
that utilities may not reserve available capacity on their facilities for future use unless the reservation is made pursuant to a bona fide development plan,and that utilities must permit use of such reserved space by attachers until the utility has an actual need for the space 
that if the utilities use some of their poles,ducts conduits,and for wire communications services,the act grants attachers access to all of the utilities poles,ducts,conduits,or 
that the utilities may not limit those who place and maintain attachments on their poles to their own specially trained employees or contractors and 
that the utilities must comply with a series of guidelines regarding notification to attachers in the event a pole needs to be modified,and must bear certain costs associated with pole modifications.
we will discuss each of these objections in turn.
discussion 
the fcc is charged with administering the act,and the guidelines under review were promulgated pursuant to its interpretation of the act.we therefore will review the fcc interpretation of the statute using the process first articulated in chevron,nrdc,d.chevron first step requires us to ascertain whether congress has spoken unambiguously to the precise question at issue.id.at.if the language of the statute is unambiguous,we go no further,for we must give effect to clear congressional intent.id.at.if,however,we determine that congress intent is ambiguous as to the question at issue,we must move on to the second step of the chevron test and ask whether the agency interpretation of congressional intent is reasonable.id.at.we must defer to an agency reasonable interpretation of congressional intent.id.at.
electric transmission facilities 
we first consider whether the fcc exceeded its authority by asserting that the act applies not just to the poles,ducts,conduits,and owned or controlled by utilities,f,but to electric transmission facilities as well.petitioners contend that the plain language of the act limits its coverage to electric distribution facilities,and that the fcc acted ultra vires when it construed the act as applying to electric transmission plant as well the fcc claims that the distinction between electric transmission facilities and electric distribution facilities is not as clear as petitioners suggest,and that petitioners construction of the act would thwart congressional intent by carving out an artificial exemption from the act coverage for any facility designated as containing transmission plant.
to ascertain whether the fcc guideline is an acceptable construction of congressional intent,we will first need to assess the differences between a utility transmission facilities and its distribution facilities.we then must consider the statutory language,and see whether the statute text limits the application of the act to a utility distribution plant.we can then apply the chevron test to the fcc guideline.
petitioners argue that electric transmission facilities are entirely distinct from local distribution facilities and are outside of the purview of the fcc regulatory authority.the distinction between the two types of facilities has been described by one state public service commission as follows 
the operations of an electric utility can be separated into three major systems production,transmission,and distribution.transmission systems,which comprise the second major component of an electric utility,transmit large quantities of electrical energy over relatively long distances from generating stations to major load centers.transmission systems consist of switching stations,substations,towers,conductors wires,and.
the third major component of an electric utility is the distribution system and is comprised of substations,underground cables,poles,overhead conductors,transformers,service drops,and meters that supply power to the customers.
re.light power.dep t of pub.util.control.
the important differences between electric transmission facilities and electric distribution facilities are reflected in the present regulatory scheme for electric utilities.transmission systems generally transport energy in bulk across state lines,and the operation of these systems is subject to regulation by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc pursuant to the federal power act.b.however,the federal power act explicitly divests the ferc of regulatory jurisdiction over facilities used for the generation of electric energy or over facilities used in local distribution.id.this provision recognizes the essentially local character of distribution facilities and systems,as opposed to the primarily interstate character of electric transmission facilities.regulation of the latter was to be implemented by the ferc,while regulation of the former was to be left primarily in the hands of state and local authorities.this bifurcated regulatory structure is indicative of the accepted and fundamental distinction between a utility transmission plant and its distribution plant.
the fcc argues,however,that this distinction is not as clear as petitioners claim.not all transmission facilities necessarily entail interstate transmission of energy.section b recognizes this fact,and divests the ferc of regulatory authority over facilities used only for the transmission of electric energy in intrastate commerce,or over facilities for the transmission of electric energy consumed wholly by the transmitter.id.while transmission of electricity may generally be an interstate matter,there are clearly situations in which transmission takes place entirely within a state,outside of the jurisdiction of federal regulatory bodies.
another reason that the distinction between distribution and transmission facilities is difficult to draw is that many poles have a shared purpose.the fcc found,and petitioners do not dispute,that a number of distribution poles are affixed with transmission conductors and other transmission plant.see br.of pet r.power light at.there are plainly instances where elements of the two segments of the electric industry are combined on one entity,such as a distribution pole.
thus,the fcc argues that it is arbitrary and contrary to the statute to attempt to draw a hard distinction between distribution and transmission facilities.they found that the act applies to any facility that can be used for wire attachments.see br.of resp ts at.our task is to assess whether this finding can be reconciled with the intent of the act.
we begin our analysis with the text of the statute.the relevant language concerning the scope of the act coverage provides that t he term pole attachment means any attachment by a cable television system or provider of telecommunications service to a pole,duct,conduit,or owned or controlled by a utility.a.poles,ducts,and conduits are regular components of local distribution systems and not interstate transmission systems.indeed,the primary physical unit responsible for carrying transmission notably absent from the definition of pole attachment.this indicates to us that congress intended the act as a mechanism for regulating attachments on the utilities distribution facilities,not their transmission facilities and systems.
this reading of the act is strengthened by the presence of a provision,codified at c,which removes the fcc authority to regulate pole attachments in any place where a state has elected to do so.as states lack general regulatory authority over interstate transmission facilities,this language strongly suggests that the act coverage does not extend beyond local distribution facilities.the senate committee notes accompanying the act lend credence to this interpretation of the act coverage 
the committee considers the matter of catv pole attachments to be essentially local in nature,and that the various state and local regulatory bodies which regulate other practices of telephone and electric utilities are better equipped to regulate catv pole attachments it is only because such state or local regulation currently does not widely exist that federal supplemental regulation is justified.

the text of the statute,coupled with the presence of this clause,make it plain that the act coverage was intended to be limited to the utilities local distribution facilities,and was not to extend to the general regulation of interstate transmission towers and plant.
however,this does not mean that the fcc lacks the authority to regulate a pole that happens to contain transmission wire.the act grants the fcc the power to regulate poles,ducts,conduits,or,and does not limit the fcc authority to those poles,ducts,conduits,or not used for the purposes of transmission.
applying the chevron test to the relevant fcc guideline,we find that the act,when considered as whole,speaks precisely to the question at issue.our inquiry is therefore complete after the first step of the chevron test.the clause,coupled with the absence of any textual reference to towers or other forms of transmission plant,indicates that congress intended to limit the act application to local distribution facilities.therefore,petitioners are correct that the scope of the act,and of the fcc regulatory power,does not extend to a utility interstate electric transmission towers and facilities,which are regulated by the ferc and are outside of the purview of the fcc authority.to the extent that the fcc guideline suggests that the act covers interstate transmission towers and facilities,it must be struck down,as it fails to effect the unambiguous intent of congress.
however,the fcc is correct that the text of the act clearly indicates that its coverage extends to any of a utility poles,ducts,conduits,or,so long as the utility uses any of its poles,ducts,conduits,or for wire communications and the facility does not fall within one of the exceptions indicated in f.the fact that a given pole,duct,conduit,or right may have some transmission plant attached to it does not exclude it from the coverage of the act.these local distribution facilities,festooned as they may be with transmission wires,are plainly within the fcc jurisdiction under the terms of the act.
in sum,the plain language of the act mandates the following transmission towers and other interstate transmission facilities are not subject to the act provisions,and the fcc lacks the authority to regulate these facilities.however,the act generally covers all poles,ducts,conduits and,and these local distribution facilities are covered by the act,regardless of whether they are used in part for transmission wires or other transmission facilities.
expansion of capacity 
in situations where it is agreed that capacity on a given pole or other facility is insufficient to accommodate a proposed attachment,the fcc orders require utilities to expand the capacity of their existing infrastructure at the request of attaching entities.petitioners challenge this requirement as contrary to the express language of the act.the challenged portion of the order on reconsideration reads as follows t he principle of nondiscrimination established by section f requires a utility to take all reasonable steps to expand capacity to accommodate requests for attachment just as it would expand capacity to meet its own needs.order on reconsideration,fcc rcd,para.
petitioners challenge to this guideline is rooted in the text of f.this clause provides that a utility providing electric service may deny a cable television system or any telecommunications carrier access to its poles,ducts,conduits,or on a basis where there is insufficient capacity and for reasons of safety,reliability and generally applicable engineering purposes.f.petitioners argue that this language speaks precisely to the question of whether utilities must expand the capacity of their plant to provide access for potential attachers,and answers that question in the negative.the entire purpose of this section is to specify the exceptions to the general rule mandating that utilities provide cable and telecommunications companies nondiscriminatory access to their facilities one of those exceptions is implicated when the facility contains insufficient capacity.if utilities are required to expand the capacity of their plant at the request of a third party,it is hard to see how you can give section f any meaning at all order on reconsideration,fcc rcd.at powell,comm r,concurring in part and dissenting in part.
the fcc counters this argument by noting that many utilities now use their poles to support thriving telecommunications businesses of their own ten of the thirteen petitioners own or have financial involvement in telecommunications businesses,and suggests that the nondiscrimination principle that motivated the telecommunications act mandates that the fcc prohibit a utility from favor ing itself over other parties with respect to the provision of telecommunications or video programming services.first report and order,fcc rcd,para.the rule on expansion of capacity,according to the fcc,is simply one manner in which the fcc implements congress intent to prevent utilities from exploiting their monopoly ownership of the necessary infrastructure to deny competitors access to their markets.the fcc merely mandates that utilities make room for third parties in the same manner in which they would if they needed additional space for their telecommunications operations.
the fcc position is contrary to the plain language of f.while the fcc is correct that the principle of nondiscrimination is the primary purpose of the telecommunications act,we must construe statutes in such a way to give effect,if possible,to every clause and word of a statute.williams taylor,d internal quotation marks omitted.section f carves out a plain exception to the general rule that a utility must make its plant available to attachers.when it is agreed that capacity is insufficient,there is no obligation to provide third parties with access to that particular pole,duct,conduit,or.f.as commissioner michael powell noted,it is hard to see how this provision could have any independent meaning if utilities were required to expand capacity at the request of third parties.the entire purpose of the section is to specify the conditions under which the general rules mandating access for third parties do not apply.by attempting to extend those generally applicable rules into an area where the statutory text clearly directs that they not apply,the fcc is subverting the plain meaning of the act.
therefore,our inquiry on this issue need not extend beyond the first step of the chevron test.the fcc attempt to mandate capacity expansion is outside of the purview of its authority under the plain language of the statute.
reserved space 
petitioners object to the fcc orders specifying the disposition of reserved space on a given pole or other facility.the fcc acknowledges that utilities enjoy the right to reserve space on their facilities for their future use,in order to ensure the integrity and reliability of their core utility service.however,the fcc guidelines require that utilities seeking to reserve space on their facilities take two distinct steps to which they object.first,utilities may not reserve space for future use unless they do so pursuant to a bona fide development plan that reasonably and specifically projects a need for that space in the provision of its core utility service.first report and order,fcc rcd.at para.second,utilities must permit third parties to use reserved space until such time as the utility demonstrates an actual need for the reserved space.petitioners claim that these requirements are contrary to the language and intent of the act and,alternatively,are arbitrary and capricious exercises of the fcc discretionary authority.
petitioners once again rely upon the text of f to support their contention that the fcc rule is contrary to statute.they argue that the language permitting utilities to deny access on the basis of insufficient capacity specifically entrusts the utilities with the power to determine when capacity is insufficient,and the fcc rules limiting the utilities ability to reserve capacity on their facilities removes this power from the utilities and places it in the fcc hands.utilities regularly reserve space on poles to ensure the reliability and safety of electric service,as well as for legitimate engineering purposes.petitioners argue that requiring the utilities to justify their decision to reserve capacity for these purposes to the fcc gives the fcc a power completely outside of the realm of its expertise,and is contrary to the language and intent of the act.
petitioners further claim that the rule mandating that reserved space be offered to third parties until such time as it is actually needed by a utility is both contrary to f and blatantly unreasonable.once again,petitioners argue that the plain language of f is contradicted when utilities are forced to provide space,even temporarily,for attachers when the utilities have already determined through the reservation of space that capacity is insufficient.also,as a practical matter,it will be extremely difficult to evict third parties using reserved space at the time a utility develops an actual need for the space.this would risk disrupting existing cable television or telecommunications service and would be unlikely to receive fcc approval.thus,petitioners claim that the fcc rule foists an unworkable system onto the utilities with respect to their rights to reserve space on their facilities.
the fcc argues that its rules on reserved space are simply a mechanism for ensuring that the nondiscrimination principle is fully implemented.its rules are a method of ensuring that the utilities do not reserve excessive space indefinitely in an effort to keep potential competitors from using their facilities.the fcc claims that the bona fide development plan rule is a reasoned mechanism to guarantee that utilities do not reserve space without legitimate purposes in mind.the actual need regulation is another reasonable manner of ensuring that utilities do not reserve space for extensive periods in an effort to deny attachers and prospective competitors the benefit of their infrastructure.the fcc asserts that both of these rules are simply ways of making sure that utilities that claim that insufficient capacity exists on their poles due to reserved space actually do lack the capacity on their poles based upon legitimate future needs,and are not simply attempting to reserve excessive space in order to thwart the interests of their competitors.
applying the chevron test to the fcc guidelines,we find that the act does not speak precisely to the question at issue namely,how the term insufficient capacity is to be defined.nothing in the language of the statute specifies the conditions under which capacity should be deemed insufficient.petitioners construction of the act,which claims that the utilities enjoy the unfettered discretion to determine when capacity is insufficient,is not supported by the act text.the language of f does not speak in such absolute terms there are no suggestions,here or elsewhere in the act,that utilities enjoy the right
