we consider three consolidated petitions for review of two orders of the federal energy regulatory commission ferc or the commission.pub.serv.comm entergy,et,opinion,and.pub.serv.comm entergy,opinion.in the orders under review,the commission held that the production costs of the five operating companies in the entergy power system must be roughly equalized in a percent bandwidth around system average each year.the commission further found that production costs associated with the vidalia hydropower plant in vidalia,louisiana should not be included in the percent bandwidth calculation.the commission ordered that the remedy be implemented prospectively on january,without refunds due to any of the entergy operating companies.
petitioners contest the commission jurisdiction to order the bandwidth remedy,the rationality of its decision,the timing of the implementation of its remedy,and its denial of refunds.we conclude that the commission had jurisdiction to reallocate production costs,that its percent bandwidth remedy was not arbitrary or capricious or contrary to law,and that its exclusion of the vidalia hydropower plant was supported by substantial evidence.however,we grant the petition with respect to the commission decisions to deny refunds and to implement a prospective remedy commencing in based on data,and we remand the matter to the commission for further proceedings on those issues consistent with part v of this opinion.
background 
the dispute before us stems from disparities in production costs among the five operating companies in the entergy system which have resulted from entergy systemwide approach to locating generation capacity,a spike in the price of natural gas,and a rate schedule associated with an inefficient hydropower plant near vidalia,louisiana.
a.the entergy system 
planning approach 
entergy corporation is a public utility holding company that sells electricity,both wholesale and retail,in arkansas,louisiana,mississippi,and texas.it does so through five operating companies named after their respective jurisdictions entergy arkansas,entergy louisiana,entergy mississippi,entergy gulf states,and entergy new orleans.the entergy system has been highly integrated for over fifty years,with transactions within the system governed by a system agreement.the current system agreement was filed in.
the system agreement acts as an interconnection and pooling agreement for the energy generated in the system and provides for the joint planning,construction and operation of new generating capacity in the system.the system agreement assigns the task of coordinating the addition of new generating capacity to a systemwide operating committee that is composed of a representative from entergy corporation and each of its operating companies.indus.ferc.the operating committee makes the major decisions concerning general timing,location and size of plant additions,in view of the overall needs of the system,while accommodating individual company needs wherever possible.id.at internal quotations omitted.
in adding generating capacity,the committee follows both a approach,which ensures that generation facilities are planned,constructed and operated for the benefit of the whole system,and a rotational approach,which adds new capacity on a rotating basis to the jurisdictions in the system.at at.because an operating company is responsible for the costs of the generation plants in its jurisdiction,the rotation of new plants throughout the system historically had the effect of roughly evening out investment costs over time among the operating companies,at.
within this scheme,in the and,the operating committee tended to add new generating units in louisiana to take advantage of its inexpensive oil and gas reserves.id.in the late and early,the operating committee decided to shift away from oil and gas generation and to add nuclear and coal capacity.id.at.a company ability to construct oil and units generally depended on the existence of sufficient natural resources within its service area,while the ability to build coal and nuclear units was less restricted.id.at.in accordance with the rotational scheme of asset additions,much of the coal capacity was constructed in arkansas.at.as before,production costs among the operating companies remained roughly equal.at.
the investment in nuclear generation,on the other hand,proved prohibitively expensive and catastrophically uneconomical,at.the grand gulf nuclear plant in port gibson,mississippi,for example,was initially projected to cost billion for two generating units,but ended up costing more than billion for one unit.id.at.after it became apparent that entergy mississippi,then named mississippi power light,could not bear the cost of the grand gulf facility,the system formed a generating subsidiary to finance and run the grand gulf plant.id.at.the costs of grand gulf were allocated to the operating companies through an addendum to the system agreement.id.at.
the commission considered the proposed allocation of nuclear investment costs in proceedings initiated by the system in.id.at.the commission found that the system agreement requires that production costs be roughly equal among the operating companies.at.it further found that the great disparities in installed nuclear investment costs disrupted the rough equalization of production costs that had existed on the system and thereby produced undue discrimination in violation of section of the federal power act.id.the commission concluded that equalizing responsibility for the nuclear investment costs among the operating companies would remedy the undue discrimination,at.on petition for review,this court agreed that the system agreement showed an intent to roughly equalize capacity costs among the operating companies,id.at,that the commission could properly conclude that the tremendous disparities in nuclear capacity costs among the operating companies disrupt ed the system historical pattern of roughly equalizing capacity costs,id.at,and that the commission choice to order nuclear investment equalization to remedy the problem was both rational and within its discretion,id.at.
the rising cost of natural gas and its effect on the entergy system 
after implementation of the nuclear investment remedy,rough production cost equalization was maintained from,with variations from,but without any large bias for any one company or another.at.during the three years prior to the nuclear investment remedy,the production costs of the entergy operating companies had deviated from system average by,and percent.id.at.during the fourteen years after the nuclear investment remedy,the deviations on the system moderated,ranging from a low of percent in to a high of percent in.id.
the picture changed in when there was a spike in the price of natural gas.at.the increase had a dramatically disproportionate effect on entergy louisiana relatively large amount of generation,as compared to entergy arkansas relatively large amount of cheaper coal base load capacity.id.in,entergy louisiana had production costs that were percent above system average,while entergy arkansas costs were percent below average.pub.serv.comm entergy,et,initial decision.similarly,in,when entergy louisiana had costs that were percent above average,entergy arkansas costs were percent below,and in,when entergy louisiana were percent above average,entergy arkansas costs were percent below.id.the total deviations of all of the operating companies around system average accordingly rose,with deviations of percent in,percent in,and percent in.at.
the vidalia hydropower plant 
in addition to the high cost of gas,entergy louisiana was also bearing the escalating costs associated with the vidalia hydroelectric power plant built forty miles south of vidalia,louisiana.the plant was developed in the to harness the power of overflow water from the mississippi and red rivers as it is diverted into the atchafalaya river through a series of channels built by the army corps of engineers.at.the plant was constructed with six bulb turbines and a total peak capacity of megawatts.id.but,as a hydroelectric project,it depends on the flow of the rivers and has generally produced a smaller capacity of about megawatts.id.at.
the vast majority of the capacity from vidalia is used by entergy louisiana pursuant to a contract that its power into in in which it agreed to purchase up to percent of the output of the vidalia plant.id.at.the louisiana public service commission lpsc,which then regulated louisiana power light and now regulates entergy louisiana,approved a rate schedule for the costs of the plant,which limited its costs to entergy louisiana initially,but then increased them until they leveled off at the end of the contract.id.at.as a result,during the early years of vidalia operation,the vidalia energy cost,but by it cost and was scheduled to increase each year thereafter until it reaches a high of during the years.at.the cost will then decrease each year until it levels off at for the years.id.
b.the proceedings below 
the alj initial decision 
in june,lpsc filed a complaint against entergy with the ferc,asserting that the cost allocation among the entergy operating companies had become unjust,unreasonable,and unduly discriminatory in violation of sections and of the federal power act,b,a.the case was assigned to presiding administrative law judge alj lawrence brenner.the arkansas public service commission apsc,which regulates entergy arkansas,and the mississippi public service commission mpsc,which regulates entergy mississippi,disputed lpsc claim.based on an evidentiary record involving transcript pages and over exhibits,alj brenner decided the following four issues which are pertinent to this petition.
disruption of rough equalization.first,alj brenner found that the cost allocations among the entergy operating companies had become unduly discriminatory in violation of the federal power act because the production costs among the companies were no longer roughly equal.at.he explained that,b eginning with,the increase in natural gas prices and the dependence of entergy louisiana on generation has caused its production costs to rise dramatically in relation to system average.id.at.l ooking at the history back to,it is clear that prior to the current period beginning with,there was no period where an operating company was hammered like entergy louisiana has been with percentage deviations above system average for each of the past four years,while entergy arkansas has enjoyed greater than mirror image disparities below system average.id.at.he further found that,or even,can not be chalked off as an aberrational temporary period,id.at,given price forecasts which left no reasonable prospect of the situation under the existing mechanisms of the system agreement.id.at.
bandwidth remedy.alj brenner decided that a numerical bandwidth was the appropriate remedy to bring the entergy system into rough production cost equalization.at.he thought it appropriate to impose a limit measured over a rolling average and to also impose a higher annual limit to achieve some relief for the first year,to limit large swings in future individual years,and to start the rolling average towards smoother,achievable results.id.to this end,he ordered a percent bandwidth to apply to a rolling average and a percent bandwidth to apply annually.id.
vidalia hydropower plant.alj brenner found that,when calculating production costs for the bandwidth remedy,the costs of the vidalia hydropower plant should be included.id.at.entergy had argued that the plant was not a system resource,but was built with an eye towards satisfying the political and economic policy needs of the state of louisiana,at the direction of the lpsc.id.at.alj brenner found that there was sufficient evidence to conclude that vidalia was planned as a resource for the benefit of the entergy system because a fter vidalia went into service,it provided energy that was ultimately used to serve the loads on the system.id.at.
implementation of remedy.alj brenner ordered that his percent annual remedy be effective beginning with all of the previous calendar year of,at,so that for each calendar year beginning with,no entergy operating company is more than relative to system average,id.at.
ferc opinion 
the interested parties filed exceptions to the alj decision with the commission.the commission made the following four findings pertinent to this petition.
disruption of rough equalization.the commission agreed with alj brenner that the entergy system was no longer in rough production cost equalization.at.it explained that w hile history shows that production cost disparities have always existed,large disparities among the operating companies started to arise in and appear likely to continue into the future.id.at.according to the commission,t he large and increasing disparities among the operating companies are now arising because the rotational scheme has been inactive for a lengthy period and rising gas prices have adversely impacted entergy louisiana,which relies heavily on production facilities.id.
the commission looked to historical data in determining whether rough production cost equalization had been disrupted.for the period from through,prior to the nuclear investment equalization remedy,the total deviation of the operating companies from system average was about percent.id.after the commission remedy,the system remained in rough production cost equalization for the next fourteen years,with total deviations ranging from to percent.id.deviations then jumped significantly to in,in,and in.id.at.the commission reasoned that because the deviations are greater than those which spurred the commission to act in,they required a finding that the system is not in a state of rough equalization.id.
bandwidth remedy.the commission agreed with alj brenner that,w ith actual gas prices remaining high and no indication that this is likely to change,a remedy was required to pull the system into rough production cost equalization.at see id.at.the commission further agreed with the use of a bandwidth as a remedial device,but reversed the alj determination on the appropriate bandwidth in favor of a broader bandwidth that eases the severity of the remedy impact.id.at.the commission eliminated the rolling average requirement in its entirety,finding it overly complex,vague and unworkable,id.at,and ordered an annual bandwidth of percent,allowing for a maximum spread in production costs between operating companies,id.at.
the commission based its percent bandwidth on data from,the period following the nuclear investment equalization remedy,when the companies deviated from system average in amounts ranging from percent to percent.at.finding that the nuclear investment remedy created rough production cost equalization and recognizing that the highest total deviation during that period was percent,the commission reasoned that a percent disparity in costs should be the highest deviation allowable in the system during a period of rough production cost equalization.id.at.a percent bandwidth would then apply if the system exceeded historical cost disparities,but would otherwise allow the system to maintain the flexibility that it had traditionally enjoyed.id.
vidalia hydropower plant.the commission reversed the alj finding that the vidalia hydropower plant was a system resource based on four distinguishing factors about the vidalia plant that it found established its status as a resource.id.at.first,ferc found that the vidalia contract was the product of a unique accommodation between the louisiana commission and entergy louisiana meant to facilitate the local economic and political objectives of louisiana.id.at.ferc pointed to the unusual structure of the contract,including the guaranteed flow through of the total power costs to entergy louisiana ratepayers by varying the fuel cost in monthly fuel adjustment charges,and the fact that no retail regulator or other operating company was given the opportunity to determine whether the vidalia contract was prudent.id.at.second,ferc noted that the costs of vidalia,if included in the bandwidth calculation,would force operating companies other than entergy louisiana to bear the high costs of the plant,which would produce significant cost shifts among the operating companies and greatly impact retail rates.id.at.third,ferc pointed out that,in contrast to the strategy adopted by the committee when it decided to add nuclear generation to the system,there is no evidence in this record that vidalia was part of any centralized and deliberate plan to increase the use of hydroelectric power for the benefit of the system as a whole.id.at.fourth,the commission pointed to lpsc settlement with entergy louisiana,under which accelerated tax deductions over the remaining life of the vidalia contract would flow directly and exclusively to the retail customers of louisiana.id.together,the four factors showed a focus on louisiana,rather than on the system,and led the commission to conclude that vidalia was planned and operated as a louisiana resource,not a system resource.id.
implementation of remedy.the commission found that its bandwidth remedy should not apply to calendar year as recommended by the alj,but should apply prospectively in calendar year.at.any reallocation of costs prior to the commission june,decision would require the payment of refunds among the operating companies because data from and showed deviations among the companies that were greater than the percent bandwidth range.id.at.the commission reasoned that it could not,therefore,implement a retroactive bandwidth because it had previously found that refunds among entergy operating companies are precluded by section c of the federal power act.id.at citing.pub.serv.comm n,et entergy.
ferc opinion 
the commission considered,and denied,requests for reconsideration of its decision.with respect to the four issues pertinent to this petition,it made the following findings.
disruption of rough equalization.the commission again found that significant deviations experienced since demonstrate that the system is out of rough production cost equalization.at.because the disparities since are far more than the system experienced for the previous years,and are comparable to the disparities experienced from through,when the commission previously found that the system was not in rough production cost equalization,the commission reasoned that the system was out of rough equalization and again required a remedy.id.
bandwidth remedy.the commission denied rehearing on its imposition of a percent bandwidth.id.at.recognizing that neither the commission nor the courts had ever identified a percentage that would define with precision rough production cost equalization,the commission concluded that its resolution of the issue appropriately balanced interests in preventing undue discrimination and in not dramatically disrupting the system historical operations and the states settled interests and expectations id.at.it further found that its inflexible symmetrical bandwidth with upper and lower limits would keep the system roughly balanced while ensuring that no operating company was given an undue preference or undue discrimination.id.at.
vidalia hydropower plant.the commission denied rehearing on its finding that the vidalia plant is not a system resource.id.at.it again pointed to evidence in the record that vidalia was not planned by the entergy operating committee in a manner similar to other system resources and that tax and rate benefits associated with the project were retained exclusively by entergy louisiana.id.at.
implementation of remedy.the commission denied rehearing regarding its decision to implement the bandwidth remedy prospectively only.id.at.the commission again found that it was prohibited by statute from ordering refunds,so was required to implement a prospective remedy.id.at.the commission clarified that,by ordering a implementation date for the bandwidth,it was ordering that equalization payments be made in based on data.id.at.
the present petitions for review from the louisiana,arkansas,and mississippi public service commissions followed.
ii.the jurisdiction of the commission 
the first issue in the petitions for review is whether ferc had jurisdiction to regulate the allocation of production costs among the entergy operating companies.the commission found that it had jurisdiction based on this court decision in mississippi industries ferc.we agree.
in mississippi industries,at,we held that the federal power act clearly provides the commission with jurisdiction to modify the allocation of capacity costs of an entergy system resource from that provided in the system agreement.section b of the federal power act gives the commission jurisdiction over the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce,the sale of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce,and the facilities used for such transmissions and wholesale transactions,but excludes jurisdiction,except as specifically provided in this subchapter and subchapter iii of this chapter,over facilities used for the generation of electric energy b.section of the act requires the commission to set the just and reasonable rate where it finds that any rate,charge,or classification,demanded,observed,charged,or collected by any public utility for any transmission or sale subject to the jurisdiction of the commission,or that any rule,regulation,practice,or contract affecting such rate,charge,or classification is unjust,unreasonable,unduly discriminatory or preferential.a.
in mississippi industries,we held that the commission had jurisdiction under sections b and to modify the allocation of capacity costs for an entergy system nuclear plant even though it was a generating facility.it was undisputed that the nuclear capacity from the plant was sold at wholesale in interstate commerce because it was sold to entergy operating companies in the system,at.and,because the system was so highly integrated,we held that the costs borne by each operating company with respect to that generating facility significantly affect ed the wholesale price at which the capacity is sold in interstate commerce to the other operating companies in the system.id.at.therefore,we concluded that section of the federal power act provides the commission jurisdiction to modify the capacity cost allocation in the system agreement because that allocation affects the rate charged for wholesale transmissions within the jurisdiction of the commission under section b.id.also,we held that the generating facility exception of section b did not eliminate the commission jurisdiction because it does not apply where jurisdiction is specifically provided for in certain specified sections of the act,including sections and.id.at.therefore,because sections b and provide jurisdiction to set rates for capacity costs that affect the price of energy sold at wholesale in interstate commerce and because the capacity costs of the entergy nuclear generating plant affected such interstate wholesale rates,we concluded that the commission had clear authority to reallocate the plant capacity costs.id.at.
arkansas electric energy consumers,aeec asks this court to distinguish or overrule our decision in mississippi industries and find that the commission lacked jurisdiction to reallocate production costs among the entergy operating companies.we can not.
aeec first asserts that the commission improperly asserted jurisdiction over a generating facility in violation of section b of the federal power act.we decided this question in mississippi industries,where we considered the precise statutory language and caselaw argued by aeec and concluded that the commission had undisputed authority over the wholesale rates of electric generating facilities in interstate commerce,which includes the authority to reallocate the costs of an entergy system resource across the system,at see also transmission access policy study group ferc,ferc assertion of jurisdiction over all wholesale transmissions,regardless of the nature of the facility,is clearly within the scope of its statutory authority.we,of course,are without authority to overturn a decision by a prior panel of this court.see,mining ass fowler.
aeec next asks us to distinguish mississippi industries,which involved the allocation of nuclear capacity costs from a plant run by a generating subsidiary,from this case,which involves the allocation of the gas production costs from facilities run by an operating subsidiary.our decision in mississippi industries,however,did not hinge on the nature of the particular generation or subsidiary at issue,but on the fact that all generating capacity on the system had been built and planned on an integrated basis by the system in order to meet the collective needs of the system.see,at.the system remains highly integrated,with the gas capacity at issue here built and operated by the system to meet its collective needs.thus,the gas production costs here,like the nuclear costs in mississippi industries,affect the wholesale price at which capacity is sold in interstate commerce to other operating companies in the system and fall within the remedial jurisdiction of the commission.we deny the petition as to this issue.
iii.the remedy 
petitioners attack ferc bandwidth remedy on several fronts.we review ferc decision to impose a bandwidth remedy under the arbitrary and capricious standard,a power partners,ferc,treating ferc factual findings as conclusive if supported by substantial evidence in the record,b.ferc remedial choice is lawful if the agency has examine d the relevant data and articulate d a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.motor vehicle mfrs.ass state farm mut.auto.ins,d internal quotation marks omitted.for the reasons set forth below,we conclude that ferc has met that standard.
as an initial matter,apsc,mpsc,and aeec suggest that the entergy system has achieved and maintained rough cost equalization among its five participants.were this true,ferc bandwidth remedy would be solution in search of a problem.substantial evidence in the record,however,supports ferc finding that system costs were out of rough equalization and in need of correction.as ferc explained,w hile history shows that production cost disparities have always existed,large disparities among the operating companies started to arise in and appear likely to continue into the future.at.between and,the system largest deviation was approximately percent.since then,the deviation has increased dramatically,averaging more than percent between and.in fact,the deviations in the system after were of comparable magnitude to the deviations that led to the remedy upheld in mississippi industries.given this factual context,it can not reasonably be disputed that the entergy system is no longer in rough cost equalization.
aeec argues that the current cost disparities are permissible because the system operating companies are not similarly situated,and each is ultimately responsible for financing and operating its own generation facilities.in mississippi industries,however,we explained that g iven the degree of integration on the system,ferc could properly conclude that the tremendous disparities in nuclear capacity costs among the operating companies disrupt the system historical pattern of roughly equalizing capacity costs and thus constitute discrimination under section of the federal power act,at.likewise,ferc could properly conclude in this matter that the large deviations in production costs among the operating companies have undermined the system history of rough equalization.as mentioned above,the current cost deviations are numerically similar to the tremendous disparities that were present in mississippi industries.id.consequently,the determination that a remedy is needed is as reasonable now as it was then.
apsc,mpsc,and aeec next criticize ferc for calculating rough cost equalization by measuring the total production cost deviations in the system.they contend that other metrics,such as deviations measured in cents per kilowatt hour,would have shown that the system still enjoys rough equalization.in a case like this,which calls upon ferc to make judgment calls on the basis of its superior technical expertise,we will only disturb ferc selection of one methodology over another if its choice is not the product of reasoned decisionmaking.el paso natural gas ferc,because this inquiry is fact intensive,it is appropriate to give significant deference to the commission choice of a valuation methodology.alj brenner rejected petitioners proposed methodologies after concluding that they were potentially misleading,to revealing relative differences,and inferior as a means of making comparisons over time,see at,and ferc affirmed the alj determination of the appropriate methodology,see at at.we have no reason to interfere with ferc reasoned choice of methodology and so defer to its expertise.
aeec also contends that,even if the system is no longer roughly equalized,no remedy is necessary because entergy strategic system resource plan ssrp will return the system to rough equalization.the ssrp,entergy plan to satisfy customer demand,spreads among the operating companies the burden of providing generation.at.this will,according to aeec,distribute production costs across the companies,thereby reducing cost deviations within the system.ferc reasonably found that the ssrp did not eliminate the need for a remedy that would return the system to rough equalization.even under entergy most optimistic projections,the ssrp would have only reduced the total deviation to percent in,percent in,and percent in.at.moreover,the ssrp is merely aspirational there is no assurance that it will work as intended,especially with the steady and sustained upward march of natural gas prices.id.
lastly,aeec argues that ferc arbitrarily and capriciously neglected to assess the rough equalization of production costs using a life of the contract standard,which aeec contends the agency has applied in similar cases.under this standard,the agency must consider the distribution of burdens and benefits between contracting parties over the full term of the agreement,and must not assess costs at one particular point in time.to support this proposition,aeec cites ferc decision in pontook operating limited partnership public service of new hampshire.in that case,ferc held that the proper time frame to use in determining the justness and reasonableness of a,contract is over the life of the contract,not a snapshot in time.id.at.ferc did not act arbitrarily and capriciously,however,because the cases in which the agency has applied the contested standard differ from this case in at least one important respect ferc applies the life of the contract standard where the parties have agreed to a contract,but the entergy system agreement is not such a contract.under a contract,parties relinquish their right unilaterally to request a rate change from ferc.see me.pub.utils.comm ferc,potomac power ferc.the system agreement,by contrast,allows individual companies to seek unilateral rate changes.see entergy system agreement each company reserves the right to unilaterally seek amendments or changes in the terms and conditions of service and increases or decreases in the rates and charges provided in any of the service schedules from any regulatory body having or acquiring jurisdiction thereover.applying a life of the contract standard in this instance,where the contract does not include a provision,would undermine a clear purpose of the contract to allow for incremental rate adjustments that might not occur if that decision hinged on considering the distribution of benefits and burdens over the entire term of the agreement.and even if the life of the contract standard were to apply,ferc did not base its decision on a snapshot of production costs at one particular point in time,but instead took into account two decades of the system agreement history.see at 
ferc concluded that the right remedy to return entergy to rough equalization of its system production costs was a fixed and symmetrical percent bandwidth.lpsc,apsc,and mpsc disagree.lpsc believes that a narrower bandwidth is necessary,while apsc and mpsc suggest either a bandwidth with no lower boundary,or else one that is more flexible.we owe ferc great deference in reviewing its selection of a remedy,for the breadth of agency discretion is,if anything,at zenith when the action assailed relates primarily to the fashioning of policies,remedies and sanctions.niagara mohawk power fpc,see also.comm ferc,noting that ferc wields maximum discretion when choosing a remedy.because we find that ferc has not abused its ample discretion,we uphold its selection of the percent bandwidth.see.pub.serv.comm ferc,w e will set aside ferc remedial decision only if it constitutes an abuse of discretion.
lpsc argues that ferc bandwidth is too broad and does not do enough to eliminate cost discrimination within the system.in mississippi industries,however,we concluded that the commission chosen remedy is sufficient to remedy the undue discrimination on the system that is,the commission could properly conclude that the remaining cost disparities do not constitute unlawful discrimination.at.here,too,ferc could have done more to eliminate cost disparities within the system,but it need not have done more to eliminate undue disparities.as the commission noted,it is charged with eliminating undue discrimination,but it does not have to eliminate all forms of discrimination.at.moreover,in mississippi industries we were especially deferential to ferc remedy because it was the product of a difficult policy choice 
in deciding whether to order production cost equalization or nuclear investment equalization,the commission confronted a major policy choice.though both alternatives would remedy undue discrimination,the former would represent a dramatic disruption of the system historical operations and of the states settled interests and expectations.accordingly,ferc chose the latter alternative.we hold that the commission decision was both rational and within its discretion.
at.faced with a similar predicament here,ferc again reasonably selected a remedy that would minimize the likelihood of disrupting the system.at.we must respect this reasoned choice.
apsc and mpsc argue that the bandwidth should have had no lower boundary,such that no operating company could be more than percent above the system average of production costs,but companies could be more than percent below the system average.alternatively,they argue that the bandwidth should have been more,instead of being triggered when at least one company is either above or below percent of the system average of production costs,the remedy should be invoked only if the maximum deviation of production costs in the system is greater than percent.they contend that ferc symmetrical and fixed bandwidth is unduly discriminatory,impairs incentives,and prevents entergy arkansas and entergy mississippi from reaping the full benefits of their already and coal and nuclear capacity.
in rejecting apsc and mpsc argument,the commission stated 
w e disagree with the arkansas and mississippi commissions argument that the commission erred in adopting an inflexible symmetrical bandwidth.entergy system is highly integrated,and therefore entergy planning and operation affects the cost disparities among its five operating companies our decision to impose the percent bandwidth allows operating companies to deviate up to percent from the system average.a symmetrical remedy ensures that the system remains roughly balanced and does not instill an undue preference or undue discrimination on any operating company.
at.the commission was well within the bounds of its discretion in choosing a fixed and symmetrical bandwidth,because the operating companies are collaborators in the entergy system functioning for their mutual benefit.a bandwidth that was not fixed and symmetrical would allow instances in which a company may be greatly advantaged,or a company greatly disadvantaged.imagine,under the petitioners proposed bandwidth without a lower boundary,that the company is percent above the system average while the company is percent below average.or imagine,under the petitioners proposed flexible bandwidth,that the company is percent above average while the company is percent below average.in either circumstance,no remedial measures would apply,despite the fact that one of the companies bears costs that lie well outside the system average.either result would be inconsistent with the nature of the system.
because we find ferc adoption of the percent bandwidth to be within its discretion,we deny the petition as to this issue.
iv.the vidalia hydropower plant 
lpsc challenges ferc ruling that the vidalia hydropower plant vidalia should not be treated as an entergy system resource.relying on four distinguishing factors that set the plant apart from system resources,ferc found that vidalia was built to benefit louisiana and that the plant production costs should stay in louisiana.at at.lpsc argues that the vidalia contract was intended to benefit the system as a whole and that the plant production costs should be included in the system bandwidth calculations.such inclusion would push the system further from rough equalization and shift some of the costs associated with the project onto other members.because substantial record evidence supports ferc decision,we deny the petition for review as to this issue.
we review ferc findings regarding vidalia under the substantial evidence standard.b the finding of the commission as to the facts,if supported by substantial evidence,shall be conclusive.this deferential standard of review requires more than a scintilla,but can be satisfied by something less than a preponderance of the evidence.fpl energy main hydro llc ferc.while there may be evidence supporting petitioner position,we must determine not whether record evidence supports petitioner version of events,but whether it supports ferc.mun.power agency ferc.lpsc argues that ferc was required under the law to provide deference to the findings of the administrative law judge.lpsc br.at.although the commission must give attentive consideration to an administrative law judge findings,those findings are not entitled to any special deference.greater boston television fcc.rather,they are treated as part of the record to which we look to ensure that the commission decision is supported by substantial evidence.id.in other words,the commission decision can not depart from the administrative law judge findings without support from the record,but in the last analysis,it is the agency function,not the administrative law judge,to make the findings of fact and select the ultimate decision,and where there is substantial evidence supporting each result it is the agency choice that governs.id.
lpsc challenges each of the four distinguishing factors upon which ferc relied in deciding that vidalia was not a system resource.first,lpsc argues that the vidalia contract is no different than those of other system resources,asserting that local operating companies always obtain local retail rate recovery,and that local retail regulators and operating companies never review the prudence of new resources built or acquired in other jurisdictions.second,as to the significant cost shifts that would result from including vidalia in the system bandwidth calculation,lpsc asserts that this is the real reason for the commission decision,and an invalid one.in response to ferc third distinguishing finding that vidalia was not part of an overall system contends that hydropower fit within the system broader efforts to move away from dependence on natural generation.lpsc also points to vidalia inclusion in the load and capability forecast and the as evidence that vidalia was approved by the entergy operating committee and planned as part of the system.fourth,with regard to vidalia local tax benefits,lpsc claims that tax benefits for system resources are always recorded on the local operating company books and reflected in its retail rates,making the vidalia contract indistinguishable from that of any other system resource.
we conclude that ferc ruling was supported by substantial evidence.lpsc arguments fail to show that ferc decision departed from the record.lpsc contends that local rate recovery of costs is common to system resources,but ferc pointed to the unique nature of the vidalia contract,which required full recovery of power costs from louisiana ratepayers.lpsc points out that other retail regulators
