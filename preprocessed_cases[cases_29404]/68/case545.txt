in the first cause of action,for declaratory relief to deem the contract to be unconscionable,plaintiffs alleged the contractual fees for subscribing to nonpublished service and unlisted service were unconscionable,because of the true cost of providing the services,unequal bargaining power,and the customer right to privacy.at t had discretion to set the level of the fees.
