this appeal presents primarily three questions whether the florida public service commission has exclusive jurisdiction over the regulation of pay phones located on private property under section,florida statutes whether a municipality has jurisdiction to regulate pay phones located in the public under section,florida statutes and if a municipality can regulate pay phones located in the public,then what constitutes a reasonable and regulation related thereto.
we agree with the district court decision granting summary judgment in favor of the city of miami beach as to the city jurisdiction to regulate pay phones located in the public.specifically,we affirm the district court decision that all of sections,except for d,and a e of miami beach.ordinance,as amended by miami beach.ordinance,are reasonable and,and necessary for the management of pay phones within the public.we also find that all of sections,and of miami beach.ordinance are not within the limits of the law as pertaining to the city regulation of pay phones.however,we disagree with the district court decision that subsection e of miami beach.ordinance concerning the regulation of advertising on pay phones in the public was not within the city jurisdiction.in addition,we find that section d of miami beach.ordinance,concerning criminal activities in the areas of pay phones installations and in public is not proper.in sum,we conclude that the city of miami beach may regulate advertising on pay phones located in the public and consequently,that subsection e of miami beach.ordinance is valid and proper under the law.lastly,we agree with the district court decision that florida state law preempts miami beach.am.ordinances b d and b c and consequently the florida public service commission has exclusive jurisdiction over the regulation of pay phones located on private property.thus,we affirm in part and reverse in part the district court judgment.
background 
appellant and,the city of miami beach miami beach,enacted zoning ordinances in an effort to restrict and to regulate pay phones located on private and public property within the city.miami beach enacted these zoning ordinances with the dual purpose of protecting the city unique aesthetic qualities as well as ensuring public safety.the zoning ordinances involved in this appeal are miami beach.am.ordinances b d and b c collectively the zoning ordinance and miami beach.ordinance,as amended by miami beach.ordinance ordinance.the zoning ordinance concerns the regulation of pay phones located on private property whereas the ordinance concerns the regulation of pay phones located in the public.in relevant sections,the ordinance sets forth a series of requirements section requires pay phone operators to obtain a permit section requires compensation for the issuance of the permit section dictates the grounds for an operator use of streets and sidewalks section governs the location and placement of the pay phones section covers the installation,maintenance,and technical requirements section subjects existing pay phones to a retroactive permit fee section requires operators to take out bonds to cover potential damage section requires indemnity insurance section reserves miami beach police power and section limits transfers,assignments and subleases.appellee and,florida public telecommunications association,fpta,an association of pay phone vendors in florida,challenged miami beach zoning ordinance and ordinance on the grounds that they were preempted by state and federal law as well as the united states and florida constitutions.both parties filed motions for summary judgment.the district court granted summary judgment to miami beach in part and to fpta in part.miami beach appeals the district court findings of preemption and the unreasonableness of subsection e of the ordinance and fpta the district court findings of and the validity of certain sections of the ordinance.
miami beach also appeals the district court decision that the florida public service commission fpsc has exclusive jurisdiction over the regulation of pay phones located on private property.
fpta appeals the district court decision that a municipality has jurisdiction to regulate telecommunications companies facilities,including pay phones located in the public.the district court concluded that municipalities and counties,retained under florida state law,the power to manage the placement or maintenance of facilities in the public.stat.b.additionally,the district court found that pay phones are telecommunications companies facilities and their location in the public subjected them to regulation by miami beach.in determining whether the regulations in the ordinance were permissible,the district court applied a test as set forth in section b,florida statutes.
the district court also found that sections,and subsection e of the ordinance were not permissible exercises of miami beach authority to regulate the public under florida state law because section was discriminatory and sections,and subsection e were not related to the placement or maintenance of pay phones or necessary to the management of public.consequently,those sections of the ordinance were held to be invalid.the district court concluded that the remaining sections of the ordinance were related to the placement or maintenance of pay phones,were reasonable and,and were necessary to manage the public and thus were valid.both parties appeal the district court decisions regarding the validity of certain sections of the ordinance.both parties agree,however,that the district court applied the correct test in determining whether sections of the ordinance were permissible.
fpta challenges the district court findings that certain sections of and c and all of sections a,a,d g,b,d and e of the ordinance are related to the placement or maintenance of pay phones and within the city authority to regulate.
the fpsc also filed an amicus brief arguing that the district court erred in finding that certain sections of the ordinance were not preempted by state law.fpsc contends that sections d g,b,d and e of the ordinance exceed the scope of the city authority to regulate public under its policing power and conflict with the fpsc exclusive jurisdiction to regulate telecommunications companies.miami beach also appeals the district court decision that subsection e of the ordinance was void because it was not related to the maintenance of pay phones and that the regulation of advertising on pay phones in the public was not within the city jurisdiction under state law.

iii.discussion 
preemption of miami beach zoning ordinance 
miami beach argues that a state agency authority to regulate the location of pay phones on private property must be based upon a specific grant of authority by the legislature in the enabling statute which created the agency power.the city contends that the florida legislature failed to grant the fpsc this explicit power.miami beach relies primarily on southwest florida water management district save the manatee club,so d dca to support this proposition that the florida legislature must specifically grant to the fpsc the authority to regulate the location of pay phones located on private property in the enabling statute.a reading of the enabling statute shows that the florida legislature granted to the fpsc broad and exclusive powers to regulate telecommunications companies.specifically,section,florida statutes grants to fpsc the exclusive jurisdiction over the regulation of telecommunications companies within florida.bellsouth telecommunications,town of palm beach,cir.the language of the statute leaves no doubt about the broad and exclusive powers granted to the fpsc to regulate telecommunications companies including their services and facilities.in contrast,in southwest florida water management district,the court concluded that the florida legislature did not grant to the southwest florida water management district the district such broad powers but only very specific and limited powers.we find no merit in this argument about the extent of the enabling statute in this case.
it is also clear that the limitations to this broad authority are very specific.in relevant part,section,florida statutes provides that 
it is the legislative intent to give exclusive jurisdiction in all matters set forth in this chapter to the florida public service commission in regulating telecommunications companies,and such preemption shall supersede any local or special act or municipal charter where any conflict of authority may exist.however,the provisions of this chapter shall not affect the authority and powers granted in or.
since the florida legislature granted the fpsc exclusive jurisdiction to regulate telecommunication companies,it clearly has the power to regulate pay phones and their locations on private property within florida.see teleco communications clark,so d.we find it unpersuasive to argue that the florida legislature should have itemized the powers of the fpsc when it gave it such broad and exclusive authority over telecommunications companies.
the only limitation on this exclusive jurisdiction to regulate telecommunications companies relevant to this case is that municipalities and counties retain the right to manage their roads and public pursuant to their police power.section b,florida statutes,states that e ach municipality and county retains the authority to regulate and manage municipal and county roads or in exercising its police power.thus,municipalities and counties right to regulate their roads and the public allow them to regulate telecommunications companies facilities including pay phones located in those spaces.it is undisputed that pay phones are facilities of telecommunications companies as those words are used in the statute.thus,as the district court correctly found,the enabling statute broadly granted the fpsc exclusive jurisdiction over all matters except for those involving the management of municipal or county roads and the public.consequently,the miami beach zoning ordinance which regulates pay phones located on private property is preempted in its entirety under florida state law.
miami beach ordinance 
fpta argues that miami beach does not have the authority to manage telecommunications companies facilities in its roads and the public.it claims that the fpsc has exclusive jurisdiction over telecommunications companies which includes the regulation of telecommunications companies facilities located on either private or public property.the district court ruled that the ordinance was not preempted by section,florida statutes,because miami beach as a municipality,was expressly granted the right to regulate facilities located in its roads and the public including telecommunications companies facilities.we agree.as discussed above,under section,florida statutes,local governments retain jurisdiction to manage their roads and the public.this jurisdiction includes the right to manage the placement or maintenance of facilities.stat.b.
in this case,miami beach ordinance only concerns the regulation of pay phones located within the city public.pay phones are clearly facilities,therefore,pay phones located in miami beach public are subject to the city regulation under section b,florida statutes.there is no preemption by state law.
although the scope of a municipality and county jurisdiction to manage its roads and the public is extremely broad under its policing power,section,florida statutes limits somewhat the authority to regulate telecommunications companies facilities.the florida legislature set forth three requirements that must be satisfied for a municipality or county to regulate a telecommunications company facilities in its roads or the public.in relevant part,section b,florida statutes,states that 
each municipality and county retains the authority to regulate and manage municipal and county roads or in exercising its police power.any rules or regulations adopted by a municipality or county which govern the occupation of its roads or by providers of communications services must be related to the placement or maintenance of facilities in such roads or,must be reasonable and nondiscriminatory,and may include only those matters necessary to manage the roads or of the municipality or county.
therefore,for a regulation over a telecommunications company facilities in a municipal and county road or the public to be valid,the regulation must be related to the placement or maintenance of facilities in municipal and county roads or the public reasonable and and necessary to the management of such roads and public.stat.b.
since we have already determined that miami beach has jurisdiction to regulate pay phones in its roads and the public,the next task for this court is to determine whether the regulations in question meet the requirements of the statute.we address each relevant section of the ordinance in turn.
section statement of purpose 
fpta argues that parts of section of the ordinance are not related to the placement or maintenance of facilities in the public because the regulation of pay phones operation,testing and use do not fall within the scope of miami beach jurisdiction.the district court concluded that section was not preempted by florida state law because it provides the foundation for the ordinance.fpta contends the district court erred in concluding that those portions of section were not implicated by florida law because they were beyond miami beach jurisdiction to regulate.however,we find no merit in fpta arguments and agree with the district court conclusion that section is foundational,states a purpose consistent with the florida statutes and,therefore,does not involve any preemption concerns.
section a definitions 
section a of the ordinance states a architectural feature shall mean any ornamentation,decorative column,or other significant building detail which represents an important part of the building design.fpta argues that section a is not related to the placement or maintenance of pay phones or necessary to manage the public because this section seeks to regulate the design of pay phones.according to fpta,the design of pay phones does not have any relationship to their placement or maintenance.it claims that the florida legislature reserved to fpsc the exclusive jurisdiction to regulate design criteria for pay phones.in response,miami beach contends that its definition of architectural features in section a provides meaning to the ordinance and does not itself regulate pay phones.the district court found that section a was not preempted by florida state law.we agree.reasonable limitations on the design of pay phones deals directly with a concern for aesthetics.we agree with the district court conclusion that section a is within the authority of the city and does not raise any preemption concerns.
section c powers and duties of city public works director 
section of the ordinance grants miami beach public works director the power to either grant or deny an application for a pay phone permit to make regulations pertaining to applications for pay phone permits and to make regulations regarding the construction,reconstruction,installation,operation,maintenance,dismantling,testing,repair and use of any pay phones.fpta argues that the terms in section c are too broad and ambiguous.fpta contends that this makes the section beyond the scope of miami beach limited authority to promulgate reasonable regulations related to the placement or maintenance of facilities in the public.to the contrary,however,we agree with the district court findings that all of section is related to the placement or maintenance of facilities in the public,is reasonable and,and is necessary to manage the public.certainly,there must be some order in the regulations and some official must be designated to oversee compliance with those regulations.
section a use of streets and sidewalks 
section a of the ordinance set forth requirements that pay phone providers must satisfy prior to installing pay phones and their duties after installation of pay phones with regards to streets and sidewalks as well as o
