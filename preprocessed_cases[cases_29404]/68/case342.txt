in june,missouri interstate gas,llc mig,along with two intrastate pipelines,missouri gas company,llc mgc and missouri pipeline company,llc mpc,applied to the federal energy regulatory commission ferc or commission for a certificate of public convenience and necessity certificate pursuant to of the natural gas act nga,c,to reorganize into one interstate,federally regulated natural gas company called mogas pipeline,llc mogas.after approving the merger and issuing the certificate,the commission authorized initial rates for service on the combined facilities of the new entity.the missouri public service commission mopsc challenged mogas proposed initial rates on a number of grounds.these included claims that the proposed rates passed on to consumers contained certain acquisition premium costs associated with asset purchases by mig as well as acquisition premiums associated with mgc and mpc.under established ferc precedent,such premiums are disallowed,unless the agency applies the benefits exception.see rio grande pipeline ferc.pipeline.
ferc sustained mopsc objections to the acquisition premiums embedded in the costs associated with mgc and mpc.however,the commission initially declined to address mopsc challenge to the alleged acquisition premium embedded in the costs associated with the mig pipeline.see.interstate gas,llc,order.later,upon denying a request for rehearing on this issue,see.interstate gas,llc,order,ferc clarified its intention to allow mogas initial rates to stand,relying on an earlier order issued in in which ferc allowed mig to include the disputed costs in its own initial rates,see.interstate gas,llc,order.
in its petition for review before this court,mopsc argues that ferc decision regarding the inclusion of acquisition premium costs in mogas initial rates is arbitrary and capricious.we agree.ferc action is plainly inconsistent with its own precedents.it is also inconsistent with the agency treatment of the acquisition premiums embedded in the costs associated with mgc and mpc,with respect to which mopsc objections were sustained.ferc claim that it properly deferred consideration of the disputed acquisition premium issue to an nga,proceeding is unavailing.mopsc submitted evidence to ferc during the proceeding to demonstrate the existence of an improper acquisition premium and mogas did not contest it or otherwise attempt to justify the alleged acquisition premium.b oth the supreme court and this circuit have made clear that the commission has a duty to use its power to protect consumers indeed,the commission usual practice in section certificate proceedings is to apply,to the extent practicable,the same ratemaking policies that it applies in section rate cases.pub.serv.comm ferc,quoting.pipeline,at see also maritimes ne.pipeline,llc,at.there is nothing in ferc decision to suggest that it would have been impracticable to address the mig acquisition premium issue in the proceeding,yet ferc failed to do so.because the agency decision is the antithesis of reasoned decisonmaking,allentown mack sales,nlrb,d,we grant the petition for review,vacate ferc order with respect to the alleged acquisition premium issue regarding mig,and remand the case for a prompt resolution of the question of the alleged acquisition premium.
background 
statutory and regulatory background 
under the nga,et,ferc closely supervises the sale and transport of natural gas in interstate commerce.under of the nga,natural gas companies must obtain a certificate of public convenience and necessity from ferc before constructing,acquiring,or operating interstate natural gas pipelines.in the context of granting such a certificate,ferc sets initial rates governing the sale price of natural gas transported in the pipeline.initial rates proposed by a new pipeline are approved if the agency finds that they are in the public interest.see.pub.serv.comm n,at quoting atl.ref.pub.serv.comm n,d.initial rates offer a temporary mechanism to protect the public interest until the regular rate setting provisions of the nga come into play.id.quoting algonquin gas transmission fed.power comm n.these regular rate setting provisions are codified under and of the nga.section allows pipelines to initiate proceedings to set or modify permanent rates,while allows ferc to do so on its own authority.permanent rates established under and proceedings are governed by the just and reasonable standard.see,see also.pub.serv.comm n,at comparing just and reasonable and public interest standards.
creation and certification of mig 
mig was first created in pursuant to a plan to convert a decommissioned oil pipeline into an interstate natural gas pipeline.when mig sought certification from ferc,mopsc challenged the pipeline proposed initial rates,arguing that they contained an improper acquisition premium.generally,when establishing the cost of service upon which a pipeline regulated rates are based,ferc employs original cost principles to determine what costs should be passed on to consumers.rio grande pipeline,at.under these principles,when a facility is acquired by one regulated entity from another,the seller depreciated original cost is included in the computations,even though the price paid by the purchaser may exceed that amount.id.any cost above the depreciated original cost a term that is alternately referred to as the net book value is known as an acquisition premium.under established ferc precedent,such premiums are disallowed,unless the agency applies its benefits exception to this general rule.see.pipeline,at.as the agency explained in its kansas pipeline case 
the commission has,with limited exception,considered amounts in excess of the net book value to be an acquisition premium that should be absorbed by the shareholders.the original cost policy is an old and accepted concept of public utility regulation.the commission has allowed exceptions to this rule but,only when the purchaser has demonstrated specific dollar benefits resulting directly from the sale.however,the benefits must be tangible,and quantifiable in monetary terms.the burden of proof for a utility seeking to demonstrate specific dollar amounts is heavy.

in,when it approved mig proposed initial rates,see order,at,ferc noted that mig represent ed that the acquisition cost reported by mig for use in ferc initial rate calculation was the depreciated net book value of the idled oil pipeline and its related assets as charged by the pipeline seller,utilicorp united,id.at.after highlighting the fact that mopsc had approved the sale of the decommissioned oil pipeline assets to mig as an sale transaction between parties and the fact that the facilities will be devoted to gas utility service for the first time,ferc declined to further evaluate whether mig initial rates should be reduced due to the alleged acquisition premium.id.however,ferc directed mig to file a cost and revenue study assuming the burden of proof on a number of issues,including the acquisition premium issue,related to the permanent rates that would govern mig operations going forward.id.at.on march,after mig submitted the required study,see order,at describing mig filing under ferc docket no.docket entry,mopsc filed a protest,contesting,among other things,the continuation of the alleged acquisition premium.
creation and certification of mogas 
in june,before the contested issues relating to the docket entry could be resolved,mig with two intrastate pipelines,mgc and reorganize into mogas,a single,new federally regulated interstate natural gas company.mopsc filed an opposition to mogas application in the proceeding,challenging mogas proposed initial rates on a number of grounds.mopsc objections included,inter alia,claims that mogas proposed initial rates included an improper acquisition premium carried over from the initial mig rates established in.mopsc further claimed that the proposed initial rates also included improper acquisition premiums embedded in the costs associated with mgc and mpc.
in,ferc approved initial rates for mogas.see order,at.the agency sustained mopsc objections to the acquisition premiums embedded in the costs associ
