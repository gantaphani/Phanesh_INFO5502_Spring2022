the federal energy regulatory commission certified intervenor ormesa llc ormesa as a qualifying geothermal small power production facility,entitling it to certain privileges pursuant to section of the public utility regulatory policies act of purpa.in particular,the certification permitted ormesa to compel traditional utilities to purchase ormesa net power output.southern california edison edison,a utility that has a power purchase agreement with ormesa,petitions for review,arguing the commission acted arbitrarily and capriciously by permitting ormesa to sell capacity in excess of its net output and by distinguishing between brine extraction and brine reinjection in calculating the net output in the first place.finding no basis for upsetting the commission order,we deny the petition for review.
congress enacted section of purpa,to encourage the development of cogeneration and small power production facilities.ferc mississippi,d.valley ferc.a cogeneration facility produces both electric energy and either steam or some other form of usable energy,a a small power production facility produces no more than megawatts of electricity using only biomass,waste,renewable resources,or geothermal resources as the primary energy source,id.a.
to counter traditional electric utilities reluctance to deal with these nontraditional facilities,the purpa charges the commission with implementing mandatory purchase and sell obligations,requiring electric utilities to purchase electric power from,and sell power to,qualifying cogeneration and small power production facilities collectively,qualifying facilities or qfs.see id.a ferc mississippi,at.a qualifying small power production facility must meet such requirements including requirements respecting fuel use,fuel efficiency,and reliability as the commission may,by rule,prescribe.c id.b covering qualifying cogeneration facilities.
hewing to the purpa mandate,the commission enacted regulations requiring a utility to purchase any energy and capacity which is made available from a qf,a,and to sell any energy and capacity requested by the qf,id.b.while the utility must sell electricity to a qf at regulated tariff rates,the utility must buy electricity from the qf at a rate equal to the utility full avoided cost.see.valley,at citing b.the utility avoided cost also called the incremental cost of alternative electric energy is the cost to the electric utility of the electric energy which,but for the purchase from such qf,such utility would generate or purchase from another source.d see b am.paper,am.power serv,d.valley,at.as a practical matter,the rate that a qf can require a utility to pay the rate is almost always higher than the regulated tariff rate at which the qf can purchase from the utility electricity for its internal operating needs.valley,at.
the commission certifies the amount of power qualifying output or qualifying power that a qf can require a utility to purchase.the commission determines a qf qualifying output by looking to the qf net output rather than its gross output.penntech papers,at,wl power developers,at,wl occidental geothermal,at,wl.a qf gross output is the total amount of electric energy that it can produce.the net output is the gross output minus the auxiliary load,which is electricity the qf itself consumes during the production process.see penntech papers,at t he facility must consume some electric power for auxiliary equipment such as pumps,blowers,fans.the commission defined the auxiliary load as power that is a necessary and integral part of the power production process.geo east mesa,at,wl.
by only certifying a qf net output rather than gross output as qualifying output,the commission prevents a qf from purchasing power for its auxiliary load from one utility at retail rates and then attempting to sell its entire gross output to another utility at avoided cost rates.penntech papers,at.this accords with the purposes behind the purpa,as the commission thus certifies the amount of output that the qf actually contributes to the amount that will displace electricity produced by traditional means.id.the commission has cautioned that a llowing a qf to sell the gross output at one utility avoided cost rates while the qf purchases the auxiliary power at another utility retail rates may very well result in an economic distortion.id.
until recently,a qf had to be owned by a person not primarily engaged in the generation or sale of electric power other than electric power solely from cogeneration facilities or small power production facilities.c ii qualifying small power production facility id.b ii qualifying cogeneration facility see also the commission construed this ownership restriction to mean that a qf could not itself be in the business of selling electric power in excess of its net output,unless the incremental power fell within the ambit of the parenthetical exception.see.valley wheelabrator claremont,at,wl connecticut valley turners falls,at,wl.the penalty for selling such nonqualifying power was loss of qf status.turners falls,at.
this changed,however,with the energy policy act of the act,b,stat,amending c b,which eliminated the statutory ownership limitation consequently,the commission removed the corresponding regulation,noting that r emoval of the ownership prohibition removes the bar to a qf selling electric energy while retaining qf status.revised regulations governing small power production and cogeneration facilities,deleting.
ormesa is a geothermal small power production facility located in imperial county,california,with a gross capacity of megawatts mw.ormesa was originally certified as a qf by the commission in.ormesa geothermal ii,wl.the facility utilizes several wells extending into underground reservoirs that are close enough to the surface and hot enough to be useful in generating electricity.as relevant to the present case,the electricity production process consists of i using pumps to extract brine from the geothermal production wells and transport it to the facility ii various activities,such as moving the hot brine through a vaporizer to vaporize the working fluid,in gaseous form,then flows into the turbines,generating electric power and iii reinjecting the used brine back into the geothermal reservoir.ormesa obtains the power necessary to perform steps i and iii requiring mw and mw,another geothermal qf.the mw needed to perform the functions,such as the activities described in step ii above,comes from ormesa itself.
edison is an electric utility that generates and purchases electric energy and resells it to consumers in southern california.edison purchases power from ormesa under a power purchase agreement consistent with commission regulations,see et.the agreement requires ormesa to maintain its qf status at all times.
on february,ormesa filed an application for as a qf.ormesa argued the auxiliary load consisted solely of the activities,such as moving the brine directly into the generating equipment.ormesa thus sought certification at a capacity of mw the commission permitted edison to intervene and protest ormesa application.edison argued the power for brine and brine reinjection that is,steps i and iii as described above should also be considered part of the auxiliary load and,accordingly,excluded from the certified net output.edison thus would calculate the net output at mw 
the commission agreed in part with each party.see ormesa llc,wl certification order.relying on geo east mesa,the commission concluded brine extraction and transportation were not necessary and integral to the power production process.the corresponding power consumption was excluded from the auxiliary load and,in turn,included in ormesa net output.conversely,the commission concluded power for brine reinjection was necessary and integral.it was thus included in the auxiliary load and excluded from net output.accordingly,the commission calculated the net output to be mw and certified that amount as qualifying output.
in a footnote,however,the commission granted ormesa permission to sell an additional mw of power in excess of its net output without imperiling its qf status,notwithstanding the owne
