ferc approved a tariff filed by the california independent system operator caiso,manager of california electric power transmission grid.southern california edison petitions for review of that ferc order because the tariff permitted generators of electricity to avoid paying significant retail charges for the energy they or their own heating,lighting,air conditioning and office equipment needs,called station power.petitioners assert that ferc,which has undoubted jurisdiction to regulate wholesale sales and transmission charges,has exceeded its authority by insisting that the same method used for calculating transmission charges for station power be used to calculate retail charges.
as we explained once before in niagara mohawk power ferc,involving the new york market,the commission ordered the unbundling of electric energy markets in order,whereby vertically integrated utilities that owned generation,transmission and distribution facilities and sold them as a package were obliged to sell transmission services separately.they were required to file open access transmission tariffs applicable to both their own electrical transmissions and those provided to independent generators.the order also encouraged the creation of independent system operators isos to ensure competitive pricing of transmission services and reduce the market power of the utilities.casio is one those isos.
just as in new york,unbundling caused a sea change in california.the three largest utilities divested not their generating facilities and now operate primarily as owners of transmission facilities and providers of retail services.the companies that purchased generating facilities from the utilities,by contrast,sell wholesale power.ferc has jurisdiction over wholesale sales and transmission,whereas the states maintain jurisdiction over retail distribution.
under this new regimen,the generators use of station power became a contentious issue.prior to unbundling,utilities which owned and operated the generators would not,of course,charge themselves for the use of station power they simply subtracted netted their own use against their gross output.but now,when the generating facilities use station when they get it from their own is arguably functionally equivalent to a retail sale falling within the jurisdiction of the states,not ferc.that raises the question of how to calculate properly the charges the utilities can impose on the generators for their use of station power.in other words,what is the appropriate netting period by which it should be determined how much power a generator took for its own station power needs ferc has the undeniable right to approve the netting methodology to determine how much electricity generators deliver to and take from the grid for transmission purposes,but in both niagara mohawk and this case,the tariff required the same methodology for both transmission and local use.
in a series of orders involving the electricity market and the new york electricity market,ferc set forth its policies relating to station power procurement and delivery.ferc first approved a tariff filed by the independent operator of the market allowing generators to net the station power it consumed against the station power it supplied on an hourly basis as we explained in niagara mohawk,at,under that tariff,generators that pulled station power off the grid for fifty minutes but supplied in excess of that amount in the next ten minutes would be deemed to have supplied the net amount to the grid and consumed nothing.ferc later accepted a modification of the tariff that changed the netting period from one hour to one month.as should be apparent,if a generator is permitted to net its power use against its power output on a monthly basis,as opposed to an hourly basis,its costs will be are led to believe considerably a generator could often produce enough power in a month to totally avoid any retail charges,but that is more difficult if the netting period is only an hour.ferc rejected arguments that the provision of station power constituted retail sales outside its jurisdiction on the ground that when a generator is net positive over a month no sale has taken place.ferc later approved a netting period in a tariff filed by the new york iso 
in,shortly after ferc issued its orders in the and new york markets,duke energy,an independent generator in california filed a complaint asking ferc to compel the caiso to switch from a netting interval to a monthly interval.the generator also asked that ferc preempt any retail charges for generators that are net positive for a month.edison,the petitioner here,objected,arguing that ferc lacked jurisdiction over retail energy sales.ferc,however,determined that the caiso tariff did not conform to its station power policies as set forth in the and new york orders.it ordered caiso to revise its tariff and added that because a one month netting interval had become a standard,ferc would require strong justification for any other netting interval edison unsuccessfully sought rehearing and then sought review in this court.we held that petition in abeyance pending ferc approval of a revised caiso tariff,which it later did.
edison again sought rehearing of ferc approval of the revised tariff,but in the interim,proposed to alter its retail tariff on file with the california public utilities commission.this time edison proposed to assess stranded cost or consumption charges rather than retail delivery charges on what it regarded as net positive generators.edison contended that the state could allow it to assess such charges even if ferc determines that no sale had taken place.but the generators asked ferc to reject that approach as well in its response to edison rehearing petition.
ferc again denied rehearing,relying on its jurisdiction over the transmission of station power.it also rejected edison alternative argument that it could charge generators even though they were net positive for a month for stranded costs or consumption charges.according to the commission,such charges would impair the ability of generators to utilize the netting provisions of caiso tariff and would force them to pay for fictitious energy purchases,when they are,in fact.ferc relied on our decision in niagara was issued while the rehearing request was pending before the which we denied a challenge to the netting period approved by ferc for the new york market when petitioners sought review of this order,it was consolidated with the first petition initially held in abeyance.
the issue before us is stark.petitioners assert that ferc,by insisting that the netting period it approved to calculate energy delivered to and taken from the grid by generators for transmission charges must also govern charges the utilities seek to impose for the generator own use of power,has exceeded its jurisdiction.
it should be noted that although ferc insists that it can determine that no retail sale has taken place or that a consumption charge is legitimate it does not rest on its wholesale but rather only on its jurisdiction over transmission.its primary justification in both its order and before us is our own opinion in niagara mohawk where,to be sure,we rejected a similar argument presented by new york utilities and the new york state public service commission.but we think ferc overreads that case.we noted then that p etitioner statutory argument is not insubstantial,that the commission rationale is a bit confusing,and,perhaps even more skeptically,that the commission has not clearly articulated why its jurisdiction over interstate transmission permits it to determine that no sale of any a retail place.at.indeed that troubling case was resolved based on a concession petitioners made by petitioners here.in niagara mohawk,it was conceded that ferc could,within its authority,dictate an hourly netting period for retail sales petitioners only objected to the tariff monthly netting period.we could discern no principled basis for distinguishing those two periods as it related to ferc jurisdiction.if the commission could legally require an hourly netting period for retail sales it seemed analytically imp
