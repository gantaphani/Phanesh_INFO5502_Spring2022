petitioners challenge a decision by the nuclear regulatory commission to grant a license permitting the construction and operation of a spent nuclear fuel storage facility in utah,on land belonging to the skull valley band of goshute indians.after the commission approved the license,the interior department bureau of land management and bureau of indian affairs denied applications for and a lease,respectively.because it is speculative whether the project will ever be able to proceed,we find the petitioners challenge unripe and direct that the case be held in abeyance 
in,private fuel storage,pfs,a consortium of eight nuclear utilities,applied to the nuclear regulatory commission nrc for a license to build and operate an independent spent fuel storage installation isfsi.the proposed isfsi would store spent nuclear fuel in steel and concrete casks on land in utah belonging to the skull valley band of goshute indians.the facility would be built on an site,about miles from the band village,pursuant to a lease between the band and pfs.while most isfsis are located at the reactors where the spent nuclear fuel is generated,pfs proposed isfsi would be the first large,away from repository to be licensed by the nrc.
in addition to applying to the nrc for a license,pfs sought two other regulatory approvals.first,it applied to the bureau of indian affairs bia for approval of the skull valley band lease of the site to pfs.second,it applied to the bureau of land management blm for a to transport the spent nuclear fuel from the main union pacific rail line to the isfsi.pfs proposed two options.its preferred option was to build a new,rail spur from the main line that would run along the base of the cedar mountains to the isfsi.pfs alternative option was to build an intermodal transfer facility,at which spent nuclear fuel would be transferred from railcars to vehicles and then transported to the isfsi via skull valley road,a public road.
on september,following a lengthy administrative proceeding in which the petitioners participated,the nrc issued a memorandum and order authorizing its staff to issue a license to pfs to build and operate the isfsi.on february,after denying utah motion to reopen the record,nrc granted the license.the license,which is specific to the site designated in the proposed lease,permits pfs to store up to metric tons of spent nuclear fuel at the facility.its term is twenty years,with an option to renew for another twenty.
petitioner ohngo gaudadeh devia ogd an association consisting primarily of members of the skull valley band opposed to construction of a nuclear waste facility on the petitioned for review of the nrc decision in this court.so,too,did the state of utah.pfs and the skull valley band intervened on the side of the nrc.
subsequent to the filing of the petitions for review,the blm and the bia denied the applications that pfs had filed with each agency.the blm disapproved both of pfs requested the preferred rail route,and the alternative intermodal transfer facility route.the bureau rejected the rail line request on the ground that the national defense authorization act for fiscal year,stat,which had been signed into law after publication of the project final environmental impact statement,clearly required denial.blm,record of decision at.section of the act designated certain lands,including those described in pfs application,as wilderness and added them to the national wilderness preservation system.see national defense authorization act,stat.at blm,record of decision at.o peration of a rail line,the blm said,would be inconsistent with the purpose for which the blm manages the cedar mountain wilderness area.blm,record of decision at.the blm also rejected the alternative option,on the ground that the intermodal transfer facility was contrary to the public interest.id.in the blm view,too many questions remain unanswered regarding the potential risk and impact of transporting spent nuclear fuel along skull valley road.see id.at.
for its part,the bia rejected the skull valley band lease of reservation land to pfs for the construction and operation of the isfsi.although the local bia superintendent had conditionally approved the lease in may,the bureau declared itself unconstrained by the superintendent conditional approval.the bureau based its disapproval on a variety of concerns,including the adequacy of the environmental impact analysis,the relationship of the use of leased lands to neighboring lands,the lack of specialized resources with which to monitor the tenant activities and enforce the lease,and the inability to ascertain when spent nuclear fuel might leave the land.see bia,record of decision at.
the parties advised us of these developments in their briefs on the merits.we requested supplemental briefing regarding the impact of these developments on justiciability,and we now conclude that the petitions are not ripe for review and should be held in abeyance.
the supreme court has noted that r ipeness is a justiciability doctrine that is drawn both from article iii limitations on judicial power and from prudential reasons for refusing to exercise jurisdiction.national park hospitality ass dep t of the interior,d quoting reno catholic soc,d.even in a case raising only prudential concerns,the question of ripeness may be considered on a court own motion.id.at.we do so here.
in testing whether the facts of a particular case meet th e standard of ripeness,we have often applied a analysis,evaluating the fit ness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.national treasury employees union united states,quoting abbott labs.gardner,d.the basic rationale is to prevent the courts,through avoidance of premature adjudication,from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements over administrative policies,and also to protect the agencies from judicial interference until an administrative decision has been formalized and its effects felt in a concrete way by the challenging parties.abbott,at.but as we have also explained,the usually unspoken element of the rationale is this if we do not decide the claim now,we may never need to.not only does this rationale protect the expenditure of judicial resources,but it comports with our theoretical role as the governmental branch of last resort.article iii courts should not make decisions unless they have to.national treasury employees union,at citation omitted see maine medical,cir boudin,noting that,i n the fitness inquiry,prudential concerns focus on the policy of judicial restraint from unnecessary decisions.
among other things,the fitness of an issue for judicial decision depends on whether it is purely legal,whether consideration of the issue would benefit from a more concrete setting,and whether the agency action is sufficiently final.atlantic states legal,epa,quoting clean air implementation project epa.but when an agency decision may never have its effects felt in a concrete way by the challenging parties,abbott,at,the prospect of entangling ourselves in a challenge to such a decision is an element of the fitness determination as well.see toilet goods ass gardner,d holding that,even though a regulation was the agency considered and formalized determination,and the issue present ed a purely legal question,the lawfulness of the action authorized by the regulation was not fit for judicial resolution,because inter alia it was uncertain whether or when the authority would be used.as the first circuit has put it 
even though the legal issues may be clear,a case may still not be fit for review t he question of fitness does not pivot solely on whether a court is capable of resolving a claim intelligently,but also involves an assessment of whether it is appropriate for the court to undertake the task.federal courts should their scarce resources on what amounts to shadow boxing.thus,if a plaintiff claim,though predominantly legal in character,depends on future events that may never come to pass,or that may not occur in the form forecasted,then the claim is unripe.
