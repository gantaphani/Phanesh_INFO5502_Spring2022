the securities and exchange commission authorized american electric power company,which provides electricity services in a number of eastern and midwestern states,to acquire a company that provides electricity services in several distant southern and southwestern states.challenging the commission decision,two electric utility associations argue that the company will violate section of the public utility holding company act,which requires that any registered holding company comprise a single integrated system that is physically interconnected or capable of physical interconnection and confined in its operations to a single area or region,id.c,b,a a.because the commission failed to explain its conclusions regarding the interconnection requirement,and because it failed to justify its finding that the proposed acquisition will satisfy the requirement,we vacate the commission order and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

although puhca states that the commission shall approve most proposed acquisitions,id.b,it details several conditions barring approval,two of which are relevant here.first,the act prohibits approval of an acquisition if the commission finds that the resulting holding company will no longer constitute a single integrated system,id.c,b,defined elsewhere as

id.a a.the commission has broken this language down into four separate prerequisites for approval of a proposed acquisition the system assets must be physically interconnected or capable of physical interconnection the interconnection requirement the assets must be capable of economic operation as a single interconnected and coordinated system the coordination requirement the system itself must be confined to a single area or region the region requirement and the system must not be so large as to impair the advantages of localized management,efficient operation,and the effectiveness of regulation the localization requirement.electric energy,puhca release.the second relevant puhca condition prohibits the commission from approving an acquisition unless the agency finds that the proposed transaction will serve the public interest by tending towards the economical and efficient development of an integrated system.c.to win commission approval,then,a proposed acquisition must not only meet the four requirements,but do so in a way that produces net efficiencies and economies.wisconsin envtl.decade,sec,quoting union,puhca release.
the proposed acquisition at issue here will merge central and south west corporation csw four operating subsidiaries,which currently supply power to parts of arkansas,louisiana,oklahoma,and texas,with intervenor american electric power company aep electric generating company and seven electric operating utilities,which supply power to parts of indiana,kentucky,michigan,ohio,tennessee,virginia,and west virginia.under the terms of the agreement,a aep subsidiary will merge with and into csw.csw will survive the merger,but it and most of its subsidiaries will become subsidiaries of the new aep.with more than thousand megawatts of generating capacity,new aep will serve close to five million customers in eleven states.
aep and csw systems are neither contiguous nor physically,at their closest point,they are separated by hundreds of miles.see appendix a see also aep,service territories,at http last visited.the companies propose to interconnect their systems by means of a,unidirectional transmission service contract with ameren corporation.this contract path will enable new aep western zone the current csw system to make use of some surplus generating is,generating capacity over and above firm load the eastern zone the current aep system.the contract extends for four years from june,to may,after which new aep may renew,though potentially at greater cost.see resp t br.at.aep and csw apparently expect that there will be fewer opportunit ies to transfer energy economically from west to east than from east to west,but when and if such opportunities arise,new aep proposes to make use of its rights under transmission service agreements.am.power,central,puhca release,sec lexis,at,june,approval order.
the proposed acquisition requires the approval of several regulatory agencies in addition to the securities and exchange commission.the federal energy regulatory commission granted conditional approval in march provided that aep and csw reduce the merger potential anticompetitive effects by divesting megawatts of generating capacity and limit ing their ability to contract for firm transmission capacity from east to west to megawatts.am.power,cent,docket nos,reversing in part,affirming in part,vacating in part,and modifying ferc initial decision see also wabash valley power ass ferc,denying petition for review.the public utility commissions of the affected states also considered the proposed merger,and most explicitly approved side agreements among aep,csw,and third parties,all drafted to ensure that ratepayers realize benefits from the transaction.approval order,sec lexis,at.
on june,the securities and exchange commission added its voice to the chorus approving the proposed acquisition.id.at.dismissing concerns expressed by four coalition of utility stakeholders and a group of consumer counselors,as well as petitioners in this case,the american public power association and the national rural electric cooperative commission found that the merger satisfies puhca requirements.id.at.specifically,the commission concluded that the contract path,though both temporary and unidirectional,is adequate to satisfy the interconnection requirement because it will permit the economic transfer of energy from one zone of the new aep system to another,generating related savings of approximately million over the period following the merger.id.at.moreover,the commission observed,aep has committed either to renew the c ontract p ath or to find another way to satisfy the interconnection requirement after.id.at.
with respect to the statute coordination requirement,the commission conceded that new aep structure will differ in some respects from the traditional utility model,in which generating capacity is centrally pooled and because new aep east and west zones will continue to satisfy their respective power demands separately,transferring power from east to west only when one z one has surplus capacity available for sale and the other has insufficient capacity.id.at.the commission was unconcerned by this lack of centralization,however,because it viewed unbundling of generation and transmission to be the direct result of government efforts to promote a competitive energy goal consistent with puhca purpose of ensuring that the growth of holding companies fosters economy of management and operation.id.at.
the commission next addressed puhca region requirement.finding that recent technological advances have reduced the relative importance of geographical limitations on utility systems,the commission declined to read this third requirement as imposing any independent conditions on the proposed merger.id.at.rather,the commission found that the merger satisfies puhca other interconnection and coordination discussed above and localization discussed below and then concluded,i n view of these considerations,the new aep system will operate in a single area or region.id.at.
turning to the fourth requirement,localization,the commission observed that v arious state regulators have demonstrated that they can effectively regulate the new aep system,in that they have already imposed an extensive list of service quality standards on the new aep system operating companies that operate within their states.id.at.additionally,the commission indicated that most affected states have imposed conditions on the proposed merger,under which the states retain the ability to review the activities of new aep and its affiliates and subsidiaries.id.at.noting that it has historically found that effectiveness of state regulation is not impaired where state regulators have the same jurisdiction before and after a merger,id.at citing conectiv,puhca release,docket cch,and also citing its conclusion discussed below that the merger will generate efficiencies,id.at,the commission concluded that new aep will not be so large as to impair the advantages of localized management,efficient operation,and the effectiveness of regulation,puhca,a a.
finally,the commission considered puhca requirement that any acquisition of securities or utility assets of a public utility or holding company must itself tend towards the economical and efficient development of an integrated publicutility system.id.c.referring to aep and csw projection that the merger will save almost billion of net cost s and approximately million of costs over the first ten years,the commission indicated that it had reviewed the assumptions and methodologies underlying the projection and found them reasonable and consistent with precedent.accordingly,the commission determined that the merger will produce sufficient economies and efficiencies to pass muster under puhca.approval order,sec lexis,at.
reiterating many of the substantive arguments they raised during the commission review process,petitioners claim that the commission erred in finding that the proposed acquisition satisfies puhca interconnection and region requirements and in accepting aep and csw projections regarding the cost savings that will result from the merger.petitioners also argue that the commission decision not to hold evidentiary hearings as part of its review of the application for approval of the acquisition was arbitrary and capricious because the acquisition raised factual issues substantially in dispute.pet rs br.at.in considering these claims,we follow the familiar rules of administrative review,accepting the commission findings of fact as long as they are supported by substantial evidence,steadman sec,d commission findings of fact are conclusive for a reviewing court if supported by substantial evidence.internal citations omitted,and affirming its conclusions of law unless they are arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law,a.see,wonsover sec,applying this standard.
interconnection requirement 
petitioners have two principal concerns regarding the commission application of the statute interconnection requirement first,that the companies temporary,transmission contract is too small and too tentative to satisfy puhca,and second,that the approval order departed from commission precedent without adequate explanation.pet rs br.at.in support of their first point,petitioners contend that aep and csw contract with ameren permits the transfer of only a t oken a mount of power,in that the contract path represents just percent of new aep combined megawatts of generating capacity.id.at.moreover,they argue that the unidirectional contract path can not satisfy puhca because the act requires term that,to petitioners,implies transfers of power.petitioners also point out that aep and csw have never said how they plan to satisfy the interconnection requirement after.the companies promise to devise an alternative method of interconnecting their systems if they opt not to renew the contract path is,according to petitioners,inadequate because separate properties not interconnected must be capable of physical interconnection at the time the commission considers the matter and not at some indefinite future time.id.at quoting pub.utils,puhca release.finally,petitioners invoke our decision in madison gas sec,for the proposition that a transmission contract can not,in and of itself,support a finding that utility assets are physically interconnected or capable of physical interconnection,puhca,a a.
we are unpersuaded by petitioners characterization of the contract path as too small and tentative.although we recognize that megawatts represents a small percentage of new aep total generating capacity,petitioners point to no statutory language,legislative history,or case law requiring that physically separated zones of a power system be interconnected by lines capable of transmitting any specific percentage of the power generated in each zone.moreover,the commission said it could order new aep to divest one of the systems if the company fails to devise a satisfactory method of integrating its utilities after the contract with ameren expires.resp t br.at.
nor are we swayed by petitioners reference to madison gas.all we said there was that a power system showing of a current transmission line contract and of a plan to build two before the end of the contract term adequately supported the commission finding that the system two zones were capable of physical interconnection.madison gas,at internal citations omitted.this in no way implies that the transmission line contract would be insufficient,in and of itself,to satisfy puhca.on the contrary,just before approving the commission interconnection finding we observed that t he sec has reasonably construed the interconnection requirement to be satisfied in cases past on the basis of contractual rights to use a transmission lines or if physical interconnection is contemplated or possible within the reasonably near future.id.internal citations omitted emphasis added.thus,nothing in madison gas precludes a finding that aep and csw contract with ameren meets puhca interconnection requirement.
we are,however,puzzled by the commission acceptance of a unidirectional contract path to interconnect aep and csw.webster dictionary defines interconnection as connection between two or more mutual connection a definition that seems,on its face,to require transfers of power.webster third new international dictionary emphasis added.in addition,puhca itself requires that the interconnected system be one which under normal conditions may be economically operated as a single interconnected and coordinated whole.a a.absent some explanation from the commission,we can not understand how a system restricted to unidirectional flow of power from one half to the other can be operated in such a manner.
moreover,we agree with petitioners that the commission failed to follow its own prior reasoning regarding interconnection of distant utilities.petitioners point to several prior orders in which the commission expressly indicated that contract rights can not be relied upon to integrate two distant utilities.wpl holdings,puhca release,emphasis added concluding that the distances at issue in this matter between cities in iowa and within the parameters of the previous decisions,aff,madison gas,see also unitil,puhca release,c ontract rights can not be relied upon to integrate two distant utilities.northeast,puhca release,indicating that the use of a third party can not be relied upon to integrate two distant utilities.although these statements were dicta,petitioners argue that they expre
