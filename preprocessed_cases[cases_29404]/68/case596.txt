opinion on rehearing 
red mountain,red mountain owns undeveloped land adjacent to a drinking water reservoir the reservoir and surrounding property owned by fallbrook public utilities district fallbrook.red mountain sued fallbrook for breach of contract,specific performance,and inverse condemnation based on fallbrook refusal to perform a written agreement to convey to red mountain a easement for ingress and egress the access easement across fallbrook property.fallbrook filed a to quiet title and for declaratory and injunctive relief,in which it alleged that approximately acres of red mountain property was encumbered by a nonexclusive sanitary easement the sanitary easement,which entitled fallbrook to patrol,control and maintain sanitary conditions in the easement area in order to keep the reservoir water free from contamination.fallbrook alleged that the easement precluded red mountain from developing the land within the easement area.
while this litigation was pending,fallbrook filed an eminent domain complaint against red mountain condemning a acre parcel of land that included all or most of the sanitary easement area fallbrook also condemned any and all rights red mountain might have had to the access easement.the two actions were consolidated and,following a bifurcated trial,the trial court entered judgment pursuant to a jury verdict that awarded red mountain damages of for breach of contract and inverse condemnation,and compensation of for the direct taking in eminent domain.after it entered judgment,the trial court awarded red mountain attorney fees and other litigation expenses under code of civil procedure sections and.
fallbrook appeals from the judgment,contending that the trial court committed reversible error by failing to construe the access easement in a manner consistent with the undisputed evidence,and with civil code section relocating the access easement and failing to limit the scope of the easement to red mountain personal ingress and egress failing to interpret the scope of the sanitary easement pursuant to fallbrook declaratory relief cause of action determining that fallbrook was liable for inverse condemnation admitting evidence of speculative damages incorrectly instructing the jury and refusing certain jury instructions that fallbrook requested refusing fallbrook request to include questions regarding fallbrook contract defense of impossibility or impracticability of performance in the special verdict form,and failing to ensure that the verdict form protected against duplicative damages and awarding red mountain attorney fees and litigation expenses under code of civil procedure section.we reverse the judgment and the order awarding litigation expenses.
factual and procedural background 
in,frank and lucille capra sold acres of land to fallbrook to be used for the construction of a dam and reservoir.the contract between fallbrook and the capras the agreement included the following provision creating the sanitary easement 
the capras also grant to fallbrook a easement over the area of the lying back of the dam to be constructed by fallbrook,which area consists of approximately acres,for the purpose of enabling fallbrook to patrol,control and maintain sanitary conditions thereon necessary and adequate to keep the water stored in the reservoir pure,wholesome,potable and free from contamination from the surrounding area and to enable fallbrook at all times to comply with the public health laws of the state of california and the rules and regulations of the state board of public health it being agreed that nothing herein contained shall be deemed to prevent the capras having free and ready access to the acres.
in,the capras sold approximately acres of land adjacent to the reservoir to a group of buyers consisting of james walter chaffin and his wife nola belle chaffin,john roy chaffin and his wife mary lee chaffin,and frederick jackson and his wife margaret jackson the group.the group immediately transferred approximately of those acres to another group of buyers and planned to develop the remaining land the red mountain ranch property into homesites.
in february,fallbrook notified james chaffin by letter that it required approximately acres of additional land north of the reservoir for future water storage and treatment.fallbrook offered to purchase the land for per acre excluding reserved road easement areas,and proposed that the o wner may reserve a foot easement on the east and west boundaries of the parcel.the group proposed certain conditions to its sale of the parcel,one of which was that fallbrook agree to grant seller a easement over the existing road on the west sides sic of the parcel being conveyed another was that the easement be sufficient in scope and magnitude to meet the subdivision requirements of san diego county and will be granted to sellers or their successors in interest upon days notice at any future time.
at a meeting of fallbrook board of directors on august,which james chaffin,jackson and their attorney attended,the board approved most of the conditions the group had proposed.however,the board voted to delete the condition that the access easement be sufficient in scope and magnitude to meet the subdivision requirements of san diego county.james chaffin and jackson agreed to the terms that the board approved.
on august,the parties signed escrow instructions setting forth the terms of their agreement the agreement.with respect to the access easement,the escrow instructions stated fallbrook a grees to grant at any future time the following easements to the sellers or their successors in interest upon provision to fallbrook by the sellers,or their successors in interest,days notice,legal descriptions and documentation required to accomplish said granting a foot easement over the existing road on the west sides sic of the parcel being conveyed and the present fallbrook property described in its grant deed 
in october,james chaffin and jackson died in an airplane crash.the chaffin family later acquired the jacksons interest in the red mountain ranch property.after james chaffin estate was settled,interests in the property were held,respectively,by nola belle chaffin,her six children,and john roy and mary lee chaffin collectively the chaffins.the chaffins abandoned plans to develop the property sometime after james chaffin death,in part because san diego county designated the red mountain ranch property as a possible site for a landfill in the early.
in,fallbrook notified the chaffins that it was planning to expand the reservoir,and that the expansion project would require it to excavate a portion of the red mountain ranch property.fallbrook proposed a boundary adjustment to accommodate the project,and offered to place excess fill material removed from the project into two canyons on the red mountain ranch property to enhance development of that portion of the property.the chaffins ultimately agreed to sell acres of land to fallbrook to be used for the reservoir expansion project.
construction on the reservoir expansion project began in and was completed in late.the expanded reservoir obliterated approximately feet of the road that had run along the west side of the reservoir,placing that portion of the road under a dam and up to feet of water.fallbrook built a paved road along the west side of the expanded reservoir red mountain dam road to replace the portion of the old road that had been destroyed.at its closest point to the reservoir,the new road is separated from the reservoir by a berm.vehicles traveling at that point on the road are to feet from the reservoir water,depending on the water level.fallbrook installed a gate across the new road,but provided keys to the lock on the gate to the chaffins so they could use the road to access the red mountain ranch property.
in the late the chaffins learned that the red mountain ranch property was no longer being considered as a possible landfill site.in,james chaffin,chaffin,with the approval of the other property owners,decided to pursue a subdivision project on the property.the chaffins formed red mountain for that purpose and transferred all of their interests in the property to red mountain.
chaffin hired civil engineer gary piro to act as project engineer.piro initial subdivision design showed access to the subdivision from mission road along red mountain dam road.in early,fallbrook objected to the use of red mountain dam road for access to a subdivision.fallbrook chief engineer told chaffin and piro that use of the road for a subdivision would cause fallbrook to have to cover the reservoir.
because of fallbrook objection to red mountain proposed use of red mountain dam road,chaffin attempted to find a different way to access the subdivision.he negotiated with an owner of property that fronted mission road on the east side of the reservoir for an access easement that would serve all of the red mountain ranch property north of mission road.however,those negotiations were ultimately unsuccessful.
in august,red mountain notified fallbrook that,pursuant to the agreement,it would provide the documents necessary for fallbrook to grant red mountain a easement over red mountain dam road.fallbrook responded with a letter in which it stated that it would not grant the access easement.fallbrook explained that t he increased traffic would require the reservoir to be covered due to health constraints at a cost of several million dollars,which fallbrook has not budgeted and for which it would not be inclined to raise rates.fallbrook added as a practical matter,the existing roads referred to in the agreement no longer exist.those roads were inundated by the enlargement of the reservoir in.that project was legally noticed throughout the fallbrook community and the district received no complaints or requests for reservation of any roadway.further,the subdivision development proposed now was not anticipated for the chaffin ranch use in.
in june,red mountain filed a complaint against fallbrook for breach of contract,specific performance and inverse condemnation,based on fallbrook refusal to grant the access easement.fallbrook answered the complaint and in april filed a to quiet title and for declaratory and injunctive relief.in its,fallbrook asked the trial court to rule that the sanitary easement was valid and that it precluded red mountain proposed subdivision development.in september,fallbrook filed an eminent domain complaint against red mountain,condemning acres that included the acres of the sanitary easement.fallbrook complaint also condemned any and all rights red mountain had to the access easement.
on the parties stipulation,the trial court consolidated the two actions for trial and fallbrook moved to bifurcate the trial into liability and compensation phases.in opposition to the motion,red mountain argued that the proposed bifurcation would violate its right to a jury trial on its breach of contract claim.the court granted the motion,ruling that the court would try liability issues,and the jury would decide the amount of compensation.however,at oral argument on the motion,the trial court stated that if surviving issues of fact will necessarily have to go to the jury after the first phase of trial,i will fashion an order that provides for that.
after the liability phase of the trial was completed,the trial court issued a statement of decision in which it ruled that the access easement referenced in the agreement granted red mountain a easement over red mountain dam road red mountain dam road was for red mountain ingress to and egress from its northern property appurtenant to fallbrook reservoir property red mountain was bound by the language in the agreement creating the sanitary easement and issues addressing whether the proposed development constitutes a new burden on the sanitary easement,whether inverse or,eminent domain remedies,possible contamination of the sanitation easement,and the likelihood that the development will overburden this easement,are all premature.on november,the court filed an interlocutory judgment on bifurcated issues,in which it set forth its rulings in the statement of decision.
on december,fallbrook made a final offer of to resolve all issues of compensation both as to the direct condemnation and claim of inverse condemnation on the same day,red mountain made a final demand of,representing compensation to be awarded in this proceeding for the taking,both by eminent domain and inverse condemnation,of all real property and interests in real property.
the compensation issues were tried to a jury in february and march of.at the close of evidence,the court made a finding of inverse condemnation,stating,it will be a jury determination as to whether there are damages.the jury returned a special verdict awarding red mountain damages of on its inverse condemnation and breach of contract causes of action,and as the fair market value on february,of the property fallbrook directly condemned.
after the court entered its final judgment on april,red mountain filed a motion for an award of litigation expenses under code of civil procedure section applicable to inverse condemnation actions code of civil procedure section applicable to eminent domain actions.red mountain also filed a motion for an order requiring fallbrook to deposit the full amount of the judgment with the court.on july,the court granted both motions and ordered fallbrook to make the required deposit in the full amount of the condemnation award 
on june,fallbrook timely filed a notice of appeal from the judgment,and on august filed a petition for writ of supersedeas asking this court to stay the order requiring it to deposit the full amount of the condemnation award.on august fallbrook filed an amended notice of appeal,stating that it was amend ing its notice of appeal filed june,to include the court ruling on litigation expenses of july,to be included as an issue on appeal.this court granted the petition for writ of supersedeas and issued an order stating to the extent that the trial court order directing deposit of the full amount of the compensation award includes the award issued for inverse condemnation or breach of contract in connection with the foot easement,the order is stayed pending appeal.
discussion 
sufficiency of fallbrook opening brief and notice of appeal from the postjudgment order awarding litigation expenses 
red mountain asks this court,on our own motion,to strike fallbrook opening brief and dismiss the appeal because the brief does not include a statement of appealability,as required by california rules of court rule a b.we exercise our discretion under rule e c to disregard fallbrook technical noncompliance with the requirement that its opening brief include a statement of appealability,because the judgment and postjudgment order fallbrook challenges are both clearly appealable.
red mountain also contends that the amended notice of appeal fallbrook filed on august,either relates back to the date of the original notice of appeal filed on april,and,therefore,is a nullity because it is premature as to the july,postjudgment order,or supersedes the original notice of appeal from the judgment and,therefore,is untimely as to the judgment.red mountain argues that this court should either dismiss the appeal from the postjudgment order,or dismiss the entire appeal on the ground that it is untimely red mountain argument implies that when an appeal is taken from a judgment,an amended notice of appeal filed after the time to appeal the judgment has expired is ineffective to appeal a postjudgment order,even if the amended notice of appeal identifies the postjudgment order and communicates the intent to appeal that order.
we reject red mountain analysis,which places far too much significance on fallbrook use of the word amended in its second notice of appeal.a notice of appeal is to be liberally construed in favor of its sufficiency rule a,and it may be deemed sufficient if it has not misled or prejudiced the respondent.ecc,oak park calabasas homeowners ass th,fn,d.as noted,fallbrook amended notice of appeal states fallbrook hereby amends its notice of appeal filed june,to include the court ruling on litigation expenses of july,to be included as an issue on appeal.even conservatively construed,the amended notice of appeal sufficiently perfects fallbrook appeal from the july,postjudgment order awarding litigation expenses,as it expressly identifies that order as an issue on appeal.red mountain does not,and can not reasonably,contend that it was misled or prejudiced as to fallbrook intent to appeal that order.we deny red mountain request to dismiss fallbrook appeal in whole or in part.
ii.construction of the access easement 
fallbrook contends that the trial court interpretation of the access easement referenced in the agreement as being for subdivision use was erroneous because uncontradicted parol evidence established that the parties intended the easement to be limited to the chaffins personal ingress and egress,and the court was required to construe the easement in fallbrook favor under civil code section hereinafter,section.we agree with fallbrook second contention.
section provides a grant is to be interpreted in favor of the grantee,except that a reservation in any grant,and every grant by a public officer or body,as such,to a private party,is to be interpreted in favor of the grantor.italics added.section directive that every grant by a public body is to be interpreted in favor of the grantor applies only if there is an ambiguity in a grant.city of los angeles howard d.here,the parties agree that the agreement to grant the access easement is ambiguous as to the scope of the easement.although the ambiguity is in an agreement by a public entity to grant an easement,and not in an actual grant,we conclude that it is appropriate to apply section in construing the agreement because the ambiguity concerns the nature and scope of the easement to be granted 
fallbrook argues that because it is a public body,section mandates that the ambiguity in the agreement regarding the scope of the access easement be resolved in its,the easement provision must be construed as requiring fallbrook to grant an easement for personal ingress and egress only.red mountain essentially argues that section does not require a court to automatically interpret an ambiguity in a grant by a public entity in the public entity favor because,as a general rule,all of the rules of construction should be considered in interpreting a contract,and the true intent of the parties should govern the interpretation.city of manhattan beach superior court cal th,d.
we have found no citable california case that directly addresses whether section requires a court to interpret an ambiguous grant by a public body in favor of the grantor when other rules of construction or extrinsic evidence support an interpretation in favor of the grantee.however,cases that have addressed the role of section in the construction of ambiguous public grants have viewed the statute public grant provision as a statutory mandate that takes precedence over other rules of construction.
the rule that ambiguous grants by the government are to be strictly construed in favor of the government is long standing and well settled.in the united states supreme court noted that p ublic grants convey nothing by implication they are construed strictly in favour of the king citations.united states arredondo pet.a key aspect of the rule,expressed in a number of later united states supreme court opinions,is that nothing passes by the governmental grant but that which is necessarily and expressly embraced in its terms.kean calumet canal improvement,dis.opn.of white,italics added see additional cases cited in home on the range v.at t d.
more than years ago,the california supreme court noted o ur own legislature has made it statute law that every grant by a public officer or body,as such,to a private party,is to be interpreted in favor of the grantor.it is certain moreover,that the principle of construction sustained by the weight of recent authority is that the state is entitled to the benefit of certain canons of construction that pertain to grants by the state to private persons or corporations,as,for instance,that if there is any ambiguity or uncertainty in the act,that interpretation must be put upon it which is most favorable to the state city of oakland oakland cal,quoting illinois cent.state of illinois,dis.opn.of shiras,italics added.the california supreme court later approved the following iteration of the rule all grants of the crown are to be strictly construed against the grantee,contrary to the usual policy of the law in the consideration of grants and upon this just ground,that the prerogatives and rights and emoluments of the crown being conferred upon it for great purposes,and for the public use,it shall not be intended that such prerogatives,rights and emoluments are diminished by any grant,beyond what such grant by necessary and unavoidable construction shall take away.los angeles san pedro,cal,quoting shively bowlby,italics added.
in los angeles county southern cal.cal d,the california supreme court noted that under section,a statutory grant to telegraph and telephone companies of the privilege to construct telegraph or telephone lines along or on public roads must be construed in favor of the state.italics added see also southern california gas city of los angeles cal d,as a public grant,a franchise granted to a public utility for the use of streets is to be construed in favor of the public interest.
pariani state of california d.involved a dispute over whether a reservation of mineral rights in a land grant by the state reserved to the state the geothermal resources underlying the granted lands.noting the federal rule that grants by the federal government are to be construed in the government favor,the appellate court added that under section,any doubt concerning the scope of the state reservation must be resolved in favor of the state.id.at,italics added.
these cases support the proposition that any ambiguity in a grant by a public entity to a private party must be construed in favor of the public grantor,and that such a grant passes only those rights and interests to the grantee that are necessarily and expressly embraced in its terms.the language of section provides clear support for that proposition.section states that every grant by a public officer or body is to be interpreted in favor of the grantor.italics added.words of a statute are to be given a plain and commonsense meaning.when they are clear and unambiguous,there is no need to resort to other indicia of legislative intent,such as legislative history,to construe the statute.quarterman kefauver th,d.further,a statute should be construed so that effect is given to all its provisions,so that no part will be inoperative or superfluous,void or insignificant citations.rodriguez superior court th,d.
the adjective every in section modifies only the phrase grant by a public officer or body to a private party it does not modify the statute reference to grants in general.the phrase every grant by a public officer or body to a private party is clear and unambiguous.the dictionary definition of every,which reflects the plain and commonsense meaning of the word,is being each individual or part of a group without exception.webster new collegiate dict,italics added.accordingly,the rule in section that every grant by a public body is to be interpreted in favor of the grantor applies without exception to the construction of ambiguities in such grants.
as noted,red mountain disputes that the public grantor provision in section takes precedence over other rules of construction.red mountain contends that the primary objective of all contract or deed interpretation is to ascertain the parties intent and that when,as here,conflicting evidence of intent is presented as an aid in interpretation,the trial court interpretation must be affirmed if it is supported by substantial evidence.we agree with the general principle that the true intent of the parties should govern the interpretation of a written instrument,including a grant by a public entity.section will not apply to give the public grantor a greater right than that for which it bargained when the intent of the parties is clear.city of los angeles howard,supra,d at.however,when a grant by a public body is ambiguous,the controlling rule is the provision in section that every grant by a public body is to be interpreted in favor of the grantor.in such a case,extrinsic evidence of the parties intent is irrelevant.
we conclude that the trial court erred by failing to interpret the access easement in fallbrook favor pursuant to section.however,an appellant has the burden to show not only that the trial court erred but also that the error was prejudicial.cal,art.vi,code civ,paterno state of california th,d.error is prejudicial if it is reasonably probable that a result more favorable to the appellant would have been reached absent the error.paterno state of california,supra,th at,d pool city of oakland cal d.a probability in this context does not mean more likely than not,but merely a reasonable chance,more than an abstract possibility.citation.cassim allstate ins.cal th,d.the requirement to show prejudice also applies to a claim of instructional error.a judgment is subject to reversal for state law error involving misdirection of the jury when there is a reasonable probability that in the absence of the error,the result would have been more favorable to the appealing party.soule general motors cal th,d,soule lundquist reusser cal th,d,instructional error is prejudicial when it appears probable that the improper instruction misled the jury and affected the verdict.
we conclude that if the trial court had construed the access easement as limited to the chaffins personal ingress and egress,there is a reasonable probability that it would not have ruled that fallbrook refusal to grant the easement resulted in an inverse condemnation of red mountain property.we further conclude that the trial court failure to construe the access easement in fallbrook favor prejudicially affected the jury verdict on red mountain inverse of contract claim.if the court had construed the access easement as limited to the chaffins personal ingress and egress and instructed the jury accordingly,it is reasonably probable that the jury would have found fallbrook refusal to grant the easement was not a breach of the agreement because the easement red mountain requested was much broader in scope than the personal easement fallbrook had agreed to convey.accordingly,the matter must be remanded for both a redetermination of fallbrook liability for inverse condemnation and a retrial to determine whether fallbrook refusal to grant the access easement constituted a breach of the agreement and,if so,the amount of damages red mountain suffered as a result.
if a jury on remand were to find that fallbrook breached the agreement to grant the access easement,the issue regarding damages would be whether the easement would have enabled red mountain to develop the southerly portion of the red mountain ranch property,even though the easement was limited in scope to personal ingress and egress.at trial,red mountain argued to the jury that it could be made whole for fallbrook refusal to grant the access easement either by an award of breach of condemnation damages with no severance damages in the direct condemnation case,or by an award of the same amount as severance damages and damages for fallbrook unreasonable precondemnation conduct in refusing to grant the access easement.however,red mountain counsel did not ask the jury to award damages for diminution of the value of all of the property red mountain had sought to subdivide and develop rather,he asked the jury to award breach of condemnation damages in the amount of,representing the precondemnation value of red mountain southerly acres as two ranch sites valued at per acre,minus the value of that acreage as mitigation land valued at per acre,plus engineering expenses of the jury award reflects that the jury accepted this formula,except that it found the precondemnation value of the southerly acres to be per acre rather than per acre 
if the court had properly instructed the jury that the access easement contemplated in the agreement was limited to the chaffins personal and the jury had evaluated red mountain inverse of contract damages based on red mountain contractual right to that limited easement,there is a reasonable probability that the jury would have found red mountain transfer of the easement to successor owners of two large ranch estates would materially overburden the easement and unreasonably interfere with fallbrook rights the owner of an easement can not materially increase the burden of the easement on the servient estate or impose a new burden.wall rudolph d.normal future uses of an easement are within the reasonable contemplation of the parties and therefore permissible,but uncontemplated abnormal uses,which greatly increase the burden,are not.witkin,summary of cal.law ed.real property.whether a particular use of an easement by either the servient or dominant owner unreasonably interferes with the rights of the other owner is a question of fact.pacific gas hacienda mobile home park d.city of los angeles howard,supra,d at.if the jury had found that a transfer of the access easement to successor owners of two large ranch estates would have materially overburdened the easement and,therefore,red mountain southerly acres could have been used only as mitigation land even if fallbrook had granted red mountain the access easement,the likely result,assuming liability,would have been a lower award of damages for inverse of contract.
our reversal of the judgment as to the inverse of contract claims requires that the issue of just compensation for fallbrook direct condemnation of red mountain property also be retried.under a correct interpretation of the scope of the access easement under section,the trial court could conclude that fallbrook refusal to grant the easement did not result in an inverse condemnation of red mountain property.in that case,there would be no award of damages for inverse of contract.however,red mountain would be entitled to seek severance damages on the direct condemnation claim,as well as damages for fallbrook precondemnation conduct in refusing to grant the access easement and for the direct condemnation of red mountain contractual right to the easement.
the award of for direct condemnation reflects the jury determination of fair market value of the condemned land as of february,as mitigation land with no access.if there was no inverse of contract,red mountain would have had a contractual right to an access easement until fallbrook directly condemned that right.under that scenario,a jury on retrial could find that the value of the property that was directly condemned was higher than the value the jury awarded for direct condemnation in the first trial.
the trial court erroneous interpretation of the access easement and its misdirection of the jury on that point prejudicially affected the outcome of the trial with respect to red mountain claims for inverse condemnation and breach of contract.these errors,in turn,may have prejudicially affected the jury determination of just compensation on fallbrook direct condemnation claim.because resolution of the inverse of contract claims could have affected the determination of just compensation for the direct condemnation,the judgment is not severable.gonzales novick constr.cal d.therefore,the entire judgment must be reversed 
iii.relocation of the access easement 
in the first phase of the trial,the court ruled that the parties had impliedly consented to relocate the access easement to the new red mountain dam road after the existing road referred to in the agreement was obliterated by the reservoir expansion fallbrook contends the trial court ruling was erroneous because the agreement explicitly referred to the existing road as the location of the easement fallbrook argues that an intention to relocate an easement should be specified in the granting document so that a floating easement is established.
we conclude that the trial court finding that the parties impliedly consented to relocate the easement was not erroneous.parties may change the location of an easement by mutual consent,which may be implied from use and acquiescence.johnstone bettencourt d,kosich braz d.when the parties consent to relocation,their rights are not affected by the change,but attach to the new location.citation.johnstone bettencourt,supra,d at.whether parties have impliedly consented to relocate an easement is a question of fact.see also stanardsville volunteer fire,berry.
here,the trial court finding that the parties impliedly consented to relocate the access easement referenced in the agreement to red mountain dam road is amply supported by undisputed facts that the trial court cited in its statement of decision.the court noted upon the completion of the reservoir expansion in approximately,the agents of fallbrook authorized the chaffins to use the new roadway immediately to the west of the odr after completion of the reservoir.despite the fact that agents of fallbrook had erected a fence and locked that roadway from general public use,the chaffins were given keys to access the roadway and continued their use of this new roadway for many years,unobstructed,up and until and through the time of this particular lawsuit.these undisputed facts are sufficient to support the trial court finding that the parties impliedly consented to relocate the access easement from the odr to the newer road immediately to the west of the expanded reservoir.
iv.the trial court interpretation of the sanitary easement 
fallbrook contends that the trial court committed reversible error by failing to rule on fallbrook cause of action for declaratory relief,which fallbrook characterizes as asking the court to determine that red mountain proposed subdivision violated the s anitary e asement.fallbrook argues that the trial court erred by failing to interpret the sanitary easement,and strongly suggests that the only correct interpretation of the easement is that it entirely precluded red mountain proposed subdivision.
we find no reversible error in the trial court handling of fallbrook declaratory relief cause of action.preliminarily,it is important to clarify exactly what relief fallbrook sought in that cause of action.fallbrook asked the court to enter a judgment declaring that the acre sanitary easement was valid and enforceable against red mountain and,as stated in fallbrook 
d that pursuant to the easement,within the acres,fallbrook is entitled to prevent red mountain from excavating,grading,trenching,digging,drilling,or moving dirt or native soil for any purpose,including but not limited to septic systems,leach lines,septic tanks,pipelines,roads,footings for house pads,roads,and 
e that pursuant to the easement,within the acres,fallbrook is entitled to prevent red mountain from building or constructing any work of improvement,including but not limited to roads,septic systems,septic tanks,leach lines,pipelines,house footings,house pads,houses,barns,landscaping and irrigation systems,or other structures and 
f that pursuant to the easement,within the acres,fallbrook is entitled to prevent red mountain from discharging any human or animal waste,insecticides,pesticides,herbicides or fertilizers of any type on to sic,in,on top of,or under the soil and 
g that pursuant to the easement,fallbrook is entitled to prevent red mountain from keeping,maintaining,storing,using,applying,or discharging,any hazardous material and 
h that within the acres,red mountain is not entitled to perform or permit any other action or activity that violates the terms and conditions of the easement.italics added.
in short,in its declaratory relief cause of action,fallbrook asked the trial court to decide,as a matter of law,that the sanitary easement precluded any and all development in the easement area it did not ask the court to decide whether the sanitary easement precluded red mountain from developing red mountain ranch property outside of the sanitary easement area,or whether use of the access easement for a subdivision would overburden the sanitary easement.the trial court effectively decided the issue fallbrook raised in its pleadings by ruling that it was premature to decide,in the court words,whether red mountain proposed development might result in possible contamination of the sanitary easement area this ruling implicitly rejects fallbrook claim that the sanitary easement precluded any and all development within the sanitary easement area as a matter of law,and effectively decided that whether particular development activities within that area would overburden the sanitary easement was a question of fact to be decided based on the specific development plan ultimately approved by the county.the trial court explained the final lot subdivision maps have neither been established nor approved.until such time as plaintiffs applications succeed in going through some kind of approval process and a final lot map is approved,the court is not in possession of sufficient facts to determine whether such lots would constitute an encroachment into the watershed and a risk to the water quality.
the trial court approach is in accord with the rule that w hether a particular use of the land by the servient owner,or by someone acting with his authorization,is an unreasonable interference is a question of fact citations.city of pasadena land water cal d.the trial court noted the creation of the sanitary easement in and ruled that red mountain was bound by its terms.however,the trial court could reasonably conclude that it was not in a position to rule,as a matter of law,that any development within the area of the sanitary easement would threaten the reservoir water and thus was precluded.
in any event,fallbrook bid for declaratory,for a judicial determination that the sanitary easement precluded any development activity within its area as a matter of rendered moot by fallbrook direct condemnation of the land within the sanitary easement.once fallbrook took the sanitary easement acreage by eminent domain,it was unnecessary for the court to decide whether red mountain could develop that land.to the extent the court erred by not interpreting the sanitary easement for purposes of the jury determination of just compensation to be paid by fallbrook for the land within the sanitary easement,the error was harmless because the jury valued the land as undevelopable mitigation land 
v.the court determination of inverse condemnation 
fallbrook contends that the trial court committed reversible error in deciding that fallbrook was liable for inverse condemnation.specifically,fallbrook contends that there can be no inverse condemnation because it filed a direct condemnation action the access easement was not intended for subdivision use fallbrook had a right not to grant a road easement for a subdivision and red mountain previously gave up the rights allegedly taken.
effect of the eminent domain action on the inverse condemnation action 
fallbrook asserts that once a public entity files a direct condemnation action,an inverse condemnation claim is subsumed into the direct action and may no longer be pursued.as authority for that proposition,fallbrook cites klopping city of whittier cal d,klopping and richmond redevelopment agency western title guaranty company d.richmond.fallbrook contends that the trial court error in allowing red mountain to pursue its inverse condemnation cause of action after fallbrook filed its direct condemnation action was prejudicial because it allowed for a double recovery of both inverse and direct condemnation.
preliminarily,we conclude that there was not a double recovery of damages.fallbrook double recovery argument is based on the fact that the parcel for which the jury awarded red mountain breach of condemnation damages of includes the parcel that fallbrook directly condemned,for which the jury separately awarded red mountain in the direct condemnation action.the trial court did not err in allowing these separate awards,as the two awards compensated red mountain for different losses that occurred at different times.the breach of condemnation award compensated red mountain for the diminution in value of the southerly acres that resulted from fallbrook refusal in august to grant the access easement as promised in the agreement.this award reflects the jury finding that without the access easement,the land could be used only as mitigation land.the jury eminent domain award compensated red mountain for the acres that fallbrook later directly condemned.the eminent domain award reflects the jury finding that on february,the agreed date of value in the direct condemnation action,the highest and best use of the directly condemned land was as mitigation land,which was consistent with its award of inverse of contract damages.if fallbrook breached its agreement to convey a personal easement,red mountain would be entitled to compensation for any diminution in the value of its land suffered in as a result of that breach,as well as just compensation for the direct taking of the land by eminent domain in.see shealy unified government of county,inverse condemnation claim by landowners against counties based on contamination of their property by landfill was not rendered moot by counties later direct condemnation of fee simple title,as damage alleged by landowners in form of diminution in value of their property caused by contamination occurred before the direct taking and,therefore,would not be recoverable in the eminent domain action city of lake station rogers,landowner should not be denied compensation for partial taking by inverse condemnation simply because the city later chose to take the entire fee simple.
neither klopping nor richmond precluded red mountain from pursuing its breach of condemnation claims after fallbrook filed its eminent domain action.applying former eminent domain statutes,richmond held that a property owner inverse condemnation was properly struck because it sought the same type of damages the property owner was required to seek by answer to the direct condemnation complaint and would have obtained as part of the eminent domain award.however,richmond was decided under obsolete eminent domain statutes that required the defendant property owner to allege the amount of damages claimed by reason of the taking in the answer to the eminent domain complaint.see richmond,supra,d at.in any event,richmond does not apply here because red mountain did not seek the same type of damages or compensation in its inverse condemnation cause of action that it could recover in fallbrook direct condemnation action.the inverse condemnation damages red mountain sought were for the diminution in the value of its land that occurred before fallbrook decided to bring the direct condemnation action.
klopping held that that as between a city eminent domain action and an inverse condemnation action involving the same property,the case that proceeds to judgment first is res judicata as to issues common to both actions and bars recovery in the other action of any damages that were or could have been recovered in the action that proceeded to judgment first.klopping,supra,cal d at.klopping is inapposite because fallbrook eminent domain action and red mountain inverse condemnation action were consolidated and proceeded to judgment together,and the two actions did not involve the exact same property,legal issues or damages.in any event,klopping does not support the proposition that an inverse condemnation action can not exist contemporaneously with an eminent domain action involving the same property.klopping contemplates separate,unconsolidated actions pending simultaneously,with one of the actions proceeding to judgment first and precluding a later judgment in the other action on the same issues.the trial court did not err in allowing both red mountain inverse condemnation action and fallbrook eminent domain action to proceed.
nature of the access easement 
fallbrook remaining three contentions as to why the trial court erred in finding inverse condemnation essentially amount to a single argument that fallbrook did not inversely condemn red mountain land because red mountain had no right to an access easement for purposes of a subdivision we reject fallbrook implied premise that as a matter of law,fallbrook refusal to grant the access easement referenced in the agreement damaged red mountain only if the easement was intended for subdivision purposes.fallbrook concedes that it agreed to grant an easement for the chaffin personal ingress to and egress from their property.whether fallbrook breached that agreement and,if so,whether red mountain suffered damages as a result,are questions of fact to be resolved on remand 
vi.evidence of damages 
fallbrook contends that the trial court committed reversible error by admitting evidence of speculative inverse condemnation damages.although we reverse the finding of inverse condemnation,we address this issue for the guidance of the trial court and the parties in the event of a retrial.see people neely cal th,d,code civ.fallbrook specifically objects to testimony by red mountain expert appraiser,robert backer,who presented four valuation analyses to the jury,two of which involved valuing the land that fallbrook directly condemned and calculating severance damages to the remaining red mountain ranch property.the fourth damage theory,entitled breach analysis,valued only red mountain southerly acres both before and after fallbrook refusal to grant the access easement.as noted,the jury adopted this damage analysis.
fallbrook contends that the trial court erred in allowing backer to present his breach analysis,his condemnation analysis that was based on red mountain having an approved tentative subdivision map for lots,and his condemnation analysis that was based on red mountain not having an approved map citing emeryville redevelopment agency harcros pigments,th,d emeryville,fallbrook maintains that these analyses were inadmissible because they constitute speculative evidence of damages based on specific plans of development.
the trial court has considerable discretion in determining the admissibility of valuation evidence in condemnation proceedings.city of san diego sobke th,d.accordingly,we review evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion.city of ripon sweetin th,d.as a general rule,a property owner may not value his property based upon its use for a projected special purpose or for a hypothetical business.citations.county of san diego rancho vista del mar,th,d.however,w hile a property owner may not generally present evidence of the value of his property in terms of money that the property would bring for a special purpose citation,evidence of a particular use may be relevant to establishing the highest and best use since such evidence may tend to establish the property adaptability for that kind of use citations.id.at,d.generally,evidence that condemned property is suitable for a particular purpose may properly be admitted when the highest and best use of the property is disputed or there is a dispute as to the feasibility of a particular use.emeryville,supra,th at,d people ex rel.of transportation tanczos th,d.
one of the main disputed issues at the trial in this case was the highest and best use of the subject property and,in particular,whether a subdivision development on the property was feasible.consequently,the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the jury to hear backer various valuations of the property based on red mountain evidence that that land was suitable for a subdivision development.in any event,following the directive of red mountain counsel in closing argument,the jury used backer breach analysis,which ignored the majority of red mountain property and awarded damages based only on use of the southerly acres as two ranch estates.backer testimony about this use of the acres was admissible highest and best use testimony it did not constitute testimony about a specific development plan,as it was not based on evidence of any specific plan for two ranch estates or any specific features of the hypothetical estates,such as location of the building pads or septic systems.backer simply valued the land as being generally useable for two large ranch estates.the court did not abuse its discretion in allowing backer valuation testimony 
vii.jury instructions 
fallbrook contends that the trial court incorrectly instructed the jury and erroneously refused to give certain instructions that fallbrook requested.

instructions given 
fallbrook first argues that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that it had to follow the court rulings from the first phase of the trial.the trial court erred in instructing the jury to follow its legal rulings only to the extent those rulings were erroneous.because we have addressed fallbrook challenges to the trial court legal rulings above,we will not further address those rulings in the context of alleged instructional error.
fallbrook next argues that the instructions the trial court gave regarding damages for breach of contract and inverse condemnation were erroneous because they did not instruct how those damages relate to just compensation in fallbrook direct condemnation action.fallbrook complains that the direct condemnation action required the jury to value the same land at issue in the breach of condemnation action and,therefore,the trial court should have given an explicit instruction that the jury could not award duplicative damages,and that awarding damages twice for the same loss is duplicative as a matter of law.
fallbrook argument is not so much a claim of instructional error as a legal argument that red mountain may not recover compensation for the diminution in value of its southerly acres as a result of any breach of contract by fallbrook in august,and also recover compensation for the portion of that land that fallbrook later directly condemned.as we discussed above,we reject this argument because the breach of condemnation award and the eminent domain award did not compensate red mountain twice for the same loss they compensated red mountain for different losses that occurred at different times.
instructions refused 
fallbrook contends that the trial court erred by refusing to give the following instructions that a plaintiff may not recover the same damages for both a breach of contract claim and a tort claim that are based on the same facts caci that the owner of the dominant estate must use its easement in such a way as to impose as slight a burden as possible on the servient estate that a sanitary easement is similar to a conservation easement that fallbrook was not obligated to grant the access easement if the jury found the requested easement would overburden fallbrook sanitary easement and reservoir and that the jury is not permitted to value the property with reference to what it was worth to the defendant for speculation or merely for possible uses baji.
failure to instruct with caci 
caci instructs that when a plaintiff has brought claims in both contract and tort against a defendant and the jury finds that the plaintiff has proved both claims,the same damages that resulted from both claims can be awarded only once.fallbrook argues that the trial court failure to give this instruction allowed the jury to improperly award duplicative damages for breach of condemnation and fallbrook direct condemnation.
preliminarily,the record does not clearly show that fallbrook requested that the trial court give caci.the only indication in the record that the trial court considered giving this instruction is a letter from fallbrook counsel to the trial court expressing fallbrook opposition to a proposed final judgment.in that letter,fallbrook counsel states that after discussing the issue of duplicative damages with both counsel,the court decided not to give caci since the court would ensure there would be only one award for damages.in any event,fallbrook was not prejudiced by the court refusal to give a duplicative damages instruction because the judgment does not award duplicative damages.as discussed above,the compensation the jury awarded red mountain for the land fallbrook directly condemned was not duplicative of the jury award of breach of condemnation damages.
failure to instruct that the owner of the dominant estate must use its easement in such a way as to impose as slight a burden as possible on the servient estate 
fallbrook contends that the trial court should have instructed the jury that the owner of the dominant estate must use its easement in such a way as to impose as slight a burden as possible on the servient estate,as stated in locklin city of lafayette cal th,d.this proposed instruction presumably concerns the access easement,not the sanitary easement,since fallbrook would have been the owner of the servient estate as to the access easement,if the easement had been granted.
fallbrook does not explain in its opening brief why the trial court rejection of this instruction was erroneous or how it prejudicially affected the verdict.the only argument on this point is in fallbrook reply brief,in which fallbrook asserts that t he jury was given no guidance as to what the fee owner could or could not do as compared to the rights of the easement holder.fallbrook presumably requested this instruction in connection with its theory that it was excused from its contractual obligation to grant red mountain an access easement under the agreement because red mountain intended use of the easement for a large subdivision would overburden fallbrook servient estate by threatening the reservoir.
the trial court properly refused to give this instruction,as it is argumentative and unduly emphasizes fallbrook overburdening theory.further,the subject matter of the instruction and the legal point fallbrook presumably intended it to convey regarding a dominant estate owner duty not to overburden the servient estate was substantially covered by the following portion of a special instruction the trial court did give overburdening an easement is defined as a use which unreasonably increases the burden on the servient estate and depends on the facts of each case.every easement includes the right to do such things that are necessary for the full enjoyment of the easement itself.but this right must be exercised in such a reasonable manner as to not injuriously increase the burden on the servient estate.italics added.fallbrook has not shown that the trial court prejudicially erred by refusing to give fallbrook proposed special instruction based on locklin.
failure to give requested instruction regarding the sanitary easement 
fallbrook contends that the trial court erred in refusing to give the following instruction,which includes the definition of conservation easement in the exact language of civil code section a sanitary easement is similar to a conservation easement and means any limitation in a deed will or other instrument in the form of an easement,restriction,covenant,or condition,which is or has been executed by or on behalf of the owner of the land subject to such easement and is binding upon successive owners of such land,and the purpose of which is to retain land predominantly in its natural,scenic,historical,agricultural,forested or condition.
the trial court properly rejected this instruction because the sanitary easement is not a conservation easement.the purpose of the sanitary easement is to enable fallbrook to patrol,control and maintain sanitary conditions in the easement area necessary and adequate to keep the water stored in the reservoir free from contamination from the surrounding watershed area and to enable fallbrook to comply with public health laws and regulations whether protecting the reservoir water and complying with public health laws require that fallbrook maintain the easement area predominantly in its natural,scenic,historical,agricultural,forested or condition was a disputed factual issue at trial fallbrook proposed conservation easement instruction would have effectively directed the jury to find,as a matter of law,that the sanitary easement imposed the same restrictions on red mountain use of the easement area that a conservation easement would have imposed.the trial court properly refused the instruction,as it is both argumentative and legally incorrect.
failure to instruct that fallbrook was not obligated to grant a subdivision access easement if the jury found that such an easement would overburden fallbrook sanitary easement and reservoir 
fallbrook contends that the trial court erred in refusing to give its proposed special instruction that states,in relevant part the chaffins have requested a road easement for a proposed development.fallbrook has refused to grant the road easement.if you find the requested road easement would overburden fallbrook s anitary e asement and reservoir,then fallbrook was not obligated to grant the easement to the chaffins.fallbrook argues that the trial court should have given this instruction because it is consistent with the sanitary easement and with civil code section.
civil code section concerns enforcement of conservation easements,and thus is inapplicable to this case.in any event,the essential point of the refused fallbrook was excused from granting the access easement if the easement would threaten the substantially and less argumentatively covered by the following special instruction that the court did give regarding fallbrook ability of performance fallbrook has the burden to show that performance of the contract was excused and the contract discharged because performance of the contract became impossible except at impractical,excessive,unreasonable expense or risk of injury not contemplated by the parties at the time the contract was made.this instruction,along with the instruction defining overburdening an easement,adequately conveyed to the jury that fallbrook was excused from performing its contractual obligation to grant the access easement agreement if the jury found that performance would overburden the sanitary easement and risk contamination of the reservoir.the court did not prejudicially err in refusing fallbrook special instruction.
failure to give baji 
finally,fallbrook contends that the trial court erred in refusing to give baji,which instructs the jury in an eminent domain case that it is not permitted to value the property with reference to what it was worth to the defendant for speculation or merely for possible uses fallbrook contends that it was error to refuse to give this instruction because the trial court allowed speculative testimony and evidence about red mountain uses of the property.we reject this contention in light of our conclusion that the evidence in question was not inadmissibly speculative rather,it constituted admissible evidence of the property highest and best use.moreover,the subject matter of the portion of baji in question was substantially covered by the following modified version of baji regarding severance damages,which the trial court gave in assessing the damages,if any,to the eminent domain defendant remaining property,caused by the project,you are not permitted to consider any factors that are speculative or imaginary,or any purely personal elements that do not affect the property fair market value.severance damages can,however,be based on any factor,resulting from the project,that causes a decline in the fair market value.damages are not to be enhanced for frustration of a proposed development which is speculative and conjectural.italics added.the trial court did not commit reversible instructional error in refusing to give baji.
viii.verdict form 
fallbrook contends that the trial court prejudicially erred by refusing to include fallbrook contract defense of impossibility or impracticability of performance in the special verdict form and by failing to ensure that the verdict form protected against duplicative damages.
the use of special interrogatories in a verdict form lies within the sound discretion of the trial court,and the court determination will not be disturbed on appeal absent a clear abuse of discretion.masonite pacific gas electric d.the trial court refusal to include specific questions about impossibility or impracticability of performance in the verdict form was not an abuse of discretion,nor was it prejudicial,because,as discussed above,the jury was instructed to find that fallbrook performance of the contract was excused and the contract discharged if fallbrook met its burden of proving that its performance became impossible except at impractical,excessive,unreasonable expense or risk of injury not contemplated by the parties at the time the contract was made.we presume that the jury followed the instructions it was given cassim allstate ins.cal th,d,and that it would not have found that fallbrook breached its agreement to grant the access easement if it had found that fallbrook performance was impossible or impracticable 
to the extent the court erred by not ensuring that the verdict form protected against duplicative damages,the error was harmless because,as discussed above,there was no award of duplicative damages.
ix.award of litigation expenses 
red mountain filed a motion to recover its litigation expenses,including expert and attorney fees,under code of civil procedure sections.red mountain sought expert witness fees in the amount of and attorney fees in the amount of,plus for bringing the motion.the court granted red mountain motion in its entirety.
code of civil procedure section provides in any inverse condemnation proceeding,the court rendering judgment for the plaintiff by awarding compensation shall determine and award or allow to the plaintiff,as a part of that judgment a sum that will,in the opinion of the court,reimburse the plaintiff reasonable costs,disbursements,and expenses,including reasonable attorney,appraisal,and engineering fees,actually incurred because of that proceeding in the trial court or in any appellate proceeding in which the plaintiff prevails on any issue in that proceeding.in awarding litigation expenses under this section,the trial court generally should apportion between attorney fees incurred in litigating the inverse condemnation claim and fees incurred with respect to other claims for which attorney fees are not recoverable,and award only the former.greater westchester homeowners city of los angeles cal d,salton bay marina,imperial irrigation,d.however,the trial court has discretion to award fees incurred with respect to a condemnation cause of action that is relevant to the inverse condemnation claim.salton bay marina,imperial irrigation,supra,d at.
