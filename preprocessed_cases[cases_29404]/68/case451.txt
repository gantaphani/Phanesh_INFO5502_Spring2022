gas transmission,northwest corporation petitions for review of federal energy regulatory commission ferc orders suspending,gas transmission,northwest,wl,and then rejecting,wl,reh g denied,wl,tariff filing,in which it sought to change its method for allocating natural gas transportation capacity.ferc claims that petition is moot because ferc later approved an alternative method of allocating capacity.we disagree.reaching the merits of the petition,we hold that ferc failed to adequately address relevant commission precedent and thus acted arbitrarily in denying filing.therefore,we grant the petition for review and vacate ferc orders and remand for further consideration in light of this opinion.
background 
operates a natural gas pipeline running miles from the border to the border between oregon and california.on its pipeline,sells two primary types of natural gas transportation and interruptible.firm capacity is purchased on a monthly basis and can not be interrupted or curtailed except in limited circumstances.interruptible transportation it capacity can be interrupted when necessary to provide service to higher priority customers,such as firm customers.it capacity is bid for as needed,rather than purchased monthly.gas tariff sets the maximum rates can charge for its it services.the total amount a shipper pays for service,and thus the revenue generated,is derived by multiplying the bid by the number of miles the gas is to be transported.
prior to the proceedings under review,allocated it capacity first to shippers bidding the maximum rate,regardless of distance,and hence regardless of revenue.then allocated any remaining capacity to shippers bidding less than the maximum tariff rate by ranking bids based on total revenue.ties between bidders,at both the maximum and rates,were broken according to a shipper position in the it queue.thus,if two shippers bids were tied,the shipper with the higher position in the queue would be allocated the it capacity.queue positions were determined by a lottery held by in.see pacific gas transmission,at,wl.
on march,submitted a tariff filing pursuant to section of the natural gas act,nga,seeking to change its it capacity allocation method.proposed to use the system it employed to rank rate bidders to rank bids from maximum rate bidders as well.under this or proposal,allocation would be based on net revenue generated per dekatherm,with net revenue being determined by multiplying the distance in pipeline miles from the receipt point to the delivery point by the rate bid plus surcharges.consequently,a maximum rate bidder would always defeat a maximum rate bidder,because the shipper total bid would always generate greater revenue.if any ties remained between bids generating the same net revenue,capacity would be allocated pro is,each tied bidder would receive a proportionate share of the remaining capacity.in sum,under filing,the it queue would be replaced with allocation followed by a pro rata tiebreaker.on march,the commission accepted and suspended ferc tariff filing,and asked to provide further justification as to the benefits gained by the pipeline and its shippers if such a change is implemented.gas transmission,northwest,at suspension order.filed additional supporting evidence for its proposal and sought rehearing of the suspension order,claiming that the suspension order improperly required to submit evidence of the unreasonableness of the it queue and the superiority of its proposed allocation mechanism.under nga,contended,a pipeline proposing a rate change need only prove that its proposed rate is just and reasonable.
on september,ferc rejected allocation proposal.gas transmission,northwest,wl i.the commission held that the mechanism would unduly discriminate against maximum rate shippers because maximum rate shippers could always outbid shippers for capacity,even though both would be bidding the same rate.id.at.b banning undue discrimination in the allocation of it capacity by reference to b.ferc explained that this result would contradict the commission policy of allocating capacity to those who value it most,since,at the maximum rate,both and shippers value the capacity equally.i,at.nonetheless,ferc realized that the it queue may be complex,inefficient,and administratively burdensome.id.at.thus,ferc did not preclude from submitting a later proposal to replace the queue,id.at,and ferc noted that it had accepted other methods of allocating capacity when shippers all bid the maximum rate,such as pro rata,id.at.finally,ferc rejected request for rehearing of the suspension order.id.at.the commission held that it was justified in seeking further evidentiary support for the relative benefits of mechanism in light of protesters concerns about discrimination against shippers.id.at.
shortly after ferc ruling in i,submitted a new tariff filing that replaced the queue with simple pro rata allocation among all maximum rate bidders.under that tariff,each maximum rate bidder receives a proportionate share of capacity regardless of revenue generated by its total bid,and thus regardless of distance.on october,ferc approved filing over the protest of some of it customers,relying on commission precedents accepting pro rata allocation and reasoning that pro rata allocation would eliminate the need for a complex queue and improve efficiency along the pipeline.see gas transmission,northwest,at,wl,reh g denied,wl ii subsequently implemented its pro rata allocation mechanism,and it remains in effect today.
meanwhile,requested rehearing of ferc i ruling,claiming that ferc failed to address several commission precedents that allowed allocation.on february,ferc denied request for rehearing.gas transmission,northwest,wl rehearing order.in the rehearing order,ferc attempted to distinguish the cases on which relied on the grounds that the cases do not address the issue raised here,but merely find that breaking ties at the maximum rate should be done in a nondiscriminatory manner.id.at.
timely filed this petition for review.
ii.analysis 
under nga,a pipeline proposing a rate change has the burden of showing that the proposed rate is just and reasonable.exxon ferc.if the pipeline meets that burden,ferc approves the rate regardless of whether there may be other rates that would also be just and reasonable.id.we will uphold ferc decision to reject a tariff filing unless it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.under this deferential standard,the commission must be able to demonstrate that it has made a reasoned decision based upon substantial evidence in the record.northern states power ferc,quotation omitted.in addition,the commission must have examine d the relevant data and articulate d a satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.motor vehicle mfrs.ass of united states,state farm mut.auto.ins,d quotation omitted.central claim is that ferc did not exercise reasoned decisionmaking when it rejected filing.before we reach the merits of contention,however,we first address whether this case is properly before us.
ferc claims that we should dismiss this petition as moot because ferc approved,and implemented,its pro rata allocation proposal after ferc rejected proposal.thus,ferc argues that allowing the mechanism would not provide with any relief because the pro rata mechanism has already replaced the queue and performs the same capacity allocation function the mechanism would perform.we disagree.a controversy persists over whether should be allowed to implement its preferred method of it capacity allocation.
article iii of the constitution limits federal courts to resolving actual,ongoing controversies.honig doe,d.to satisfy article iii case or controversy requirement,a litigant must have suffered some actual injury that can be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.iron arrow honor soc y heckler,d.ferc does not dispute that suffered an injury when the commission initially rejected its mechanism.rather,it contends that injury has been negated by the commission later acceptance of a different proposal for al
