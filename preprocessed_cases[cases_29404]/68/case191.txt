this case involves the belle fourche irrigation district method of assessing construction debt and operation and maintenance o m costs to the landowners in the district.concerned irrigators,a landowners association,and harold nelson and laurie barnaud,individual landowners,appeal the district court grant of summary judgment to the district.the appellants collectively,concerned irrigators argue that the district is violating both federal law,which requires construction charges to be equitably apportioned,and state law,which requires assessments to be made with regard to the benefit received.we affirm.
the united states bureau of reclamation constructed the belle fourche irrigation project in the early part of the twentieth century to deliver water to the arid lands of western south dakota.after its completion,the project was operated by the bureau.in,the belle fourche irrigation district,an organization formed by the landowners whose lands were irrigated by the project,took over the project operation and maintenance.
the district annually assesses the landowners within the district to cover each landowner share of construction debt and o m costs.over the years,the district and the bureau have entered into several different contracts that require,among other things,repayment of construction costs.four contracts are relevant to this dispute the contract,the keyhole contract,the contract,and the contract.
under the contract,those who owned less productive land were assessed at a lower rate for both construction debt and o m costs 
all assessments,tolls,or other charges against individual tracts in the district for the purpose of paying the district obligations shall be fixed for the different classes of land at such ratios as may be determined by the district board of directors provided,that all assessments shall be within the percentage ratios as follows,all ratios being based on a ratio of for class land 
class lands are the most productive class lands are the least productive.
in,the bureau and the district entered into a contract that allowed the district to receive water from the newly constructed keyhole reservoir in wyoming.the keyhole contract amended the contract to provide for payment of keyhole construction debt and keyhole o m costs.the assessment method for these charges was the same as the method provided in the contract.
the district board of directors proposed a different method of assessment in.under this proposal,the o m costs were to be assessed equally based on the number of irrigable acres owned.those who owned less productive land would no longer be assessed at a lower rate for o m costs.in addition,the ratios for the land classes,which would still be used to assess construction debt,were to change.after the board passed the resolution,it submitted the proposal to the landowners for a vote.of the eligible voters,voted,with in favor of the change.the district and the bureau then entered into a new contract in,which modified both the contract and the keyhole contract.the contract incorporated the new assessment method 
the assessments to pay annual operation,maintenance,and replacement costs and assessments for any and all special or reserve funds shall be assessed equally against all irrigable acres irrespective of land classification.all assessments,tolls,or other charges against individual tracts of land in the district for the purpose of paying annual construction installments due under all contracts shall be fixed for the different classes of land at such ratios as may be determined by the district board of directors provided,that all assessments shall be within the percentage ratios as follows,with all ratios being based on a ratio of for class lands 
in,congress enacted a law that designated the project as the belle fourche unit of the missouri basin program,allowing the project to benefit from the sale of hydroelectric power in the basin the purpose of the law was to modernize and improve the irrigation facilities in the district and to promote recreation and fish and wildlife preservation.the bureau and the district entered into a new contract in to establish a new repayment plan for construction debt.by its terms,the contract superseded the contract and a contract that is not relevant here.the keyhole contract was incorporated into the contract.the contract was not mentioned however,the district continued to assess the landowners in accord with its provisions.
today,the district assesses o m costs equally per irrigable acre,as provided by the contract.the district assesses construction debt proportionally based on land class,but whether it is using the ratios from the contract is not clear.
nelson and barnaud filed suit individually and on behalf of concerned irrigators,an association of class and landowners within the district.concerned irrigators alleged that the district method of assessment is improper and in violation of its contractual and statutory obligations.the district court found that the contract was valid,that the contract did not supersede the contract,and that the district assessment of o m costs complies with its contractual obligations.the court also found that the district assessment of construction debt complies with federal law.concerned irrigators appeals the court grant of summary judgment for the district.the district,arguing that the district court lacked jurisdiction to review the assessment rates.
citing flint united states,cir,the district argues that the authority to set assessments is a discretionary function of the bureau of reclamation and that the district court therefore lacked jurisdiction to review the assessment method.in flint,the ninth circuit held that the administrative procedure act precluded review of the secretary of the interior discretionary act of setting maximum o m charges because there were no meaningful standards against which to judge the action.at.here,concerned irrigators is challenging decisions made by the district,not by the secretary or the bureau.flint does not speak to the setting of assessments by a private irrigation district,and the district court did not lack jurisdiction to review the district method of assessment.
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo.richmond fowlkes,cir.we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,upholding summary judgment if there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.
concerned irrigators argues that the district equal assessment of o m costs and proportional assessment of construction debt does not comply with state law provisions requiring assessments to be made according to the benefit received see codified laws and.
the district need not assess the landowners according to the benefit received if its contract with the bureau requires a different method of assessment.south dakota law authorizes an irrigation district to assess in accord with the terms of its contract with the united states.codified laws the question we must answer,then,is whether the district contract with the bureau establishes a method of assessment.
under the contract,which modified the method of assessment found in the and contracts,the district assessed o m costs equally for each irrigable acre and construction debt proportionally,using new ratios for the different land classes.concerned irrigators argues that the contract is invalid for three reasons it was not judicially confirmed as required by federal law,it was not approved by a majority vote of the affected landowners as required by state law,and it was superseded by the contract.
federal law gives the united states authority to enter into repayment contracts with irrigation districts,but specifies that these contracts are not binding on the united states until the proceedings on the part of the district for the authorization of the execution of the contract with the united states shall have been confirmed by decree of a court of competent jurisdiction,or pending appellate action if ground for appeal be laid.even if the united states is not bound by the contract because it was not judicially con
