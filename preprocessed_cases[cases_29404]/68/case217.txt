the city of palos verdes estates city appeals the grant of summary judgment in favor of sprint pcs assets,sprint.we must decide whether the district court erred in concluding that the city violated the telecommunications act of tca,stat.codified as amended in various sections of titles,and,when it denied sprint permission to construct two wireless telecommunications facilities in the city public.specifically,we must decide whether the city denial is supported by substantial evidence,as required by c b iii,and whether the city denial constitutes a prohibition on the provision of wireless service in violation of a and c b i ii.because the city denial is supported by substantial evidence,and because disputed issues of material fact preclude a finding that the decision amounted to a prohibition on the provision of wireless service,we reverse and remand.
factual and procedural background 
the city is a planned community,about a quarter of which consists of public that were designed not only to serve the city transportation needs,but also to contribute to its aesthetic appeal.in and,sprint applied for permits to construct wireless telecommunications facilities wcf in the city public.the city granted eight permit applications but denied two others,which are at issue in this appeal.one of the proposed wcfs would be constructed on via azalea,a narrow residential street,and the other would be constructed on via valmonte,one of the four main entrances to the city.sprint acknowledged that it already served four thousand customers in the city with its existing network but stated that the proposed wcfs were nonetheless needed to replace its existing infrastructure.
a city ordinance ordinance provides that wcf permit applications may be denied for adverse aesthetic impacts arising from the proposed time,place,and manner of use of the public property.palos verdes estates,ordinances ch.b.under the ordinance,the city public works director director denied sprint wcf permit applications,concluding that the proposed wcfs were not in keeping with the city aesthetics.the city planning commission affirmed the director decision in a unanimous vote.
sprint appealed to the city council council,which received into evidence a written staff report that detailed the potential aesthetic impact of the proposed wcfs and summarized the results of a drive test,which confirmed that cellular service from sprint was already available in relevant locations in the city.the council also heard public comments and a presentation from sprint representatives.the council issued a resolution affirming the denial of sprint permit applications.it concluded that a wcf on via azalea would disrupt the residential ambiance of the neighborhood and that a wcf on via valmonte would detract from the natural beauty that was valued at that main entrance to the city.
denied permits by the director,the commission,and the council,sprint took its case to federal court,seeking a declaration that the city decision violated various provisions of the tca.the district court concluded that the city decision was not supported by substantial evidence and thus violated c b iii.this determination was premised on a legal conclusion that california law prohibits the city from basing its decision on aesthetic considerations.the district court also concluded that the city violated and c b i ii by unlawfully prohibiting the provision of telecommunications service,finding that the city had prevented sprint from closing a significant gap in its coverage.the city timely appeals.

iii.discussion 
the tension between technological advancement and community aesthetics is nothing new.in an book that would become a classic in city planning literature,vienna camillo sitte lamented 
t here still remains the question as to whether it is really necessary to purchase these technological advantages at the tremendous price of abandoning all artistic beauty in the layout of cities.the innate conflict between the picturesque and the practical can not be eliminated merely by talking about it it will always be present as something intrinsic to the very nature of things.
camillo sitte,city planning according to artistic principles rudolph wittkower,random house.
the tca attempts to reconcile this innate conflict.on the one hand,the statute is intended to encourage the rapid deployment of new telecommunications technologies,stat.on the other hand,it seeks to preserve the authority of state and local governments over zoning and land use matters.usa,city of anacortes,cir citation omitted.the tca seeks a balance by placing certain limitations on localities control over the construction and modification of wcfs.see a,c b.this appeal involves a challenge to the district court conclusion that the city exceeded those limitations.
section c b iii 
one of the limitations that the tca places upon local governments is that a ny decision to deny a request to place,construct,or modify personal wireless service facilities shall be in writing and supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record.c b iii.as we have explained,the upshot is simple this court may not overturn the city decision on substantial evidence grounds if that decision is authorized by applicable local regulations and supported by a reasonable amount of evidence.metropcs,city county of,cir thus,we must determine whether the city decision was authorized by local law and,if it was,whether it was supported by a reasonable amount of evidence.both requirements are satisfied here.
the city decision was authorized by local law.
w e must take applicable state and local regulations as we find them and evaluate the city decision evidentiary support or lack thereof relative to those regulations.metropcs,at.as noted above,the ordinance authorizes the denial of wcf permit applications on aesthetic grounds.also relevant for our purposes is the california public utilities code puc,which provides telecommunications companies with a right to construct wcfs in such manner and at such points as not to incommode the public use of the road or highway,cal.pub,and states that municipalities shall have the right to exercise reasonable control as to the time,place,and manner in which roads,highways,and waterways are accessed.id.the district court erred in concluding that the city consideration of aesthetics was invalid under the puc the california constitution gives the city the authority to regulate local aesthetics,and neither puc nor puc divests it of that authority.
california constitution 
the california constitution authorizes local governments to make and enforce within their limits all local,police,sanitary,and other ordinances and regulations not in conflict with general laws.cal.const.art.xi.california supreme court has explained that a city police power under this provision can be applied only within its own territory and is subject to displacement by general state law but otherwise is as broad as the police power exercisable by the legislature itself.fisher city of berkeley,cal d,quoting birkenfeld city of berkeley,cal d,see also.indem.of san joaquin county,cal th,d,state constitution provides city with general authority to exercise broad police powers.there is no question that the city authority to regulate aesthetics is contained within this broad constitutional grant of power.see landgate,cal.coastal comm n,cal th,d,aesthetic preservation is unquestionably a legitimate government purpose ehrlich city of culver city,cal th,d,a esthetic conditions have long been held to be valid exercises of the city traditional police power.
thus,the threshold issue is not,as sprint argues and the district court apparently believed,whether the puc authorizes the city to consider aesthetics in deciding whether to grant a wcf permit application,but is instead whether the puc divests the city of its constitutional power to do so therefore,the question actually before us is whether the city consideration of aesthetics is in conflict with general laws.cal.const.art.xi.a conflict exists if the local legislation duplicates,contradicts,or enters an area fully occupied by legislative implication.action apartment ass n,city of santa monica,cal th,d,citation and quotation omitted.local legislation is contradictory to general law when it is inimical thereto.id.citation and quotation omitted.absent a specific legislative indication to the contrary,we presume that there is no conflict where the local government regulates an area over which it has traditionally exercised control.see id.sprint has the burden of demonstrating that a conflict exists.see id.we conclude that neither puc nor puc conflicts with the city default power to deny a wcf permit application for aesthetic reasons.
the city consideration of aesthetics in denying sprint wcf permit applications comports with puc,which provides telecommunications companies with a right to construct wcfs in such manner and at such points as not to incommode the public use of the road or highway.cal.pub.to incommode the public use is to subject it to inconvenience or discomfort to trouble,annoy,molest,embarrass,inconvenience or t o affect with inconvenience,to hinder,impede,obstruct an action.the oxford english dictionary ed see also webster new collegiate dictionary ed.to give inconvenience or distress to.the experience of traveling along a picturesque street is different from the experience of traveling through the shadows of a wcf,and we see nothing exceptional in the city determination that the former is less discomforting,less troubling,less annoying,and less distressing than the latter.after all,travel is often as much about the journey as it is about the destination.
the absence of a conflict between the city consideration of aesthetics and puc becomes even more apparent when one recognizes that the public use of the is not limited to travel.it is a widely accepted principle of urban planning that streets may be employed to serve important social,expressive,and aesthetic functions.see ray gindroz,city life and new urbanism,fordham urb,a primary task of all urban architecture and landscape design is the physical definition of streets and public spaces as places of shared use.kevin lynch,the image of the city a vivid and integrated physical setting,capable of producing a sharp image,plays a social role as well.it can furnish the raw material for the symbols and collective memories of group communication.camillo sitte,city planning according to artistic principles rudolph wittkower,random house one must keep in mind that city planning in particular must allow full and complete participation to art,because it is this type of artistic endeavor,above all,that affects formatively every day and every hour of the great mass of the population.as congress and the california legislature have recognized,the public use of the roads might also encompass recreational functions.see,cal.pub.burying of power lines along scenic highways a regulation of billboards near highways necessary to promote recreational value of public travel and to preserve natural beauty.
these urban planning principles are applied in the city,where the public are the visual fabric from which neighborhoods are made.for example,the city staff report explains that via valmonte,which is adorned with an historic stone wall and borders a park,is cherished for its rural character,and valued for its natural,unspoiled appearance,rich with native vegetation.meanwhile,via azalea is described as an attractive streetscape that creates a residential ambiance.that the public use of these encompasses more than just transit is perhaps most apparent from residents letters to the director,which explained that they moved to palos verdes for its a esthetics and that they count on this city to protect its unique beauty with the abundance of trees,the absence of sidewalks,even the lack of street lighting.
thus,there is no conflict between the city consideration of aesthetics in deciding to deny a wcf permit application and puc statement that telecommunications companies may construct wcfs that do not incommode the public use of the.
nor does the city consideration of aesthetics conflict with puc statement that municipalities shall have the right to exercise reasonable control as to the time,place,and manner in which roads,highways,and waterways are accessed.cal.pub.that provision was added to the puc in to bolster the cities abilities with regard to construction management and to send a message to telephone corporations that cities have authority to manage their construction,without jeopardizing the telephone corporations statewide franchise.comm.on energy,utilities,and commerce,analysis of,reg,at cal see also id.i ntent of this bill is to provide the cities with some control over their streets.if the preexisting language of puc did not divest cities of the authority to consider aesthetics in denying wcf construction permits,then,a fortiori,neither does the language of puc,which only bolsters cities control.
aesthetic regulations are time,place,and manner regulations and the california legislature use of the phrase are accessed in puc does not change that conclusion in this context.sprint argues that the time,place and manner in which the are accessed can refer only to when,where,and how telecommunications service providers gain entry to the public.we do not disagree.however,a company can access a city in both aesthetically benign and aesthetically offensive ways.it is certainly within a city authority to permit the former and not the latter 
our interpretation of california law is consistent with the outcome in city of anacortes,in which we rejected a c b iii challenge to a city denial of a wcf permit application that was based on many of the same aesthetic considerations at issue here.city of anacortes,at.there,the city determined that the proposed wcf would have a commercial appearance and would detract from the residential character and appearance of the surrounding neighborhood that it would not be compatible with the character and appearance of the existing development and that it would negatively impact the views of residents.id.at.we noted that the city ordinance governing permit applications required the city to consider such factors as the height of the tower and its proximity to residential structures,the nature of uses of nearby properties,the surrounding topography,and the surrounding tree coverage and foliage.id.at.we stated that w e,and other courts,have held that these are legitimate concerns for a locality.id.citing,llc unified gov t of wyandotte county.city,cir cellular.town of oyster bay,cir.what was implicit in our decision in city of anacortes we make explicit now california law does not prohibit local governments from taking into account aesthetic considerations in deciding whether to permit the development of wcfs within their jurisdictions.
sprint warns that this conclusion will allow municipalities to run roughshod over wcf permit applications simply by invoking aesthetic concerns.however,our decision in no way relieves municipalities of the constraints imposed upon them by the tca.a city that invokes aesthetics as a basis for a wcf permit denial is required to produce substantial evidence to support its decision,and,even if it makes that showing,its decision is nevertheless invalid if it operates as a prohibition on the provision of wireless service in violation of c b i ii.nor does our decision constitute a judgment on the merits of the city decision in this case.our function is not to determine whether the city denial of sprint permit applications was a proper weighing of
