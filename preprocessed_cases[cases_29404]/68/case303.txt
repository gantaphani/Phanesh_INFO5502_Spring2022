petitioner fuel safe washington fsw seeks review of two orders by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc granting a certificate of public convenience and necessity cpcn to georgia strait crossing pipeline lp gsx,permitting gsx to build a new natural gas pipeline and ancillary facilities in northwest washington state,and denying requests for rehearing.fsw asks us either to vacate ferc final orders or,alternatively,to remand this matter to ferc for further proceedings.we decline to vacate ferc orders or remand for further proceedings.the petition for review is therefore denied.
background 
pursuant to the natural gas act,ferc has plenary jurisdiction over the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce the sale in interstate commerce of natural gas for resale for ultimate public consumption and companies engaged in such transportation or sale.b.see city of fort morgan ferc,cir.there is an exception from ferc jurisdiction,called the hinshaw amendment exception,which excludes from ferc jurisdiction a natural gas company activities if the company receives all gas within or at the boundary of a state all the natural gas so received is ultimately consumed within such state and the service of that gas,and the accompanying facilities and rates,are subject to regulation by the state.c see also city of fort morgan,at.
prior to constructing or operating any natural gas pipeline and related facilities,a company subject to ferc jurisdiction must obtain from ferc a certificate of public convenience and necessity,c a,indicating ferc determination that the proposed service is or will be required by the present or future public convenience or necessity.e.
as a part of its review process before issuing a cpcn,ferc conducts an environmental analysis under the national environmental policy act nepa,which prescribes the necessary process by which federal agencies must take a hard look at the environmental consequences of their proposed actions.lee air force,quoting utahns for better transp.dep t of,cir,modified,cir further quotation omitted.in contemplating major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment,agencies must prepare an environmental impact statement eis in which they consider the environmental impact of the proposed action and compare this impact with that of alternatives to the proposed action.id.quoting c.
on april,gsx applied for cpcns to construct and operate a natural gas pipeline and accompanying facilities in whatcom and san juan counties,washington.the proposed pipeline would 
carry gas east to west,from the canadian border near sumas,washington,overland across whatcom and san juan counties,washington,then underwater across the strait of georgia,to a subsea interconnection in the boundary pass at the international border between the united states and canada.the onshore facilities will consist of approximately miles of pipe,miles of pipe,a horsepower compressor station at cherry point,washington,and a receipt point meter station at the border near sumas.the offshore facilities will consist of approximately miles of pipe,with a subsea tap valve assembly near the san juan islands.
georgia strait crossing pipeline lp,at,wl footnote omitted.at sumas,the east terminus of the pipeline,the proposed line would interconnect with a canadian pipeline,westcoast energy and with a united states pipeline,northwest pipeline corporation.at its west subsea terminus,the pipeline would interconnect with a new pipeline to be built and operated by georgia strait crossing pipeline which would transport gas from the interconnection point to vancouver island,british columbia.while it was clear that the pipeline was primarily designed to transport canadian gas to canadian consumers on vancouver island,the system was designed from the beginning to permit as much as of its capacity to,at times,be transported through the northwest connection to united states markets gsx proposed that powerex,a british columbian corporation,would be the initial transportation service customer.
on june,ferc sent a notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed georgia strait crossing project,request for comments on environmental issues,and notice of public scoping meetings and site visit noi to interested parties.ferc held two public meetings in washington state and received comments on the proposed project throughout the summer of.
on december,ferc staff filed its draft eis deis with the environmental protection agency epa,announced it in the federal register,and mailed it to individuals and organizations on a mailing list created for the project.under council on environmental quality ceq regulations implementing nepa,the public had until february,to comment on the deis.the commission held another public meeting in washington on february,at which people made statements.the commission received comments on the deis from four federal agencies,five state agencies,five local agencies and elected officials,two native american groups,six companies and organizations,ten individuals,and the applicant,gsx.
meanwhile,the commission proceeded with its review of the aspects of the project.it published notice of gsx application in the federal register on may.parties filed motions to intervene.on march,ferc issued a preliminary determination,concluding that,subject to completion of the environmental review process,the benefits of the proposed project outweighed the potential adverse effects.none of the parties to this case requested a rehearing of the preliminary determination.on june,whatcom county filed a motion to dismiss gsx application,or alternatively seeking an evidentiary hearing,arguing that ferc lacked jurisdiction over the pipeline under of the nga because the gas supply sources and end consumers were canadian,and there was therefore no interstate transportation of the gas.on july,ferc issued the feis.following the issuance of the feis,ferc received further comments from two individuals,the epa,and the united states public health services,department of health and human services hhs.
on september,ferc issued a final order denying whatcom county motion to dismiss,analyzing the environmental issues and issuing a cpcn authorizing the construction and operation of the proposed pipeline.in that order,ferc responded to the comments made on the feis by the epa,hhs and the two individuals.whatcom county did not seek rehearing of the final order and fsw only requested rehearing of the environmental issues.the commission addressed the environmental issues in its rehearing order,and rejected fsw arguments.
on march,fsw petitioned for review in the ninth circuit.ferc filed a motion to dismiss on the ground of improper venue.on july,the ninth circuit transferred the case to this court and,on october,the commission filed the certified index to the record.georgia strait and powerex intervened in the proceedings before this court.meanwhile,on september,fsw had requested the commission to reopen the evidentiary record and prepare a supplemental eis.ferc denied the request.this petition for review followed.
discussion 
jurisdiction 
as indicated above,ferc has plenary jurisdiction over the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce.fsw argues that ferc improperly exercised jurisdiction over the proposed pipeline because the pipeline will not transport gas in interstate commerce.to the contrary,fsw argues,the gsx pipeline will transport only canadian gas to canadian consumers alternatively,fsw argues that the state of washington may properly regulate the pipeline because the pipeline is subject to the hinshaw amendment exception to ferc regulation.
ferc responds by arguing that,because fsw failed to challenge ferc jurisdiction in its rehearing request before the commission,fsw is precluded by statute from seeking review of that order in this court.ferc thus argues we lack jurisdiction to review the propriety of ferc exercise of jurisdiction over the pipeline.fsw replies that,while it admittedly failed to raise the issue of the propriety of ferc jurisdiction in its own petition for rehearing,whatcom county raised that issue in its motion to dismiss,ferc addressed the matter in its rejection of that motion,and the matter was therefore raised and addressed by ferc and is available for review in this court.we address first,as we must,our own jurisdiction to review ferc orders.
section b of the nga provides that n o objection to the order of the commission shall be considered by the court of appeals unless such objection shall have been urged before the commission in the application for rehearing unless there is reasonable ground for failure so to do.b.section b reflects the policy that a party must exhaust its administrative remedies before seeking judicial review.fed.power comm.interstate gas.this general rule of exhaustion,which fsw does not contest,has been consistently applied by our court and many others.as we have said,the presentation of a ground of objection in an application for rehearing by the commission is an indispensable prerequisite to the exercise of power of judicial review of the order on such ground.pan am.petroleum fed.power comm n,cir.we have further indicated that we must apply this statute punctiliously to carry out its purpose.colorado interstate gas ferc,cir quoting new jersey zinc ferc.
we have accordingly applied that exhaustion policy to refuse to address procedural matters which were not raised in petitions for rehearing before ferc.see,comm ferc,cir refusing to consider an objection to expert witnesses because not raised in petition for rehearing before ferc phillips petroleum fed.power comm n,cir refusing to consider whether a contract was renewed for purposes of obtaining a new rate because the issue was not raised in the petition for rehearing before ferc skelly oil fed.power comm n,cir refusing to consider arguments by amicus because not raised by any party on an application for rehearing as required by b of the act pan am.petroleum,at refusing to consider challenge to an order which was not challenged in a petition for rehearing.other courts have similarly applied b.see,comm.for the new river,ferc,refusing to consider whether commission adequately considered alternatives because not raised in petition for rehearing consol.gas supply ferc,cir noting that this rule of exhaustion of administrative remedies is particularly applicable when,as here,the objections are procedural and,if sound,subject to correction.
we have also applied the virtually identical rehearing requirement contained in the federal power act to refuse to consider whether the federal power commission properly determined that a petitioner had to obtain a license for a hydroelectric power project where the petitioner failed to seek rehearing at all.utah power light fed.power comm n,cir we have had no occasion to apply b rehearing requirement in the specific context of this,when the issue sought to be raised before our court,but not argued on rehearing before ferc,is whether ferc properly asserted its regulatory jurisdiction over the transportation of natural gas.fsw argues it may avoid the general rule of b in this case for two reasons its challenge to ferc jurisdiction is the equivalent of a challenge to ferc subject matter jurisdiction,which can always be raised,even sua sponte by the court itself and alternatively,whatcom county raised the issue before ferc and ferc addressed it,so the need to have the agency address the issue first has effectively been satisfied.
subject matter jurisdiction 
in support of this argument,fsw relies heavily on the eighth circuit decision in union electric federal power commission,cir,rev on other grounds,d.as more fully explained in judge mcconnell concurrence,the pertinent part of union electric is dictum and,in any event,is inapposite.section b requires all challenges to the scope of an agency regulatory jurisdiction to be raised first before the commission.see sunray oil fed.power comm n,d applying b requirement that all issues submitted for judicial review must be raised before the commission to refuse to address an argument that the commission order might violate the natural gas act and thereby impermissibly extend its regulatory jurisdiction intermountain mun.gas agency ferc,refusing to address,because not raised in the petition for rehearing,petitioner challenge to ferc interpretation of the hinshaw amendment to preclude exempting from ferc regulation a system which delivers gas that is subsequently transported temporarily out of state but returned for ultimate consumption within the state of delivery aquenergy,ferc,cir expressly responding to petitioner argument that the commission lacks jurisdiction because operation of the project does not affect interstate commerce and stating w e decline to consider this contention because it was not presented to the commission and w e will not consider a contention not presented to,or considered by,the commission.city of farmington ferc,in rejecting ferc argument that the court lacked jurisdiction to hear petitioner challenge to ferc decision that petitioner gas purchases were subject to ferc regulatory jurisdiction,the court did not rely upon the rule that subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time.
we therefore reject fsw argument that its challenge to ferc decision that the gsx pipeline fell within its regulatory jurisdiction is the equivalent of a challenge to ferc subject matter jurisdiction and accordingly not subject to the limitations of b.
whatcom county challenge to ferc jurisdiction 
fsw alternatively argues that,while it did not raise the issue in its own petition for rehearing,whatcom county raised it in its motion to dismiss gsx application,and ferc addressed it in its denial of that motion.most courts addressing this issue have required the party seeking review of a decision to have sought rehearing itself before the commission.see process gas consumers group ferc,t he party seeking review must raise its objections in its own application for rehearing to the commission.columbia gas transmission ferc,stating that a court can not consider an objection not raised by petitioner but argued to ferc by another party to the same proceeding united gas pipe line ferc,cir the plain language of section requires that the very party seeking judicial review must raise its objections in its own petition for rehearing.we join those courts and hold that fsw can not bootstrap its way into our court be relying upon the fact that another party argued the issue before the commission.
furthermore,even were we to permit such bootstrapping by fsw,whatcom county was obligated by statute to seek rehearing from the commission of its challenge to ferc exercise of its regulatory jurisdiction.it did not do so.fsw may not itself fail to preserve an issue,then take advantage of the fact that another party raised the issue but failed to properly pursue it by seeking rehearing,thereby allowing the decision below to effectively become final,and seek now to escape all of those defaults.we lack jurisdiction to consider whether ferc correctly determined that the gsx pipeline was subject to ferc regulation as an interstate pipeline.
ii.nepa compliance 
fsw did seek rehearing on the general issue of ferc compliance with nepa,asserting that ferc failed to so comply in various ways.we therefore address those arguments.we review agency action for compliance with nepa under the administrative procedures act apa.the apa empowers a reviewing court to hold unlawful and set aside final agency action,findings,and conclusions found to be arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.lee,at further quotation omitted.this is a deferential standard administrative determinations may be set aside only for substantial procedural or substantive reasons.id.further quotation omitted.
nepa delineates the process by which federal agencies take a hard look at the environmental consequences of a proposed agency action.pennaco energy,dep t of interior,cir further quotation omitted see robertson methow valley citizens council,d.before taking major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment,agencies take that hard look at potential environmental impacts by means of an environmental impact statement eis.see c.the eis evaluates the environmental impact of the proposed action,as compared with the impact of alternative courses of action.nepa does not impose substantive limits on agency conduct,pennaco energy,at further quotation omitted,nor does it require agencies to elevate environmental concerns over other valid concerns.lee,at.accordingly,w e apply a rule of reason standard essentially an abuse of discretion standard in deciding whether claimed deficiencies in a feis are merely flyspecks,or are significant enough to defeat the goals of informed decision making and informed public comment.utahns for better,at.
fsw argues that the feis in this case was deficient because it failed to adequately address four issues reasonable alternatives transboundary impacts cumulative acoustic impacts and the impact of reasonably foreseeable earthquakes.
consideration of alternatives 
nepa requires an feis to include a discussion of alternatives to the proposed action.c iii see also a requiring agencies to r igorously explore and objectively evaluate all reasonable alternatives,and for alternatives which were eliminated from detailed study,briefly discuss the reasons for their having been eliminated utahns for better,at.the consideration of alternatives to a proposed action is the heart of the environmental impact statement.lee,at quoting.however,the agency need not analyze the environmental consequences of alternatives it has in good faith rejected as too remote,speculative,or impractical or ineffective.all indian pueblo council united states,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in deciding whether an agency has adequately considered reasonable alternatives,courts look closely at the objectives identified in an eis purpose and needs statement.citizens comm.to save our canyons forest,cir.
fsw argues ferc discussion of reasonable alternatives was deficient in two ways the scope of the project arbitrarily abbreviated the alternatives analysis and ferc inappropriately eliminated alternatives it had evaluated.
scope of project 
an agency may not define a project so narrowly that it foreclose s a reasonable consideration of alternatives.davis mineta,cir.ferc described the scope or purpose of the gsx pipeline project as provid ing a transportation system for natural gas to supply the growing demand for natural gas on vancouver island and i n particular to transport natural gas to two new facilities on vancouver island.final envtl.impact statement georgia strait crossing project at,vol.iii.
fsw argues that ferc narrow definition of the project provide natural gas as a means to meet the increased need for electricity on vancouver it to ignore other ways to meet that need for electrical power.we disagree.in discussing a alternative,ferc discussed various other ways to increase electrical power on the island alternative fuels,technology,solar power,electricity,hydroelectric generation,and wave energy.the feis explained why each was not a feasible alternative.
the feis went on to observe that 
s everal commentators on the draft eis suggested that replacing or upgrading the underwater electric transmission cables serving vancouver island could reduce the need for electric generation capacity on the island and should be considered as an alternative to the gsx project.because the direct transmission of electricity to vancouver island does not meet the stated objectives of the proposed project to provide a transportation system for natural gas,consideration of replacing or upgrading the transmission cable can only be considered in terms of the alternative.if a project sponsor were to replace or upgrade existing cables or were to install new cables,demand for energy production on vancouver island could be reduced to the extent that the demand for natural gas could also be reduced.despite this fact,no such project has been proposed by potential sponsors.
feis at,vol.iii.ferc also noted that generating electricity on the mainland and replacing and upgrading its electric transmission cables would cost about cdn more than building the gsx project and generating electricity on vancouver island.id.as discussed more fully below,ferc then considered a number of different natural gas pipeline alternatives.
ferc had before it a particular project proposal by a private natural gas company,involving the building of a natural gas pipeline as a means to provide electrical power on vancouver island.where the action subject to nepa review is triggered by a proposal or application from a private party,it is appropriate for the agency to give substantial weight to the goals and objectives of that private actor.citizens comm.to save our canyons,at.ferc was not obligated to reject that project in favor of a gas alternative which was purely hypothetical and speculative.given that the agency is only obligated to consider reasonable,alternatives,we can not say that its review of gas pipeline alternatives,and rejection of them in favor of the gsx project,was arbitrarily and improperly restricted by its definition of the scope and purpose of the project.
reasonable route and system alternatives 
fsw next argues ferc completely failed to consider alternative canadian routes for the natural gas,and it failed to distinguish between alternatives that might have environmental impacts in canada but not the united states.fsw asserts that other agencies,namely the environmental protection agency epa and the washington state department of ecology wdoe,shared fsw concern that ferc discussion of alternatives was inadequate.
the draft eis deis identified three routes,two of which involved following parts of the centra pipeline,while the third involved following an existing bc gas pipeline for part of the route.the deis recommended no further consideration of these three routes because two of them presented engineering difficulties and more significant environmental impacts than the proposed gsx route the third alternative,the route,was environmentally acceptable but involved severe engineering problems because it crossed through terrain that was particularly vulnerable to seismic events,even moderate ones.
following the issuance of the deis,commissioned a study to determine the feasibility of expanding the existing canadian centra and bc gas systems to meet the objectives of the gsx project.these were considered alternative systems,rather than alternative routes,because they involved expanding existing pipeline systems,although there was some overlap with parts of the three routes which the deis had examined and recommended be removed from consideration 
the feis describes the five pipeline system alternatives the commission considered the existing centra,bc gas bc gas,arco,and cascade systems as well as the previously planned orca natural gas pipeline orca project.feis at,vol.iii.it concluded that expansion of the centra system,which already was the sole provider of natural gas to vancouver island,was not a viable alternative because it involved significant environmental and engineering drawbacks including the construction of large sections of looped pipeline through forested and mountainous terrain.feis at,vol.iii the bc gas system alternative was not viable because,although environmental concerns were a trade off compared to the gsx system,the geotechnical hazards associated with the bc gas alternative were more significant the arco system alternative was not viable because to provide the volumes of natural gas proposed by this system would require expansion and construction of new facilities similar to or greater than those proposed for the gsx project.id.at the cascade system alternative was not viable because a modification or expansion to accommodate the volumes proposed by would not be feasible.and the orca system alternative was not feasible because it would be over miles long,compared to the miles of the gsx project,would have greater onshore and offshore impacts and had recently been put on hold due to a lack of firm commitment from potential major customers.id.at.having concluded that these system alternatives,involving expansions of varying degrees of existing pipelines,were not viable alternatives,but were preferable environmentally to a completely new route alternative through canada,the feis concluded that none of the canadian alternatives was feasible.
the feis then examined one route alternative which passes through the united states,the stanwood to victoria route alternative.the feis concluded that,while the alternative did have some environmental advantages,those were offset by disadvantages.id.at.it therefore recommended no further consideration of the route.the feis also rejected the no action alternative,because the need for the project would not be fulfilled.
fsw argues that ferc ignored an important distinction between the gsx project and the system the gsx project will have impacts upon united states property while the canadian system alternatives will not.ferc discussion of the various alternatives explained why they were not reasonable viable alternatives.the fact that it selected a route with more impacts in the united states,rather than canada,does not undermine the reasonableness of that discussion.
fsw also argues that ferc ignored concerns expressed by two other epa and the wdoe.the epa submitted comments on the deis expressing its concern that the 
evaluation of alternatives in the draft eis appears to have been conducted more from the perspective of developing the rational for eliminating alternatives than from the direction of the implementing regulations for nepa to rigorously explore and objectively evaluate all reasonable alternatives,and to devote substantial treatment to each alternative considered in detail so that reviewers may evaluate their comparative merits.
epa comments on the gsx deis,vol.iii.in response to this,ferc expanded its discussion of several of the alternatives.the epa remained concerned about the discussion of alternatives 
while the discussion of alternatives has been expanded in the final eis,we remain concerned that the approach used to develop the eis has inappropriately eliminated reasonable alternatives,in both the united states us and canada,that could meet the stated purpose and need for the project.we do not believe that the eis has provided sufficient or compelling reasons for the elimination of alternatives presented in chapter.
letter from epa to ferc,vol.iv.
nepa requires agencies preparing environmental impact statements to consider and respond to the comments of other agencies,not to agree with them.custer county action ass garvey,cir.on the other hand,a reviewing court may properly be skeptical as to whether an eis conclusions have a substantial basis in fact if the responsible agency has apparently ignored the conflicting views of other agencies having pertinent expertise.mineta,at.
ferc noted in its certificate order granting gsx its cpcns that the epa does not challenge the need for the proposed pipeline,but prefers that this need be met by expanding an existing system.georgia strait crossing pipeline lp,at.ferc clearly considered and responded to epa comments on the deis and to its comments on the feis.as we have stated many times,nepa does not require any particular substantive result,just adherence to the process by which agencies take their requisite hard look.
ferc is obligated to articulate a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.friends of marolt park dep t of,cir quoting baltimore gas natural res.def.council,d.given our deferential standard of review,we conclude that the feis adequately considered alternatives and was not arbitrary or capricious in its selection of the gsx project.
transboundary effects 
nepa requirement that an feis analyze the environmental impact of a proposed action,c i,includes an analysis of direct,indirect,and cumulative effects.fsw argues that the feis failed to adequately examine the transboundary effects of the gsx pipeline project t hough ferc final eis contains a section entitled canadian impacts,ferc analysis in that section does not satisfy either nepa or ceq guidance.pet r opening br.at.fsw failed to challenge the alleged failure to consider transboundary effects in its rehearing request.accordingly,it is barred by b from raising that issue before us.see.interstate gas,at.refusing to consider an issue not raised in petitioner request for rehearing before the commission pan am.petroleum,at noting that t he presentation of a ground of objection in an application for rehearing by the commission is an indispensable prerequisite to the exercise of power of judicial review of the order on such ground emphasis added.
acoustic effects 
fsw argues that the feis failed to take a hard look at the project acoustic effects.more specifically,fsw argues that ferc failed to consider the acoustic effects of pipeline repair and maintenance failed to assess adequately acoustic effects before resources were committed to the project and failed to consider cumulative acoustic effects.
acoustic effects of repair and maintenance 
ferc considered the direct and indirect impacts of noise caused by the construction and operation of the pipeline on marine wildlife,marine fish,marine invertebrates and certain endangered species.it concluded that,to the extent information was available about the effects of noise on marine life,any increased noise would be temporary unlikely to cause significant adverse effects nonetheless,ferc recommended that gsx develop a plan for monitoring noise emitted by the pipeline,submit the plan for approval by the office of energy projects,and then report the findings.fsw does not challenge the adequacy of ferc analysis of the acoustic effects of the construction and operation of the gsx project.
fsw does allege,however,that the feis failed to consider the impact of noise caused by repair and maintenance of the pipeline,to the extent that the maintenance differs from the operation of the pipeline.ferc acknowledged that pipeline repairs are foreseeable even with proper installation,operation,and routine maintenance of the pipeline system,repairs to the pipeline,including replacement of portions of the system,are reasonably foreseeable actions in the long term.feis at,vol.iii.however,ferc then concluded that b ecause it is not possible to foresee where additional operation and maintenance activities would occur along the pipeline system,further review of the environmental impacts of those maintenance activities is beyond the scope of this eis.appropriate environmental review of those activities would take place under applicable rules and regulations.id.
after refusing to expand the scope of the eis to assess in detail the environmental impact of hypothetical future maintenance actions ferc briefly addressed maintenance issues,noting that m aintenance activities requiring pipeline excavation or replacement would be expected to be the same as those described for construction.feis at,vol.iii see also id.at.ferc also noted,in response to a comment on the deis,that emergency repairs within a waterbody are exceedingly rare.id.at.fsw charges that ferc conclusion that emergency repairs in waterbodies are very rare,and its discussion of the acoustic impacts of pipeline maintenance,are conclusory and unsupported by evidence in the record.we disagree.
the feis contains a section on pipeline accident data.the data show that pipelines are vulnerable to failure as a result of outside forces such as heavy equipment,earth movement,geologic hazards,and weather effects,all less likely to damage an underwater pipeline,as opposed to an underground pipeline.pipelines are also vulnerable to corrosion,construction and defects,and other causes of rupture or damage.because gsx is a subsidiary of the williams companies,ferc examined the pipeline safety record of the many miles of pipeline operated by williams and its subsidiaries.it found that since,williams northwest pipeline system has had two reportable leaks and twelve reportable ruptures the williams gas has had five reportable leaks and ten reportable ruptures there have been no incidents along the kern river gas transmission pipeline since,there have been five reportable incidents along the transco system and since there have been two reportable incidents along the texas gas system.given that the gsx pipeline portion that is in the water is less vulnerable to many of the outside forces described,it was reasonable for ferc to conclude that major repairs in the marine environment,along the fourteen miles of offshore pipeline in the gsx project,would be rare.
even as to impacts that are sufficiently likely to occur such that they are reasonably foreseeable and merit inclusion,the feis need only furnish such information as appears to be reasonably necessary under the circumstances for evaluation of the project.utahns for better,at.thus,d etailed analysis is required only where impacts are likely.id.further quotation omitted.the feis analysis of the likelihood of a major underwater repair was adequate,given the circumstances.
with respect to its conclusion about the acoustic effects of pipeline maintenance,ferc reached the reasonable conclusion that,while pipeline repairs and maintenance are foreseeable,it is impossible to determine now the precise impacts because it is impossible to determine now the magnitude of a future repair problem.to the extent,however,that a repair requires replacement of existing sections of pipeline,ferc reasonably assumes that the acoustic impact will be comparable to construction.
given our deferential standard of review,we can not say that the feis was deficient for failing to address further the acoustic effects of pipeline repairs and maintenance.
cumulative acoustic effects 
an environmental impact statement must analyze not only the direct impacts of a proposed action,but also the indirect and cumulative impacts.utahns for better,at further quotation omitted see also a.defines cumulative impact as follows 
cumulative impact is the impact on the environment which results from the incremental impact of the action when added to other past,present,and reasonable foreseeable future actions regardless of what agency federal or or person undertakes such other actions.cumulative impacts can result from individually minor but collectively significant actions taking place over a period of time.
fsw argues ferc failed to analyze cumulative effects in three respects the cumulative acoustic effect of the project in light of noise already in the marine environment the cumulative acoustic effect of the project in light of reasonably foreseeable future projects and the pipeline cumulative environmental effect in the marine environment in light of past,present and reasonably foreseeable future actions.
cumulative acoustic effect in light of background marine environment noise 
fsw argues ferc failed to properly analyze the additive effect of both constant pipeline operation and intermittent pipeline repair,construction,maintenance noise sources in combination with vessel traffic and other stressors already in place in the marine environment.pet r opening br.at.this is simply another way of challenging ferc analysis of the noise impact caused by the gsx project.we have already concluded that ferc analysis of the impact on the marine environment of the construction,operation and maintenance of the project is reasonable and not arbitrary or capricious we decline fsw invitation to revisit that issue,under the guise of discussing the cumulative acoustic effect of the pipeline in the existing marine environment.
cumulative acoustic effects in light of reasonably foreseeable future projects 
cumulative effect is defined as the incremental impact of the action when added to other past,present,and reasonably foreseeable future actions.fsw claims ferc analysis of the cumulative effects of the gsx project and other reasonably foreseeable actions in the same geographic vicinity is cursory and conclusory.
the feis contains a table listing existing or proposed activities cumulatively affecting resources of concern for the pipeline project.table,feis at,vol.iii.it lists present activities and reasonably foreseeable future projects which may affect,inter alia,marine resources.the only reasonably foreseeable future projects affecting marine resources are the construction and operation of the canadian portion of the gsx project,which would involve miles of offshore pipeline in the strait of georgia the opalco pipeline project,involving constructing a lateral off the pipeline and requiring eleven miles of offshore pipeline and the gateway pacific terminal,a deepwater marine terminal facility south of the cherry point refinery the feis contains the following summary of the likely cumulative acoustic impact of those projects 
visual and acoustic disturbances associated with pipeline construction and operation may add to other commercial,public,and recreational vessel disturbances to affect marine mammals,fish,birds,and invertebrates.the magnitude of the impact would probably be insignificant relative to the total marine environment available to,and used by,these species,particularly given the nature of the construction activities.
feis at,vol.iii.
while we do not consider the cumulative acoustic impact analysis of the feis to be a model of clarity or thoroughness,custer county action ass n,at,given our deferential standard of review,we find it sufficient.ferc reasonably concluded that the primary acoustic impact on marine resources will occur during the construction of the gsx pipeline and any other projects,should they be built.this is a limited time period.additionally,many marine inhabitants are mobile and can avoid the area while any construction takes place further,operational acoustic impacts are minimal and are generally less than those caused by vessels in the area.any repair impacts will be intermittent and similar to construction impacts,except in the rare event that some catastrophic failure occurs.
our job is not to question the wisdom of the agency ultimate decision or its conclusion concerning the magnitude of indirect cumulative impacts.envtl.coalition dombeck,cir.rather,our job is to examine the administrative record,as a whole,to determine whether the agency made a reasonable,good faith,objective presentation of those impacts sufficient to foster public participation and informed decision making.id.at.we conclude that ferc discharged its duty to take a hard look at the cumulative acoustic impacts of the gsx project along with other reasonably foreseeable projects in the same area 
cumulative environmental effects 
fsw argues the feis devoted insufficient attention to the cumulative effects of the gsx project along with the other current and reasonably foreseeable actions and activities.we disagree.while the feis analysis is again not a model of thoroughness,custer county action ass n,at,we again find,applying our deferential standard of review,that it is adequate and not arbitrary or capricious.see feis at,vol.iii.
reasonably foreseeable earthquakes 
finally,fsw argues that ferc failed to evaluate the consequences of all reasonably foreseeable earthquakes,in part by relying upon an inappropriate standard,the uniform building code,to identify what earthquakes are reasonably foreseeable,which,in turn,led it to fail to provide a meaningful mitigation analysis.
the feis states as follows concerning the standard used to design the pipeline to withstand earthquakes has designed the pipeline to withstand ground motions associated with an earthquake with a percent probability of exceedance in years equivalent to a recurrence interval of in years.this is common practice for buildings as summarized in the uniform building codes international conference of building officials.feis at,vol.iii.ferc responds that gsx correctly designed the pipeline to meet current engineering design standards,as set out in three different building guideline systems,as well as in accordance with the minimum federal standards for the transportation of natural and other gas by pipeline.
fsw complaint about the ubc is that it provides an inaccurate standard for identifying reasonably foreseeable earthquakes.it argues the ubc uses a standard of a ten percent chance of potential failure over the next fifty years,which,fsw asserts,is far too low a standard and fails to id
