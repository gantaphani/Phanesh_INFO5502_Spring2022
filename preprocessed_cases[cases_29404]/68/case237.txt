in this case,we consider another piece of the california energy crisis puzzle before us are petitions for review from the california independent system operator and pacific gas and electric company pg e,alleging that the federal energy regulatory commission ferc committed various errors in permitting to certain settlement statements.we dismiss the petitions for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.we conclude that we lack subject matter jurisdiction to consider petition for review because it implicates ferc prosecutorial discretion.we conclude that we lack subject matter jurisdiction to entertain pg e petition for review because it is an impermissible collateral attack on a prior ferc order 
these are two more cases in a series of cases concerning california energy crisis,which occurred from.we have provided a history of the crisis in other opinions,see,at,so it is unnecessary for us to detail it here except as necessary to explain our reasoning.see also cal.ex rel.lockyer ferc,cir summarizing the history of the california energy crisis and ferc response.
in brief,with the goal of converting california,regulated utilities to a deregulated,competitive market,the california legislature enacted assembly bill ab.act of september,cal.legis.serv.codified at cal.pub.under ab,the major,vertically integrated utilities were required to divest a substantial portion of their power generation plants to unregulated,producers.after divesting the generation assets,the utilities were required to sell all of their remaining to the california power exchange calpx,a nonprofit wholesale clearinghouse created by ab.calpx,which was deemed a public utility pursuant to the federal power act fpa,see e,and thus subject to regulation by ferc,see b,d,was to provide a centralized auction market for trading electricity.
ab created another nonprofit entity,the california independent system operator,also subject to ferc jurisdiction,which was to be responsible for managing california electricity transmission grid and balancing electrical supply and demand.although the utilities continued to own the transmission facilities,exercised operational control over the grid.
to maintain the necessary balance,was authorized,and,during the california energy crisis,often required,to purchase energy.it purchased two types of energy uninstructed imbalance energy,which it used to balance the electrical grid,and operating reserves,or ancillary services capacity,which a seller agreed to hold in abeyance in case of a shortage or other emergency.when it purchased operating reserves,paid the seller full fare,even if it did not ultimately need the reserved energy.
energy purchases led to two distinct problems.first,after a investigation,discovered that fourteen entities may have been selling single units of energy as both uninstructed imbalance energy and operating reserves from april,to september.if true,those entities doubled billed because they received two payments for a single unit of energy one payment for uninstructed imbalance energy,and another for operating reserves,even though no energy was actually reserved.
second,made some of its energy purchases in the form of energy exchange transactions,in which paid for the energy needed to balance the electricity grid in kind,rather than in cash.in a typical transaction,a seller would supply with energy to balance the grid,and would repay the the next two units of energy for every one unit provided.the energy exchange transactions proved difficult for because it was required,as a non profit corporation,to keep a neutral cash balance,and the energy exchange transactions led to accounting imbalances.when received energy as part of an exchange transaction,it showed a positive balance.when,however,paid for the energy,it showed a negative balance.to remedy these imbalances,implemented a neutrality adjustment charge,which spread the costs incurred in balancing the electricity grid among all market participants,even if individual entities bore no responsibility for those grid imbalances.
following deregulation and the creation of calpx and,certain energy providers were alleged to have manipulated the california energy market through a variety of means,resulting in artificially inflated energy prices.in august,san diego gas and electric company sdg e filed a complaint under of the federal power act,a,against sellers of energy and ancillary services in the calpx and markets.sdg e requested that ferc impose a price cap on sales into those markets.other parties,including pg e and the state of california,joined the complaint.
on august,ferc issued an order denying the relief requested by sdg e,but determining that it was appropriate to investigate the justness and reasonableness of the rates for all sales in the calpx and markets.san diego gas,et,wl august,order.therefore,it established its own investigatory proceeding in ferc docket nos.and the remedy proceeding.ferc also initiated a hearing regarding energy prices in california.see,am.power serv.
as part of the refund proceeding,ferc established a mitigated market clearing price mmcp,which estimated what the market price for energy would have been in a competitive market.see san diego gas,at.ferc then ordered to rerun past settlement statements,which are invoices,to reflect what they would have been had consumers been charged the mmcp,enabling ferc to calculate the refunds owed to california consumers.see id.at.
before conducting the that ferc ordered in the refund proceeding,sought to perform a preliminary to eliminate the effects of double selling,the neutrality adjustment charge,and other errors in its settlement procedure.the preliminary would have given the appropriate baseline against which to complete the.
proposed tariff amendment number amendment to remove any obstacles to its completing the preliminary.ferc conditionally accepted amendment,subject to submitting a compliance filing that provided further detail about the scope and effects of the proposed tariff amendments.cal.indep.operator.provided more detail about amendment,and ferc approved the majority of proposed amendments on november.cal.operator,wl november order.these petitions for review stem from the portions of amendment that address the double selling and neutrality adjustment charge problems.
to address the double selling problem,proposed to amend its operating tariff to permit recision of double payments made between april,and september.ferc rejected the proposal,noting that this proposed adjustment concerns the double selling issue set for hearing in the enron strategy show cause proceedings.november order,at.ferc refused request for rehearing,noting that the proposed changes to the tariff would have address ed more transactions,more parties,and a longer time period than specified in the commission show cause proceedings.cal.operating,at february order.more specifically,ferc rejected proposed tariff amendment because it 
proposes to address the time period of april,to september,and encompass ten other entities that were not covered in the show cause proceeding.in the show cause proceedings the commission determined that the relevant time period was january,to june,to explore certain gaming issues,including double selling.also,in the show cause proceedings the commission investigated and determined there was only enough evidence to proceed with four parties on the double selling issue.we reject the attempt to use the adjustment in this docket to expand the transactions covered under the show cause proceedings.we find that the show cause proceedings are the proper forum to resolve disputed legal and factual issues related to alleged double selling.therefore,we will reject the adjustment to rescind payments for ancillary services and we will deny the request for rehearing on this issue.
id.at.petitioned for review in this court.
to address the fact that the neutrality adjustment charge accounting method unfairly charged all market those who had no hand in the energy the deficits shown on books,sought to settlement statements using the total negative uninstructed imbalance energy accounting method.under that method,only those p
