this case arises primarily out of the stresses involved in a shift from one system of regulatory ratemaking to another.
for many years the oil pipeline companies owning and operating the trans alaska pipeline system taps charged shippers rates based on a settlement agreement between them initially six of the carriers,but ultimately all eight and the state of alaska.alaska anticipation of royalties and tax receipts gave it a stake in the matter the shippers in the early years,by contrast,were largely affiliates of the pipeline companies,and so had little adversity of interest.the taps settlement agreement tsa established the taps settlement methodology or tsm,a ratemaking methodology to be used for computing interstate rates until,the end of the pipeline then projected useful life.although no shippers joined the agreement,the federal energy regulatory commission,by this time the agency with authority to regulate oil pipeline rates under the interstate commerce act,et ica approved it as fair and reasonable and in the public interest.g see trans alaska pipeline system,ferc,taps i pipeline system,ferc,taps ii.the commission order left shippers free to later protest rates as unjust or unreasonable.taps ii,ferc at.in practice,the tsm governed the pipeline interstate rates through.
but when the carriers filed rates for and,alaska and two shippers anadarko petroleum for both years,tesoro corporation for protested.alaska,exercising rights it preserved in the tsa,alleged that the proposed rates violated the and provisions of the ica,as they were higher than the intrastate rates set by the regulatory commission of alaska rca.the shippers argued that the rates were unjust,unreasonable,and otherwise unlawful.the commission responded by scuttling the tsm.instead it applied a methodology that it had developed for oil pipeline ratemaking generally in williams pipe line,ferc opinion.
stated in very general terms,the commission orders found the rates filed for and to be unjust and unreasonable,but not discriminatory or unduly preferential.though deciding that the just and reasonable rates would be below the rates,it limited refunds,in accordance with of the ica,to the difference between the and filed rates and the prior unchallenged rate.bp pipelines alaska,ferc opinion bp pipelines alaska,ferc first rehearing order bp pipelines alaska,ferc second rehearing order.
the carriers assert a host of methodological errors in these decisions we are unpersuaded.alaska seeks relief against the commission refusal to provide remedies for the alleged price discrimination we find that even if there was discrimination,alaska has not made the showing necessary to justify reparations.the commission also issued a number of orders that either have not jelled in clear enough form for judicial review or present an undue likelihood of piecemeal review we find these unripe.
we review ferc orders under the familiar standard for agency actions we must set them aside if they are not supported by substantial evidence or are arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.
commission use of rate base balances from the tsm era.in calculating the maximum just and reasonable rate for service after,it is obviously important to know how much of the rate base essentially the pipeline initial capital cost the carriers had recovered as of december.a just and reasonable rate would allow it to recover thereafter only such sums as it had not recovered before.the carriers had recovered accelerated depreciation under the tsm,and the commission found that they should use the amounts so calculated to determine the unrecovered balance as of the end of.the commission rejected their contrary use depreciation figures shown in their filings of ferc form,the carriers annual financial the simple ground that it would enable them to receive benefits related to accumulated depreciation more than one time.opinion,p.see also id.p.the carriers assert before us that there is also no when opinion is consistently applied,as the carriers presentation did,joint pet.br.at.while their submission,see prepared rebuttal testimony of robert van hoecke,indicates that revenues received under the tsm were less than the hypothetical revenue flow under opinion,it does not show why this required the commission to recharacterize tsm return of capital as something different for purposes of estimating the rate base balance.
instead,they claim that ferc ruling violates their right not to have the tsa used as precedent against right enshrined,as we just saw,in the commission approval of the tsa and in our arctic slope decision affirming that approval.see arctic slope regional corporation ferc.in a slightly different variant of the same point,they say that the shippers,because they were not parties to the tsa,can not benefit from it.
but ferc use of the rate balances created by the tsa operation is not a precedential use of the tsa.since,the carriers have justified the rates that they charged shippers based on an accelerated depreciation schedule.it makes no difference what the cause of the carriers having characterized a portion of their rates in this manner may have tsa,the tax implications,rolling dice.the past is what it was.for the commission to rely on those justifications to determine how much of the rate base has been recovered is not arbitrary and capricious.
our rejection of the carriers claims here encompasses not only those claims related to accelerated depreciation but two additional categories that appear to be functionally equivalent.one of these is million in previously disputed costs that the carriers amortized under the tsa.the second is deferred return.this is a sum annually extracted from the inflation component of the nominal rate of return on equity and added to a capital account and then amortized over the capital item remaining life.opinion explains the method and provides a helpful mathematical example.see williams pipe line,ferc at opinion pp.the carriers do not claim that the commission has in any way removed from the rate base amounts added thereto and not amortized by the end of under the tsm deferred return system.rather,at least judging from their briefs before the commission which are clearer than the ones filed with us,the claim is that the commission should have assumed a recovery of deferred return altogether different from what actually happened under the tsm.see initial brief of the taps carriers before the commission at reply brief of the taps carriers before the commission at.we see nothing arbitrary in the commission rejection of these claims.
starting rate base.the carriers contend that as part of using opinion methodology,they are entitled to a of their rate base.the claim arises out of the transition from ferc regulatory approach and the methodology it adopted in that opinion.in the era,the commission had used a valuation rate base,an arcane formula representing primarily a weighted average of original and reproduction costs.see farmers union central exchange ferc.opinion replaced the valuation system with a trended original cost methodology toc,which was to apply to all pipelines,new and old.to enable pipelines that had previously used the valuation method to make a smooth transition and to protect the reasonable expectations of their investors,opinion provided that such pipelines would be entitled to a increase of their rate base.ferc.see also lakehead pipe line company,ferc.in the current proceeding ferc refused to allow the taps carriers any comparable.
ferc never approved rates for the taps pipeline.opinion,p.to be sure,the carriers filed rates between and using valuation methodology,see trans alaska pipeline system,icc,establishing interim rates for taps using valuation methodology,but in fact,as the carriers own expert witness joseph kalt acknowledged,the rates finally adopted were based on the tsm,which called for a toc methodology akin to that specified by opinion.see opinion,p.accordingly,by the time of the tsa any reasonable investor would have abandoned any hopes in the valuation methodology.thus,neither the transition theory nor the intere
