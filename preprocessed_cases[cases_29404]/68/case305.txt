at issue in this case is the application of the federal communication commission fcc cable television inside wiring rules under an agreement which grants an incumbent cable provider,time warner,a license to maintain the cable wiring its predecessor installed within an apartment complex,the atriums.the atriums argues that the license is limited to the wiring currently being used to provide cable television services,and therefore that it may invoke an fcc regulation which requires the incumbent cable provider to sell,abandon,or remove wiring the incumbent cable provider no longer has an legally enforceable right to maintain.see.the district court agreed,finding that the license between time warner and the atriums did not extend to wiring not in use providing cable services,and accordingly that the atriums could invoke the regulations against time warner.exercising jurisdiction under,we affirm.
in april,joseph tutera,representing the atriums,a retirement complex,entered into a license agreement with telecable of overland park telecable,time warner predecessor,to provide cable television to the atriums.the atriums and telecable now time warner executed the standard license agreement,without change according to the agreement time warner received the right,license and permission to install,operate and maintain the equipment necessary to provide catv and pay tv services to the atriums tenants.i app.at.by the contract terms time warner retains property ownership of the equipment installed.
pursuant to the agreement,time warner installed a cable distribution system at the atriums.there are three general parts to a cable distribution system.first,there is the riser,a large cable that runs into the building through a utility closet on the ground floor,and up through utility closets on each of the floors.next runs the home run wiring at issue in this litigation,which consists of wires that run from the riser through the hallway ceilings on each floor and toward each individual apartment.finally,there are home wires approximately twelve inches outside each apartment the home run wiring becomes home wires there is no physical demarcation between home run wires and home wires.the home wires run into each individual apartment unit.see.
in june,the atriums sent a letter to time warner,stating that it intended to allow everest midwest licensee everest,which received a franchise to provide telecommunication services in overland park in the summer of,to compete with time warner in the provision of cable television and high speed internet services in the atriums.to accomplish this goal,the atriums demanded time warner elect to abandon,sell,or remove its home run wires in the atriums which were not currently being used by time warner subscribers,pursuant to recently enacted fcc regulations,specifically b.section b states 
where an mvpd multichannel video programming distributor owns the home run wiring in an mdu multiple dwelling unit and does not or will not at the conclusion of the notice period have a legally enforceable right to maintain any home run wire dedicated to an particular unit on the premises against the mdu owner wishes,the mdu owner may permit multiple mvpds to compete for the right to use the individual home run wires dedicated to each unit in the mdu the incumbent mvpd will then have to provide a single written election to the mdu owner as to whether,for each and every one of its home run wires dedicated to a subscriber who chooses an alternative provider service,the incumbent mvpd will remove the wiring and restore the mdu building consistent with state law abandon the wiring without disabling it or sell the wiring to the mdu owner.if the mdu owner refuses to purchase the home run wiring,the mdu owner may permit the alternative provider to purchase it.if the alternative provider is permitted to purchase the wiring,it will be required to make a similar election for each home run wire solely dedicated to a subscriber who switches back from the alternative provider to the incumbent mvpd.
in its letter invoking b,the atriums expressed hope that time warner would agree to sell the home run wiring to everest,as it perceived that such an outcome would facilitate the ability of tenants to switch from time warner to everest and vice versa on a seamless basis.i app.at.time warner refused,arguing that an mdu owner may invoke the regulations only when the incumbent provider lacks a legally enforceable interest in maintaining the home run wires on the property.claiming that it retained a legally enforceable interest,time warner relied on its interpretation of the license agreement between the atriums and time warner,which stated,in part,that 
subject to the terms and conditions hereinafter set out,owner the atriums hereby grants to telecable time warner the right,license and permission to install,operate and maintain such of the facilities as telecable time warner deems necessary or desirable in or on the owner the atriums property and in the project in order to provide catv and pay tv services to tenants in the project.telecable time warner shall have the right to enter the project at any time to perform maintenance on and make repairs and replacements of the facilities,or any part thereof,and to install or disconnect customers.
i app.at.as a result,time warner concluded that under the license agreement it retained a legal right to maintain all of its home run wiring.under this interpretation of the agreement,the atriums could allow everest into the building to construct its own cable services facilities,lay its own wiring however,time warner was not obligated under b to abandon,sell,or remove its home run wiring in the atriums.
time warner proceeded to file suit in federal district court in july,seeking a declaratory judgment that b did not apply to its home run wiring in the atriums specifically,time warner maintained that it had a preexisting,legally enforceable right to maintain its wires on the property.time warner also requested a preliminary injunction preventing the atriums from invoking the regulations.the parties agreed to consolidate the hearing on time warner preliminary injunction motion with a hearing on the merits.time warner entertainment,lp atriums partners,lp,d.on november,the district court denied the request for the preliminary injunction and found that time warner had a legal right only to the home run wires running to apartments of current time warner subscribers.id.at.for the home run wires running to apartments of,the district court found that the atriums could invoke b,thereby requiring time warner to abandon,sell,or remove those home run wires.id.at.time warner appeals.
because the federal home run wiring regulations only apply if an incumbent provider no longer has a legally enforceable right to maintain its home run wires in an mdu,our interpretation of the license agreement necessarily implicates whether the federal regulations apply in this circumstance.however,in addition to analyzing the license agreement between time warner and the atriums,we must also interpret the federal regulations in order to determine if the regulations apply to the facts before us.the fcc regulations contain two provisions potentially relevant to the home run wiring at issue the provision and the provision.see a b.under either of the two home run wiring provisions,time warner is not obligated to abandon,sell,or remove its home run wiring if it has a legally enforceable right to either remain on the premises in the context or maintain any particular home run wiring in the context.id.accordingly,we begin with an analysis of the license agreement between time warner and the atriums,followed by an analysis of the federal regulations at issue.

the atriums argues on appeal that our interpretation of the contract should be informed by three factors time warner drafted the agreement the agreement was a contract of adhesion and the anticompetitive nature of time warner interpretation of the agreement is against the public interest.therefore,the atriums urges,we must read the agreement narrowly,any ambiguity should be construed strictly against time warner,and the agreement should be liberally construed to favor the public.addressing the interpretation of the contract between time warner and the atriums,the district court noted that its construction was informed by those factors.first,the district court found,because time warner drafted the license agreement,any ambiguity found therein must be construed strictly against time warner.second,because there was essentially no competition in the cable services market when the atriums signed the licensing agreement,the district court concluded that the contract was an adhesion contract,which also required that the agreement be strictly construed against time warner.last,because this license agreement affected the public interest,the court liberally construed the contract to favor the public.

not only does this contract involve the interpretation of a license granted to a public franchise in this case,the contract implicates the atriums right to avail itself of regulations promulgated by the fcc to encourage competition amongst cable services providers in the mdu market.see purposes of cable regulations.the fcc estimates that as of,thirty million americans resided in mdus,and there were approximately mdus in the united states.inside wiring,wl at,to be codified at pt.final rule.moreover,when the city of overland park licensed time warner,it considered in its franchise grants whether the franchise provide s to the residents of the city a useful and desirable service for the benefit of the public welfare of the residents.i app.at.finally,both the everest and time warner franchise grants are subject to city regulation of the services provided and rates charged.see,i app.at i app.at.given this evidence,we conclude that this contract affects the public interest and where appropriate,we will construe it accordingly.
the atriums contends that under such a reading the license agreement granted time warner only the right to provide cable television to a tenant therefore,if time warner is not actually providing cable television to such tenant,it retains no legally enforceable right to maintain any wiring to that tenant residence.time warner counters that,when read as a whole the license agreement is unambiguous and grants time warner a legally enforceable right to maintain all of its home run wires at the atriums,regardless of whether the home run wires are currently in use by time warner to provide cable television to tenants.
with respect to the question of whether time warner retains a legally enforceable right to maintain its home run wiring at the atriums,the following clauses of the license agreement between time warner and the atriums are particularly relevant 
telecable time warner desires to install,operate and maintain its cable,junction boxes,and other facilities incidental or related to the provision of its services to tenants in the project the facilities in order to serve those tenants of owner the atriums who shall from time to time pay telecable time warner for its services 
owner the atriums recognizes that the provision of telecable time warner of cable television and pay tv service to tenants in the project is of benefit to owner the atriums,and accordingly,owner the atriums is willing to grant the license and permissions hereinafter set forth 
now,therefore,the parties hereto agree as follows 
subject to the terms and conditions hereinafter set out,owner the atriums hereby grants to telecable time warner the right,license and permission to install,operate and maintain such of the facilities as telecable time warner deems necessary or desirable in or on the owner the atriums property and in the project in order to provide catv and pay tv services to tenants in the project.telecable time warner shall have the right to enter the project at any time to perform maintenance on and make repairs and replacement of the facilities,or any part thereof,and to install or disconnect customers.
it is agreed that the facilities installed by telecable time warner in the project or elsewhere on owner the atriums property shall be and remain the sole and exclusive property of telecable time warner and shall be treated as personal property of telecable time warner for all purposes.
these considerations in mind,we must determine whether time warner retains a legally enforceable right under its license agreement to maintain all of its home run wiring in the atriums.the district court relied in part upon section c of the premises of the license agreement,which states 
telecable time warner desires to install,operate and maintain its cable,junction boxes,and other facilities incidental or related to the provision of its services to tenants in the project the facilities in order to serve those tenants of owner the atriums who shall from time to time pay telecable time warner for its services.
i app.at.accordingly,the district court concluded that the license granted time warner the right to maintain its facilities only when it was providing service to a tenant.reasoning that provide does not mean that time warner can store its wires in anticipation of offering services to new tenants,the district court determined that provide limits time warner rights to only those home run wires currently in use by time warner subscribers.time warner,d at.as a result,the court determined,time warner simply has no license pertaining to the home run wires running to apartments not currently subscribing to time warner cable television services.in addition,the district court reasoned that the phrase in order to serve those tenants of owner who shall from time to time pay time warner for its services is ambiguous and best resolved against time warner to refer to tenants who periodically pay monthly time warner for its services.id.finally,the district court concluded that while time warner maintains ownership of unused wiring,its license extends to the provision of cable services because time warner clearly has no right to provide cable services to tenants who have not requested such services,its ability under the license agreement to maintain facilities in order to provide service extends only to current subscribers of time warner.id.at.
on appeal,time warner contests the district court interpretation of the license agreement on three main grounds the agreement is unambiguous the clear language supports time warner interpretation of the agreement and the district court interpretation results in absurdity.first,time warner argues that the agreement is not ambiguous,and that the parties intent is easily determined in the context of the entire agreement that intent,time warner contends,was to grant time warner a license to maintain all of its home run wiring in the atriums,including unused home wiring,in anticipation of offering its services to tenants in the future.bolstering its argument that this interpretation reflects the parties intent as measured when the agreement was entered into in,time warner draws our attention to the fact that for the fifteen years following its entry into the agreement,the atriums allowed time warner to maintain all of its home run wires,regardless of whether the particular apartment tenant was a current subscriber.however,this objection ignores the atriums contention that time warner was the only available cable services provider in overland park when the agreement was signed therefore,the atriums could not have sought to allow another provider to buy or use time warner home run wires to provide cable service in the building.also notable is the fact that everest was granted a license to offer cable services in overland park only a year before the atriums sought to introduce everest as a competitor to time warner in the building.as a result,we consider time warner argument that the atriums fifteen year acquiescence in time warner exclusive provision of cable services as inconclusive evidence of the parties intent 
second,time warner argues that the clear language of the agreement granted it the right to operate and maintain such facilities as necessary or desirable for time warner to be able to provide cable services to the tenants of the atriums.because the agreement clearly contemplated that time warner would retain ownership of the wiring and was given access to maintain those facilities,and because,according to time warner,numerous provisions in the license agreement contemplate that it would not be continually supplying cable services to all units,it insists that the agreement unambiguously grants it a legally enforceable right to maintain all the home run wires.the district court interpretation,time warner stresses,improperly emphasizes the phrase in order to provide service at the expense of the other clauses of the agreement.in fact,time warner insists that in order to provide was a mere descriptive clause which can not reasonably be read to limit the term of the license granted.appellant br.at.
we disagree to the contrary,the license agreement purpose is clearly stated in the premises section of the agreement,the atriums grants time warner a license in order to provide cable television services.see license agreement c telecable time warner desires to install,operate and maintain facilities incidental or related to the provision of its services to tenants in order to serve those tenants of owner the atriums who shall from time to time pay telecable time warner for its services and d owner the atriums recognizes that the provision of cable television and pay tv service to tenants is of benefit to owner the atriums,and accordingly,owner the atriums is willing to grant the license and permissions hereinafter set forth,i app.at.the installation and maintenance of the cable wiring is expressly incidental and related to the primary purpose of the provision of cable services to tenants of the atriums.indeed,in order to serve those tenants who shall from time to time pay telecable seems best read to mean that the license is limited to the maintenance of wiring related to the provision of cable services to current time warner subscribers.we are simply not persuaded that the district court was incorrect in focusing on the primary purpose of the provision of cable its analysis 
next,time warner argues that the district court interpretation of the contract leads to absurdity in that the logical conclusion of its reading is that time warner license vanishes each time a tenant moves out,a tenant cancels its subscription with time warner,or a tenant chooses a competing cable service.not only do we disagree with time warner that the district court interpretation of the contract is absurd we consider it to be the most reasonable interpretation.first,the license agreement explicitly provides time warner access to the atriums during transition periods such as the installation or cancellation of services.telecable time warner shall have the right to enter the project at any time to install or disconnect customers.license agreement,i app.at.thus,the license anticipates that subscriptions to cable services will be periodically entered into and cancelled,and provides for that eventuality.if time warner had a right to enter the atriums at any time to maintain unused wires,it would be unnecessary to include a clause that ensured that it had access to the atriums to start and stop service,for time warner could simply enter at any time to maintain any wiring.moreover,the installation clause makes perfect sense when the agreement is read as the district court indicated,to wit,that time warner license to maintain the wires extends only to those wires which are currently in use to provide cable television services,and that the installation clause extends the license granted to time warner to enter the building to those periods required to start and stop service 
further,subsection c of the license agreement conditions the installation,operation,and maintenance of cable wiring on the provision of cable services.see license agreement,c,i app.at.the installation,operation,and maintenance of the wiring is for the sole purpose of serv ing those tenants who shall from time to time pay time warner for its services.id.nothing in this clause,or any other clause of the agreement,implies that time warner has a license to install,operate,or maintain wiring for any purpose other than providing cable television services,nor is there any indication that time warner could refuse to provide cable television services,yet continue to maintain its wiring.in fact,section of the license agreement reiterates that the license is granted in order to provide catv and pay tv services to tenants of the atriums.license agreement,i app.at.
additionally,time warner is required,under the new fcc regulations,to sell,abandon,or remove home run wiring which it lacks a legally enforceable right to maintain.see a b.as a result,under our reading of the license agreement,should a tenant cancel service with time warner,time warner would have to sell its lines to a competitor similarly,if the tenant then cancelled its subscription with a competitor,and wished to subscribe with time warner,that competitor would then be obligated to sell the lines to time warner under the regulations we recognize that the fcc regulations were not in existence at the time the parties entered into the agreement however,as demonstrated above,the license itself anticipated that time warner right to enter the premises would be conditioned on whether it was actively providing service to a particular unit.we observe only that our interpretation of the agreement,even following the promulgation of the fcc regulations,results in a logical and tenable outcome.
finally we note that time warner interpretation suffers from the same fault it attributes to the present reading specifically,it reads clauses of the agreement out of existence.under time warner reading,it would retain a license to maintain home run wiring even if it was providing no cable television services to any resident of the atriums,or if it were to lose its franchise rights in overland park.time warner interpretation would therefore read out of the agreement the phrases facilities incidental or related to the provision of its services to tenants in order to serve those tenants who shall from time to time pay time warner for its services,in order to provide catv and pay tv services to tenants.license agreement c,i app.at emphasis added.
we conclude that the overriding purpose of the license agreement was the provision of cable television services to the residents of the atriums any interpretation of the license agreement which would allow the license to continue without the provision of cable services is directly contrary to the purpose of the agreement and must be disfavored.consequently,we agree with the district court that the license agreement grants time warner a legally enforceable right to maintain its home run wiring to a particular unit only when time warner is providing cable services to that unit.
having decided that the district court interpretation of the license agreement was correct,we turn to whether the district court properly interpreted the fcc home run wiring regulations to deny time warner request to permanently enjoin the atriums from invoking the procedures outlined in b.we review the district court interpretation of federal regulations de novo,united states brown,cir,applying general rules of statutory construction,beginning with the plain language of the regulations.valley camp of utah,babbitt,cir,see also,aspenwood investment martinez,cir.as with statutory construction,in interpreting regulations,we strive to construe the text so that all of its provisions are given effect and no part is rendered superfluous.apwu,potter,cir.additionally,a regulation must be interpreted in such a way as to not conflict with the objective of its organic statute.joy technologies,sec.of labor,cir.
to set the proper stage for our analysis,we review briefly the context under which the federal regulations were enacted.the home run wiring regulations at issue were developed under the auspices of the cable television consumer protection and competition act,stat,which instructed the fcc to promulgate rules which would enable consumers to utilize the wiring with an alternative multichannel video delivery system and avoid any disruption the removal of such wiring may cause.at.see i directing the fcc to prescribe rules regarding the disposition of cable wiring upon termination of cable service.the new rules were intended to foster opportunities for multichannel video programming distributors mvpds to provide service in multiple dwelling unit buildings mdu by establishing procedures regarding how and under what circumstances the existing cable home run wiring would be made available to alternative video service providers.fcc first order on reconsideration and second report and order,in the matter of telecommunications services inside wiring implementation of the cable television consumer protection and competition act of cable home run wiring,cs docket,mm docket,wl,at,fcc second report definitions.moreover,the rules were adopted for the purpose of facilitating competition between and among mvpds.competition is welcome.fcc second report at.
to foster competition,the home run wiring rules establish the procedures used to require the sale,removal,or abandonment of home run wiring in mdu where the incumbent provider no longer has an enforceable right to remain in the building or serve particular units,and the mdu owner intends either to terminate service by the incumbent for the entire building or to allow more than one mvpd to compete to use the home run wiring on a basis.id.at a b.the new home run wiring rules also require that a fter the effective date of this rule,mvpds shall include a provision in all service contracts entered into with mdu owners for the disposition of any home run wiring in the mdu upon the termination of the contract.d.thus,the rules attempt to remove an impediment to competition among cable providers in multiple dwelling reluctance of mdu owners to allow the installation of multiple home run wires by alternative cable service providers in their buildings due to concerns regarding aesthetics and possible property damage,disruption and inconvenience to residents,and space constraints.see final rule at.by facilitating the entry of new providers into mdu communities the cable inside wiring rules are intended to advance congress directive to provide a,national policy framework to encourage the provision of advanced information technologies and services to all americans.fcc second report at.
section of the cable inside wiring rules addresses the disposition of home run wiring.the rule is divided into two parts disposition of home run wiring subsection a,and disposition of home run wiring subsection b.under a,the section,a multichannel video programming distributor mvpd,which does not have a legally enforceable right to remain on the premises against the wishes of the multiple dwelling unit mdu building owner,must upon receiving notice from the mdu that it intends to invoke the procedures of this section,either remove all the home run wiring inside the mdu,abandon the home run wiring without disabling it,or sell the wiring to the building owner.a.thus,the home run wiring regulations allow a building owner under an exclusive contract with a single incumbent provider to contract with a new cable services company to provide exclusive services to the entire building if the incumbent provider no longer has a legally enforceable right to remain on the premises.under such circumstances,the incumbent,who is no longer providing cable service to the building,has the option of selling,abandoning,or removing its home run wires.
under the section,b,the same options regarding the home run wiring are found the mvpd must remove,abandon,or sell its home run wiring.this subsection varies only in that the mvpd obligation is triggered when it receives notice from the mdu if the mvpd does not have a legally enforceable right to maintain any particular home run wire dedicated to a particular unit on the premises against the mdu owner wishes.b emphasis added.thus,under this provision,the owner could choose to allow competition among mvpd for the right to provide service in an individual unit,if the incumbent has no right to maintain the home run wire running to that particular unit.under this regulation more than one cable services provider will be present and competing within an individual building.
the relevant issue for our purposes is whether b provisions should apply in this case,given our conclusion that time warner does not have a legally enforceable right to maintain home run wiring to units to which it does not provide cable service.one federal district court has addressed a similar situation.although its conclusion is not binding on us,we consider it in some detail.in csc holdings,the district court for the southern district of new york found that as long as a provider retains the right to service so much as one customer in the building the home run wiring a b are inapplicable.csc holdings,westchester terrace at crisfield,et al,d.applying this logic to the case before us,time warner argues that because it retains a license to provide cable services to current subscribers,the atriums can invoke neither the nor home run wiring regulations.
to support its conclusion that the home run wiring regulations do not apply in situations where the incumbent cable provider retains the right to service at least one subscriber in the building,the csc holdings court relied upon paragraph of the fcc report and order and second further notice of proposed rulemaking in the matter of telecommunications services inside wiring,wl,fcc,fcc second further notice.see csc holdings,d at.paragraph reiterates the explicit reservation contained in the regulations,specifically that the home run wiring provisions will not apply where the incumbent provider has a contractual,statutory or common law right to maintain its home run wiring on the property.fcc second further notice at application of procedural framework.in addition,the report states that the fcc adopt s specific procedural mechanisms requiring the sale,removal or abandonment of the home run wiring where the mdu owner terminates service for the entire building and wishes to use the home run wiring for an alternative video service provider,or wants to permit more than one multichannel video programming distributor mvpd to compete for the right to use the home run wiring on a basis.fcc second further notice at.the correct interpretation of this language,according to csc holdings,leads to the conclusion that neither the or regulation applies,even against the mdu owner wishes,as long as the incumbent has a legal right to maintain its home wiring to any subscriber,because the incumbent maintains the right to remain on the premises under either provision.
we disagree with this conclusion.the plain language of a b demonstrates that under a,the provisions apply when the cable provider does not have a legally enforceable right to remain on the premises emphasis added while under b,the provisions apply when the cable provider does not have a legally enforceable right to maintain any particular home run wire dedicated to a particular unit,emphasis added.in our view,the csc holdings reading conflates these two provisions.taken to its logical conclusion,if the mvpd has a right to remain on the premises to serve even one cable subscriber,a building owner may invoke neither provision of the regulations.under such an interpretation,moreover,the provision would apply only when the mvpd has lost any right to remain on the premises.this reading contravenes the specific language of b and reads the language of a into b.as noted above,we interpret the language of regulations as we construe the language of statutes accordingly,we must read the regulations such that every word is operative.see potter,at finley united states,cir stating that we must construe statutes in such a manner that every word has some operative effect.as a result,we reject the csc holdings interpretation limiting to only those circumstances where the incumbent provider has been,or will be imminently,ejected from the building.
more convincing,in our view,is the district court interpretation of the regulations in the instant case we agree that under the regulation,where the incumbent provider retains a right to remain on the premises,the regulation can not by its terms be invoked.this conclusion is amply supported not only by the plain language of a a provisions apply when the cable provider does not have a legally enforceable right to remain on the premises emphasis added,but is also supported by the fcc second further notice,which makes clear the distinction between the and context.specifically,it states i n the context,the procedures will not apply where the incumbent provider has a legally enforceable right to maintain its home run wiring on the premises in the context,the procedures will not apply where the incumbent provider has a legally enforceable right to keep a particular home run wire dedicated to a particular unit on the premises.fcc second further notice at.this distinction is again reiterated in the fcc discussion of the procedures applicable in mandatory access states.id.at.
thus,it is apparent that the fcc did not intend to divest an incumbent cable operator of its right to service customers in the building by allowing building owners to invoke the regulations to eject the incumbent and install another competitor,with exclusive rights to service the entire building,when the incumbent still retained a legal right to service the building.rather,the regulation applies only when the incumbent no longer retains a legal right to service any customer in the building in that circumstance,the building owner becomes free to negotiate with other cable providers and enter into an agreement allowing a new provider the right to convert the entire building to a new service provider.fcc second further notice.
the regulation,however,is not intended to be limited only to situations where the incumbent provider no longer has a legal right to service any customer in the building.the fcc discussion of the procedures for the disposition of home run wiring bolsters this conclusion.fcc second notice at.the report explains that the underlying purpose of the procedures regulating the disposition of home run wiring is to promote competition and consumer choice by bringing order and certainty to the disposition of the mdu home run wiring upon termination of service.id.at.when discussing the disposition,the report instructs that the regulation allows an mdu owner to permit competition in the building for the right to use the individual home run wires dedicated to each unit.id.at.after the mdu owner has informed the incumbent cable service provider of its decision to invoke the regulations,the incumbent provider must 
make a single election for how it will handle the disposition of the individual home run wires whenever a subscriber wishes to switch video service providers the election will then be implemented each time an individual subscriber switches service providers.if the mdu owner permits the alternative service provider to purchase the home run wiring,the alternative service provider will be required to make a similar election for any home run wiring that the alternative provider subsequently owns and that is solely dedicated to a subscriber who switches back from the alternative provider to the incumbent.
id.at.consequently,under the regulations,once an mdu owner has properly notified an incumbent cable service provider,which does not have a legally enforceable right to maintain its home run wiring to any particular unit on the premises,of its intention to allow competition in the provision of cable services in the building,the incumbent cable services provider must make a determination of how it will dispose of the home run wiring remove the wiring,abandon the wiring,or sell the wiring.
notably,the incumbent provider election is not effective immediately as to all of the incumbent home run wiring rather,the home run wiring will be disposed of,according to the incumbent election,as the need arises,as individual tenants elect to terminate cable service with the incumbent and begin service with the alternative cable provider.see b second further notice at.further,the alternative provider must also make an election as to the disposition of any home run wiring it may own thus,if the incumbent sells to the alternative provider,the alternative provider must decide how it will dispose of the home run wiring it owns should any of its subscribers terminate service and,for example,resume service with the incumbent.see d.under this scenario,the fcc anticipated that in the context,individual subscribers would have the opportunity to switch from the incumbent provider to the alternative provider,but that this transition would not be mandatory,nor would the entire building be switched simultaneously.it follows that the regulation anticipates that the incumbent provider may still be providing services in the building,contemporaneously and in competition with the alternative provider.this differs from the provision,which does not contemplate continued cable service from the incumbent provider,but addresses the complete cessation of service by the incumbent,to be replaced by an alternative service provider.
explaining further the precise process contemplated in the regulations,the fcc second further notice clarifies the difference between the context and the context.incumbent providers,under the option,will not be expected to remove,abandon,or sell all of their home run wiring once the building owner has chosen to allow competition.id.at.instead,the report notes that the incumbent,if it has chosen to remove its home run wiring,will have only seven days following notification by the subscriber that the subscriber intends to terminate service in favor of an alte
