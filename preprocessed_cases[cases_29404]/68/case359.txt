this case arises from the reorganization of the electric transmission grid in the state of california,the subsequent imposition of administrative fees by the california independent systems operator iso,and the of those fees by pacific gas and electric pg e to its customers.the decision of the federal energy regulatory commission ferc or commission to approve the fees and has been challenged by several large customers of pg western area power administration,northern california power agency,sacramento municipal utility district smud,city of santa clara,and modesto irrigation district together existing customers as well as the cogeneration association of california and the energy producers and users coalition together cogen.the petitioners argue that the commission acted arbitrarily and capriciously in approving fees that violated ferc principles and imposed new fees for existing services,in violation of the doctrine.
we uphold the commission order against both sets of challenges.cogen petition to this court was untimely.subject matter jurisdiction over challenges to a ferc order is limited to petitions that are filed within days of the challenged order.b.because cogen did not file its petition within that time frame,we can not review its merits.while we have jurisdiction over the petition of the existing customers,we find that the commission did not act arbitrarily or capriciously in its approval of the california iso fees or the pg e.we therefore uphold the decision of the commission.
background 
in,ferc inaugurated a brave new regulatory world with order.east kentucky power,ferc.this order was p romulgated in response to the anticompetitive effects of vertical integration where generation of electricity and transmission of electricity was controlled by the same entity.id.at.the order attempted to increase competition in the electricity business by requir ing the functional unbundling of wholesale generation and transmission services.id.quotation marks omitted.we have described order as follows 
if vertical integration the predecessor to functional unbundling offered a prix fixe menu of utility services,functional unbundling required the a la carte alternative under the new system,previously integrated utilities were now required to maintain a wholesale marketing function separate from their transmission functions 
in addition to the unbundling requirements that it imposed,order encouraged,but did not demand,the formation of regional transmission organizations rtos entities that could manage all transmission services for a particular region ferc suggested a further improvement to the novel system it envisioned the rto would cede operational control of its collectively run transmission facilities to an iso,which would have no financial interest in generation services and therefore no incentive to thwart ferc goals of efficiency,competition,and improved reliability.
as the commission was implementing order,the state of california chartered the california iso as an independent entity that would take over transmission operations from california utilities.sacramento mun.util.dist.ferc.upon taking over the transmission grid,the california iso would provide transmission services on a nondiscriminatory basis.prior to the transition to the iso,the three major e,southern california edison,and san diego gas had operated its own control area,performing the coordination,administrative,and maintenance duties needed to operate a reliable power system.contracts between pg e and the existing customers,collectively referred to as the control area agreements,date to the time when pg e held responsibility for its control area.upon the creation of the california iso,the utilities became participating transmission owners in the new system by turning over control of their transmission facilities to the iso.after that transition,certain services contracted for by the existing customers in the control area agreements with pg e were provided by the california iso.
in,the california iso filed its original proposed grid management charge which was designed to recover its,administrative,and operating costs.letter from charles robinson,general counsel,california iso,and edward berlin,swidler berlin shereff friedman,to david boergers,secretary,ferc,at,reprinted in joint appendix ja.this charge was assessed on a monthly basis against all iso scheduling entities that are responsible for scheduling electricity deliveries through the iso.id.under the new system,pg e has been the scheduling coordinator for the existing customers for all relevant time periods.
in november,the california iso proposed a new grid management charge for the period from january,to january.the revised grid management charge unbundled the earlier charge in order to allocate costs fairly among all iso system users,and minimize cost subsidization among participants in california electrical market.id.at,ja.the iso believed that unbundling the grid management charge would better reflect the principle of cost causation which it defined as meaning that the iso costs,to the extent possible,should be attributed to those entities that caused them to be incurred.id.tying fees closely to cost causation facilitates market efficiency because more accurate price signals direct market behavior towards optimum results.id.
the grid management charge was unbundled according to three categories of services that the iso provides control area services,scheduling,and market operations.control area services are the services that the iso provides as a control area operator to ensure reliable,safe operation of the transmission grid.id.at,ja.the iso responsibilities as a control area operator include 
scheduling generation,imports,exports,and wheeling transactions insuring adherence to regional and national reliability standards monitoring and developing transmission maintenance standards performing operational studies and system security analyses dispatching bulk power supplies conducting system planning to ensure overall reliability providing emergency management overseeing outage coordination and performing transmission planning.
id.footnote omitted.the costs incurred by the iso for its control area services were allocated to scheduling coordinators on a gross load basis.the iso defined gross load as all demand for energy within the iso control area.control area gross load does not include auxiliary load energy used in the power production process or load that is electrically isolated from the iso control area load that is not synchronized with the iso control area.id.the scheduling category of services is not at issue in this case.market operations services include the iso cost of market and settlement related services includ ing the billing of,and payments for,energy,ancillary services capacity,and transmission service into,within,and out of the iso control area.id.at,ja.the costs of the market operations services were allocated to scheduling coordinators based on the proportion of a given scheduling coordinator total purchase and sales of ancillary services,supplemental energy,and imbalance energy to the total purchases and sales of all scheduling coordinators.id.at,ja.the sum of the charges for control area services,scheduling,and market operations charges made up the grid management charge.
shortly after the california iso proposed the grid management charge,pg e proposed a new tariff for control area agreement customers that would pass through the grid management charge to those customers.pg e claimed that the was justified,because control area agreement customers are the direct beneficiaries of these iso services.it is from these control area agreement customers that pg e seeks recovery pg e does not seek to earn a return on the,but rather seeks to recover only the full cost it incurs on behalf of these third parties.letter from pg e to david boergers,secretary,ferc,at,ja.the tariff was calculated to reflect the percentage that each control area agreement customer contributed to the relevant portion of the grid management charge.the customers were therefore billed for a portion of the control area services charge based on the c ustomer monthly gross load and the market operations charge was billed based on the customers total purchases and sales of ancillary services,supplemental energy,and imbalance energy.schedule,pg e gmc tariff,ja.
several parties,including the petitioners in this case,objected to the structure of the grid management charge and tariff.in may,the commission addressed objections filed by affected parties to the initial decision of an administrative law judge alj approving the charge and tariff.cal.indep.operator,at opinion reviewing cal.indep.operator,at initial decision.among the issues addressed were the assessment of the control area service charge based on control area gross load the assessment of the charge to retail load and whether pg e tariff passes through the costs of a new service providing new benefits to the control area agreement customers.id.at.
the commission upheld the decision of the alj that gross load allocation of the control area services charge did not violate cost causation principles.several parties had argued to the alj that allocation of control area services charges based on gross load violates the commission cost causation principles because it includes loads which do not use the iso controlled grid.initial decision,at footnote omitted.the phrase load was defined by the alj to 
refer to circumstances in which retail loads of an entity and the generation from which that entity serves the loads are located on the same side of the meter at the interconnection between the iso controlled grid and the transmission or distribution facilities of the entity.parties have denominated these circumstances as wholesale.it may also refer to circumstances in which a load is served by a generator located on the side of the retail meter between the load and the iso controlled grid or between the load and the distribution system of a utility distribution company.parties have denominated these circumstances as retail.
id.at citations omitted.
the alj rejected this argument on the ground that both cost causation and benefits received are appropriate considerations in determining whether the iso control area services charge is just and reasonable.id.at.where an iso has taken over the transmission grid,all users of the regional grid will benefit when that grid is operated and planned by a single regional entity in that circumstance,it was appropriate for a ll customers using that grid to share in all the costs of the grid,because they all benefit.id.quoting midwest indep.operator,at,opinion.citing testimony from several witnesses,the alj concluded that control area services are provid ed on behalf of all load within the iso control area and that all load is wholly dependent on the performance of these control area services,without which no entity,whether,or whatever,could operate.id.at.the commission affirmed the initial decision on this issue,citing language from its decision in opinion in which the commission established that the benefits received by loads served through facilities justified the allocation of costs to those loads.opinion,at citing opinion,at.
while,in general,the commission agreed that gross load was an acceptable basis for allocating the control area services charge,it found that 
the judge cast too wide a net with the gross load approach in one respect.customers with generation who primarily rely on that generation to meet their energy needs have made a convincing argument that use of gross load results in this customer class being allocated too great a share of control area services costs.to take into account the more limited impact such customers have on the iso grid,the commission finds that they should be allocated control area services costs on the basis of their highest monthly demand placed on the iso grid,rather than on gross load.in this manner,their more limited dependence on the iso grid will be reflected in their allocation of the control area services costs.customers eligible for such treatment are those with generators with a percent or greater capacity factor 
id.the commission agreed with the alj decision that retail and wholesale generators should be treated similarly,noting that the gross load allocation exemption applies whether the generation is wholesale or retail.id.at.
the commission then turned to objections that had been raised against the pg e tariff.objectors complained that the tariff amounted to a change in existing contracts for control area agreement customers,thereby run ning afoul of the commission longstanding policy not to abrogate existing contracts in the context of industry restructure.id.at.objectors also complained that the tariff violates the doctrine,under which a utility can not unilaterally file a new rate to supersede the rate in an existing contract.id.quotation marks and emphasis omitted.
the commission rejected these arguments,finding that the existing control area agreements are not being modified in any manner,so that the rate for pg e control area agreement services is not being superseded.rather these customers of pg e are receiving a new and different service in addition to the service they already receive under the control area agreements.id.in analyzing the control area services component of the grid management charge and therefore the tariff the commission addressed the argument that the tariff does not represent new or different service above and beyond what the control area agreement customers were provided by pg e in its former guise as a utility.the commission found that 
t here are indeed distinct services that are performed by the iso in its role as control area operator for which it is billing pg e.these include performing operational studies,system security analyses,transmission maintenance standards,and system planning to ensure overall reliability.of course,pg e formerly provided to the control area agreement customers all the necessary services required for the safe and reliable operation of a high voltage electric transmission system.accordingly,the rate schedules for each of the control area agreements defined the extent of pg e duties and responsibilities for each customer.pg e scheduling and activities derived from the fact that pg e was both a transmission service provider and the control area operator.
now,however,the iso is the control area operator for the former control area of pg e as well as the former control areas of other utilities and has the responsibility to provide the control area agreement customers access to the iso.consistent with its obligations as a control area operator,the iso operates a real time imbalance energy market to ensure that all generation and all load within the control area are balanced on a basis t he iso is responsible for arranging operating reserves,scheduling interchange and maintaining power flows within established operating limits,and providing adequate contribution to interconnection frequency regulation,while pg e role is now to coordinate with the iso on load scheduling and operations,so that the control area agreement customers gain access to the grid necessary to satisfy the requirements under their contracts.
id.at footnotes omitted.
the commission reversed the finding of the alj that the market operations charge did not represent new services.pg e challenged the finding of the alj,arguing that there are now competitive markets established for ancillary services and imbalance energy,as opposed to the era when pg e had no such markets and managed ancillary services as a vertically integrated utility.id.at.the commission agreed,finding that,a s with the control area services,we find that there is no duplication of function of activity between pg e and the iso,because the scheduling activities that pg e performs under the control area agreements is unrelated to the iso activities that give rise to the market operations component of the grid management charge.id.the commission also acknowledged that m any control area agreement customers argue that they should not be assessed the market operations component of the grid management charge because they can certain services.id.the commission found that the market operations charge would only be assessed for accessing the grid to support transmission service and,therefore,the market operations charge did not violate principles.id.
upon requests for rehearing,the commission reconsidered its view of the exemption to the gross load allocation that it had crafted in opinion,finding that this exception is not supported by record evidence.cal.indep.operator,at,opinion.the commission,however,continued to believe that certain behind the meter generators should be subject to an exception,and therefore adopted a new standard 
in light of the nature of the control area services charges,in particular expenses incurred for the continued planning of operation of the transmission grid,it appears appropriate that generators which are not modeled by the iso in its regular performance of transmission planning and operation should be exempted from the control area gross load charge.that is,those generators that will not cause the iso to incur administrative or operating expenses should,therefore,have the load exempted from the control area services charge.
several parties again petitioned for rehearing,and the commission found that those petitions have made clear that questions concerning the exemption,as well as the manner in which it would be administered,present issues of material fact that can not be resolved based on the record before us.cal.indep.operator,at.the commission therefore ordered a second evidentiary hearing on the question of the exemption.id.
after conducting a second hearing,the alj released her findings on the exemption to the control area gross load allocation.the alj explained how the california iso models generators 
i t is necessary to keep in mind that the iso does not actually model generating units.instead,it adopts the power flow models,including the representations of generating units,which are developed by the participating transmission operators.a model is a quantitative representation of the facilities that constitute the grid,and their physical limitations the iso has explained that while it does not model generating units per se,it does use the models provided to it by the participating transmissions operators to conduct studies that examine the effects of different conditions under which the transmission system may have to operate and to determine the effects of the conditions on the transmission system.
cal.indep.operator,at,initial decision ii footnotes omitted.
the alj also recited the iso view that the purpose of the control area services charge is not to recover the costs of modeling generating units rather the criterion of whether a generating unit was modeled is an objective criterion used as a surrogate to identify load with a more limited dependence on the iso control area services.id.at.the alj also described the kinds of load and generation that must be modeled 
generation that may deliver excess energy to the transmission system in the wholesale market arena load serviced by the generation that would remain connected and continue to draw power from the transmission system in the event the generation tripped or was curtailed and generation that is of such size,nature,and character or connected at a critical point within the transmission system such that the performance of the transmission system with respect to transient stability,voltage collapse,local area power quality,fault current contribution or coordination of protective devices.
in opinion,the commission adopted many of the factual findings of the alj,and clarified the nature and scope of the modeling exemption.the commission adopted the alj definition of a model as a quantitative representation of the facilities that constitute the grid,and their physical limitations.cal.indep.operator,at,opinion quotation marks omitted.the commission further cited testimony from an expert witness that a model as used in the exemption is a numerical representation of the physical equipment,and its limits,that comprises the electric grid,the interrelations between the equipment that is,how the pieces are wired together,and the information on the real world limitations of such equipment.id.
the commission agreed with the alj that the iso does not itself create models of generating units,but uses those provided by the participating transmission owners to conduct studies concerning transmission planning and operation.id.the commission,however,reject ed the contention that because the iso does not actually construct the models it does not model generation.the important fact is that the generators were included in the models which the iso examines and on which it bases its studies t he relevant factor is whether a particular generating unit was modeled,and not who modeled the generating unit in question.id.quotation marks omitted.
the commission also clarified that the intent of the modeling exemption was to identify and defin e the subset of behind generators which incur no control area services costs or only de minimis costs.id.at.generation was defined further to describe situations in which a load electrical consumption can not be distinguished from a generating unit simultaneous production of electricity,because both are measured with only one meter.id.at quotation marks omitted.the commission described the intended scope of the exemption from the gross load allocation of the control area services charge to be extremely limited 
a hypothetical situation which we believed indicated the need for an exemption was a mw generator which served its own load except for two weeks a year when it was for maintenance t he great majority of the time,such a generator and an equivalent amount of load would not be seen by the iso,and not receive any control area services as a witness explained 
the iso admits that it knows very little about the load served by generation,it is hard for me to understand how such load causes the iso to do any work.when such loads are not served by generation,that is,when they are served over the utility transmission and distribution facilities,is when they cause the iso to do work,such as ensuring operating reserves but at these times,the iso sees these loads and appropriately assesses them the control area services charge.
it is the generators serving this load unseen by the which the iso obviously does not provide control area which the commission has been trying to craft an exemption.
id.at footnote omitted.
finally,the commission found that the record showed that generation which is not modeled does not incur control area services costs.id.at.relying on the testimony of an iso witness,the commission found that 
for generation,the iso has no information and must make estimates to figure gross load allocation.thus,while there is no specific quantification in the record concerning control area services costs for this generation,there is evidence that the iso does not see this generation and does no work for it,except when it is actually using the iso grid t here is indeed a small subset of generators for which the iso incurs no control area services costs whatsoever.
id.footnote omitted.based on these findings,the commission found that the modeling exemption was justified.
the commission issued a final opinion denying requests for rehearing of opinion.the commission maintained that the standard that it developed for the generators that are not modeled by the iso to avoid paying the control area services charge on a gross load justified.the commission maintained that while the mechanics of the exemption from allocation of control area services costs based on gross load has evolved in the course of this proceeding as the factual record has developed,the commission has held firm to its view that generators that will not cause the iso to incur expenses should have their load exempted from control area services charges.cal.indep.operator,at,opinion.reviewing challenges to the standard that it had adopted,the commission concluded that it was justified and that no party had raised any issue requiring a rehearing.the commission therefore denied all rehearing requests in all respects.id.at.
after this decision,the existing customers petitioned this court for review of opinion and prior decisions of the commission leading up to that opinion.cogen,however,sought ferc rehearing of opinion.the commission summarily dismissed cogen request for a rehearing,stating that t he commission does not allow rehearing of an order denying rehearing.cal.indep.operator,at.cogen then petitioned this court for review of this final order denying a rehearing of opinion,and the prior opinions.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
we review the commission orders under the familiar arbitrary and capricious standard.midwest iso transmission owners ferc.we abide by the commission factual findings if they are supported by substantial evidence,and affirm the commission orders so long as ferc examined the relevant data and articulated a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.when ferc orders concern ratemaking,we are particularly deferential to the commission expertise.id.quotation marks,citations,and alterations omitted.
cogen petition is untimely 
a party aggrieved by an order issued by the commission may obtain a review of such order in the united states court of appeals by filing in such court,within sixty days after the order of the commission upon the application for rehearing,a written petition preying that the order of the commission be modified or set aside.
this provision establishes a jurisdictional time bar on petitions for review of ferc orders.see city of batavia ferc.therefore,because s tatutory jurisdictional requirements are not mere technicalities that can be brushed aside by a court,williston basin interstate pipeline ferc,we must parse the record with care to determine whether cogen petition for review is timely.
the commission orders became ripe for judicial review with opinion,which denied all of the parties requests for rehearing of opinion in their entirety.the existing customers sought review of opinion and opinion after the denial of the request for rehearing.cogen,however,filed a request for rehearing of opinion before the commission,a request that was denied in a summary decision,and now seeks review of the later order.
cogen argues that opinion did not simply deny rehearing instead,opinion set forth a new standard for exemption from the control area services charge.reply br.of cogeneration association at.cogen finds this new standard in a paragraph in opinion in which the commission defends the modeling standard for the exemption to the gross load allocation against criticism that it violates cost causation principles 
the commission previously noted that based on principles,certain customers should be exempted from the allocation of control area services costs,and upon further investigation the commission refined that exception to better match the specifics of in this proceeding.the california iso incurs administrative costs in conducting such activities as transmission planning studies and transmission operation studies.accordingly,we disagree with the assertion that there is no cause and effect relationship between modeled generation and california iso administrative expenses.additionally,participating transmission operators historically have been the source of the transmission and generation data required to conduct such studies and analyses.to the extent that generators are included in participating transmission operator studies models and the iso subsequently receives the information,the iso will decide whether that information is relevant and useful in conducting its various studies and in modeling the transmission system.if the iso decides that the information regarding generators is relevant to its studies and system modeling,then those generators are ineligible for the exemption because they are significant for study and modeling purposes and thus ultimately relate to administrative costs incurred by the iso.we therefore will deny rehearing requests of cogen and smud on this issue.
at footnote omitted emphasis added.however,this paragraph simply does not do the work that cogen wants it to do.nothing in opinion changes the standard given in opinion.opinion simply offers further justification for why the standard is appropriate and consistent with ferc principles.the standard,that generators that are not modeled by the,generators on which the participating transmission operators are not required to provide data to the exempt from the gross load allocation,remained the same.it was the same before and after opinion.in the language at issue,the commission simply reiterated its it had offered many times modeling was an appropriate proxy for costs incurred.that the commission used slightly different words to do so does not make opinion a separate order requiring a request for rehearing.
in order for petitioners to preserve their rights to judicial review under b,they must file a request for rehearing of a challenged order with ferc unless there is reasonable ground for failure so to do.allegheny power ferc,quoting statute.we clarified the circumstances under which a complainant need not request rehearing 
w e conclude that the federal power act does require an application for rehearing of an order on rehearing when the later order modifies the results of the earlier one in a significant way,raising objections to the rehearing order that are substantially different from those raised against the original one.
town of norwood,ferc.in allegheny power,we further clarified that the act requires a second petition only when the result is different a petitioner need not file a second petition when the outcome had not been changed but the commission had supplied a new improved rationale.at quoting cal.dep t of water res.ferc,brackets omitted.
these cases describe the conditions under which a request for rehearing is necessary to preserve challenges on objections to a commission order,but they also indicate when a challenge is ripe for judicial review.when a petition for rehearing is not,when a rehearing has been denied in its entirety with no substantive modification in the case is ripe for judicial review and the clock on the jurisdictional starts ticking.williston basin,at holding that,under the natural gas act,court had no jurisdiction over petition filed more than days after the ferc order of which petitioner now seeks review where request for rehearing was not timely filed.cogen was required to file a petition for review within days of ferc issuance of opinion.it is quite clear that opinion provided an adequate basis for a petition for judicial review.because opinion was simply a denial of rehearing and did not,as the cogen argues,create a new standard for the exemption to the gross load allocation of the control area services charge,cogen petition for review is time barred.accordingly,we have no jurisdiction over the challenges raised by cogen.
c.the grid management charge and tariff are for new services 
the existing customers argue that the grid management charge and the tariff violate the doctrine because they amount to an alteration of an existing contract.the doctrine arises from two supreme court decisions,united gas pipe line mobile gas serv,and fed.power comm sierra pacific power.we have described the doctrine as follows 
under the and doctrine,utility providers that negotiate contracts with their customers may,as part of that negotiation,voluntarily relinquish some of the freedom to which they are otherwise entitled under section of the federal power act.under such contracts,utility providers are prohibited from filing a new rate for services currently provided and therefore subject to the negotiated contract rate.ferc is similarly prohibited from modifying the contract rate except where the modification is both required by the public interest and upon a showing that the changes are just,reasonable,and nondiscriminatory.
east kentucky,at quotation marks,brackets,footnotes,and citations omitted.
however,where a new rate is intended to recover the costs of new benefits and services,t he doctrine,powerful though it may be where it applies,is not implicated.id.the question that we must address,then,is whether the control area services charge and market operations charge are for new services provided by the iso for the benefit of the existing customers among others.if they cover new services,then the doctrine does not apply and the commission was justified in upholding the grid management charge and tariff.in midwest iso and east kentucky,we addressed very similar questions relating to the midwest iso,and found that the iso provided new services to customers with preexisting contracts with formerly vertically integrated utilities.applying those cases to the california iso,we find that the iso similarly provides new services.therefore,the doctrine is inapplicable.
in midwest iso,we reviewed a decision by the commission concerning the allocation of the midwest iso administrative costs.midwest iso,at.the commission had required the iso cost adder,which was designed to recover midwest iso administrative costs,to be applied to all loads in the system,including bundled and grandfathered load.id.when the midwest iso was created,the participating transmission owners had obligations to provide bundled retail service generation and transmission to consumers at rates frozen by state legislation,state regulatory agencies,or legal settlements,as well as bilateral agreements with other utilities to provide wholesale transmission service at fixed rates.id.at.the owners proposed that the cost adder be applied only to new wholesale and unbundled retail transmission,id.at,but first an alj and then the commission found that in order for the cost adder to be just and reasonable,it had to apply to bundled retail loads or grandfathered loads,because a ll of the midwest iso participants transmission customers will benefit from the new system.id.at.
we upheld the commission determination finding that all transmission,unbundled,grandfathered,from the enhanced reliability and security midwest iso brings to the transmission grid.id.at.we also found that benefits such as an overall reduction in the costs of transmitting energy within the region and large scale regional coordination and planning of transmission would redound to all users of the transmission grid.id.at quotation marks omitted.because all transmission customers draw benefits from being a part of the midwest iso regional transmission system,ferc correctly determined that they should share the cost of having an iso.id.
in east kentucky,we addressed a issue.the cost adder at issue in midwest iso was applied by the iso to the participating transmission owners the question in east kentucky was whether the transmission owners could pass through that charge to customers with preexisting contracts.the commission found that the owners could pass through the cost of administering the iso,because the benefits brought by the iso represent new services not previously provided under grandfathered contracts.east kentucky,at quotation marks omitted.those benefits included 
independent and regional grid planning as opposed to planning,enhanced reliability,increased efficiency,more effective management of grid congestion to accommodate greater power flows,access to spot markets,and price transparency to facilitate bilateral contract formation.
id.we concluded that the commission reasonably rested its decision on this new services analysis and considered evidence that the costs to be collected under the new charge are separate and distinct from the costs collected under the grandfathered agreements.id.at quotation marks omitted.
both midwest iso and east kentucky show that regional isos generate significant benefits for all customers of a transmission system,including customers that had preexisting contracts with formerly utilities for all services.east kentucky clearly rejected the argument that transmission contracts that provided for safe,reliable transmission by a regional operator positively exclude new services provided by an iso.isos produce new benefits that the utilities did not therefore,it is not enough for the existing customers to point to their contracts with these utilities and argue that the new system does not provide them with any benefits that they had not contracted for in prior years.
ferc made factual findings that the california iso would generate significant new services for pg e existing customers.in opinion,the commission noted that the california iso has brought about massive and fundamental changes in the manner in which electricity is sold and distributed there,so that the complexities of operating the transmission system have increased exponentially.at quoting witness.the commission recited some of the benefits of the iso 
b y combining the control areas and eliminating pancaked rates,the iso operations allow greater access to generation alternatives so that the iso can provide ancillary services to the existing transmission contracts in the most and efficient manner possible on a broad regional basis.regional planning and operation of the combined iso grid maximizes efficiencies when compared to the utility operations.consolidating scheduling maximizes transmission usage,reduces ancillary service requirements and provides greater reliability by allowing the operation of more facilities to respond to contingencies.
the commission also noted the creation of new market opportunities,which in the long term will result in an increased supply of competing generation to entities leading to lower overall costs.id.these same new market opportunities were credited by this court in midwest iso and east kentucky as lending support to the justification for a new charge.the commission further noted evidence provided by pg e that the costs of the grid management charge passthrough were for the iso service,and not the service which pg e has provided and continues to provide under existing contracts.id.the commission credited the testimony of pg e witness bray 
bray specifically explained that the iso performs certain activities in its role of control area operator which were not performed in the era.he further stated that the iso new tasks had a direct impact on pg e,which performs on behalf of each and every control area agreement customer as its scheduling coordinator a new and unique function that it did not provide to the control area agreement customers prior to the iso.he also distinguished the costs charged by pg e for services performed under the control area agreements from the costs that pg e was passing through to its control area agreement customers by means of the tariff.
id.footnotes,brackets,and ellipses omitted.the commission additionally credited the testimony of pg e witness king,who explained in detail the manner in which he analyzed the company accounts to demonstrate that no iso costs billed to pg e for the iso grid management charge are included in pg e transmission operation and maintenance expense accounts or the control area agreements.id.quoting witness bracket omitted.
the petitioners fail in their attempts to rebut ferc analysis.petitioners argue that new market opportunities are not a new benefit,but this contention is directly contrary to this court findings in midwest iso and east kentucky.petitioners also fail to address new efficiencies that are created by the existence of a regional transmission grid.the best argument presented by the petitioners is that,under the new regime,pg e has fewer responsibilities for managing the control area and therefore fees that it collected for that role in the past should be returned to customers.br.for western area power admin.at.the commission addresses this argument in two ways.first,the commission credited pg e testimony that the new iso arrangement creates additional burdens on pg e in its role as scheduling coordinator.more importantly,the commission has refuted the petitioners argument by noting that the new it may generate in exponential increases in the complexity of the system.thus,it is not the case that there is a relationship such that each service that is now done by the iso means one less service provided by pg e.the point is that,together,pg e and the iso perform new and better services for customers.the tariff is based on t
