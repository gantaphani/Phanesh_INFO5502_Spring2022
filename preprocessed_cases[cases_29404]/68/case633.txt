labor code section,subdivision b requires service as a brakeman before an employee becomes a conductor acting on a report by the united transportation union union,the california public utilities commission puc determined that two railroad companies,burlington northern and santa fe railway company and union pacific railway company railroads,were violating section,subdivision b although the puc found merit in the railroads assertion that section b had been repealed by implication,it ordered the railroads to comply with the statute because it believed that,pursuant to article iii,section of the california constitution it could not refuse to enforce section b.the railroads petitioned this court for a writ of review,which we issued.
we agree with the puc that section b was repealed by implication.we determine,however,that article iii,section does not prevent the puc from refusing to enforce this statute.therefore,we annul the puc decision enforcing section b.
background 
the duties of a conductor and brakeman are not defined by statute or regulation.instead,they are subject to industry practice and collective bargaining agreements.historically,a brakeman assisted the conductor.his duties included setting and releasing brakes.
in,the legislature enacted section b,pursuant to which railroads were prohibited from employing a conductor who has not had at least two years actual service as a railroad brakeman on steam or electric railroad other than street railway,or one year actual service as a railroad conductor.stats,ch.modern braking systems,however,have generally eliminated the need for a brakeman service.other technological advancements have eliminated additional aspects of a brakeman job.industry practice and collective bargaining agreements have recognized the elimination of the need for brakemen.current hiring and training practices in the railroad industry enable employees to be trained and employed as conductors without serving as brakemen.despite these advances and changes in the railroad industry,section b,amended slightly in,remains in effect.
featherbedding is a practice,whether created by law or agreement,that requires a business to employ persons in excess of the number of employees reasonably required to perform actual services.see mcmillion,collective bargaining in the federal sector has the congressional intent been fulfilled winter,fn.describing means and purposes of featherbedding.in,the california electorate moved to eliminate featherbedding practices in the railroad industry.by initiative,it enacted the law of.ballot,text of.the law includes section,which states,in pertinent part it is the policy of the people of the state of california that featherbedding practices in the railroad industry should be eliminated nothing contained in the laws of this state or in any order of any regulatory agency of this state shall prevent a common carrier by railroad from manning its trains in accordance with any agreement between a railroad company and its employees or their representatives.
despite its participation in collective bargaining agreements that did not require conductors to have prior service as brakemen,the union reported to the puc that the railroads were violating section b.after the railroads admitted they no longer adhered to the requirements of section b,the puc issued a formal order to show cause,providing to the railroads the opportunity to present evidence and argument on the issue.
in ruling against the railroads,the puc recognized the railroads were arguing that section b is unconstitutional,preempted by federal law,and inconsistent with the state law.the puc further commented that these contentions are not without merit however,it opined that,due to the restrictions found in article iii,section,it did not have authority to refuse to enforce section b.to support this,the puc quoted a portion of reese kizer cal d,at page,which states the purpose of article iii,section was to prevent agencies from using their own interpretation of the constitution or federal law to thwart the mandates of the legislature.the puc failed to recognize,however,that its enforcement of section b was,in effect,a refusal to enforce the later enacted state law.
the railroads filed a petition for writ of review in this court.we issued a writ of review and stayed the puc decision.
in proceedings in this court,the parties did not raise the issue of whether article iii,section prohibits the puc from refusing to enforce a statute that has been repealed by implication by another statute.accordingly,we directed the parties to file supplemental letter briefs on the issue.the railroads responded to our order.the union attempted to file a late response,which we rejected.and the puc ignored our order,even though it is a party to this action and the issue presented a question concerning the scope of the puc authority.
the railroads supplemental letter brief represented an apparent change in its position.in proceedings before the puc,the railroads asserted that the puc had authority to refuse to enforce a statute if such enforcement would result in violation of an inconsistent state requirement.in its supplemental letter brief to this court,however,the railroads asserted the puc was without authority to refuse to enforce section b.
the issue of whether the state law repealed section b by implication was properly presented to the puc for its consideration.although no party contends the puc has authority to refuse to enforce a statute that has been repealed by implication,we must start with that foundational question because it must be answered before we can determine the scope of our current review of the puc decision.in other words,if the puc has authority to refuse to enforce section b because it was repealed by implication,our review is limited to whether the puc properly decided the issue of whether the statute was repealed by implication.in such a case,it is unnecessary for the puc,relying on article iii,section,to refuse to enforce the statute based on constitutional or federal preemption grounds.

in,the california supreme court held that the puc may determine the constitutional validity of a statute.southern pac.transportation public utilities com.cal d,fn.dissenting from that holding,justice stanley mosk wrote that the puc does not have constitutional review power.defending his position against the argument that not giving the puc constitutional review power allows invalid statutes to remain in effect,he stated it is true that if the commission lacks constitutional review power,an invalid statute will remain in effect during the interval between the puc decision and this court reviewing opinion.but on the other hand a time lag will also occur when the commission,as in the present case,erroneously declares a law unconstitutional during the period before this court reverses the commission,legislation duly enacted by the representatives of the people of california will not be enforced.citations.the question,accordingly,is which time lag is the less undesirable a period during which an unconstitutional law remains effective prior to court review,or a delay during which a valid legislative measure is rendered inoperative.id.at,conc.and dis.opn.of mosk.
justice mosk answered his own question by concluding it is more desirable to leave an invalid statute in effect until the court can review it.southern pac.transportation public utilities,supra,cal d at,conc.and dis.opn.of mosk,less than two years later,the electorate,at least in practical terms,agreed with justice mosk.in response to the majority opinion,the legislature,by unanimous vote,placed proposition on the ballot.ballot,primary june,text of.the electorate voted in favor of it,adopting article iii,section,which prohibits the puc and other administrative agencies from declaring statutes unconstitutional or preempted by federal law.see reese kizer,supra,cal d at,reviewing history of.
