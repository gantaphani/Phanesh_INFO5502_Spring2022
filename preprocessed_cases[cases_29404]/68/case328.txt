various petition for review of two federal energy regulatory commission orders conditionally approving the california independent system operator caiso proposal to create an integrated balancing authority area ibaa by combining the sacramento municipal utility district smud and the turlock irrigation district turlock for the purpose of pricing transactions.we deny the petitions for review.
the court has recently summarized much of the pertinent background in sacramento municipal utility district ferc,a related case.following the commission promulgation of order,which called for nationwide deregulation of electricity transmission and encouraged public utilities to participate in regional transmission organizations and independent system operators,the california legislature in created the caiso to operate transmission and other ancillary services on parts of the california electric power system.in response to the california energy crisis,the caiso,at the commission behest,began redesigning the california electricity market to foster greater reliability and economic efficiency on its system in,the caiso filed proposed revisions to its existing tariff and the market redesign and technology upgrade tariff,which it described as a comprehensive redesign of the california electricity markets aimed at enhancing reliability and increasing the efficient utilization of the caiso controlled grid.caiso,amendments to mrtu tariff provisions,at,docket no.june,ibaa proposal.the amended tariff would implement locational marginal implement a full network model of the transmission system to improve dispatch efficiency include and energy markets and ensure that schedules are physically feasible.the commission has approved the market redesign in a series of orders,two of which concern the caiso ibaa proposal and are challenged here.order conditionally accepting tariff changes and directing compliance filing,ferc,order order on rehearing and clarification,ferc july,rehearing order.
according to the caiso,the most important objective of its proposal was to protect caiso ratepayers from unjust and unreasonable prices that may result in the absence of the caiso having accurate information to verify the location of external resources.ibaa proposal at.the caiso inability to verify the location of external resources stemmed from california and the pacific northwest electricity transmission infrastructure.the intertie,which delivers electricity from the pacific northwest to central california,is comprised of three kilovolt power lines that run parallel to each other.the first line,the transmission project cotp,runs from the captain jack substation in oregon to the tesla substation in central california,ending at the olinda substation.tanc is a participant in,and the project manager of,the cotp.the cotp is generally located within the smud balancing authority area and is not part of the grid.the remaining two lines,known collectively as the pacific ac intertie paci and at times referred to individually as and,run from the malin substation in oregon to the tracy substation in central california,ending at the round mountain substation.the paci is physically located within the geographic area of the caisocontrolled grid,although the caiso is not an owner of the paci.the captain jack substation and the malin substation are electrically connected likewise the tesla substation and the tracy substation are electrically connected.the basic structure of the intertie looks like this 
the ibaa proposal focuses on smud and turlock,two independent but interconnected balancing authority areas,see sacramento,at,that draw power from the pacific northwest over the intertie when purchasing this power is cheaper than generating it locally.together they have twelve interconnections with the caisocontrolled grid.the caiso was concerned that it would be unable to model power flows and calculate locational marginal prices accurately for these entities due to parallel flows,also known as unscheduled flows.although a scheduled or contract flow is planned between two points over a specific path,the power does not always flow over the scheduled route if there are other paths it flows over the path of least resistance,creating a parallel flow.in some instances,as in the intertie,the presence of parallel lines means that when a scheduled flow occurs there will necessarily be an unscheduled flow over parallel lines.
the caiso proposed solution in the ibaa proposal was.it first combined smud and turlock into a single ibaa for purposes of the full network model.and,second,to rectify concerns regarding market manipulation and to model the ibaa connection points more accurately,the ibaa proposal used a single hub approach whereby one default proxy price would be selected for all twelve connection points all imports into the caiso system from the ibaa would be priced as if they originated at the captain jack substation in oregon all exports from the caiso system to the ibaa would be priced at a hypothetical smud hub.alternatively,smud and turlock or future ibaa entities could enter into individual market efficiency enhancement agreements meeas with the caiso to receive a more accurate pricing structure upon providing the caiso with information allowing it to verify the location and operation of the resources used to carry out interchange transactions between the grid and the ibaa.
the caiso explained that the elements of its single hub,default pricing point proposal were justified by and result ed directly from the limited type and amount of information the caiso expects to receive from the ibaa e ntities.ibaa proposal at.the commission agreed,concluding that by using a more accurate representation of the locations of external resources used to implement interchange transactions in the caiso full network model the ibaa p roposal will help to ensure that interchange transactions from the smud and turlock balancing authority areas are appropriately valued for purposes of managing congestion on the grid,and reduce the likelihood of significant differences between scheduled flows and actual flows.order.accordingly,the commission found the caiso tariff,as amended by the ibaa proposal,was just and reasonable under the federal power act fpa,but conditioned its approval on the modification of the ibaa proposal in several ways,including that the caiso address potential for charges based upon losses of energy during transmission due to the modeling of parallel flows,specify in its tariff the information to be provided for establishing meeas,and treat such information as confidential.see order.the caiso satisfied the conditions in additional filings and the commission denied rehearing,rejecting various challenges,some of which are renewed in the pending petitions.see rehearing order.
petitioners challenge the commission jurisdiction to review and approve a tariff amendment governing the pricing of electricity in the caiso market,and also contend that the commission acceptance of the ibaa proposal amending the caiso tariff was neither a reasonable exercise of its discretion under the fpa nor supported by substantial evidence of record.

jurisdiction.fpa section f provides that n o provision in subchapter ii regulating electric utility companies engaged in interstate commerce shall apply to,or be deemed to include any political subdivision of a state or any agency,authority,or instrumentality of the foregoing unless such provision makes specific reference thereto.f.section requires the commission to ensure that the rates and charges made,demanded,or received by any public utility are just and reasonable.id.a.section e,in turn,defines public utility to be any person who owns or operates facilities subject to the jurisdiction of the commission.id.e.the court has concluded that by these provisions congress has specifically exempted governmental entities from subchapter ii of the fpa.tanc,at.
petitioners,joined by intervenor municipals,contend that the commission exceeded its jurisdiction in approving the ibaa proposal because fpa section f unequivocally exempts governmental entities from the commission authority under fpa sections and,and their voluntary participation in such markets does not give the commission authority to regulate their rates,bonneville power admin.ferc,cir.the commission rejected this challenge,concluding that approving the ibaa proposal was within its core authority for four principal reasons the amended caiso tariff applied only to scheduled transactions that affect the grid and the ibaa proposal establishes only the rates,terms and conditions for sales in the caiso market in national association of regulatory utility commissioners ferc,naruc,the court upheld the commission authority to regulate all aspects of wholesale energy sales an ibaa entity voluntary choice to participate in the caiso market includes a choice to operate under the caiso tariff and bonneville,which addressed the commission authority to order refunds under fpa section,does not limit the commission jurisdiction here because it was not ordering a entity to issue a refund.see rehearing order.petitioners and municipals maintain that these four bases for exercising jurisdiction impermissibly focus on the nature of the transactions and not the identity of the sellers.as noted,the court affords chevron deference to the commission interpretation of its jurisdiction under the fpa.see tanc,at.
although the jurisdictional line was more easily drawn when the electricity world was neatly divided into spheres of retail versus wholesale sales,and local distribution versus transmission facilities,the unbundling of services and the general restructuring of electricity markets in the last two decades has made more complex.transmission access policy study group ferc.rather than allowing the mere presence of a governmental entity to defeat the commission assertion of jurisdiction over a public utility,the court has accepted that jurisdictional and entities are regularly integrated in modern power markets.thus,in naruc,at,where facilities were jointly owned by private firms and states,the court held that the commission assertion of jurisdiction over specified transactions,even though affecting the conduct of the state owner s with respect to its facilities,is not per se an exercise of jurisdiction over the facility,observing that the contract modifications mandated by order forced owners to permit certain transactions to occur over the jointly owned facility.id.at.the court observed that the commission was exercising jurisdiction only over interconnections to a distribution facility when the facility is included in a public utility open access transmission tariff and the interconnection is for the purpose of facilitating a jurisdictional wholesale sale of electric energy.id.at emphasis added in opinion quoting order,ferc,at p.likewise,the commission may analyze and consider the rates of utilities to the extent that those rates affect jurisdictional transactions.tanc,at citation and quotation marks omitted.
in sacramento municipal,the court rejected a challenge to the commission jurisdiction to approve the initial,proposal phases of the caiso market redesign,including its decision to implement locational marginal pricing.the imperial irrigation district argued in that case that the commission exceeded its authority in assessing marginal loss charges to transactions involving imperial use of transmission ownership rights,contractual entitlements to use facilities it owns within the caiso balancing authority area.see id.at.the commission responded by making clear that marginal loss charges would be applied only to transactions that involve injections and withdrawals from the caiso grid and could not be assessed where the transmission ownership rights holder has no point of interface with the caiso.id.at ellipsis and second alteration in original citation and internal quotation marks omitted.the court upheld the commission assertion of jurisdiction 
far from compelling imperial irrigation district to become a participating transmission owner of california iso,the commission merely permitted the iso to charge imperial for the costs incurred by the iso when imperial conducts transactions that cause transmission losses on the iso grid.the commission proper exercise of its power to regulate california iso rates was not transformed into a violation of its statutory jurisdiction by dint of its incidental effect on imperial.
id.the commission was not charging imperial to use its own facilities rather,the charges stemmed solely from imperial use of facilities and attendant services.id.at.the court noted a similar distinction had been drawn in michigan public power agency ferc.
the same reasoning controls here.in denying rehearing,the commission emphasized that t he ibaa proposal is limited,only applying to scheduled transactions that impact the grid.rehearing order.and since the ibaa proposal only applies to scheduled transactions that impact the grid,only a party that chooses to use the grid is affected.id.in short,the ibaa proposal establishes only the rates,terms and conditions for sales in the caiso markets.id.although petitioners and municipals would distinguish sacramento municipal because the ibaa proposal regulation of the rate at which entities may sell energy to the caiso is not,in their view,an incidental effect of regulating jurisdictional entities,the fact remains that the commission is only regulating the caiso actions and the manner in which it calculates rates on the grid.petitioners and municipals rates are not the object of the commission orders,and the commission does not purport to interfere impermissibly with the manner in which these municipalities calculate their own rates.see naruc,at.in the highly integrated and complex california energy market,the commission regulation of a jurisdictional entity,such as the caiso,may,of course,impinge as a practical matter on the behavior of ones.id.but,as in sacramento municipal,this is not a basis for concluding that the commission has exceeded its jurisdiction under the fpa.
contrary to petitioners position,neither the ninth circuit opinion in bonneville nor this court opinion in tanc preclude the commission from asserting jurisdiction over the ibaa proposal.bonneville simply holds that the commission may not order a entity to issue a refund,at,and,more critically,the commission is not regulating petitioners rates it is regulating only the caiso.indeed,bonneville distinguishes a circumstance in which the commission orders the caiso,as opposed to a governmental entity,to operate the market in a different fashion or to set a price for power on a basis.id.for the same reason,the commission does not run afoul of the prohibition in bonneville,adopted by this court in tanc,that the commission refund authority under the fpa is ultimately determined by the identities of the sellers subject to the refund order.tanc,at quoting bonneville,f d at.
petitioners and municipals also miss the mark in faulting the commission for justifying its assertion of jurisdiction on entities voluntary participation in the caiso market.in denying rehearing the commission was not suggesting that it was asserting jurisdiction by agreement rather,the commission was illustrating that governmental entities are affected by the ibaa proposal only insofar as they choose to transact within the grid.see rehearing order.thus,petitioners and municipals reliance on columbia gas transmission ferc,is misplaced.
municipals fare no better in responding that the ibaa proposal is not limited to the grid because it incorporates prices at captain jack outside of the grid and makes reference to modeling external resources.although the caiso full network model uses proxies and data from outside the grid,the ibaa proposal sets rates only for transactions on the grid.moreover,the commission may properly analyze and consider the rates of utilities to the extent that those rates affect jurisdictional transactions.tanc,at citation and quotation marks omitted.
existing contracts.the amended owners coordinated operation agreement agreement between pacific gas and electric company pg e,participants in the transmission project cotp,and participants in the western area power administration addresses the joint operation of the intertie,the parallel system comprised of the cotp between captain jack and tesla and the dual and lines between malin and tracy.because the agreement governed different subject matter than the ibaa proposal,the commission rejected the argument that approval of the ibaa proposal violated the agreement.see order rehearing order.petitioners and the commission agree that the doctrine prohibits the commission from approving the ibaa proposal if it impinges upon rights protected under the agreement.the issue,then,is whether the commission determination that the agreement and ibaa proposal do not conflict was reasonable.
a variation of the chevron analysis frames the arbitrary and capricious review.see entergy,ferc.the court first consider s de novo whether the agreement unambiguously addresses the matter at issue.if so,the language of the agreement controls for the court must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of the parties.cal.edison,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.familiar contract interpretation principles apply.thus,ambiguity arises where an agreement is reasonably susceptible of different constructions or interpretations.iberdrola renewables,ferc,citation and quotation marks omitted.further,i n construing tariffs,courts and agencies must look to the four corners of the tariff and consider the entire instrument as a whole.consol.gas transmission ferc.and t he purposes for which a tariff was imposed should be considered for to decide the question of the scope of a tariff without consideration of the factors and purposes underlying the terminology employed would make the process of adjudication little more than an exercise in semantics.id.second alteration in original quoting united states pac.
section of the agreement provides 
this agreement governs the coordinated operation of the paci and cotp.it is the intent of the parties to maintain the system as coordinated facilities to benefit its transfer capability.except as to the use of the tesla bypass provided under this agreement and as necessary to perform curtailment sharing obligations under section of this agreement,no party provides or shall be required to provide any transmission or other electric service to another party under this agreement.
section provides,in pertinent part,that 
t he system shall be operated as a coordinated transmission system.no party shall be charged any rate and pg e shall not be charged any transmission loss for any power,which flows over the system or over the tesla bypass except to the extent necessary for sharing curtailments,no party shall have a right under this agreement to have any of its power delivered on or otherwise have the use of transmission facilities owned by another party.
although the caiso agreed to honor the agreement,see order,the extent to which the agreement restricts the caiso is unclear.insofar as it is binding,the commission concluded that the agreement,which provides for shared use,coordinated operation,maintenance,and planning of the intertie,does not concern how energy is priced once it enters the grid and therefore presents no conflict with the ibaa proposal.id.viewing section to denote the scope of the agreement,the commission concluded that the prohibition on charges in section was limited to the coordinated operation and maintenance of the paci and cotp.id.see also rehearing order.
petitioners contend that section unambiguously precludes the caiso from charg ing any rate for any power,which flows over the system.as they see it,section reflects the parties intent to shield one another from charges that might otherwise be imposed as a result of their coordinated operations,even where the power flows through the caisocontrolled grid.reply br.but section must be read in conjunction with section,as they are both part of a single agreement.see consol.gas transmission,at.on its face the agreement does not concern the manner in which the caiso sets rates in its own market.although section refers broadly to any rate for power flowing over the system,the reach of this provision can not extend beyond the scope of the agreement itself,which is stated in section.
seeking to avoid the effect of section,petitioners maintain that the commission has erroneously presumed a conflict between the two sections.but the commission simply read one section in light of the other.see order.in addition,the commission interpretation is consistent with the agreement general purpose,see consol.gas transmission,at,to ensure the combination of the three power lines cotp,does not result in parallel flow charges to the parties,which they would otherwise incur.indeed,petitioners acknowledge that t he agreement prohibits the parties from assessing each other for any such power flows.reply br.the ibaa proposal does not permit a party to the agreement to charge another party for flows over the system.it is irrelevant,as the commission maintains,that the paci is part of the caiso grid.
petitioners relatedly contend that the commission adjustment of the ibaa proposal to prevent potential overcollection of losses,see order,shows that the commission is permitting losses to be charged for parallel flows in violation of the agreement.the commission directed the caiso to remove these charges,however,in order to avoid having cotp customers that transact in the caiso market pay the cost due to losses of energy during transmission reflected in the captain jack locational marginal price in addition to the same cost reflected in the existing cotp tariff.see order.such action has no relation to whether the parties to the agreement may charge one another for parallel flows on the intertie.the commission acknowledged that section of the agreement provides that parties can not charge a rate for these parallel flows.order.but its decision to direct the caiso to revise the ibaa proposal to address any potential overcollection of losses,does not indicate that a failure to remove these loss charges would have violated the agreement.the commission explained that the ibaa proposal will not charge any rate for these flows over and above what it is doing under the current tariff.id.emphasis added.on rehearing,the commission stated that it did not find such pricing to be prohibited by the agreement.see rehearing order.the commission position on appeal,that this adjustment was to make the ibaa rate consistent with other rate tariffs,not the coordinated operation agreement,is thus supported by the record.resp t br.
because section defines the scope of the agreement to govern only the joint operation of the three power lines comprising the intertie,and section is properly read in light of section,the commission reasonably concluded that the agreement only prohibits the parties to the agreement from charging each other for unscheduled use of another lines associated with parallel flows and does not reach the ibaa proposal,which concerns the caiso ability to set rates within its own market.
discrimination.fpa section,in addition to requiring that all rates and charges be just and reasonable,provides 
no public utility shall,with respect to any transmission or sale subject to the jurisdiction of the commission,make or grant any undue preference or advantage to any person or subject any person to any undue prejudice or disadvantage,or maintain any unreasonable difference in rates,charges,service,facilities,or in any other respect,either as between localities or as between classes of service.
b.to this end,upon finding that a rate is unjust,unreasonable,unduly discriminatory or preferential,the commission is required to determine the just and reasonable rate,charge,classification,rule,regulation,practice,or contract to be thereafter observed and in force,and shall fix the same by order.id.a.a rate is not unduly preferential or unreasonably discriminatory if the utility can justify the disparate effect.energy consumers ferc,see also consumers res.council ferc.the court will not find a commission determination to be unduly discriminatory if the entity claiming discrimination is not similarly situated to others.sacramento mun.util.dist.ferc.
in filing a revision to a tariff,the public utility bears the ultimate burden of demonstrating that the rate is not unduly discriminatory.see consumers,at.yet o nly upon a section complainant showing that a rate design has different effects on similarly situated customers does the burden shift to the respondent public utility to justify those disparities.sw,ferc.if the commission determines the rate is not unduly discriminatory,as it did here,then bear the burden of demonstrat ing that the commission policy judgments are arbitrary or capricious,a heavy burden indeed.transmission access,at.this framework was made clear in sacramento municipal,at,where the court rejected the contention that the commission erroneously conflated the burden of proof when it properly placed the initial burden of showing that the tariff proposal wa s just and reasonable on the caiso t hen,after finding that the caiso had established that it was just and reasonable,simply found that imperial had failed to controvert that conclusion.petitioners likewise overlook the shifting burdens and the standard of review in suggesting that the commission impermissibly advances a post hoc argument on appeal,that petitioners failed to show the rates were unduly discriminatory,when the commission had placed the initial burden on the caiso to justify the tariff amendment,see,order rehearing order.
on the merits,petitioners contend that combining smud and turlock into an ibaa constituted unreasonable and undue discrimination,in violation of fpa section.rejecting this view,the commission credited the caiso identification of six factors distinguishing smud and turlock from other balancing authority areas,finding that unique circumstances justified the consolidation for purposes of the caiso market redesign.see order rehearing order.petitioners now complain that the commission failed to provide a reasoned response to evidence and objections advanced by parties,see noram,at,but the record is to the contrary.
in response to petitioners objection to placing weight on the number,rather than the size,of the connections between two parallel systems,the commission noted that the proposed ibaa does,in fact,have several large interconnection points,including tracy,making the ibaa highly interconnected with the caiso with respect to the number,size,and distance between its interconnections with the caisocontrolled grid.order see also rehearing order.additional statements defeat petitioners claim that the commission did not conclude smud and turlock connections were more significant than other areas.the commission noted that the sheer number of interconnections and the extent of the parallel flows combined with its imbedded position within the caiso grid make the ibaa the most highly integrated interface with the caiso.order.the commission also contrasted the ibaa twelve interconnection points with the next largest balancing authority area,the los angeles department of water and power,which has only four points.see id.moreover,with respect to the degree of impact on the caiso system,the commission found that unscheduled flow data for smud and turlock distinguished these entities from neighboring balancing authority areas.see rehearing order.the commission also responded to petitioners objection that the former integration of smud and turlock with the caiso was irrelevant,pointing out that this detailed knowledge helped inform the caiso understanding of challenges that might arise.order.in sum,petitioners fail to show that the commission did not examine the relevant data or articulate a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made,bearing in mind that the court review is highly deferential.see alcoa,at.
petitioners persist,however,contending that the commission failed to respond to comments raising the arbitrariness of lumping smud and turlock together.this contention also fails.the commission,citing evidence of two experts presented by the caiso,explained that the high degree of integration between smud and turlock justified the ibaa proposal.see order.on rehearing,the commission pointed out that the caiso had presented compelling data that illustrates the significance of unscheduled flows between the smud and turlock balancing authority areas and the caisocontrolled grid.rehearing order emphasis added.this data compared smud and turlock with other neighboring balancing authority areas,and documented the amount and frequency of unscheduled flows over a period.the commission found that t he evidence demonstrates that smud and turlock both experienced large and,in many cases,frequent deviations between scheduled and actual power flows.id.the commission noted that smud did not address this data and that the petitioners efforts to focus on individual factors and any one particular data set miss the larger point of considering the totality of factors and unique characteristics of a potential ibaa.see also id.finally,the commission reasonably found that because turlock is uniquely situated within the caiso balancing authority area with smud,making it possible for a schedule d transfer to be made from turlock to the caiso for power that is actually being sourced from within the smud balancing authority area or the pacific northwest,it is important that the caiso be better able to map such flows or reflect their source in its locational marginal prices.id.
petitioners remaining arguments fare no better.first,contrary to their suggestion,the commission did not unreasonably reject evidence relating to flow rates.rather,the commission discussed in detail the parties respective positions regarding the accuracy of the data and the difference between frequency,magnitude,and peak flow data.see order.on rehearing the commission noted that smud assertion that we ignored evidence it provided suggesting that flow reversals were grossly exaggerated is incorrect.the commission considered all submitted evidence in the record in making determinations regarding the ibaa proposal.rehearing order.as the commission points out,the fact that the caiso experts and data were credited over petitioners is no reason to grant the petition because the court,acknowledging the commission expertise,defers to the commission resolution of factual disputes between expert witnesses.consumers res.council ferc.
second,while petitioners correctly point out that future approval of other ibaas does not justify undue discrimination against smud and turlock,and that the availability of agreement between the caiso and an ibaa entity to share not cure discrimination these considerations are of no aid to them here.the commission identified no other entities suitable for ibaa treatment at the time of the challenged orders,and thus the commission can not be said to be treating similarly situated entities differently.see sacramento,at.if,in the future,the petitioners or others provide information that another balancing authority area equals or surpasses smud and turlock on the measures relied upon by the commission and the caiso,the
