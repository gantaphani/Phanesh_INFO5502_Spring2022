the fundamental question in this appeal from a district court order of remand is whether we have appellate jurisdiction in light of the limitations of d.we hold that we have jurisdiction to review the district court ruling on substantive issues of controlling law on the merits of the case.we affirm all of the district court rulings on those substantive issues,relating principally to immunity,but hold that the claims against the government agencies should have been dismissed rather than remanded to state court.
background 
the underlying consolidated actions are suits arising from the energy crisis of.see generally duke energy trading marketing,davis,cir.as a result of the crisis,the state of california,together with some of its private and corporate citizens,filed suits in california state courts against reliant energy,duke energy and other generators of power in the california energy market collectively referred to as duke and reliant.the plaintiffs alleged that defendants conspired to fix prices of wholesale electricity in violation of california cartwright act,cal.bus,et,and california unfair competition law,id.at.
duke and reliant filed in the state court seeking indemnity from two agencies of the united states government,bonneville power administration,bpa,and western area power administration,wapa,and from two canadian entities,powerex corporation,powerex,and british columbia hydro and power authority,bc hydro.both bpa and wapa are agencies of the united states government statutorily authorized to promote the development,sale,and distribution of electric power in the western united states.see,h see also united states by area power admin.pac.gas.bc hydro is a crown corporation of the canadian province of british columbia created by the british columbia hydro and power authority act of.powerex is a wholly owned subsidiary of bc hydro.powerex markets and exports surplus canadian hydropower to the united states.
each of the removed the cases to federal court.as the basis for removal,bpa and wapa invoked a,which permits removal by federal agencies.bc hydro and powerex invoked d,which allows removal by foreign states as defined by the foreign sovereign immunity act fsia,a.california then moved the district court for remand.bpa and wapa opposed the remand,arguing that they were entitled to be dismissed from the action because they enjoyed sovereign immunity as agencies of the government.bc hydro argued for dismissal on the ground that it was an immune foreign sovereign as defined by the fsia.powerex opposed california motion for remand on the ground it was entitled to remove under the removal statutes.a d and the foreign sovereign immunities act,a.powerex did not argue for sovereign immunity because the claim arises from commercial activities powerex conducted within the united states.see a.
the district court ruled first on the immunity arguments.the court held that bc hydro was entitled to foreign sovereign immunity under the fsia as a crown corporation of british columbia.as to the government agencies,duke and reliant contended bpa and wapa had waived their immunity.the district court held that there had been no waiver because only congress could waive immunity and congress had not done so.it therefore held that the wapa and bpa were immune from suit.finally,the district court held that powerex was not entitled to removal because it was not the instrumentality of a foreign sovereign.then the district court granted the earlier motion to remand the entire case.
duke and reliant,now appeal,challenging the district court holdings that bpa and wapa have not waived their sovereign immunity,and that bc hydro is immune from suit,bpa and wapa,challenge the district court decision to remand the entire case to state court,contending that the district court should first have dismissed them from the suit,powerex,challenges the district court ruling that it is not a sovereign as defined by the fsia.
california,happy to be back in state court,contends that this court is without jurisdiction to hear any of these appeals.it argues that d prohibits the exercise of appellate jurisdiction over the district court order of remand and that we therefore can not review the substantive issues of law the district court resolved.
we first deal with the issue of appellate jurisdiction.we conclude that we have jurisdiction to review the underlying merits of the district court substantive rulings on immunity and sovereign status.we then turn to the merits of those rulings.
appellate jurisdiction 
the district court final order that is on appeal to this court remands the case to state court following its original removal to federal court.section c provides that a motion for remand for procedural irregularities in the removal must be filed within days and that a case may be remanded at any time if it appears that the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction 
appellate review of a remand order pursuant to c is limited by the provisions of d.section d provides 
d an order remanding a case to the state court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise,except that an order remanding a case to the state court from which it was removed pursuant to section of this title shall be reviewable by appeal or otherwise.
the limitation relates on its face only to appellate review of federal jurisdiction or of whether the remand order itself was procedurally correct.our court has therefore recognized that the limitations on review in d do not preclude our review of substantive issues of law that may have preceded the remand order.we have said that d preclude s only appellate review of remand orders based on one of the two grounds listed in subsection c lack of subject matter jurisdiction or removal procedure irregularities.united investors life ins.waddell reed,cir,citing things remembered,petrarca,d.section d does not preclude our review of a district court resolution of substantive issues on the merits,apart from issues of jurisdictional or procedural defects leading to remand.see abada charles schwab,cir,citing clorox united states dist,cir and pelleport investors,budco quality theatres,cir.
moreover,the district court had jurisdiction over this case because bpa,wapa and bc hydro properly removed the case from state court.such a removal removes the entire case,not merely the portion affecting the removing sovereign.see imfc professional services of,latin american home health,cir nolan boeing,cir.the district court accordingly did not lack jurisdiction to decide the issues of immunity of bpa,wapa and bc hydro and of the sovereign status of powerex.we accordingly are not deprived by d of jurisdiction to review these substantive rulings,and we now address them on their merits.
immunity of the agencies bpa and wapa 
reliant and duke argue that the federal agencies waived their immunity by acting as generators,buyers,and sellers of electricity in the california energy markets.specifically,duke and reliant contend that by agreeing to the federal energy regulatory commission,ferc,tariff governing the california market,bpa and wapa were bound by the provisions of the tariff.under the tariff,participants in the california energy market irrevocably waive any objection to the jurisdiction of california courts over legal actions arising from the tariff.in essence,duke and reliant contend that by performing their statutory function to provide power to the western markets,bpa and wapa became participants in that market within the meaning of ferc tariffs and thereby waived their governmental immunity.
the district court rejected the arguments of duke and reliant and concluded that bpa and wapa did not waive their sovereign immunity.this ruling was correct because only congress can waive immunity of a federal governmental agency and bpa and wapa are indisputably such agencies.
in lane pena,d,the supreme court unambiguously reaffirmed that a waiver of the federal government sovereign immunity must be unequivocally expressed by congress in statutory text.id.at.duke and reliant point to no such text waiving the immunity of bpa or wapa.nor is there a statute waiving th
