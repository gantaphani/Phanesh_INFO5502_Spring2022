in this appeal thomas burns,trustee of a family trust,and the los altos golf and country club lagcc seek review of an order sustaining the demurrer of the city of los altos city and county of santa clara county in appellants action to recover fees paid for sewer service provided by the city.appellants assert error in the trial court determination that payment under protest was necessary before pursuing a claim for refund of fees asserted to be invalid.we find no error and affirm the judgment of dismissal.
background 
because this appeal arises from the sustaining of a demurrer,we set out the underlying facts as alleged in the operative pleading as well as the procedural history of the litigation.lagcc and burns each own property in an unincorporated area of santa clara county.under a contract between the county and the city of los altos city,county residents could use the city sewage transmission and treatment facilities and services.the city had the right to set sewer service charges for county residents in unincorporated areas,which could be up to twice the amount charged for city residents.the charges were collected by the county through its tax collector and appeared on residents property tax bills.
according to appellants first amended complaint,charges billed to property owners outside city limits were between percent and percent higher than those imposed on city residents.appellants paid the sewer assessments for through,but in august they sought a refund from the city council for the charges exceeding those paid by city residents.appellants relied on los altos municipal code lamc chapter and revenue and taxation code section,et.the city council rejected the claims,and appellants then filed this action.
appellants first amended complaint asserted class action allegations on behalf of all property owners outside city limits who were charged more for sewer service than city residents.in the first cause of action for declaratory relief,they alleged that the excess charges violated article xiii d of the california constitution,specifically section b the second cause of action also requested declaratory relief appellants alleged that the fee imposed on them was contrary to health and safety code sections,and,which required sewer service charges to be just,fair and equitable to all users of the sewer facilities.in the third cause of action appellants sought a refund of the geographically discriminatory surcharge pertaining to the period from the year through the year burns sought,while lagcc sought.the fourth cause of action was asserted against the city,requesting a writ of mandamus directing the city to stop collecting the excess sewer charges.
respondents demurred to all causes of action on the ground that appellants had not perfected a claim for refund,because they had not paid the fees under protest.they further asserted that appellants were not entitled to equitable relief or a writ of mandamus because they had an adequate remedy at law.after receiving argument on the question of whether payment under protest was a prerequisite to suit,the court agreed with respondents and sustained their demurrer without leave to amend 
appealability 
appellants filed their notice of appeal from the order sustaining the demurrer,a nonappealable order.respondents urge this court not to consider the merits and dismiss the appeal.respondents properly acknowledge,however,that the court subsequently did file a judgment of dismissal in this case,rendering the notice of appeal only premature.because a judgment of dismissal has actually been entered,we will liberally construe the appeal to have been taken from the judgment of dismissal.see cal.rules of court,rules a,see also groves peterson th,fn,d accord,bardin daimlerchrysler th,fn,d.
