the consolidated petitions for review challenge ferc approval of a comprehensive settlement that redesigned new england capacity market.the maine public utilities commission and the attorneys general of connecticut and massachusetts assert that ferc approval of the settlement was arbitrary and capricious,contrary to law,and beyond the commission jurisdiction.we reject most of these arguments,but we agree with the petitioners that the commission has unlawfully deprived parties of their rights under the federal power act.
in a capacity opposed to a wholesale electricity market the transmission provider compensates the generator for the option of buying a specified quantity of power irrespective of whether it ultimately buys the electricity,llc ferc.in order to maintain the reliability of the grid,transmission providers generally purchase more capacity than is necessary to meet their customers demand for electricity.this ensures that the transmission providers are able to respond adequately to unexpected fluctuations in demand.
for many years,new england capacity market has been rife with problems.as the commission explained in,existing generators needed for reliability are not earning sufficient revenues and are in fact losing money,and additional infrastructure is needed soon to avoid violations of reliability criteria.devon power llc,ferc at.in other words,the supply of capacity was barely sufficient to meet the region demand.
ferc,the generators,the transmission providers,and the power customers have made several attempts to address these issues.in,a group of generators sought to enter into reliability agreements with the new england independent system operator iso,which operates the transmission system in new england under a agreement,a generator in an area with supply shortages may recover up to its full in order to remain in operation.those agreements have several important drawbacks.as ferc explained 
contracts suppress prices,increase uplift payments,and make it difficult for new generators to profitably enter the market e xpensive generators under contracts receive greater revenues than new entrants,who would receive lower revenues from the suppressed spot market price.in short,extensive use of those contracts undermines efficient market performance.
devon power llc,ferc at.for these reasons,ferc accepted the agreements filed by the new england generators,but only allowed these generators to recover certain maintenance costs,not their full.id.at.
in its orders addressing the agreements,the commission simultaneously directed the iso to develop a new market mechanism that would include a location requirement.id.at.in a locational market,prices are set separately for various geographical.thus,prices would be highest in the regions with the most severe capacity shortages,which would encourage new entry.
in response to ferc directive,the iso proposed a locational capacity market structure in march.this proposed market mechanism included four,each of which would have a monthly auction for capacity.the auctions would be based on an demand curve that would establish the price and quantity of capacity that must be procured within each devon power llc,ferc at.ferc commended the iso for adopting a locational pricing mechanism that took account of transmission constraints between different subregions within new england.id.at.however,the demand curve proposed by the iso was extremely parties submitted comments and testimony regarding the proper height and slope of the curve.id.at.ferc set the matter for hearing before an administrative law judge alj.
in june,the alj issued a order that largely accepted the iso proposed demand curve.devon power llc,ferc.several parties filed exceptions to this decision,arguing that the alj wrongfully excluded evidence and failed to respond to comments about flaws in the iso demand curve.on september,the full commission held an oral argument on the locational market structure and the proposed demand curve.ferc subsequently established settlement procedures to allow the parties to develop a new market mechanism.
after four months of negotiations involving parties,a settlement was reached.as ferc has repeatedly reminded us,only eight of these parties opposed the final settlement.ferc at.the key feature of the settlement agreement is the forward capacity market,which would replace the iso earlier proposal and eliminate the need for the controversial demand curve.under the forward market,there will be annual auctions for capacity,which will be held three years in advance of when the capacity is needed.id.the settling parties determined that a lead time will provide for a planning period for new entry and allow potential new capacity to compete in the auctions.id.each transmission provider will be required to purchase enough capacity to satisfy its installed capacity requirement,which is the minimum level of capacity that is necessary to maintain reliability on the grid.id.at.as ferc requested,the forward market also includes a locational annual auctions will be held in different capacity zones based on transmission constraints between the various within new england.id.
the most contentious issue regarding the forward market is the set of transition payments that will be required from december,until june.as explained above,the forward market provides for a lead time in the capacity auctions,in order to allow new entrants to bid in the auctions.however,this leaves a gap between the first auction and the time when the capacity procured in this auction will be provided.the parties addressed this issue by negotiating a series of fixed payments that will be paid to generators during the transition period.ferc at.the agreement also provides that challenges to the transition payments and the final forward market auction clearing of whether the challenge is brought by a settling party,a party,or the be adjudicated under the public interest standard rather than the usual just and reasonable standard.id.at.
on june,ferc approved the settlement agreement,finding that as a package,it presents a just and reasonable outcome for this proceeding consistent with the public interest.id.at.most importantly,the commission determined that the settlement would address the problems that had plagued new england capacity market 
the settlement package,including both the forward market and the interim transition mechanism,resolves the issues raised in this proceeding concerning the of capacity resources in new england,and provides the appropriate market structure to ensure that generating resources are appropriately compensated based on their location and contribution to system reliability and provides incentives to attract new infrastructure where needed.
id.at.ferc conceded that the transition payments were not ideal as a single market design element,but concluded that they were a reasonable transitory mechanism that enables the new england region to shift to the forward market.id.at.in particular,the commission determined that the transition payments fall at the very low end of the range of demand curves prices submitted by maine and the iso during the litigation over the iso previous market structure proposal.id.at.ferc also approved the agreement incorporation of the public interest standard of review because use of the more deferential standard in a limited number of circumstances would promote rate stability.id.at.
after ferc denied rehearing,the maine public utilities commission and the attorneys general of connecticut and massachusetts petitioned for review,arguing that the commission approval of the settlement was arbitrary and capricious,contrary to law,and beyond the scope of ferc jurisdiction specifically,petitioners assert that ferc acceptance of the transition payments was arbitrary and capricious because the record did not contain sufficient data about generators costs ferc unreasonably accepted the transition payments even though the payments did not include a locational pricing mechanism ferc unlawfully accepted a provision that imposed the deferential public interest standard of review on rate challenges brought by parties and ferc lacks jurisdiction to approve the settlement agreement because the forward market will effectively force states to acquire a specific level of capacity.for the reasons set forth below,we grant the petition for review with respect to the issue,but we deny the petition with respect to the other three issues.
the petitioners argue that ferc approval of the settlement transition payments was arbitrary and capricious,in violation of the administrative procedure act,a.to withstand review under that standard,ferc must have examine d the relevant data and articulate d a satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.motor vehicle mfrs.ass state farm mut.auto.ins,d quoting burlington truck lines,united states,d.the commission findings of fact,if supported by substantial evidence,are conclusive.b.when the record would support more than one outcome,we must uphold ferc order because t he question we must answer is not whether record evidence supports the petitioner desired outcome,but whether it supports ferc.mun.power agency ferc.see generally noram gas transmission ferc,i n reviewing the commission approval of a contested settlement,we must determine whether the commission has supplied a reasoned decision that is supported by substantial evidence.quoting h i.
in this case,after considering the merits of the settlement as a whole,ferc examined the record evidence and concluded that the transition payments fell within a reasonable range of capacity prices.ferc at.the commission correctly noted that there is not a single just and reasonable rate but rather a zone of rates that are just and reasonable a just and reasonable rate is one that falls within that zone.see utils.pub.serv.statutory reasonableness is an abstract quality represented by an area rather than a pinpoint.it allows a substantial spread between what is unreasonable because too low and what is unreasonable because too high.pac.gas ferc,t he court may only set aside a rate that is outside a zone of reasonableness,bounded on one end by investor interest and the other by the public interest against excessive rates.in re permian basin area rate cases,d t his court has often acknowledged that the commission is not required by the constitution or the natural gas act to adopt as just and reasonable any particular rate level rather,courts are without authority to set aside any rate selected by the commission which is within a zone of reasonableness.exxonmobil gas mktg.ferc,the burden is on the petitioners to show that the commission choices are unreasonable and its chosen line of demarcation is not within a zone of reasonableness as distinct from the question of whether the line drawn by the commission is precisely right.internal quotation marks omitted.
in challenging ferc decision to approve the transition payments,the petitioners argue that there was no record evidence of existing generators costs and that without such evidence ferc could not find that the payments fell within a reasonable range of capacity prices.in its early orders in devon power,however,ferc determined that reliance on individualized cost recovery proceedings was not a policy in the public interest and that,instead,capacity payments should be made to all suppliers with a single price.see,devon power llc,ferc at.ferc is correct that it need not rely on generators costs to determine rates.the supreme court has disavowed the notion that rates must depend on historical costs and has held that rates may be determined by a variety of formulae.see,fpc hope natural gas.t he commission i s not bound to the use of any single formula or combination of formulae in determining rates.see also mobil oil fpc,d mobil argument assumes that there is only one just and reasonable rate possible for each vintage of gas,and that this rate must be based entirely on some concept of cost plus a reasonable rate of return.we rejected this argument in permian basin and we reject it again here.am.pub.power ass fpc,congress carefully eschewed tying just and reasonable rates to any particular method of deriving the rates.certainly there is nothing in the federal power act specifically endorsing historic test year ratemaking or any other technique of ratemaking.congress clearly intended to allow the commission broad discretion in regard to the methodology of testing the reasonableness of rates.
of course,ferc can not pluck rates out of thin air it must rely on record evidence to establish a reasonable range of rates.but contrary to the petitioners suggestion,ferc statement that the transition payments are reasonable rates for existing generators until the forward market begins,ferc at,was not simply an assertion but rather a conclusion based on the commission analysis of two pieces of record evidence projected prices under demand curves introduced by maine and vermont load representatives and by england at the hearing on the locational installed capacity mechanism,and the estimated cost of entry for a new peaker unit.only after reviewing this evidence to establish a zone of reasonableness did ferc conclude that the transition payments fell within the zone.see also ferc at discussing ferc reliance on demand curve and cost of new entry evidence in evaluating the transition payments.
in establishing the reasonable range of capacity prices,ferc first reviewed evidence introduced at the hearing on the locational installed capacity mechanism which was later replaced by the forward market.ferc decided to look at projected prices for maine and northeastern massachusetts under both the demand curve proposed by maine and vermont load representatives and the demand curve proposed by the iso.the commission acknowledged that these were not the only two demand curves proposed at the hearing,but,as it explained more fully in the order on rehearing,it chose to rely on these two curves because they came from two different sectors.load representatives offered demand curves that projected low prices,while supplier representatives offered demand curves that projected high prices thus,ferc noted that i f the commission relied only upon demand curves proposed by parties representing load,the transition payments may have appeared excessive relying only on demand curves proposed by suppliers would imply that the transition payments were inadequate.ferc at.ferc accordingly conclude d that relying on proposed demand curves from a single sector would have been unreasonable and focused on two two different provided a narrow range of price projections.see also ferc at.comparing the transition payments to these demand curve projections,ferc found that the transition payments fell within the range of capacity prices projected by both demand curves.ferc at.
the petitioners object that ferc improperly relied on the demand curves as a basis of comparison because ferc did not expressly find them to be just and reasonable.since it never made that finding,the petitioners insist,ferc could not rely on the demand curves to find that the transition payments were reasonable.it is true that ferc may not use unexamined rates as a basis of comparison.laclede gas ferc.but here,ferc examined the record evidence and concluded that these two curves establishe d a reasonable range of capacity prices for comparison.ferc at see also ferc at.ferc determination that these curves offered a reasonable range of prices for comparison was further supported both by the fact that ferc had explicitly endorsed the demand curve approach in earlier orders,see ferc at w e preliminarily find the use of icap regions and an icap demand curve as proposed by to be just and reasonable devon power llc,ferc at we agree with overarching proposal to use a demand curve,and in particular a downward sloping demand curve,as part of the eventual licap mechanism in new england,and by the fact that the administrative law judge had adopted the iso demand contained higher price projections than the a lengthy proceeding,devon power llc,ferc at t he undersigned finds the iso demand curve proposal to be just and reasonable see ferc at t he initial decision did adopt proposal see also id.at.in light of this evidence,ferc determination was sufficient.a binding merits decision was not required indeed,such a requirement would largely vitiate the purpose of a settlement.
the petitioners also object to ferc reliance on evidence of the estimated cost of new entry to determine a reasonable range of rates.the petitioners raise two concerns.first,they argue that cost of new entry represents the estimated costs of a new peaker,not those of an existing generator,and that the two may have different capital costs.the commission determined,however,that new peakers have capital costs that are lower than most,if not all,other plants.ferc at.hence,if cost of new entry is used as a reference point,the transition payments are likely to be significantly lower than a payment for most,if not all,new generators.see id.at concluding that in the first years,the transition payments are less than the cost of new entry,accurately reflecting market conditions.
second,the petitioners argue that cost of new entry is an arbitrary reference point for the transition period because,although cost of new entry provides a starting point for the forward market auction,the forward market does not exist during the transition period.but the fact that cost of new entry is used to kick off the auction does not mean that it is relevant only for that purpose.if anything,the reliance on cost of new entry as a starting point of the forward market auction underscores its relevance to appropriate rates it is used to commence the auction because it approximates reasonable compensation for existing as well as new generators.see id.at.ferc sets rates to ensure both that existing generators are adequately compensated and that prices support new entry when additional capacity is needed.see,recording of oral arg.at.as ferc therefore noted,cost of new entry is a key factor in determining appropriate rates for capacity and was central to the demand curves under the locational installed capacity market as well as the forward market design.ferc at consumers res.council ferc,upholding ferc approval of a demand curve that sets prices based on the annualized cost of a new peaker plant new york indep.operator,ferc at in a competitive market,prices should reach equilibrium at or near to the levelized net cost of new entry.we conclude that it was reasonable for the commission to look to cost of new entry as a basis of comparison in its review of the transition payments.
finally,the petitioners claim that ferc did not respond meaningfully to their objections to the transition payments.see ppl wallingford energy llc ferc,an agency failure to respond meaningfully to objections raised by a party renders its decision arbitrary and capricious.quoting canadian ass of petroleum producers ferc.specifically,the petitioners argue that ferc did not address the argument of the attorneys general that the transition payments do not reflect market conditions,reliability contributions,or and they cite witness that the transition payments are significantly in excess of what is needed to retain existing resources because many generators rely in part on sources of energy other than oil and gas,nuclear and hydro power.the commission did,however,respond to these objections,discussing the commitment and enhanced reliability contributions of generators that the transition payment mechanism requires.see ferc at ferc at.ferc also rejected the petitioners premise that their expert testimony was the only relevant evidence about whether the transition payments were reasonable and explained that cost of new entry and the demand curves were relevant evidence,ferc at.in short,ferc conclusion that the transition payments fell within a reasonable range of capacity prices was a reasoned decision supported by substantial evidence 
petitioner maine public utilities commission maine puc argues that ferc acceptance of pricing during the transition period was arbitrary and capricious,attacking ferc decision on both general and specific grounds.
at a general level,maine puc contends that ferc acted arbitrarily in approving transition payments when ferc had previously insisted that a locational structure was necessary for new england.maine puc claim is that,by approving transition payments,ferc abandoned the core of the market reform it set out to implement,a mechanism that would appropriately value capacity resources according to their location.pet r br.quoting devon power llc,ferc at.but the forward market,which is the ultimate product of the settlement,includes locational pricing hence,the settlement does satisfy ferc initial concern about pricing.see ferc at the locational feature in the forward market appropriately addresses on a basis issues regarding payments to capacity in constrained regions.ferc at in the june order,we concluded that the forward market itself appropriately recognizes location.see also ferc at accepting the locational feature of the forward market.the fact that the transition period lacks a locational component does not change the fact that the ultimate result of the settlement proceedings is a new market structure that does account for location.
maine puc specific contention is that separate prices are warranted for maine during the transition period because maine has a capacity surplus and is export constrained so that it would experience lower capacity prices in an actual market.it maintains that ferc refused to consider the evidence that it presented to support this contention.but ferc did consider maine argument that it should pay lower transition payments because of its capacity surplus.the commission offered two interrelated reasons for its conclusion that the transition payments should not have a locational component.first,ferc cited record evidence that projected little to no variability in capacity prices across new england regions for the period covered by the transition mechanism.ferc at.second,to the extent that import constraints do exist in other areas of new england,thereby creating a need for additional capacity,ferc noted that reliability agreements had already been approved and would continue during the transition period,with the costs for these contracts paid locally.id.
to be sure,maine puc offered some contradictory evidence about capacity price variability,see,supplemental affidavit of thomas austin,but ferc orders do not lack substantial evidence simply because petitioners offered some contradictory evidence.comm ferc,internal quotation marks omitted.ferc was entitled to reject maine puc evidence and to base its conclusion on different evidence in the record.see,consumers res.council,at t he court defers to the commission resolution of factual disputes between expert witnesses.see also.mun.power agency,at.
maine puc insists that ferc can not rely on the rationale that price separation between maine and the rest of new england was unsupported by the record.although ferc did rely on this rationale in its initial order,maine puc claims that the commission abandoned it in its order on rehearing.according to maine puc,on rehearing ferc refused to consider data presented by the petitioners and instead found that it was irrelevant whether maine was export constrained.but despite somewhat infelicitous language in its rehearing order,ferc did not abandon the findings and conclusions of its initial order.to the contrary,the rehearing order first discussed both the evidence presented by maine puc,including austin affidavits,and the data and arguments in the record that contradicted this evidence.see ferc at see also id.at the commission did consider arguments presented in austin affidavits in approving the settlement agreement.ferc subsequent statement that the issue of maine being is not the subject of this proceeding,id.at,did not undo all of that previous discussion.rather,it merely clarified that the question of whether maine was export constrained was relevant only insofar as it affected ferc determination of reasonable rates it was not an independent question before the commission.see id.
finally,maine puc challenges ferc denial of a motion that it filed on september,following the commission initial june order.by that motion,maine puc sought to lodge the department of energy national electric transmission congestion study,which maine puc argued supported its claim that the transition payments should be locational.we accord the commission broad discretion in fashioning hearing procedures.consol.gas ferc,quoting lyons barrett,and find no abuse of discretion here.the motion at issue was filed nearly three months after ferc decision approving the settlement,and ferc acted reasonably in holding that it would be inappropriate to accept evidence at this extremely late date in this proceeding after a dispositive order has been issued,since it would effectively deny parties the opportunity to respond to the evidence.ferc at.ferc similarly denied untimely motions to intervene by bridgeport energy,llc and casco bay energy company,llc,which had been filed several weeks before maine puc motion.see id.at.
accordingly,we reject all of maine puc attacks on ferc decision to accept pricing during the transition period.
section of the settlement agreement provides that the transition payments and the final prices from the forward market auctions will be reviewed under the public interest standard rather than the just and reasonable standard.ferc at.this is more than a matter of semantics the public interest standard is much more restrictive than the just and reasonable standard,which means that the settlement agreement makes it harder to successfully challenge the transition payments and forward market auction prices.pub.power,ferc,citation omitted.the agreement states that the public interest standard will apply to all future challenges to the transition payments and final auction prices whether the change is proposed by a settling party,a party,or the ferc acting sua sponte.ferc at.were not parties to the settlement that this provision will deprive them of their statutory right to challenge rates under the just and reasonable standard.we agree,and we grant the petition for review on this issue.
under the doctrine,ferc may abrogate or modify freely negotiated private contracts that set firm rates or establish a specific methodology for setting the rates for service only if required by the public interest.atl.city ferc.this doctrine recognizes the superior efficiency of private bargaining,and its purpose is to subordinate the statutory filing mechanism to the broad and familiar dictates of contract law.borough of lansdale fpc.thus,when the parties to a rate dispute reach a contractual settlement,ferc must enforce the terms of the bargain unless the public interest requires is,unless the negotiated rates might impair the financial ability of the public utility to continue its service,cast upon other customers an excessive burden,or be unduly discriminatory.fpc sierra pac.power.in the instant case,we are presented with a question of first impression may the commission approve a settlement agreement that applies the public interest standard to rate challenges brought by third parties we think not.
section of the federal power act provides whenever the commission,after a hearing had upon its own motion or upon complaint,shall find that any rate,charge,or classification is unjust,unreasonable,unduly discriminatory or preferential,the commission shall determine the just and reasonable rate and shall fix the same by order.a.in other words,when a party files a complaint against a rate or charge,ferc must adjudicate the challenge under the just and reasonable standard.the doctrine carves out an exception to this rule based on the familiar dictates of contract law.lansdale,at.when two or more parties reach a negotiated settlement over a disputed rate,ferc applies a strong presumption that the settled rate is just and reasonable,and the commission may only set aside the contract for the most compelling reasons the purpose of the doctrine is to preserve the benefits of the parties bargain as reflected in the contract,assuming that there was no reason to question what transpired at the contract formation stage.atl.city,at.for example,in the sierra case,pacific gas electric pg e had surplus hydroelectric power,which it sold to sierra pacific power company at a very low rate.at.when the surplus power was no longer available,pg the commission on its contract and increased sierra rates.id.at.the supreme court held for sierra,stating that neither pg e filing of the new rate nor the commission finding that the new rate was not unlawful was effective to change pg e contract with sierra.id.at.the court required the commission to apply the public interest standard of review to challenges to rates,in order to preserve the terms of the parties bargain.id.at.see also lansdale,at holding that ferc may not approve a utility breach of a settled rate contract unless the contract rates contravened the public interest.
courts have rarely mentioned the doctrine without reiterating that it is premised on the existence of a voluntary contract between the parties.in mobile,the supreme court stated that the relations between the parties may be established by contract,subject only to public interest review.united gas pipe line mobile gas serv.emphasis added.similarly,this court has emphasized that the deferential public interest standard only applies to freely negotiated private contracts that set firm rates or establish a specific methodology for setting the rates for service.atl.city,at emphasis added see also maine puc ferc,richmond power light fpc,the contract between the parties governs the legality of the filing.
this case is clearly outside the scope of the doctrine.as we explained,is invoked when one party to a rate contract on file with ferc attempts to effect a unilateral rate change by asking ferc to relieve its obligations under a contract whose terms are no longer favorable to that party.maine puc,at.here,the settling parties are attempting to thrust the public interest standard of review upon third parties who have vociferously objected to the terms of the settlement agreement.as the supreme court has noted,i t goes without saying that a contract can not bind a nonparty.eeoc waffle house,d.the doctrine applies a more deferential standard of review to preserve the terms of the bargain as between the contracting parties.atl.city,at.but when a rate challenge is brought by a third party,the doctrine simply does not apply the proper standard of review remains the just and reasonable standard in section of the federal power act.
in defense of the provision,ferc argues that the public interest standard will only apply to future challenges to a narrow category of rates the transition payments and the final auction clearing prices from the forward market.ferc at.this is not persuasive.it is equivalent to arguing that ferc will use an illegal standard sparingly.despite the limited applicability of the public interest standard,ferc approval of this agreement still deprives parties of their statutory right to have rate challenges adjudicated under the just and reasonable standard.and in any event,we are skeptical of ferc characterization of the provision as narrow or limited.as petitioners counsel noted at oral argument,if circumstances change after a rate has initially been approved by the commission,then under the settlement agreement subsequent challenges to that rate would be reviewed under the public interest standard.recording of oral arg.at.the provision thus departs from the usual just and reasonable standard and makes it harder for petitioners to successfully challenge rates in cases of changed circumstances 
ferc also argues that in other recent cases,the commission has approved contracts that apply the public interest standard to third parties.ferc at.this may show that the commission policy has been even ferc concedes that is so only since it does not necessarily support the policy legality,since none of the cited orders have been subject to judicial review on the issue.ferc states that there is no commission or court precedent that supports a finding that a may unilaterally seek changes to a public interest contract under the
