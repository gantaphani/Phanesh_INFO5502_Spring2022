opinion of the court 
dissatisfied with the stock and reliability of powergenerating facilities in new jersey,the state adopted the long term capacity pilot program act.the as new jersey board of public utilities to promote the construction of new facilities in the state.rather than pay for the construction of these plants directly,the board of public utilities crafted a set of contracts,called standard offer capacity agreements,that assured new electric energy generators fifteen years of revenue from local utilities and,ultimately,new jersey ratepayers.lcapp guaranteed revenue to new generators by fixing the rates those generators would receive for supplying electrical capacity,that is,the ability to make energy when called upon.
the federal government,however,has exclusive control over interstate rates for wholesales of electric capacity.so when new jersey arranged for lcapp generators to receive preferential capacity rates,the state entered into a field of regulation beyond its authority.accordingly,federal law preempts,and thereby invalidates,lcapp and the related standard offer capacity agreements.we,therefore,affirm the district court judgment.
although we affirm,we address our opinion to the field of interstate rates,and not to electric energy markets generally.moreover,because we determine that lcapp has been field preempted,we do not reach the conflict preemption and dormant commerce clause arguments raised by the parties.
background of the case 
this case concerns new jersey authority to arrange for the construction of new electric generators through a scheme focused on capacity prices.new jersey legislation,and its reasons for pursuing it,make sense only in the broader context of the regional energy market.our analysis begins there.
regulatory framework 
electric energy generation and transmission occur in a complex regulatory environment populated with multiple private and public actors operating under the supervision of both state and federal agencies.the federal power act embodies congress attempt to reconcile the claims of federal and of local authorities and to apportion federal and state jurisdiction over the industry.light power fed.power comm n.
both the federal government and the states regulate aspects of the electric energy system.
with the federal power act,congress placed the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce and the sale of such energy at wholesale in interstate commerce under federal control.a.through the act,congress exercised its commerce clause prerogative to regulate matters of interstate commerce that the states could not.public util.comm of attleboro steam,holding that the regulation of wholesale energy transactions that are fundamentally interstate from beginning to end may come only from the exercise of the power vested in congress.and congress further extended federal authority to those electric energy matters indirectly related to interstate commerce that had previously been subject to state regulation.see new york.
but congress preserved state authority over many aspects of the electric energy industry.the federal power act disclaimed any attempt to regulate any other sale of electric energy and declared that federal regulators shall not have jurisdiction,except as specifically provided over facilities used for the generation of electric energy or over facilities used in local distribution or only for the transmission of electric energy in intrastate commerce.b.so while the federal government has exclusive control over interstate rates and transmission,the n eed for new power facilities,their economic feasibility,and rates and services,are areas that have been characteristically governed by the states.pac.gas state energy res.conservation dev.comm n.
ferc has exclusive authority over interstate capacity sales and transmissions,and it has exercised that authority through regional transmission organizations.
with respect to electric energy sales and transmissions,the federal government has placed one agency in charge of implementing the federal power act,the federal energy regulatory commission.this agency,known as ferc,regulates the sale of electricity at wholesale in interstate commerce.entergy.pub.serv.comm n.ferc jurisdiction over interstate wholesale rates is exclusive.nantahala power light thornburg.accordingly,ferc alone has the responsibility to ensure that wholesale rates are just and reasonable.entergy,at quotation marks omitted a.
while ferc once directly considered whether the wholesale rates submitted to it were just and reasonable,the agency has since moved away from this approach.now ferc favors using market mechanisms to produce competitive rates for interstate sales and transmissions of energy.as part of this approach,ferc oversees regional transmission organizations that facilitate market operations.
pjm interconnection llc operates as the federally regulated regional transmission organization for the pjm region.pjm takes its name from pennsylvania,jersey,and maryland,the home states of the first utilities to pool their excess power and capacity in.today,the pjm region encompasses all or part of thirteen states and the district of columbia,including the entirety of new jersey.pjm operates the largest centrally dispatched power market in the world.
as a regional transmission organization,pjm has two responsibilities of significance to this case.first,pjm manages the flow of electric energy throughout the regional power grid,dispatching energy in real time to where it is needed.app x.second,pjm facilitates the interstate sales of electricity products,including energy and capacity,by managing marketplaces where those products may be exchanged.electric energy is the actual electricity that electric generators produce and which residential and business customers ultimately use.app x quotation marks omitted.by contrast,electric capacity is the ability to produce energy when called upon.app x quotation marks omitted.in a system,such as pjm,where multiple power generators pool their power,capacity describes the total amount of resources available for use.in other words,capacity is to energy what parking spaces are to cars a measure of how much traffic the system can accommodate.
new jersey has moved away from a monopoly model for electric power generation and toward a model approach.
new jersey once followed a traditional utility model,regulating local monopolies that both generated and distributed power to an exclusive service area.in,however,new jersey enacted the electric discount and energy competition act,stat.et.the act restructured new jersey electric energy system so customers would have the right to choose their electricity suppliers and so that energy suppliers could obtain their energy from wholesale energy markets.app x see also stat.to this end,new jersey divorced the entities that generate electricity from those that supply it.
the change produced a delicate circuitry of interdependence between private entities and public utilities,and between new jersey and wholesale energy markets.generators,such as or natural gas power plants,sell their capacity and energy to pjm through various pjm auctions.entities pay pjm for furnishing capacity and energy,and,in turn,sell energy to consumers electricity distribution companies,acting as common carriers,use their network of power lines to transfer energy from generators to consumers.
although new jersey restructured its approach to electric energy regulation,it did not cede its authority over the siting and construction of power plants.app x.new jersey state utility regulator,the board of public utilities,retained statutory authority for general supervision and regulation of and jurisdiction and control over all public utilities.stat.a.pursuant to this authority,new jersey has,for example,asserted jurisdiction over t he charges assessed to customers for basic generation service,id.a,and the licensing of electric power suppliers,id.
new jersey passed lcapp to encourage the construction of new power plants.
roughly a decade after new jersey restructured its electric power industry,new jersey legislature foresaw crisis.the legislature found that new jersey is experiencing an electric power capacity deficit and high power prices.stat.e.the legislature warned that,a s a result of a lack of new,efficient electric generation facilities,new jersey has become more reliant on power plants.f.and the legislature specifically found that pjm capacity market has not resulted in large additions of peaking facilities or any additions of intermediate or base load resources available to the region and the state.stat.b.new jersey concluded that it needed more electric energy generators.
new jersey legislature enacted lcapp in january to address its concerns.see id.lcapp aimed to encourage power generation companies to construct new power plants in new jersey in order to add a cumulative megawatts of capacity to the regional power grid from which new jersey obtained its electrical energy.id.c.
the legislature fostered additional electric generation in new jersey by furnishing new generators with contracts to supply a predetermined amount of capacity at a predetermined rate.lcapp authorized the board of public utilities to compel electricity distribution companies to sign these contracts.broadly speaking,these contracts,known as standard offer capacity agreements,guaranteed new generators a fixed level of revenue over a contract term.
pursuant to lcapp,the board of public utilities solicited bids from power generation companies willing and able to construct new electric power generation facilities.stat.a b.the board received bids from companies to participate in lcapp,and it selected the proposals of appellant cpv power development,hess newark llc,and amicus nrg energy.the board then exercised its authority to compel the new jersey electricity distribution companies to sign standard offer capacity agreements with the lcapp generators.since then,hess and cpv projects have moved forward nrg project has not.
proceedings to date 
after new jersey enacted lcapp,several existing electrical energy generators and two electricity distribution companies filed suit against the commissioners of the board of public utilities.they sought both a declaration that the federal power act preempted lcapp and an injunction prohibiting new jersey authorities from enforcing lcapp.
cpv intervened to defend the law a few months later.the district court denied both sides motions for summary judgment.over thirteen days,the parties tried their case to the bench.witnesses included experts on the electric energy industry,including former regulators and corporate executives.the trial concluded with a lengthy written opinion and a judgment in favor of the plaintiffs.see ppl energyplus,llc hana,d app x.
the district court determined that the federal power act preempted lcapp.the court concluded that lcapp infringed on ferc exclusive control over the price received for interstate sales of capacity.thus,lcapp had been field preempted.the district court further determined that lcapp interfered with pjm method of determining the price of capacity.thus,lcapp had been conflict preempted.finally,the district court rejected the plaintiffs dormant commerce clause attack on the grounds that they had not met their burden of proof.based on its conclusions,the district court declared lcapp unconstitutional,invalidated the standard offer capacity agreements,and enjoined new jersey from enforcing the statute.
the board of public utilities and cpv appealed.hess newark has since intervened in cpv appeal each side has been joined on appeal by numerous amici.at the court invitation,the united states and ferc,acting amicus curiae,also briefed the preemption questions in support of the appellees.

because of the constitutional claims presented in the case,the district court properly exercised subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to.because the district court entered final judgment,we exercise appellate jurisdiction pursuant to.
when the district court decides a constitutional claim based on a developed factual record,we exercise plenary review of the district court legal conclusion.we defer to the factual findings supporting that conclusion unless they are clearly erroneous.united states voigt,cir citation omitted.
iii.discussion 
congress has distinguished between those matters that belong exclusively to the federal government,such as regulation of interstate sales and transmissions of energy,and those matters that remain within the regulatory authority of the states,such as the regulation of energy generators.see b.
in the american system of federalism,federal law commands primacy over state law.the constitution,and the laws of the united states which shall be made in pursuance thereof shall be the supreme law of the land and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby,any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.const.art.vi,cl.as between state and federal law,therefore,any state law that interferes with or is contrary to federal law must yield.free bland,citing gibbons ogden,wheat.
accordingly,if lcapp intrudes into the exclusively federal field or conflicts with valid federal regulation,federal law preempts its effect and renders it invalid.see farina nokia,cir.if,on the other hand,lcapp addresses a local matter and leaves federal law unimpaired,it remains valid.see id.analysis requires us to compare federal and state law.pliva,mensing.we do so with the basic assumption that congress did not intend to displace state law.farina.at alteration omitted quoting maryland louisiana.only a clear and manifest conflict with federal law,or clear and manifest congressional intent to override state choices,will overcome the presumption against preemption.id.at.
comparing lcapp subject matter to the federal regulation of interstate sales and transmissions of energy 
the core of this case concerns field preemption,specifically whether lcapp has strayed into the exclusive federal area of interstate wholesale rates.this begs the question of what the federal government and new jersey have each regulated.accordingly,within the broader framework described in part i,we must fill in some of the details of pjm approach to setting market prices and lcapp design to incentivize the construction of new electric generators in practice,ferc,through pjm,regulates aspects of interstate wholesale rates through a capacity auction,while lcapp encourages the construction of new generators by arranging for a capacity price supplement.we determine that lcapp effectively sets capacity prices and therefore regulates the same field occupied by ferc.
through regional transmission organizations,ferc uses market mechanisms to price and sell electric capacity.
although the federal power act speaks to interstate wholesales of electric energy,the wholesale price for capacity is squarely,and indeed exclusively,within ferc jurisdiction.n.bd.of pub.utils,cir.ferc has determined that maintaining adequate resources bears a significant and direct effect on wholesale rates.pjm interconnection,ferc,at.therefore,ferc regulates interstate sales of electric capacity as part of its approach to regulating electric energy rates.see,ppl energy plus,llc,cir.
ferc has approved pjm reliability pricing model as the means to set the interstate wholesale price for electric capacity in the pjm region.the reliability pricing model attempts to match supply of capacity to demand for capacity.to calculate demand,pjm uses data from market participants and sophisticated computer models.to calculate supply,pjm uses two mechanisms.first,pjm tabulates all generation capacity within the pjm region that has been prearranged between suppliers and users of energy.this includes,for example,capacity associated with monopolies or capacity privately exchanged between entities and energy generators.second,pjm uses an auction to obtain the additional capacity needed to meet projected demand.the winners of the auction agree to provide capacity to pjm see generally pjm capacity market operations,pjm manual pjm capacity market demand in the reliability pricing model,supply resources in the reliability pricing model ed.
