this case tests the limits of our jurisdiction under the hobbs act to review orders of the nuclear regulatory commission nrc or commission.the nrc is the federal agency that licenses and regulates all nuclear power plants in the united states,including the indian point energy center indian point in buchanan,ny,operated by entergy nuclear operations,entergy.the atomic energy act aea,which gives the nrc its authority,requires the commission to hold hearings before taking certain actions,such as granting or amending a license.petitioners richard brodsky et contend that the nrc violated this hearing requirement when granting indian point an exemption from a fire safety regulation with which it was out of compliance.petitioners also argue that,apart from the hearing requirement,the exemption is an invalid exercise of the nrc authority.
petitioners filed their action in this court pursuant to the hobbs act,which vests the courts of appeals with exclusive jurisdiction over nrc orders made reviewable by the aea.we hold,however,that the hobbs act does not give us jurisdiction over nrc exemptions.we also conclude that the order being challenged by petitioners is indeed an exemption,and not an amendment or other type of nrc order within the ambit of the hobbs act.accordingly,we dismiss the petition without prejudice for lack of jurisdiction.
background 
indian point,like all nuclear power plants,is licensed and regulated by the nrc,pursuant to the aea.the aea requires that,when granting a license,the nrc determine that a plant operation is in accord with the common defense and security and will provide adequate protection to the health and safety of the public.a.under the aea,all licenses shall be subject to amendment,revision,or modification by reason of rules and regulations issued by the nrc in accordance with the act.id.
the aea also mandates that the nrc hold hearings,if requested,when taking certain actions 
in any proceeding for the granting,suspending,revoking,or amending of any license,the commission shall grant a hearing upon the request of any person whose interest may be affected by the proceeding,and shall admit any such person as a party to such proceeding.
id.a a.additionally,the nrc has promulgated regulations requiring a public period to precede any amendments to a license.see a.
nrc regulations also permit the agency to grant exemptions from the requirements of the regulations,as long as the exemptions are a uthorized by law,will not present an undue risk to the public health and safety,and are consistent with the common defense and security,and special circumstances are present.a.the regulations set out six potential special circumstances,any of which can justify an exemption.see id.a i vi the regulations do not require the nrc to hold hearings for exemptions.
in,the nrc adopted fire safety regulations in response to a nearly catastrophic fire five years earlier at the browns ferry power plant.the regulations,inter alia,required nuclear plants to use fire barriers to protect the electrical cables that power the plants shutdown systems.see fire protection program for operating nuclear power plants.by shielding these electrical systems,the barriers would improve a plant ability to shut down its reactors safely after a fire had started.the regulations mandated that the barriers should be able to withstand a fire for at least one hour,and longer if the plant does not have automatic sprinklers installed.see id.
in,the nrc granted indian point several exemptions from compliance with certain of the fire protection program requirements.in doing so,the agency noted that the plant was using a popular fire barrier called hemyc,which was rated for one hour of protection.however,in,the nrc discovered that hemyc,despite its rating,could actually withstand a fire for only to minutes.the agency required indian point and all other licensees to confirm compliance with the existing applicable regulatory requirements in light of this newfound problem.licensees were directed to implement appropriate compensatory measures and develop plans to resolve any nonconformances.the nrc asked for a response from each licensee so that it could determine whether a facility license should be modified,suspended,or revoked,or whether other action should be taken.
in june,entergy alerted the nrc to potentially noncompliant hemyc barriers at indian point.entergy stated that it could not meet nrc standards,but that it had implemented hourly fire watch tours and other compensatory measures.entergy asked the nrc to issue indian point a revised exemption to reflect a fire resistance rating,in lieu of the rating,for two f ire a reas at the plant.in august,entergy amended its request to ask that one of the two fire areas be rated for minutes.
on september,pursuant to the national environmental policy act nepa,the nrc issued an environmental assessment ea finding that entergy requested exemption would not significantly impact the environment.four days later,the nrc granted the revised exemption,which was published in the federal register on october.revision to existing exemptions.in approving entergy request,the agency explained that,given the existing fire protection features in the affected fire zones,entergy continues to meet the underlying purpose of the fire protection program.id.at.
on december,petitioners wrote to the nrc objecting to the agency grant of an exemption in an amendment to the indian point license.petitioners asked the agency to reopen the matter,grant them leave to intervene,and hold a public hearing.the nrc responded on january,treating the petition solely as a request for a hearing.the agency explained that petitioners were challenging an exemption from nrc regulations,not a license amendment as asserted in the petition.the agency stated that the aea does not provide for hearings on exemptions from nrc regulations and denied the request.
on march,petitioners filed the instant petition in this court,seeking review of the nrc order denying their december petition.petitioners contend that the september exemption fails,among other things,to provide reasonable assurance of adequate protection of the health and safety of the public as required by law under the aea.the petition also argues that the nrc violated the aea,nepa,administrative procedures act apa,and various regulations by granting the exemption,and that the agency acted arbitrarily and abused its discretion in granting the exemption.petitioners request that we vacate the exemption and remand for a public hearing on the matter.
the nrc moved to dismiss the petition,arguing that petitioners challenges to the september exemption were untimely,and that the agency january order should be summarily affirmed because exemptions do not warrant hearings under nrc regulations.a previous panel of this court referred the motion to us.see brodsky nuclear regulatory comm n,cir.july.we reserved decision on that and two other motions.
discussion 
whether we have jurisdiction over exemptions 
pursuant to the hobbs act,petitioners have challenged the nrc actions directly in this court without first filing in a district court.the act gives the courts of appeals exclusive jurisdiction to enjoin,set aside,suspend in whole or in part,or to determine the validity of all final orders of the nrc made reviewable by section of title.section,in turn,makes reviewable a ny final order entered in any proceeding of the kind specified in a.b.and a,in relevant part,encompasses any proceeding for the granting,suspending,revoking,or amending of any license.in defining the scope of our jurisdiction under the hobbs act,a does not mention exemptions.
the nrc contends that the hobbs act should nonetheless apply to exemptions because of the supreme court decision in florida power light lorion,d.lorion sheds light on how a operates.section a serves multiple ends in addition to establishing hobbs act jurisdiction in the courts of appeals,it also dictates when the nrc must hold hearings.a a.these two purposes may or may not coexist in particular instances.for example,with respect to license amendments,a gives the courts of appeals the excl
