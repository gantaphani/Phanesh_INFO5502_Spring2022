introduction 
petitioner southern california edison company sce sought a writ of review of public utilities commission puc or commission decision and resolution,both denying sce the ability to establish a memorandum account effective january.we issued the writ.sce urges the puc abused its discretion and failed to proceed in the manner required by law insofar as it failed to recognize the memorandum account came into existence by operation of law on january.we agree.
sce filed with the puc an advice letter,attaching a tariff,which established a memorandum account to track its financing costs on fuel oil reserves.a memorandum account is used by utilities to track various expenses.expenses so recorded may in the future be reviewed by the puc for possible inclusion in rates.unless expenses are included in such accounts,a utility may not seek to pass them on to customers later.sce tariff purported to establish its memorandum account effective january.the puc resolution allowed sce to establish the memorandum account,but with an effective date of august.the puc action effectively precluded sce from attempting to recover in rates costs incurred between january,and august,amounting to million.
the key questions before us are does a tariff that does not increase rates become effective by operation of law days after filing pursuant to public utilities code section and the puc general order go,unless suspended by the puc during that period did sce,by specifically requesting that the puc issue a resolution approving its memorandum account,effectively opt out of the operation of section and go and was the puc imposition of the august,date a permissible exercise of its power under section to modify or alter a tariff that had become effective under that section 
we hold that a memorandum account may be established via the advice letter procedure outlined in go and,as it was not suspended by the puc,sce memorandum account became effective upon the expiration of days from the filing date.we further hold sce did not opt out of,or waive its right to rely upon,the operation of section and go.finally,we find the puc subsequent imposition of an august,date can not be justified as a modification or alteration after a hearing.
factual and procedural background 
background facts.
sce is an public utility providing electrical service in portions of california.respondent puc is the administrative agency responsible for regulating california public utilities.cal,art.xii.
sce owned california power plants,fueled primarily by natural gas.sce maintained a reserve of fuel oil that could be used to operate these plants in the event a natural disaster made it impossible to deliver natural gas to them.
in,the legislature restructured and deregulated california electric utility industry.et as part of that restructuring,the legislature directed formation of an independent system operator iso,which was to have broad responsibility for operating the utilities transmission systems,subd.k.the legislature also required the puc to identify and determine those costs and categories of costs for assets and obligations that may become uneconomic as a result of a competitive generation market,including transition costs,and to determine whether such costs were reasonable and should be recovered from consumers.
as a consequence of the restructuring,sce sold the plants.with the approval of the puc,sce retained the reserves until the iso determined whether or not they were necessary for system reliability.
puc authorization to record carrying costs of sce fuel oil reserves in a memorandum account during.
as used herein,a memorandum account is an accounting device used by a utility to record various expenses and costs it incurs.the utility may later seek authorization from the puc to recover the recorded amounts by passing them on to consumers in rates.the establishment of a memorandum account,and the recording of expenses in the account,do not guarantee that the utility will ultimately be authorized to recoup the tracked amounts in rates.however,a utility is precluded from attempting to recover amounts not recorded.according to the puc,m emorandum accounts are ratemaking tools within the authority of the commission to authorize,on a case by case basis,when found to be reasonable and necessary they are designed to record expenses that the commission subsequently reviews for possible inclusion in rates.
in late,the puc authorized sce to record in a memorandum account sce carrying costs,the financing costs on its investment in the fuel oil reserves.the puc authorized recording of the costs for only decision did not address treatment of the costs after.
sce attempt to establish a memorandum account to track costs incurred in.
sce wished to continue to track its fuel oil carrying costs during so that it could later seek puc approval to pass these costs on to consumers.to that end,on november,sce filed with the puc advice letter the advice letter attached a schedule creating a new memorandum account in sce tariff,dubbed the fuel oil inventory memorandum account foima.the advice letter pointed out that the iso had not yet determined whether sce fuel oil reserves were needed for system reliability,and sce did not believe a final determination by the iso would be made during under a section entitled effective date,the advice letter stated it is requested that this advice filing become effective on the calendar day after the date filed,which is january.since this advice filing proposes the establishment of a new memorandum account,a resolution is required for approval.italics added.
enron a private energy company and the puc office of ratepayer advocates ora protested sce advice letter on various grounds.the ora contended that allowing further recording of the costs in a memorandum account would provide a disincentive to sce to push for resolution of the question by the iso.sce filed with the commission written responses to these protests.
the puc prepared a draft resolution in response and sought comment from interested parties,including sce.sce filed comments and proposed changes to the draft.one of the issues explicitly addressed during this process was the effective date of the foima.initially,the puc proposed to make the foima effective in june,to coincide with the date of an expected puc decision on another issue related to sce.sce argued against such a move,contending the effective date should be january,the date originally stated by sce.sce urged that implementing the proposed effective date in june would result in automatic disallowance of reasonably incurred costs for at least the first half of such a disallowance would be grossly unfair in that it would deny sce an opportunity to recover such costs given that the delay in resolution of the fuel oil issue is beyond sce control and sce timely and in full compliance with the commission general order,section,properly filed advice days prior to sce requested foima effective date in a subsequent draft alternate resolution,the puc adopted the january,date sce had requested.
the commission resolution.
on august,the puc issued resolution resolution,approving the foima.however,the puc made the foima effective date august,the date the resolution was adopted.thus,it authorized sce to record only the costs incurred after august,effectively precluding sce from later seeking to recover carrying costs incurred between january,and august.according to sce,the carrying costs incurred during these months amounted to approximately million.
resolution expressly addressed the effective date issue.it stated the foima will become effective upon adoption of this resolution and will terminate no later than january.there is no existing authority for edison to book these costs to a memorandum account after december,and the commission policies concerning prospective ratemaking preclude making the foima effective prior to the adoption of this resolution.it reasoned,edison is asking us to make the foima effective as of january.to do so would be to allow edison to recover carrying costs on its fuel oil inventory for a period during which there was no memorandum account into which it was authorized to book that expense.therefore,doing so would be inconsistent with our repeatedly stated policy.
sce application for rehearing and the commission denial.
on september,sce filed a timely application for rehearing of resolution e.sce argued,inter alia,that the puc had committed legal error by refusing to recognize that the advice letter and tariff establishing the foima became effective,by operation of law,on january.sce urged that resolution violated go,which requires that tariffs not increasing rates become effective after not less than days unless suspended by the puc the puc reliance on the retroactive ratemaking doctrine was misplaced because the account went into effect by operation of law on january,and thus adoption of a january date would not constitute authorization of a retroactive account the puc had sometimes allowed the establishment of memorandum accounts with retroactive effective dates,an effective date prior to the date of puc approval of the account and the puc current practices caused uncertainty and inconsistency,as utilities could not be sure when their memorandum account requests would be approved,making effective dates vary between days after the filing to any possible date in the future.
on november,the puc denied sce application for rehearing.the puc reasoned that a memorandum account could not be established without formal puc approval.it concluded that go provides for,but does not automatically authorize,certain tariff sheets filed by advice letter becoming effective after the fortieth day of the advice letter filing,unless the filing is suspended by the puc.moreover,the puc concluded that sce had understood the memorandum account would not become effective until approved by the puc,because sce advice letter stated,s ince this advice filing proposes the establishment of a new memorandum account,a resolution is required for approval.italics added.the puc also noted that,in light of the protests filed against sce advice letter,it was not possible for the puc to approve the memorandum account within the day time frame referenced in go.puc policy precluded approval of memorandum accounts retroactively,and this policy was consistent with a prohibition against retroactive ratemaking.the puc conceded that it had sometimes made memorandum accounts effective before the approval date,but only when a statute or an earlier puc decision had authorized the accounts.
relief requested in this court.
on december,sce timely filed a petition for writ of review pursuant to section,subdivision a,requesting that we review the puc decision to make the effective date of the foima august,rather than january.sce requests that we set aside the puc resolution e and decision insofar as they fail to recognize the foima was effective january.
contentions 
sce contends that the puc decisions in resolution e and decision misconstrued go and section.sce contends that these provisions create a default rule of effectiveness unless the commission acts to suspend it,the tariff goes into effect.accordingly,the effective date is not dependent on commission action,except in the sense that the commission may postpone the effective date by suspending the tariff.sce asserts that a clear procedural path is necessary to enable sce to change tariffs without undue delay,and section and go were designed for that very provide quick and automatic implementation of tariffs.thus,sce argues,because the puc did not suspend sce tariff,the memorandum account automatically became effective by operation of law on january.
amici curiae pacific gas and electric company,southern california gas company,and san diego gas electric company concur in sce arguments,and also point out that quick implementation of tariffs is particularly important in this era of competitive energy markets under the puc policy,a utility wishing to change a rate schedule,classification,contract,practice or rule must wait an indefinite period for the puc to act upon its advice letter before such rate schedule,classification,contract,practice or rule can go into effect in the restructured and newly competitive energy and telecommunications markets,utilities such as sce and amici curiae can not afford to wait months or even years for the puc to act on advice letters.utilities are expected to respond quickly to their customers needs,or those customers will take their business elsewhere.
the puc,for its part,makes three central contentions.first,the puc asserts that a memorandum account can not come into existence without puc approval.thus,because the foima was not effective until it was approved by the puc on august,allowing an earlier effective date would violate the puc longstanding policy against retroactive establishment of memorandum accounts.second,the puc asserts that in any event,in this instance sce requested puc approval,effectively foreclosing to it any automatic approval process mandated by go a and section.third,the puc points out that it has the power,under section,to modify or alter tariffs after a hearing,and its procedures here were tantamount to such a hearing.
discussion 
standard of review.
section,as amended effective january,allows litigants challenging decisions of the puc to petition this court directly for a writ of review.section delimits the scope of our review of puc decisions.as pertinent here,section requires us to determine whether the puc abused its discretion or failed to proceed in the manner required by law,subds.a.
the interpretation of a regulation,like the interpretation of a statute,is a question of law subject to our independent review.yamaha of america state bd.of equalization cal th,d,culligan water conditioning state bd.of equalization cal d,state farm mutual automobile ins.quackenbush th,fn,d.an administrative agency interpretation of its own regulations is entitled to consideration and respect by the courts.yamaha of america state bd.of equalization,supra,at,d.however,the level of deference due to an agency regulatory interpretation turns on a legally informed,commonsense assessment of its merit in the context presented.state farm mutual automobile ins.quackenbush,supra,d ramirez yosemite water cal th,d,yamaha of america state bd.of equalization,supra,at,d.whether judicial deference to an agency interpretation is appropriate and,if so,its weight it should be thus fundamentally situational.a court assessing the value of an interpretation must consider a complex of factors material to the substantive legal issue before it,the particular agency offering the interpretation,and the comparative weight the factors ought in reason to command.yamaha of america state bd.of equalization,supra,at,d.a court is more likely to defer to an agency interpretation of its own regulation than to its interpretation of a statute,since the agency is likely to be intimately familiar with regulations it authored and sensitive to the practical implications of one interpretation over another.ibid.
the puc is not an ordinary administrative agency,but a constitutional body with broad legislative and judicial powers.wise pacific gas electric th,d.the puc decisions are presumed valid.greyhound lines,public utilities com.cal d,pacific bell public utilities com.th,d puc decision on procedural matters will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion or unreasonable interpretation of relevant statute.
applicable legal principles.
the california constitution and the public utilities code empower the puc to establish rules and prescribe a uniform system of accounts for all public utilities.cal,art.xii,subject to statute and due process,the commission may establish its own procedures.cal,art.xii,the commission may fix rates,establish rules and prescribe a uniform system of accounts for all public utilities subject to its jurisdiction.the commission may supervise and regulate every public utility in the state and may do all things,whether specifically designated in this part or in addition thereto,which are necessary and convenient in the exercise of such power and jurisdiction.section provides that the puc may,after notice and hearing if requested,prescribe by order the accounts in which particular outlays and receipts shall be entered,charged,or credited.
section,subdivision a,requires public utilities to file a tariff a schedule showing all rates,tolls,rentals,charges,and classifications together with all rules,contracts,privileges,and facilities which in any manner affect or relate to rates,tolls,rentals,classifications,or service.pacific bell public utilities,supra,th at,d go a,i,subd.a.
section prescribes the procedure to be followed when a utility files a tariff not increasing or resulting in an increase in rates.that section states whenever any schedule stating an individual or joint rate,classification,contract,practice,or rule,not increasing or resulting in an increase in any rate,is filed with the commission,it may,either upon complaint or upon its own initiative,at once and if it so orders without answer or other formal pleadings by the interested public utility or utilities,but upon reasonable notice,enter upon a hearing concerning the propriety of the rate,classification,contract,practice,or rule.pending the hearing and the decision thereon the rate,classification,contract,practice,or rule shall not go into effect.except as provided in section,the period of suspension of the rate,classification,contract,practice,or rule shall not extend beyond days beyond the time when it would otherwise go into effect unless the commission extends the period of suspension for a further period not exceeding six months.on the hearing the commission shall establish the rates,classifications,contracts,practices,or rules proposed,in whole or in part,or others in lieu thereof,which it finds to be just and reasonable.all rates,classifications,contracts,practices,or rules not so suspended shall become effective on the expiration of days from the time of filing thereof with the commission or a lesser time as the commission may grant,subject to the power of the commission,after a hearing had on its own motion or upon complaint,to alter or modify them.
the puc go implements section,as well as several other provisions of the public utilities code.it sets forth the puc rules for the general form and construction of tariff schedules required by section,go,i,subd.b,and establishes the procedure to be followed in the filing and publishing of tariff schedules in compliance with section go,i,subd.b.section iii of go requires that all tariff sheets shall be transmitted by an advice letter.
go,subdivision v,provides in pertinent part on regular notice.a new tariff sheet covering a service or commodity not theretofore furnished or supplied,or a changed tariff sheet not increasing or resulting in an increase,may be filed by advice letter such tariff sheets,unless suspended by the commission either upon complaint or its own motion,will become effective after not less than the regular notice fortieth calendar day after the filed date on less than regular notice.upon application in the advice letter,and for good cause shown,the commission may authorize tariff sheets which do not result in increases in rates or charges to become effective on less than the forty day notice period.go,v,subds.a b.
section iv,entitled filed and effective dates,states that the effective date is the date on which the rates,charges,rules,and classifications stated in the sheets,first become effective.this date shall not be less than the fortieth calendar day after the filed date unless authorization by the commission be first obtained go,iv,subd.b.
puc practices regarding memorandum accounts.
the puc asserts that it must formally approve,via a resolution or other formal procedure,a utility request for a new memorandum account.the puc asserts that this practice reflects commission policy.sce asserts that the puc requirement that it approve requests for memorandum accounts before they become effective is of recent vintage and has been inconsistently applied.
resolution listed numerous prior puc decisions in support of its view that sce memorandum account could become effective only upon the date the puc approved it.these decisions do,indeed,show that utilities have in the past sought formal puc approval prior to establishing memorandum accounts,and that the puc has not allowed sums to be recorded prior to the date a memorandum account was established however,none of the cited decisions discuss the application of section or go,nor do they address the question of whether a memorandum account can become effective under the automatic procedure set forth in section and go,as opposed to a formal resolution.
for example,in in re pacific gas and electric company d,pg e was required,pursuant to a state agency consent order,to perform hazardous waste cleanup.pg e filed an advice letter requesting approval of a memorandum account to record the costs,but the puc did not act on the advice letter for approximately eight months.during the interim,pg e was required to perform some of the cleanup work.however,the puc disallowed inclusion in the memorandum account of expenses incurred prior to the date of the resolution approving it,even though pg e protested that the puc had failed to act on its advice letter in a timely fashion.id.at.
in resolution,the puc authorized utilities to catastrophic memorandum accounts in which utilities could record expenses related to emergency operations.the puc resolution was prompted by the aftermath of the loma prieta earthquake.resolution e explained that,after the earthquake,several utilities requested authority to establish accounts to record all costs associated with the earthquake.however,the puc determined that only costs incurred after the accounts were authorized were recoverable.to cure the resulting inequity,the puc authorized utilities to memorandum accounts.consistent with the commission usual practice for memorandum accounts,each energy utility desiring to avail itself of a catastrophic event memorandum account cema will be required to file and make effective on thirty days notice an advice letter with tariff sheets reflecting its establishment.thus,while the puc allowed utilities to establish accounts effective on notice,it had already approved the establishment of the accounts.
other cited cases held similarly,in re southern california gas d full text available at cal.puc lexis.authorizing southern california gas company to establish memorandum account to record costs related to its move to new headquarters,and finding socalgas will be able to recover only those expenses associated with its move to the new headquarters which are incurred after receiving the commission approval to record such expenses in a memorandum account or which are incurred after a decision on the merits of the application in re water company d full text available at cal.puc lexis.authorizing utility to record in memorandum account revenues lost due to mandatory water rationing,but disallowing recording in memorandum account any costs incurred prior to effective date of puc decision approving account.
in this appeal,and below,sce cited several decisions in which it contended the puc had approved memorandum accounts with retroactive effective dates.accordingly,sce argued,the puc had inconsistently applied its policy.however,the puc distinguishes these cases on the ground that in each,the memorandum account had been previously approved by a statute or an earlier puc decision.in contrast,the puc asserts,sce memorandum account had no such prior approval.
the decisions cited by the parties suggest the puc has in the past taken the position that its approval is required before a utility can establish a memorandum account.however,none of the cited decisions analyzed the basis for this requirement,or attempted to reconcile it with go or section.thus,the cited decisions tell us only that the puc has in the past insisted on approving memorandum accounts,and utilities have complied with the puc policy.
a utility tariff establishing a memorandum account may become effective by operation of law under section and go.
a and puc practice apparently permit utilities to initiate establishment of a memorandum account via the procedure sce used here,filing an advice letter attaching a tariff establishing a memorandum account.a,section iii,mandates that a ll tariff sheets shall be transmitted by an advice letter.a,section v,provides that a new tariff sheet covering a service or commodity not theretofore furnished or supplied,or a changed tariff sheet not increasing or resulting in an increase may be filed by the advice letter designated in section iii.in resolution,the puc stated that it was c onsistent with its usual practice for memorandum accounts for utilities to file and make effective on thirty days notice an advice letter with tariff sheets reflecting establishment of a memorandum account,in re southern california edison company d,allowing sce to establish a memorandum account by filing tariff sheets,in compliance with go.indeed,the puc does not argue that the procedural mechanism used by sce was defective or inapplicable to memorandum accounts.
such a procedure appears to fall squarely within the ambit of section and go section applies to any schedule stating a practice that does not increase or result in an increase in rates.likewise,go,subdivision v,applies to any tariff sheets not increasing or resulting in an increase.sce memorandum account can fairly be characterized as a practice within the meaning of the statute and go.
sce filing did not increase,or result in an increase in,rates.although the puc papers on appeal assert that edison was asking for a method of assigning the costs of the excess fuel oil to its customers,the record belies a finding that the foima would have resulted in an increase in rates.indeed,the puc conceded as much in its original resolution and in its answer to the writ petition.the puc resolution stated,the foima is a memorandum account to allow edison to track its incurred costs for its fuel oil inventory.actual recovery through rates of any expenses attributed to the operation of the foima would have to be addressed by the commission in a subsequent decision.res,italics added puc answer,memorandum accounts are designed to record expenses that the commission subsequently reviews for possible inclusion in rates puc answer,though a memorandum account is a ratemaking tool,the order authorizing the opening of the account did not set rates.
such a finding is in accord with earlier puc decisions.for example,the puc has previously stated,in the context of authorizing utilities to catastrophic memorandum accounts,that the existence of a memorandum account does not automatically change rates recovery in rates is not guaranteed by the creation of and booking into memorandum accounts and it would be premature to presume or imply that there is assurance of full recovery of any or all costs included in a catastrophic memorandum account.cal.res.july.
sce advice letter did not purport to establish authority for eventual to consumers of amounts recorded in the foima.its stated purpose was to record incurred expenses,so that costs recorded in the foima can be reviewed by the commission in the applicable annual transition cost proceeding,and that t his advice filing will not increase or decrease any rate or charge,cause withdrawal of service,or conflict with any schedule or rules.
indeed,the puc does not directly contend that the existence of a memorandum account results in an increase in rates.instead,its argument is limited to an assertion that its decisions in resolution and decision never reached the issue of whether the foima would result in an increase in rates.though it is undisputed that the existence of the foima was a prerequisite to eventual recovery in rates of costs,the foima itself did not authorize sce to pass on these costs.given that further puc approval is required before a utility can increase rates as the result of booking costs into a memorandum account,we can not say the advice letter increased or resulted in an increase in rates within the meaning of section or go.therefore,we find sce advice letter falls within the scope of both go and section.
that being the case,the plain language of section and go suggests that a memorandum account filed pursuant to go becomes effective days after filing,unless the puc acts to suspend the tariff establishing the account.section provides that,any practice not so suspended shall become effective upon the expiration of days from the time of filing thereof with the commission,italics added.go likewise is clear that,when a tariff sheet is filed by advice letter,unless the puc suspends it,the tariff will become effective after not less than the regular notice fortieth calendar day after the filed date.
the language of both these provisions is mandatory.the legislature and puc use of the words shall and will,respectively,demonstrates unambiguously that,after the expiration of the prescribed time,the practice or tariff goes into effect.in determining the meaning of a statute,we look first to the words of the statute,giving the language its usual,ordinary meaning.if there is no ambiguity in the language,we presume the legislature meant what it said,and the plain meaning of the statute governs.hunt superior court cal th,d,acapulco restaurants,alcoholic beverage control appeals bd.th,fn,d rules of statutory construction apply equally to regulations.ordinarily,the literal meaning of the words of a statute governs.people ex rel of transportation southern cal.edison cal th,d.such is the case here the language of the statute and go is plain and unambiguous.if the puc does not act to suspend a filing covered by go and section,the tariff implementing the practice becomes effective days after the filing date.
furthermore,if section and go intended that filings may become effective only after formal puc approval,the additional provision that the puc could act to suspend the filing makes little sense.such a provision would be unnecessary if the filed tariff was not to go into effect until the puc approved it.in construing the words of a statute or constitutional provision to discern its purpose,the provisions should be read together an interpretation which would render terms surplusage should be avoided,and every word should be given some significance,leaving no part useless or devoid of meaning.city and county of san francisco farrell cal d.here,the provisions regarding puc suspension become meaningless surplusage if tariffs go into effect only upon formal puc approval.
additionally,our interpretation is supported by the fact that the public utilities code and go treat tariffs or filings resulting in a rate increase differently than those which do not.for example,section states that e xcept as provided in section,no public utility shall change any rate or so alter any classification,contract,practice,or rule as to result in any new rate,except upon a showing before the commission and a finding by the commission that the new rate is justified.italics added.likewise,go requires that a utility may not change tariffs to increase rates until a showing has been made before the commission and a finding by the commission that such increase is justified.go,pt.vi,italics added.this different treatment,in statute and the puc general order,of tariffs that increase rates versus those that do not supports a finding that the legislature intended that specific commission approval not be required when a utility proposes a change.
the puc asserts that its approval is required before a utility can establish a memorandum account.the stated bases for the puc position are this has been the puc practice and sce acknowledged that a puc resolution was required.the puc does not set forth any particular provision,statutory or administrative,specifically governing the establishment of memorandum accounts,nor does it refer us to any regulation,statute,or administrative materials differentiating memorandum accounts from other tariff filings indeed,the puc does not directly assert in this appeal any reason why memorandum accounts can not be established via the automatic approval mechanism set forth in go.
the puc states that it obviously acknowledges that certain tariff sheets filed by advice letter can become effective on days notice unless suspended.it states that sce memorandum account request was not a tariff change,implying that only routine filings can be automatically approved under the go procedure.however,the puc does not explain which tariff filings are subject to the automatic approval process,why these unnamed filings must be treated differently than filings initiating memorandum accounts,or what order,regulation,or other provision of law authorizes such treatment.
thus,even assuming the puc had a practice of requiring that memorandum accounts become effective only upon puc approval,the puc has provided no basis upon which we can find that practice in accord with section and go.we recognize that,whether a utility may proceed by an advice letter or instead must file a formal application for a particular tariff change is a decision peculiarly within the puc expertise and judgment citation,not this court.we will not disturb the puc selection between the procedures absent a manifest abuse of discretion or an unreasonable interpretation of the statutes governing its procedures citation.pacific bell public utilities,supra,th at,d.here,however,the puc actions appear to contravene its own general order,as well as section.
it is true that an administrative agency interpretation of its own regulation is entitled to consideration and respect,especially where,as here,the agency has a special familiarity and expertise with the issues.yamaha of america state bd.of equalization,supra,cal th at,d.however,an agency interpretation of a regulation or statute does not control if an alternative reading is compelled by the plain language of the provision.redding medical center bonta th,d motion picture studio teachers welfare workers millan th,d the principle of agency deference does not permit the agency to disregard the regulation plain language.moreover,while we may defer to an administrative agency construction of its own regulation,if the language of the rule does not require administrative expertise,we apply the regulation as we understand it.department of alcoholic beverage control alcoholic beverage control appeals bd.th,d.as explained in yamaha courts must,in short,independently judge the text of the statute,taking into account and respecting the agency interpretation of its meaning,of course,whether embodied in a formal rule or less formal representation.where the meaning and legal effect of a statute is the issue,an agency interpretation is one among several tools available to the court.depending on the context,it may be helpful,enlightening,even convincing.it may sometimes be of little worth.yamaha of america state bd.of equalization,supra,at,d.here,the puc offers us no basis for its reading of either section or go.the puc asserts that it has long insisted upon approving memorandum accounts,but gives us no explanation of how it squares section or go with its current practice.thus,in this instance,we have nothing to which we can meaningfully defer.
accordingly,we hold that on the facts presented here,a tariff attaching a memorandum account falls within the ambit of section and go,and becomes effective as a matter of law days after filing,unless suspended by the puc a filing that does not raise rates can either be suspended by the puc,or it will go into any further approval or commission days after filing.the puc can suspend a advice letter and tariff within days it can also modify the tariff in accord with section.however,if it allows the days to pass without suspending the advice letter and tariff,the tariff goes into effect as a matter of law.
sce request for a resolution did not preclude its use of the automatic procedure.
having found that a tariff initiating a memorandum account can be filed pursuant to section and go,subdivision v,and under those provisions becomes effective automatically unless suspended,we next address whether these principles applied in this instance.thus,we turn to the question of whether the language used in advice letter and sce request for a formal resolution precluded its use of the automatic procedure.
the puc argues that,by explicitly requesting its memorandum account be approved by a puc resolution,and by acknowledging such approval was required,sce has waived or is estopped from asserting any right it had to rely upon the automatic approval provisions of section and go.
as indicated,sce advice letter stated,it is requested that this advice filing become effective on the calendar day after the date filed it also stated,because this advice filing proposes the establishment of a new memorandum account,a resolution is required for approval.in response to sce advice letter,the puc initiated proceedings in compliance with section,subdivision g.that section requires that,prior to voting on any commission decision not subject to subdivision d,the decision shall be served on parties and subject to at least days public review and comment.any alternate decision must also be served upon all parties and must be subject to public review and comment before it may be voted upon,subds.e,g.here,the puc prepared and served both a draft resolution and a draft alternate resolution,and sce commented upon both.ultimately,a formal vote and resolution was undertaken,as requested by sce.
the puc argues that by requesting a formal resolution,and acknowledging that one was required,sce opted out of any right it had to avail itself of the automatic approval process contemplated by section and go.it points out that,an advice letter can become effective only once.edison can not ask to have a memorandum account become effective by way of resolution,and then later say that it became effective automatically under section and go.we disagree that sce choice of words and conduct constituted a waiver in this instance.
the principles underlying the waiver doctrine are well settled.waiver always rests upon intent.waiver is the intentional relinquishment of a known right after knowledge of the facts.citations.the burden,moreover,is on the party claiming a waiver of a right to prove it by clear and convincing evidence that does not leave the matter to speculation,and doubtful cases will be decided against a waiver.citations.hills,chopstix dim sum cafe takeout iii,th,d city of ukiah fones cal d.the pivotal issue in a claim of waiver is the intention of the party who allegedly relinquished the known legal right.hills,chopstix dim sum cafe takeout iii,supra,at,d jovine fhp,th,d.
the waiver doctrine applies in the administrative context if the administrative record shows that the applicant has made a knowing,intelligent,and voluntary waiver in circumstances where the applicant might reasonably anticipate some benefit or advantage from the waiver,and if the waiver does not seriously compromise any public purpose that the act time limits were intended to serve.bickel city of piedmont cal th,d,abrogated by statute in regard to its construction of the permit streamlining act stats,ch.
sce explains it made a request for approval b ecause the commission staff had recently insisted that it approve similar advice letters,and because sce expected that certain parties would challenge this advice letter.sce notes that its recognition that commission approval was required shows that such approval was required to address the protests after the tariff had become effective.italics original.moreover,it suggests its use of the term requested was merely a polite way of acknowledging the commission power to suspend the effective date.
we agree that the language used by sce in its advice letter was ambiguous.sce did not expressly invoke the section automatic procedure.moreover,the automatic procedure for approval contemplated in section and go appears fundamentally incompatible with the resolution procedure requested by sce.for example,section,subdivision g imposes procedural requirements when the puc votes out a resolution.under section,subdivision g,the puc must release a proposed resolution to the public days before adoption.additionally,the puc also must consider possible protests,may issue an alternate draft resolution for comment,and must vote on a resolution.at oral argument,both parties conceded that this process could n
