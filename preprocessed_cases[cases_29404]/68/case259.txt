this dispute arises out of the west coast recent energy crisis.the case involves claims against energy wholesalers by a public utility which contends it was forced to pay exorbitant prices for electricity.the utility case was dismissed by the district court because its claims were found to be preempted.for the reasons discussed below,we affirm in part and remand.
appellant public utility district of grays harbor county,washington grays harbor is a public utility district that provides retail electric power services to residential,commercial,and government customers within grays harbor county,washington.appellees idaho power company and idacorp energy market and sell electric power in the wholesale markets of the pacific northwest.appellee idacorp is the holding company for both idaho power company and idacorp energy,and it is also the general partner of idacorp energy 
at the center of this dispute is a contract for power.on or about march,grays harbor entered into a megawatt purchase transaction with idaho power company for the purchase of electric power from october,through march,at the market rate,which turned out to be per megawatt hour.in or around june,idaho power company assigned all of its rights and obligations under the contract to idacorp energy subsequently,idacorp energy delivered the power under the contract,and grays harbor paid idacorp energy for the power.
this contract was negotiated during a summer and winter of the west coast was experiencing extreme power shortages and price volatility.these shortages resulted in numerous blackouts in california and threatened blackouts in the northwest.according to grays harbor,this situation was allegedly caused by dysfunctional markets,market manipulation and the intentional withholding of generation capacity from the market.
on or about october,grays harbor filed suit against idacorp,idaho power company and idacorp energy in washington state court.in the complaint,grays harbor sought rescission or reformation of the contract based on four mistake,unilateral mistake,duress,and unconscionability.the complaint also asserted a claim for unjust enrichment against idacorp and idacorp energy in essence,the complaint alleges that the market rate of per megawatt hour price was agreed to only because grays harbor believed that the rate was based on a properly functioning market,when in fact the price resulted from a dysfunctional,manipulated market.
as to the unjust enrichment claim,the complaint seeks restitution from idacorp and idacorp energy in an amount equal to the difference between per megawatt hour and the fair value for the electric power delivered by idacorp energy pursuant to the contract.alternatively,the complaint seeks rescission or reformation of the contract to a price that reflects a fair price absent dysfunction,manipulation and the intentional withholding of electric power and restitution from defendants jointly and sever ally in an amount equal to the difference between per megawatt hour and the fair value for the electric power delivered under the contract.
on november,the defendants removed the case to the united states district court for the western district of washington.on november,the defendants filed a motion to dismiss,which was ultimately heard on january.at the hearing on january,the district court issued an oral ruling dismissing the complaint.the district court concluded that it did not have jurisdiction to resolve the issues raised in the complaint.the court explained that the relief sought would require the court to determine a fair price and that the federal energy regulatory commission has preempted the field of determining fair value of power the judge stated,all of the relief requested in the complaint would require this court to undermine the congressional scheme of uniform regulation of rates.on january,the court issued a minute order and a judgment,dismissing the complaint.grays harbor filed a timely notice of appeal on february.

discussion 
the arguments raised on appeal all involve the scope of preemption in the energy context and how that preemption applies to grays harbor contract claims as an initial matter,it is clear that the federal power act the fpa grants ferc exclusive authority to regulate the transmission and sale at wholesale of electric energy in interstate commerce.transmission agency of cal.sierra pac.power,cir tanc quoting new england power new hampshire,d see also.through the fpa,congress meant to draw a bright line easily ascertained,between state and federal jurisdiction this was done in the power act by making ferc jurisdiction plenary and extending it to all wholesale sales in interstate commerce except those which congress has made explicitly subject to regulation by the states.nantahala power light thornburg,d quoting fed.power comm cal.edison,d.this power includes the exclusive authority to determine the reasonableness of wholesale rates.see.power light ex rel.moore,d see also a stating that ferc shall determine the just and reasonable rate when it finds that any rate,charge,or classification,demanded,observed,charged,or collected by any public utility for any transmission or sale subject to the jurisdiction of the commission,or that any rule,regulation,practice,or contract affecting such rate,charge,or classification is unjust,unreasonable,unduly discriminatory or preferential.to the extent that it bars states from acting within the zone of ferc authority,this exclusive jurisdiction is grounded in the supremacy clause of the constitution.see.power light,at.const.art.vi,cl.see also duke energy trading,davis,cir noting that a preemption claim involving state actions that conflict with the federal power act are properly understood as predicated on the supremacy clause.
there are three theories that require this case to be dismissed.they are field preemption,conflict preemption,and the filed rate doctrine we address them separately below.
field preemption 
field preemption occurs when the federal statutory scheme is sufficiently comprehensive to infer that congress left no room for supplementary regulation by the states.gadda,at.when the federal government completely occupies a given field or an identifiable portion of it,the test of preemption is whether the matter on which the state asserts the right to act is in any way regulated by the federal government.pac.gas state energy res.conservation dev.comm n,d quoting rice santa fe elevator.when considering preemption,no matter which type,t he purpose of congress is the ultimate touchstone.ting,cir quoting cipollone liggett group,d.
grays harbor basic argument in this respect is that its complaint merely alleges facts that under state common law would allow the court to grant the equitable remedies of rescission or reformation and that the fpa does not necessarily grant ferc exclusive jurisdiction over all contract disputes.grays harbor emphasizes the fact that its complaint is not about rates charged for power but rather about contract formation.moreover,grays harbor argues,the congressional intent to preempt its action is especially lacking in the deregulated power markets,where prices are negotiated between parties and the rates are not filed and approved in advance by ferc.ferc is only authorized to provide refunds plus interest for a prospective period,b this type of relief,grays harbor contends,is inadequate in a deregulated market where the prices are not set in advance 
the supreme court has provided some support for grays harbor argument questions of exclusive federal jurisdiction and ouster of jurisdiction of state courts are,under existing jurisdictional legislation,not determined by ultimate substantive issues of federal law.the answers depend on the particular claims a suitor makes in a state how he casts his action.pan am.petroleum superior court,d.here,grays harbor has cast its action as a simple question of contract formation.but grays harbor arguments ignore the fundamental thrust of its complaint.in its current form,grays harbor complaint seems to require the district court,at some point,to determine the fair price of the electricity that was delivered under the contract.this determination is clearly within ferc jurisdiction for determining the reasonableness of wholesale rates.power light,at.see also a.at the very least,the requested relief intrudes on an identifiable portion of a field that the federal government has occupied and addresses a matter that is in any way regulated by the federal government.see pac.gas,at.
it may be true that the district court could decide simply whether,for instance,there was duress or mutual mistake such that reformation or rescission may be appropriate,whether there was a contract formation problem.in fact,ferc has stated that such a determination,by itself,may be more appropriately resolved in the courts.see villages of edgerton montpelier,ohio ohio power,wl,unlike most contractual disputes that come before us,this case involves a question not of contract interpretation but of whether there is a contract.with respect to the issue of whether ohio power made a legally enforceable commitment to supply the villages full requirements service,we believe that generally the courts would be the appropriate forum for deciding whether two parties entered into a contract.but the district court could do no more without intruding into an area of exclusive ferc authority.see in re cal.wholesale antitrust,d at i n order to resolve plaintiff claims and provide it the damages it seeks,the court would be expressly required to assume a hypothetical rate different from that actually set by ferc.this,the court can not do.quotation marks and citation omitted.thus,the situation is analogous to that in arkansas louisiana gas hall,d,where the supreme court held the mere fact that respondents brought th eir suit under state law does not rescue it,for when c ongress has established an exclusive form of regulation,there can be no divided authority over interstate commerce.congress here has granted exclusive authority over rate regulation to the commission.quotation marks and citation omitted 
the fact that the rates at issue in this case are market based does not alter this conclusion.idaho power company authority to charge rates comes from ferc.before allowing idaho power company to charge rates,ferc first confirmed that idaho power company did not have,or had adequately mitigated,market power in generation and transmission and could not erect other barriers to entry.idaho power,wl,at.further,the ability to charge prices comes with certain filing requirements,including providing ferc with individual service agreements for contracts such as the one at issue here.see id.at.even in the context of rates,ferc actively regulates and oversees the setting of rates.thus there is no grays harbor has provided no authority to support the rates are not within ferc exclusive jurisdiction over wholesale rates.
the fact that ferc can only grant prospective refunds similarly fails to alter the conclusion that grays harbor claims are preempted.as the supreme court has stated 
congress here has granted exclusive authority over rate regulation to the commission.in so doing,congress withheld the authority to grant retroactive rate increases or to permit collection of a rate other than the one on file.it would surely be inconsistent with this congressional purpose to permit a state court to do through a action what the commission itself may not do.
gas,at.true,because ferc does not specific rates,the shift to such rates may mean that prospective refunds are an inadequate remedy.but this fact,by itself,does not change the scope of preemption regarding ferc exclusive jurisdiction over wholesale rates see.gas,at.a finding that federal law provides a shield for the challenged conduct will almost always leave the violation unredressed.
therefore,we find that grays harbor claims are barred because of field preemption.
conflict preemption 
conflict preemption exists if there is an actual conflict between federal and state law,or where compliance with both is impossible.gadda,at pac.gas,at.even where congress has not entirely displaced state regulation in a specific area,state law is preempted to the extent that it actually conflicts with federal law.perhaps most relevant to the case at hand,conflict preemption exists where state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.ting,at quoting hines davidowitz.under the obstruction strand of conflict preemption,an aberrant or hostile state rule is preempted to the extent it actually interferes with the methods by which the federal statute was designed to reach its goal.ting,at quoting int l paper ouellette,d.
grays harbor argues that no actual conflict exists in this case that would require a finding of conflict preemption.but,by asking the court to set a fair price,grays harbor is invoking a state rule specifically,contract law that would interfere with the method by which the federal statute was designed to reach it goals specifically,ferc regulation of wholesale electricity rates to permit grays harbor to receive in its court action what is essentially a refund would create a conflict with ferc authority over wholesale rates.and such a result would make state law stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress under the fpa.
therefore,we find that conflict preemption applies here.
the filed rate doctrine 
closely related to these preemption issues is the filed rate doctrine.this doctrine,applied in a variety of contexts,is grounded in an agency exclusive authority.tanc,at.at its most basic,the filed rate doctrine provides that state law,and some federal law antitrust law,may not be used to invalidate a filed rate nor to assume a rate would be charged other than the rate adopted by the federal agency in question.id.at see also.gas,at.under the filed rate doctrine,n o court may substitute its own judgment on reasonableness for the judgment of the commission.t he filed rate doctrine has prohibited not just a state court or a federal court applying state law from setting a rate different from that chosen by ferc,but also from assuming a hypothetical rate different from that actually set by ferc.tanc,at.
the relief sought by grays harbor would require the court to set damages by assuming a hypothetical rate,the fair value,in violation of the filed rate doctrine.see tanc,at finding that claim that rates were procured by fraud are barred under the filed rate doctrine because any award of damages would interfere with ferc authority.
grays harbor describes at length the reasons why the filed rate doctrine should not apply here,but its arguments all center on the nature of the rates at issue in this case.grays harbor contends that the per megawatt hour that was charged was not filed with ferc and approved by ferc before it was charged.in short,according to grays harbor,ferc simply did not set any rates.grays harbor contends that to apply the filed rate doctrine to rates that have not been filed with ferc would be an unwise and unprecedented expansion of the doctrine.
but,as described above,the rate regime established by ferc continues ferc oversight of the rates charged.ferc only permits power sales at rates after scrutinizing whether the seller and its affiliates do not have,or have adequately mitigated,market power in generation and transmission and can not erect other barriers to entry.idaho power,wl,at.accordin
