before us are two petitions for review filed by boston edison company concerning contracts allocating output from,and costs associated with,operation of its pilgrim nuclear power station in plymouth,massachusetts.in one case,boston edison seeks review of federal energy regulatory commission ferc orders reducing its rate of return on common equity in the pilgrim plant and directing refunds to montaup and commonwealth electric companies.in the other,boston edison claims that amendments terminating its contracts with montaup and commonwealth upon the recent sale of the pilgrim plant have extinguished any rights to these refunds.
the pertinent facts track the life cycle of the pilgrim plant.on august,four months before the unit became operational,boston edison entered into virtually identical entitlement contracts with montaup and with commonwealth,then known as the new bedford gas and edison light company.each was entitled to percent of pilgrim output in return for bearing percent of costs and expenses,including,as part of total financing and income tax expenses,a return of percent on common percent of the original capital for the plant.boston edison promptly filed both contracts with ferc as rate schedules commonwealth and montaup.
midway in the pilgrim progress from birth to projected retirement,boston edison and montaup amended their contract,assertedly to allay boston edison concerns about its ability to recover its full actual costs and to provide for the possibility that the plant might outlive the contract term.effective january,the amendment added decommissioning as an allocable expense and altered boston edison chargeable return on common equity from percent to the return allowed by the massachusetts department of public utilities in boston edison most recent retail rate decision.
the department of public utilities,later renamed the department of telecommunications and energy,was already responsible for approving the permissible rates of return on common equity for the percent of pilgrim output that boston edison retailed directly the amendment in the montaup contract,and similar modifications in boston edison other entitlement contracts,sought to make the state decisions binding as to the remaining percent that boston edison sold wholesale the amendment in commonwealth contract,made in,kept its return on equity at percent until a pending docket before the state utility commission set a new rate,or until the next retail decision if no rate was set in that docket.the montaup and commonwealth amendments,which also made other changes not pertinent here,were filed with ferc.
as initially filed,the amendments bound montaup and commonwealth to whatever rate the massachusetts agency approved for boston edison retail customers,with no upper limit.each amendment,however,was followed by boston edison filing with ferc of a rate schedule supplement,establishing a specific ceiling on common equity rates of return.each supplement said that if the state agency were to approve a retail rate of return above the ceiling,boston edison may file an application with ferc pursuant to terms of section of the federal power act d to temporarily modify said ceiling.
absent such an application,the supplement fixed the ceiling for montaup at percent,and the supplement set the ceiling for commonwealth at percent,which was also the original and interim contractual rate for commonwealth.according to boston edison,the state agency never established a retail rate higher than percent thus that rate applied to montaup contract until its termination in.similarly,because no new rate resulted from the state docket pending in,commonwealth,under its amended contract,continued to pay at the percent rate.the use of section to lift these ceilings,therefore,remained a moot issue.
in november,anticipating the substantial costs of dismantling the pilgrim nuclear power plant,boston edison filed a petition under section for an increase in decommissioning expenses.boston edison,at.ferc accepted the increased charges for filing,but suspended them pending a hearing based on a preliminary judgment that they might not be just and reasonable.id.at see e.at the same time,believing that the rates of return being collected on common equity might be similarly suspect,ferc began an investigation into existing rates under section a of the act,a.
after a hearing in september,a ferc administrative law judge alj found the additional decommissioning charges just and reasonable subject to an adjustment not here at issue,but the and percent returns applicable,respectively,to montaup and to commonwealth on common equity unjust and unreasonable within the meaning of section.boston edison,at,initial decision.the alj recommended a new return on common equity of percent,effective from march.in so doing,the alj rejected boston edison argument that,under the doctrine,the agency could modify the contractual rates only if they adversely affect the public interest,federal power com sierra pacific power.accord united gas pipe line mobile gas serv.
on december,ferc released its own decision on review of the alj order.boston edison,at,opinion.ferc summarily affirmed the alj conclusion that the just and reasonable standard pertained,and applying his recommended rate of percent for the period from march,to june,ordered refunds for that period pursuant to b.ferc also directed boston edison to file a new schedule using a rate of percent prospectively to reflect a rise in treasury bond yields since the alj recommendation was made.
ferc subsequently denied boston edison petition for rehearing.boston edison,at,opinion.the rehearing order is important,however,because in it ferc provided a new and distinct rationale for its earlier conclusion that the use of the just and reasonable standard was consistent with the doctrine.the overall effect of ferc two orders was to require a reduction in boston edison rates for montaup and commonwealth and refunds amounting to almost million.
the events bearing on the present case include one other transaction and separate ferc proceedings.earlier in before opinion issued,ferc in separate dockets approved boston edison sale of the pilgrim plant to entergy.boston edison entergy nuclear generation,order on sale of facilities,rate filings,and petition for declaratory order boston edison entergy nuclear generation,order conditionally authorizing sale of jurisdictional facilities.in these dockets,ferc accepted termination amendments to boston edison entitlement contracts with montaup and commonwealth which stated that the contracts would be terminated upon pilgrim sale,to be replaced by new arrangements with entergy.boston edison transferred the pilgrim plant to entergy on july.
in its compliance filing made in response to opinion,and in a petition for rehearing of opinion,boston edison argued that the termination amendments had extinguished montaup and commonwealth rights to the refunds mandated in those opinions.ferc concluded otherwise and,in a single order,rejected boston edison compliance filing and request for rehearing.boston edison,at,order denying rehearing and rejecting compliance filing.
boston edison has now petitioned this court for review of the orders reflected in opinions and,and for review of the january,order.see b.its central claim is that ferc has no authority to alter the contract rates,or to order refunds based on such an alteration,unless ferc first finds that the existing contracts are contrary to the public interest under.in the alternative,boston edison argues that any refund claims that montaup and commonwealth had under the two opinions were extinguished by the termination amendments on the sale of the pilgrim plant.ferc and montaup support the orders under review commonwealth,which is now an affiliate of boston edison,stands silent.
to understand requires a brief step back to the regulatory scheme.in regulating electricity rates,the federal power act follows with variations a model the utility sets the rates in the first instance,a,subject to a basic statutory obligation that rates be just and reasonable and not unduly discriminatory or preferential,id.a b.ferc,which inherited the powers of its predecessor the federal power commission,can investigate a newly filed rate section,id.e,or an existing rate section,id.a,and,if the rate is inconsistent with the statutory standard,order a change in the rate to make it conform to that standard,id.e,a b.
the procedural incidents and ferc ability to provide refunds vary depending on whether the proceeding is one to investigate a new rate filing or an existing rate.for example,in the former case,the burden is on the utility to show that its rate is lawful,e,and,in the latter,the burden is on the ferc staff or the customer to show that the rate is unlawful,id.b.in both circumstances,however,the statutory test of lawfulness is phrased in the same terms.what the decisions did,in certain of the cases where the utility and its customer have made a contract governing the rates to be charged,was to drive a wedge between the two sections,and vary the statutory standard in a way that no one can discern from the statutory language alone.see sierra,at.
traditionally,contracts fixing utility or carrier rates have been anathema to the courts because,almost by definition,they suggest different treatment of customers in contravention of the basic principle of.see,new york united states.but the customers in interstate sales of electricity and natural gas sales have tended to be big companies,and negotiated contracts formed a useful means of allocating risks.when congress imposed rate regulation in the federal power act,and then again in the natural gas act,it contrast to its initially pure regulation of railroads and telephone contracts between individual parties could also be used to set rates.see,d,a.
in the mobile and sierra decisions,the supreme court sought to mesh this new respect for contracts under the federal power and natural gas acts with the traditional scheme of regulation.it held that where the electrical utility or natural gas company and its customer have contracted for a particular rate,and the agency has accepted the contract for filing and then allowed the rate to become effective,the utility can not unilaterally,without the customer consent file a new rate under section to supersede the rate and the agency power under section to alter the existing contract rate under the just and reasonable standard is also curtailed.sierra,at.accord mobile,at.same as to sections and of the natural gas act.for example,ferc can not order an increase in a rate merely by finding that the rate is unreasonably low in the traditional sense that it is insufficient to produce a reasonable return on capital for the seller.sierra,at.accord northeast utilities serv.ferc,cir.
instead,importing a term that does not appear in the rate regulation provisions of the federal power act or the natural gas act,the supreme court said that the contract rate could be raised only if it offended the public interest and the example given was of a rate so low that it threatened the survival of the utility,excessively burdened other consumers,or imposed undue discrimination.sierra,at.this solution based on a public interest standard,although created out of whole cloth makes practical sense when one understands the facts out of which mobile and sierra arose,namely,blatant attempts to raise rates by sellers in violation of their contracts.but it left open several further problems,such as when the contract should be read as setting a binding rate and what circumstances might justify ferc supplanting a contract rate as contrary to the public interest.
it is easy enough to understand why boston edison invoked the doctrine.its original contracts,as modified by the and supplements,initially agreed to specified rates of return on equity percent to be paid by montaup and percent for commonwealth rates that,in the end,were never changed ferc ordered future rate reductions for boston edison and refunds for the two customers on the premise that the just and reasonable rates of return were less than those provided for in the contracts and actually charged.see,at.and ferc never found that the higher rates of return fixed by contract were contrary to the public interest.
the alj basic answer to,summarily adopted by ferc in its initial order opinion,was straightforward.he reasoned that the contractual intent to disable ferc from using the just and reasonable standard must be clear,at that the rate of return provision of the pilgrim contracts contain no restrictions on changes to the rates for any period of time,that the agreements contain a general laws,regulations and approvals clause making them subject to agency regulation,and that this clause c learly contemplates review of the rate of return at any time as the commission deems necessary under the just and reasonable standard,id.
ferc is entitled to some deference in construing contracts where the sales are subject to ferc regulation.united gas pipe line memphis light,gas water,d see also boston edison ferc,cir.but no one reading these contracts at the time they were written would doubt that the parties had bargained for a specific rate of return at the outset or,under the amendments,for a formula or method of fixing those rates of return.richmond power,at.and the period of time was obviously the duration of the contract,unless the parties agreed to changes themselves,as they did in the and amendments,or unless ferc overrode the contracts with a public interest finding.
the doctrine has hung over the electric power and natural gas industries since,and the two cases are probably among the dozen public utility decisions by the supreme court in this century.at least until recently,anyone bargaining in the shadow of the doctrine would assume that a contract unconditionally setting a fixed rate,or a fixed rate of return,would be governed by.see,at.this was certainly so in when the pilgrim plant contract framework was constructed and the and amendments only varied the method for identifying the proper rate of return in that formula.nothing in the amendments suggests that the parties had a later intent to enlarge ferc authority to reduce the rates.the only aspect of the contractual relationship that suggests the parties intended any ferc involvement beyond may be found in the amendment supplements,but those merely give ferc an option to increase those rates if the state agency adopts ones above the cap.
in,as today,the parties could negate the protection afforded by by providing that a contract rate initially fixed by the parties and filed with ferc could be overridden by ferc at any time under the just and reasonable standard.see memphis light,at.see also papago tribal utility auth.ferc,cert.denied,d kansas cities ferc.the alj said that the parties had effectively done just this by the laws,regulations and approvals clause.it reads as follows to make clear his reasoning,we add the emphasis supplied by the alj 
this agreement is made subject to present and future federal,state and local laws and to present and future regulations and orders properly issued by federal,state and local bodies having jurisdiction and performance hereunder is conditioned upon securing and retaining such federal,state and local governmental and regulatory approvals,grants and permits as may from time to time be necessary.
the opening portion of the clause made subject to is the standard boilerplate inserted by lawyers to protect against lawful supervening directives.it is very hard to read it either as adopting the just and reasonable standard for rate review or as making lawful a ferc rate order that would be unlawful under.the closing performance hereunder portion of the clause,which contains the language underscored by the alj,clearly pertains to regulatory actions such as the grant of a construction or operating license and not to rate decisions.in short,the rationale of the alj,which ferc initially adopted by,is not persuasive.
our view of the matter accords with the most recent decision of the circuit on both points,namely,that the specification of a rate or formula by itself implicates unless the parties negate the implication and that a generally framed boilerplate clause like the laws,regulations and approvals clause here does not constitute such a negation.texaco,ferc,appalachian power federal power comm n,cert.denied,d.texaco arguably impairs the circuit earlier decision in kansas cities,at,here relied upon by ferc but that case is distinguishable in any event the truth is that the cases,even within the circuit itself,do not form a completely consistent pattern.compare,texaco,at,with union pac.fuels,ferc.
on rehearing,ferc reaffirmed its support for the alj rationale but,understandably uneasy texaco had been decided in the meantime,offered a new rationale for avoiding.reverting to a staff argument mentioned but not relied on by the alj,ferc rehearing order noted that in the and contract amendments,boston edison had consented to numerical caps on the rate of return that governed under the contracts,even if the state authorized a retail rate above the cap levels but the utility had also reserved a right to ask ferc under section to approve the,rates under a just and reasonable standard,at.in short,the contract provided a cap but also a safety valve.
ferc said that because this cap and safety valve regime employed the just and reasonable standard to protect boston edison,it made as a matter of contract interpretation and regulatory employ the same standard in reviewing rates below the cap,at.in reality,it makes sense under neither criterion,and ferc should not be resorting to such an argument it fosters the impression that the agency will say anything it needs to achieve its ends,ends that could probably be achieved prospectively with a modicum of forethought,effort,and candor.
starting with contract interpretation,the cap and safety valve is a regime patently designed to protect interstate purchasers from paying an excessive rate of return that might be fixed by the state agency in consideration of local purchasers.thus a cap was imposed at the top,with no corresponding minimum floor but since the cap itself might prove to be too confining under certain economic conditions,the safety valve was added to allow boston edison to escape the cap assuming ferc approved.nothing in this balanced solution suggests that,in agreeing that the state rate should otherwise be binding,the parties intended to negate the ordinary,default rule that governed changes,texaco,at.
as to the supposed policy grounds invoked by ferc,ferc says that boston edison is attempting to bind ferc to a stricter public interest standard than that to which the party is itself bound,at,the latter obviously referring to boston edison option to seek to exceed the cap under the just and reasonable standard.this is rhetoric rather than policy.premise is that the parties can nullify ferc authority to make changes in private contracts except when required in the public interest if this is so,it is not a further infringement of ferc authority for the parties to reserve an area within which ferc retains limited authority under a different standard here,just and reasonable to police one area of special concern.
whether and when applies in varying contexts is going to remain in confusion unless and until ferc makes up its mind and squarely confronts the underlying issues.it is not at all clear to us that ferc,which is now becoming hostile to,needs to tolerate it at all.ferc has reasonably broad powers to regulate the substantive terms of filings that it accepts and allows to become effective,whether they are ordinary tariffs or contracts,see in re permian basin area rate cases,d and such powers may include the power to require prospectively,by regulation,that all contracts set their rates subject to ferc just and reasonable standard.obviously,we do not decide the point,and whether it would be good policy is a very different question 
alternatively,if ferc were neutral toward or opposed to such clauses but wanted to eliminate much of the existing uncertainty as to the parties intent,it might prescribe prospectively the terms that parties would have to use to invoke protection.this would at least be a more winning approach than efforts to impose such requirements ad hoc,and,as here,after contracts have been drafted,signed,accepted for filing by ferc,and implemented.see,san diego gas public serv,june,florida power light,may,southern.arguably,such regulations as to form would more easily survive judicial scrutiny than a general ban on contract provisions seeking to invoke.
ferc is not entirely to be blamed for the present confusion some of the problems arise from the failure of the parties to be clear about their intentions,see,memphis light,at.some from changing attitudes of the courts and the agency,see,kansas cities,at and some from wholesale confusion about just what concrete circumstances would allow a contract to be overridden under,see,transmission access policy study group ferc.but ferc should stop trying to deals that the parties have already made under the aegis of it properly invokes the public interest instead take the longer view and decide what it wants or does not want in new contracts.
even though we conclude that applies in this case,ferc might still override the contract rates in question on remand by determining that they are contrary to the public interest.sierra,at.mobile,at.admittedly,the rates are too high for the period in question to be just and reasonable or at least boston edison has chosen not to contest this ruling but are they so high as to be contrary to the public what would this mean anyway see generally northeast utils.serv.ferc,cir.very little useful precedent exists ferc has made no findings and offered no interpretation of the concept in this case and the parties have not briefed the issue on appeal.certainly,we have no interest in anticipating it.
on remand,the parties are free to litigate the public interest issue before ferc,but it is worth suggesting that this is a case best resolved by settlement.boston edison has sold pilgrim,and new contracts are in force between the new owner entergy and montaup and commonwealth.as to refunding past payments,the only issue is money,and the parties are likely to waste much of it on lawyers fees by litigating the public interest issue which,being terra incognita as to rate reductions,promises further appellate strife however it might be resolved by ferc.
there remains boston edison alternative claim on appeal that,even if it owed refunds as determined by ferc,montaup and commonwealth surrendered their rights when they signed the termination agreements.if we thought this argument were correct,it would waste everyone time to remand the case to see whether refunds could be justified by analyzing the rates under the public interest standard the termination amendments would waive any refund claims regardless of the standard used to invalidate the rates actually charged.we conclude,however,that boston edison waiver argument fails on the merits.
at the outset,ferc says that boston edison waiver argument should be rejected because not properly preserved.it relies upon a provision of the federal power act that says no proceeding to review any order of the commission shall be brought by any person unless such person shall have made application to the commission for a rehearing thereon.a.this is in substance an provision but,being statutory in character,it is somewhat less susceptible to the implied exceptions that courts have liberally devised where the exhaustion requirement is created by the courts rather than congress,mccarthy madigan,d coit independence joint venture federal sav.and loan ins,d.
what happened here is that the termination amendments were filed in april and became effective in july,more than two years after boston edison had petitioned for rehearing of the refunds ordered in opinion.once ferc denied rehearing of that decision in september in opinion,boston edison invoked the termination amendments as a separate defense to refunds first in early october by including the argument in its opinion compliance filing,and then again later in october in more abbreviated form in a petition for rehearing of opinion.the parties then exchanged arguments on the issue in briefs addressed to th
