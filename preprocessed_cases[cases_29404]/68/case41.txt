plaintiff niagara mohawk power corporation niagara is a utility engaged in the business of generating and distributing electric power to consumers in the state of new york.seeking relief from a number of contracts that it had entered into with qualifying cogeneration facilities qfs,niagara sued the federal energy regulatory commission ferc,the new york state public service commission the psc,and the individual commissioners of the psc.niagara claims derive in large part from the public utility regulatory policies act of purpa,et,which congress enacted to promote economic growth by reducing the nation reliance on oil and gas,to encourage the development of alternative energy sources and thereby to combat a nationwide energy crisis.niagara mohawk power fed.energy regulatory comm n,d,niagara.
section of purpa title ii,encourages the development of cogeneration and small power production facilities,which congress believed would reduce the demand for traditional fossil fuels.section a,a,directs ferc,in consultation with state regulatory authorities,to promulgate rules necessary to encourage such power production,including rules requiring utilities to offer to sell electricity to,and purchase electricity from,qfs.section f obligates state regulatory agencies such as the psc to implement ferc rules through their own rulemaking,in particular those pertaining to electric utilities obligation to purchase power from qfs.f.
purpa and its regulations prohibit ferc from provid ing for a rate which exceeds the incremental cost to the electric utility of alternative electric energy.b.an electric utility incremental cost is the cost that the utility would incur in generating the electric energy itself or purchasing it from another source.d.incremental cost is also referred to as avoided cost.b.
in,the new york legislature enacted new york public service law,which provided that the psc would require electric utilities to enter into agreements for the purchase of electricity from qfs.the psc was charged with overseeing the contracting process,including approval of the contracts and setting power purchase rates.new york initially did not adopt purpa avoided cost ceiling for electricity purchases.in,section was amended to require the psc to establish a minimum sales price of at least six cents per kilowatt hour for power purchased from state qualifying qfs.this amendment is commonly referred to as the law.the new york legislature amended section again in,partially repealing the law.the amendment,however,preserved the minimum rate with respect to certain contracts executed and filed with the psc on or before june,including the agreements at issue here.pub.serv.law mckinney.
niagara initiated this action in may.its first amended complaint alleged that the incremental cost limitation contained in purpa and ferc implementing regulations preempts both the new york legislature ability to enact the law and the psc ability to enforce it.the complaint alleged one claim against the psc and its commissioners,for violations of purpa,purpa regulations,and the supremacy clause of the constitution,const.art.vi,cl,and one claim against ferc,for violations of purpa and the administrative procedure act the apa,et.
defendants moved to dismiss the complaint pursuant to.b and,arguing that there was no federal subject matter jurisdiction over niagara claims and that,in any event,niagara failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.the district court norman mordue,judge granted defendants motion and dismissed the complaint in its entirety,in part for a lack of subject matter jurisdiction and in part for failure to state a claim.niagara,d.for a detailed discussion of the factual background and procedural history of this case,see the district court thorough opinion.niagara,d at.
we affirm the district court dismissal of niagara complaint,albeit on slightly different reasoning.we agree with the district court analysis with respect to the claims against ferc,which were properly dismissed with prejudice,and the purpa claim against the psc and its commissioners,which was properly dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because of niagara failure to exhaust its administrative remedy by pursuing the claim with ferc in the first instance.we disagree,however,with the district court analysis with respect to the supremacy clause claim against the psc and its commissioners,which also should have been dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because of niagara failure to exhaust its administrative remedy.
discussion 
we review the district court dismissal of niagara complaint de novo,accepting all factual allegations contained in the complaint as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in niagara favor.chambers time warner,cir.dismissal is appropriate only if it appears beyond doubt that niagara can prove no set of facts in support of its claim which would entitle it to relief.see conley gibson,d.
claims against ferc 
niagara alleges two claims against ferc,one for violation of purpa and one for violation of the apa.while ostensibly independent of each other,these claims share a common legal theory that ferc refusal to apply the incremental and avoided cost limitations of purpa and its regulations under purpa to niagara existing qf contracts constitutes a violation of both purpa and the apa.first am.compl.for declaratory and injunctive relief compl.for the reasons discussed below,we believe that the district court properly dismissed both of these claims.see niagara,d at.
purpa claim 
as the district court held,niagara can not maintain a claim against ferc under purpa for the simple reason that no such claim exists.the only private right of action under purpa arises from h b of that statute.see h b.that subsection permits a ny electric utility,qualifying cogenerator,or qualifying small power producer to petition ferc to enforce purpa against a state regulatory authority or nonregulated electric utility and,if ferc does not initiate an enforcement action,to bring an action in district court to require such state regulatory authority or nonregulated electric utility to comply with purpa.id.because ferc is neither a state regulatory authority nor a nonregulated electric utility,niagara may not sue ferc under purpa.see compl.stating that ferc is an agency of the united states see also state gas saranac power partners,d,psc can not sue ferc under the guise of a section h enforcement action,aff,cir nyseg.accordingly,the district court correctly dismissed this claim.
niagara also asserts a claim against ferc under the apa.in order to pursue such a claim,niagara must show that either the ferc action of which niagara seeks judicial review is made reviewable by statute or there is no other adequate remedy in a court.niagara does not argue that any statute provides for judicial review of ferc decisions interpreting purpa and,indeed,no statute so provides.niagara does argue,however,that it has no other adequate judicial remedy.in particular,niagara argues that unless it can obtain judicial review of ferc ruling under the apa in an action against ferc,its remedy against the psc is not adequate.br.for at.we disagree.as the district court noted,the court of appeals for the circuit ruled,in a previous stage of this litigation,that a district court is perfectly capable of determin ing whether ferc interpretation of purpa is reasonable even if ferc chooses not to intervene.niagara,d at quoting niagara mohawk power fed.energy regulatory comm n,alteration in original 
moreover,the complaint itself acknowledged that niagara may obtain complete relief with respect to all of the contracts at issue if the minimum rate provision of the law is declared invalid and niagara is permitted to withdraw its tariff and file a substitute tariff eliminating any reference to the rate established by the law.compl.see also br.for at stating that adequate relief could be obtained by a declaration of the invalidity of the law and an order directing the psc to accept a tariff filing eliminating reference to the rate.niagara does not explain,and we can not see,why ferc absence from the litigation woul
