wepco,an electric utility that is the plaintiff in this diversity suit for breach of contract governed by wisconsin law,appeals from the grant of summary judgment to the defendant,the union pacific railroad.the contract was for the transportation of coal to wepco from coal mines in colorado between the beginning of and the end of.the appeal presents two issues whether a force majeure clause in the contract authorized the railroad to increase its rate for shipping the coal,and whether the railroad breached its duty of performance of its contractual obligations by failing to ship the tonnage requested by wepco on railcars supplied by the railroad.
the doctrine of impossibility in the common law of contracts excuses performance when it would be unreasonably costly and sometimes downright impossible for a party to carry out its contractual obligations.if the doctrine is successfully invoked,the contract is rescinded without liability.the standard explanation for the doctrine is that nonperformance is not a breach if it is caused by a circumstance the of which was a basic assumption on which the contract was made.restatement second of contracts,introductory note to ch,preceding,quoting ucc.but this explanation leaves unexplained why parties to a contract would have assumed that a condition would not occur that has occurred.was it just a lack of foresight or is the idea behind the doctrine,rather,that the parties,had they negotiated with reference to the contingency that has come to pass and has made performance infeasible or fearfully burdensome,would have excused performance the latter is the more promising line of inquiry,and is the line we took in northern indiana public service carbon county coal,cir,where we said that the proper question in an impossibility case is whether the promisor nonperformance should be excused because the parties,if they had thought about the matter,would have wanted to assign the risk of the contingency that made performance impossible or uneconomical to the promisor or to the promisee if to the latter,the promisor is excused.id.at.impossibility is thus a doctrine for shifting risk to the party better able to bear it,either because he is in a better position to prevent the risk from materializing or because he can better reduce the disutility of the risk as by insuring if the risk does occur.id.at see also associated gas distributors ferc.
liability for breach of contract is strict,globe refining landa cotton oil.holmes,evra swiss bank,cir restatement,supra,introductory note to ch,preceding,which makes the performing party an insurer against the consequences of his failing to perform,even if the failure is not his fault.but formal insurance contracts contain limits of coverage,and the impossibility doctrine in effect caps the insurance coverage that strict liability for breach of contract provides.northern indiana public service carbon county coal,supra,at.the analogy is to a provision in a fire insurance contract that excepts from coverage a fire caused by an act of war.so it is no surprise that in allanwilde transport vacuum oil,the doctrine of impossibility was successfully invoked when a wartime embargo prevented the performance of a shipping contract because the ship could not complete its voyage.see also israel luckenbach,cir.
parties can,however,contract around the doctrine,because it is just a gap filler,first national bank atlantic,cir united states general douglas macarthur senior village,cir allan farnsworth,farnsworth on contracts,ed a guess at what the parties would have provided in their contract had they thought about the contingency that has arisen and has prevented performance or made it much more costly.as holmes explained,the consequences of a binding promise at common law are not affected by the degree of power which the promisor possesses over the promised event in the case of a binding promise that it shall rain,the immediate legal effect of what the promisor does is,that he takes the risk of the event,within certain defined limits,as between himself and the promisee.he does no more when he promises to deliver a bale of cotton.holmes,the common law see field container icc,cir.the key is binding promise.to defeat the application of the doctrine of impossibility the contract must state that the promisor must pay damages even if he commits a breach that could not have been prevented at a reasonable cost.
modern contracting parties often do contract around the doctrine,though not by making the promisor liable for any and every failure to by specifying the failures that will excuse performance.the clauses in which they do this are called force majeure superior force clauses.the name suggests a purpose similar to that of the impossibility doctrine.but it is essential to an understanding of this case that a force majeure clause must always be interpreted in accordance with its language and context,like any other provision in a written contract,rather than with reference to its name.it is not enough to say that the parties must have meant that performance would be excused if it would be impossible within the meaning that the word has been given in cases interpreting the common law doctrine.perlman pioneer.partnership,cir ppg industries,shell oil,cir williams cary wright,force majeure delays,construction lawyer,see also gulf oil fpc,cir.
the provision at issue in this case does not specify circumstances that would make performance impossible or infeasible in any sense,and does not excuse the performing party the railroad from performing the contract.the provision is part of article xi of the contract,and some of the other provisions in the article do specify contingencies that would excuse performance,including certain acts of god.but the provision at issue merely provides that if the railroad is prevented by an event of force majeure from reloading its empty cars after it has delivered coal to wepco with iron ore destined for geneva,utah,it can charge the higher rate that the contract makes applicable to shipments that do not involve backhauling.farnsworth,supra,corbin on contracts,joseph perillo ed.for example,the rate for coal shipped from one of the colorado mines to wepco was specified as per ton if there was a backhaul shipment but if there was not.the reason for the higher rate,obviously,was that if the railroad cars were empty on the trip back to colorado,the railroad would obtain no revenue on that trip it would be underutilizing the cars.
the iron ore that the railroad freight train would have picked up in minnesota on its way back was intended for a steel mill in utah owned by the geneva steel company.the mill had been built during world war ii well inland because of fear that the japanese might attack the west coast.the company was bankrupt when the parties signed the contract.it was still operating,but obviously might cease to do so hence the provision.why the parties used the term force majeure,rather than simply providing that the railroad could charge the higher rate if the steel company stopped buying iron ore,has not been explained.more careful drafting might have averted this lawsuit.
in november the steel mill shut down,never to reopen.it was closed for good in february.a couple of months after that final closing the railroad wrote wepco to declare an event of force majeure and that henceforth it would be charging wepco the higher rate applicable to shipments without a backhaul.it did not attempt to make the rate change retroactive.had it invoked the force majeure clause when the steel mill first shut down,wepco would have incurred an extra million in shipping charges between then and the belated declaration of force majeure.
despite this windfall,wepco argues that the railroad broke the contract by invoking the force majeure clause when it did.the fact that the railroad did invoke the clause earlier shows that the shutting down of the steel mill did not prevent the railroad from charging the low,backhaul rate.well of course not it is never impossible to offer a discount.but what the contract says is that the railroad may charge the higher rate if it is prevented from reloading
