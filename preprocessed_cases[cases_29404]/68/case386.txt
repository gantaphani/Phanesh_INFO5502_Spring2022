petitioner,an owner and operator of electric generation facilities in new york city,appeals an order of the federal energy regulatory commission,arguing that the commission acted arbitrarily and capriciously in deciding that the new york independent system operator nyiso had not violated the filed rate doctrine in establishing a pair of formulae for translating installed capacity into unforced capacity.because we agree,we vacate and remand.
the new york independent system operator is a organization charged with administering new york electricity markets.among other duties,nyiso enforces rules designed to ensure the reliability of the state electricity grid.one way nyiso does this is by requiring electricity retailers referred to as entities or lses to purchase opposed to actual generators in regularly held auctions.the purchase of capacity differs from the purchase of electricity.like an option contract,the lse compensates the generator for the option of buying a specified quantity of power irrespective of whether it ultimately buys the electricity.
nyiso calculates the amount of capacity lses must purchase by multiplying each lse expected peak load by one plus a figure called the installed reserve margin,which is set by the new york state reliability council nysrc,a corporation established by nyiso.during the summer of,the period at issue here,nysrc set the installed reserve margin at.for instance,if an lse expected that the most power it would peak be mw,then that lse would have to acquire access to mw of capacity in order to maintain a cushion against shortfall.nysrc sets the installed reserve margin at a level necessary to prevent system failure from occurring probabilistically more than once every ten years.
until,nyiso denominated the lses capacity obligation in terms of installed capacity,the amount of power a generating facility can produce under ideal conditions.this approach had a significant shortcoming it gave generators little incentive to improve their reliability,leaving them free to sell their entire quantity of installed capacity regardless of how often their facilities underwent forced is,unplanned outages such as mechanical breakdowns and the like.nyiso sought to correct this problem by requiring lses to purchase unforced capacity instead of installed capacity.for those unfortunate souls not steeped in the vernacular of electricity regulation,a generator unforced capacity ucap is its installed capacity icap discounted or by its forced outage rate or equivalent forced outage rate demand eford.the forced outage rate equals the historical percentage of the generator maximum output lost to forced outages when such output is demanded.the translation of installed into unforced capacity can be represented mathematically as follows 
ucap icap x 
for example,consider a generating facility with installed capacity of mw that has historically lost of its output to forced outages.that generator would have unforced capacity of mw.if it could have sold mw in the capacity auctions before the switch from installed to unforced capacity,then after the switch it could sell only mw,giving it an incentive to reduce its forced outage rate.
having reduced the quantity of capacity generators could sell,nyiso also reduced the quantity of capacity lses had to purchase in order to reflect that they were purchasing unforced rather than installed capacity.critical to the issue in this case,nyiso used different methodologies for making the two translations.for translating generators installed capacity into unforced capacity,nyiso revisions to its services tariff filed in july the forced outage rate would be calculated from the past twelve months of outage data for each generator.nothing in the tariffs,however,specified how the lses capacity obligation would be translated,only that it would be done in accordance with the iso procedures.nyiso later filled this gap in the icap manual,a document that specified various aspects of the new system and that had been prepared as part of a stakeholder process.the icap manual explained that for purposes of translating installed capacity into unforced capacity for lses,the forced outage rate would be based on the data used to determine the installed reserve margin by the nysrc,a formulation understood to mean that nyiso would discount the lses installed capacity requirement by the average forced outage rates generators had experienced over the past ten years.
because forced outages had declined significantly over the ten years leading up to,measuring forced outage rates over two different time periods produced substantially different results the average generator forced outage rate was roughly,while the outage rate used by the lses was roughly.using a higher forced outage rate for lses than for generators effectively reduced the amount of capacity lses had to purchase,regardless of whether capacity is measured in terms of installed or unforced capacity.to see why,imagine a market that,for ease of illustration,has lses obligated collectively to buy mw of installed capacity and generators collectively possessing mw of installed capacity.in this simple scenario,supply and demand are in balance.if,however,installed capacity is translated into unforced capacity using a outage rate for buyers and a outage rate for sellers,the balance shifts.under such a scenario,lses must purchase mw of unforced capacity,but generators can sell mw of unforced capacity,creating a capacity surplus of mw or about of total supply.
in other words,using a lower forced outage rate for generators than for lses decreases the quantity of capacity sold in the market.this decrease can be measured by translating the quantity of unforced capacity sold in the above hypothetical back into installed capacity.rearranging the equation produced above yields a formula for doing so 
the generators in this example sold mw of unforced capacity and were using a forced outage rate.plugging those numbers into the above equation yields mw of installed capacity sold,substantially less than the mw sold before the application of differential forced outage rates.
following the summer of,the nysrc and nyiso staffs produced calculations using the same logic as above showing that the use of different translation methodologies for generators and lses had reduced the quantity of installed capacity sold from mw,the amount required by the nysrc formula,to mw,a mw reduction.as a result,the nysrc and nyiso staffs concluded,the actual statewide installed reserve margin had fallen from the level of to.nyiso business issues committee later wrote that the unforeseen and unintended consequence of the current translation methodology is a shortfall of installed capacity and therefore an inability to comply fully with the new york state reliability council reliability rules.accordingly,in the fall of,nyiso switched to a system in which both generators and lses measure forced outage rates over periods.
petitioner ravenswood generates electric power and sells capacity in new york city.in,ravenswood filed a complaint with the commission claiming that nyiso had violated section of the federal power act fpa,which requires public utilities to file with the commission all practices and regulations affecting their rates and charges and mandates that public utilities may only depart from such filed rates after sixty days notice to the commission and to the public.c,d.ravenswood argued that in three separate filings nyiso had obligated itself to enforce nysrc installed capacity requirements,yet by using a lower forced outage rate for generators than for lses in the summer of,nyiso had fallen well short of nysrc installed capacity requirement,thus violating the fpa.ravenswood presented economic evidence purporting to show that,by both reducing the quantity of capacity sold and,through the law of supply and demand,reducing the market price of capacity,nyiso had caused it to lose million in sales,which it asked the commission to order in refunds.
rejecting ravenswood complaint,the commission stated that the rates charged by nyiso conformed with the commission applicable orders governing nyiso i
