rhinelander paper company rhinelander seeks review of orders of the federal energy regulatory commission ferc or commission which renewed rhinelander license to operate a hydroelectric project pursuant to the federal power act fpa,et.rhinelander challenges two provisions of the license one that retains the project historical property boundary rejecting,pending preparation of a land management plan,rhinelander proposal to remove a large portion of the property from the project boundary and a second provision that requires rhinelander to develop and implement a plan to monitor invasive plant species at the project.for the following reasons,we deny rhinelander petition for review.
on june,rhinelander filed an application for a license to continue operating its megawatt hydroelectric project on the wisconsin river in oneida county,wisconsin,which has been licensed to operate since in its application rhinelander sought to modify the project boundary by removing from it some acres,most of which is privately owned,out of a total area of acres excluding the reservoir,leaving approximately acres within the project.
in november ferc opened the proceeding to comments,motions to intervene,recommendations and terms and conditions.the department of the interior,united states fish and wildlife service fws,intervened and submitted a letter dated january,which did not oppose approval of rhinelander application but offered two recommendations relevant here.
first,the fws opposed rhinelander request that ferc modify the project boundaries within the license terms.expressing concern that some of the land that rhinelander owned and proposed to remove might have high wildlife and recreational values,letter from fws to ferc at ja,the fws recommended maintaining the existing project boundary until,at least,the land that is proposed to be removed from the project boundary is clearly identified so the fws can make an informed decision.id.ja.accordingly,the fws recommended that ferc require rhinelander to prepare,in consultation with the wisconsin department of natural resources dnr,a land management plan for land owned by rhinelander to include wildlife management,forest harvest compatible with wildlife management,and protection of habitat for federal and threatened and endangered species.id.at ja 
second,the fws proposed requiring rhinelander to work with the fws and the dnr to monitor and control the spread at the project of exotic invasive plant species such as purple loosestrife lythrum salicaria and eurasian myriophyllum spicatum.the fws acknowledged there was no evidence of the plants at the project at that time but noted infestation might become a problem over the term of the license.
in march ferc staff issued a final environmental assessment final ea of the license which addressed each of the two issues raised by the fws.first,the final ea recommended that ferc modify the project boundary as rhinelander requested because the acres of land that would be excluded from the current boundary is primarily a highly developed,residential area which would not be necessary to maintain project operations and their removal would neither diminish public access to the reservoir,nor have an adverse impact on sensitive environmental features.final ea at ja.second,with regard to exotic and invasive plants,ferc final ea acknowledged there was no apparent infestation at that time but agree d with the fws recommendation to control the spread of purple loosestrife and eurasian watermilfoil.id.at ja.accordingly,the ea recommended that rhinelander,in consultation with fws and dnr,develop a plan for commission approval,to monitor purple loosestrife and eurasian milfoil in project waters and implement measure s to these species,as appropriate,id.ja,agreeing with rhinelander that any control measures implemented by rhinelander should be limited to its own property.id.at ja 
on august,ferc director of the office of energy projects director issued an order granting the license with the two provisions based on the fsw recommendations.rhinelander paper,wl.first,notwithstanding the final ea contrary recommendation,the director rejected rhinelander proposed boundary modification because he agree d with the fws that the record in this proceeding does not contain sufficient information on which to make an informed decision with respect to rhinelander proposal to reduce the amount of land within the project boundary.at.the director found specifically that rhinelander had not demonstrated that the lands at issue are not needed for project purposes,such as for a shoreline buffer zone,public recreational access,or the preservation of habitat necessary for threatened or endangered species.id.nonetheless,the director advised rhinelander that,after it filed and obtained commission approval of a land management plan pursuant to article of the license it could submit an application to amend the license to remove excess property accompanied by information adequate to address the issues identified above.id.second,the director ordered rhinelander within one year to submit for ferc approval an exotic species control plan to monitor invasive species,such as purple loosestrife and eurasian,at the project.at.the plan is to include a description of the monitoring method frequency of monitoring documentation of providing sic the monitoring results to the wisconsin dnr and fws and a description of and implementation schedule for providing public information about the species.id.
rhinelander requested rehearing on the two contested issues,which ferc denied in a february,order wl.on the request to modify the project boundaries,ferc first determined there is no need to retain in the project boundary any of the lands at issue for purposes of public recreational facilities and access.at.ferc nonetheless decided to affirm the director conclusion the ea recommendation notwithstanding that rhinelander proposal for land removal must await further information and analysis,forthcoming in the land management plan for purposes of establishing an appropriate buffer zone around the reservoir,understanding exactly where residential development has occurred the reservoir shoreline,and determining where to draw a new project boundary to best serve the public interest considerations described above.id.ferc also upheld the plant monitoring requirement as an appropriate condition pursuant to section j of the fpa,which requires ferc to include in each hydroelectric license conditions to adequately and equitably protect,mitigate damages to,and enhance,fish and wildlife including related spawning grounds and habitat,based on recommendations from federal and state resource agencies.at quoting j.
rhinelander filed a timely petition for review on april.
we review a commission licensing decision under the fpa to determine whether it was arbitrary and capricious.alabama rivers alliance ferc,citing north carolina ferc,cert.denied,d bangor.ferc.we examine each license provision separately.
we first consider ferc decision to retain the existing project boundary in the new license.under ferc regulations,a project boundary must enclose only those lands necessary for operation and maintenance of the project and for other project purposes,such as recreation,shoreline control,or protection of environmental resources.h.rhinelander contends that the lands proposed to be removed are not necessary for operation of the hydroelectric project and that ferc was therefore required under its own regulation to remove the lands from the project boundary.we disagree.
ferc grounded its decision on section a of the fpa,which directs 
that the project adopted,including the maps,plans,and specifications,shall be such as in the judgment of the commission will be best adapted to a comprehensive plan for improving or developing a waterway or waterways for the use or benefit of interstate or foreign commerce,for the improvement and utilization of development,for the adequate protection,mitigation,and enhancement of fish and wildlife including related spawning grounds and habitat,and for other beneficial public uses,including irrigation,flood control,water supply
