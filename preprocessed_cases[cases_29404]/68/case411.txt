corporation petitions for review of a federal communications commission order interpreting tariff on resales of telephone service.a provision of that tariff allows resellers to transfer their business,so long as the recipient assumes all of the transferor obligations.based on this provision,denied one reseller request to move the traffic under its plans to another reseller without a transfer of the corresponding obligations.the commission interpreted the tariff transfer provision as not addressing the movement of traffic,and ultimately held that could not refuse the transfer.we conclude that traffic is a type of service covered by the transfer provision,and that the commission contrary interpretation would render the provision meaningless.we grant the petition for review.
this case concerns the transfer of telephone service.at the time of the events in question,was the dominant carrier of such service,which it provided pursuant to tariffs filed with the fcc.under the communications act of,as amended,and the filed rate doctrine incorporated therein,neither the carrier nor its customers could depart from the terms set forth in tariffs.see c cent.office,d orloff fcc.
the tariff at issue t tariff fcc companies to purchase and resell service to small businesses around the country.the tariff refers to this resale business,as well as the underlying service itself,as wide area telecommunications service wats.any company could qualify as a reseller so long as it met the requirements of one of several plans described in the tariff.companies qualified by aggregating the wats usage of multiple small businesses into a single plan,and,under the tariff,the companies obtained service for these businesses at a discounted rate.in return,the reseller or aggregator company agreed to meet certain obligations set forth by the carrier,including commitments to purchase a certain volume of use.
in the early,as other carriers began to acquire a share of the market,the fcc began to loosen its regulation of.starting in,the commission no longer forced the carrier to offer wats only through the generic plans set forth in tariff.instead,the fcc gave the option of individually negotiating contract tariffs with particular resale companies.as contract tariffs could be drawn to offer discounts greater than those available under tariff,many resellers naturally sought to obtain them.
alfonse inga,a new jersey businessman who owned several aggregator companies,was one such reseller.in,inga undertook a series of transactions designed to move his business from tariff to a more lucrative contract tariff.first,his of which operated under cstp ii,a type of plan offered under tariff all nine of their plans to a new entity,combined companies,incorporated cci.as required by section of tariff,cci expressly agreed to assume all obligations of the transferor companies.the transfer also stipulated that cci would pass percent of its profits on to the transferor companies.second,cci attempted to negotiate a contract tariff with.third,as temporary cover until this envisioned contract tariff became a reality,or as a permanent alternative in case it never did,inga planned another between cci and public services enterprises of pennsylvania pse.pse already had a contract tariff with at a substantially larger discount on service than that available to cci under tariff.
resisted this series of transactions.fearing that cci would not have the assets to meet its obligations under the transferred plans,initially refused to implement the first transfer from the inga companies to cci unless cci paid a requirement not found in section of tariff.in,the inga companies and cci brought suit against in federal district court in new jersey,and the court ordered to drop the deposit requirement and implement the transfer.combined companies,may,unpublished opinion.
meanwhile,cci negotiations for its own contract tariff failed and cci entered into the second transfer,moving substantially all the service in its cstp ii plans to pse.as with the first transfer,the agreement called for pse to pass much of the realized profit back to cci.the second transfer,however,differed from the first in an important respect.the parties attempted to structure the transaction to avoid section of tariff,so that pse would not have to assume cci obligations on the transferred service.to do this,the parties asked to move just the service to particular traffic under cci to leave the plans themselves otherwise intact.the parties hoped that,as a result,service would be billed under pse substantially lower contract tariff rates,while cci would remain responsible for the obligations to the carrier under tariff.
balked at this second transfer as well.maintained that section applied to the transaction,and that pse thus had to assume cci obligations in order for the transfer to go through.in addition,argued that the proposed transfer violated the tariff fraudulent use provisions,as cci almost certainly would fall short of its volume commitments once the traffic was moved to pse account,and had reason to believe that cci would not have sufficient assets to pay the resulting penalties.
the same district court that compelled to accept the first transfer declined to rule on the second,holding that tariff interpretation issues were within the primary jurisdiction of the fcc.id.at.when none of the parties brought the primary jurisdiction matter to the agency,however,the district court went ahead and issued its own decision interpreting the tariff.see combined companies,unpublished opinion.the third circuit vacated this ruling as inconsistent with the primary jurisdiction referral,and ordered the sides to bring the matter to the fcc attention.combined companies,cir.may,unpublished opinion.
the specific question referred to the fcc was whether section permits an aggregator to transfer traffic under a plan without transferring the plan itself in the same transaction.id.at.while the case was pending before the commission,entered into a settlement with cci,extinguishing its wats plans and releasing all claims between the two parties.apparently as a result of this settlement,the commission took no action on the case for seven years.the inga companies,however,continued to claim damages stemming from denial of the transfer,and in the commission finally addressed the third circuit referral.
the commission held that section did not govern,and therefore did not preclude,the movement of traffic without attendant obligations.fcc memorandum opinion and order at.in particular,the commission reasoned that section applied only to the transfer of entire tariffed plans,and not to the transfer of just the traffic component of such plans.id.at.the commission also held that,even assuming the transaction constituted fraud under the tariff,the tariff did not allow to remedy such fraud by denying the transfer.id.at.in light of these holdings,the commission ruled that could not refuse the transfer.id.at.the inga companies,whose involvement in the federal district court action in new jersey is still ongoing,view the commission ruling as entitling them to millions of dollars in damages.
now petitions for review of the fcc order.
our inquiry is governed by the administrative procedure act,which requires us to uphold an fcc order unless it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.to clear this threshold,the fcc tariff interpretations must be reasonable and based upon factors within the commission expertise.global naps,fcc,citation omitted and alteration in original.thus,we will reverse the fcc only if its interpretations are not supported by substantial evidence,or the commission has made a clear error in judgment.id.same.
the commission order in this case is entirely predicated on its determination that section of tariff does not apply to the movement of traffic.at the time of the proposed transfer to pse,that section read as follows 
transfer or wide area telecommunications service may be transferred or assigned to a new customer,provided that 
b.the new customer notifies in writing that it agrees to assume all obligations of
