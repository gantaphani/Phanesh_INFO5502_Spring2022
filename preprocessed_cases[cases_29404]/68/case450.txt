in this case,southern company services along with a dozen owners of utility poles and conduits collectively,utilities or petitioners petition this court for review of three federal communications commission fcc or commission orders implementing amendments to the pole attachments act the act.under the act,the owners of poles and conduits have an obligation to lease space to companies that wish to attach cables or wires.the statute gives the fcc authority to regulate the rates,terms,and conditions in the market for attachment space and to adopt procedures necessary and appropriate to hear and resolve complaints regarding these matters.id.b.in the disputed orders,the commission announced regulations and procedures designed to assure that telecommunications providers can obtain the attachment space at just and reasonable rates.
in july,the fcc adopted a notice of proposed rule making nprm relating to the implementation of e of the telecommunications act of to amend the commission rules and policies governing pole attachments.in the matter of implementation of section e of the telecommunications act of,amendment of the commission rules and policies governing pole attachments,notice of proposed rule making,wl,reprinted in joint appendix.in february,after notice and comment,the commission announced rules governing reasonable rates for telecommunications attachments and guidelines for nondiscriminatory access to poles and conduits.implementation of section e of the telecommunications act of,amendment of the commission rules and policies governing pole attachments,report and order,wl,telecom order,reprinted in.in march,the fcc adopted a nprm relating to the maximum just and reasonable rates utilities may charge for attachments made to a pole,duct,conduit or,wl.in april,following notice and comment,the commission revised the methodology and application of the rate formula.amendment of rules and policies governing pole attachments,report and order,wl,fee order,reprinted in.finally,in may,the fcc clarified and revised its two previous orders,answering petitions from interested parties in a consolidated proceeding.in the matter of amendment of the commission rules and policies governing pole attachments in the matter of implementation of section e of the telecommunications act of,consolidated partial order on reconsideration,wl may,reconsideration order,reprinted in.
the utilities contend that the new rules exceed the fcc enforcement authority and interfere with their rights to reasonably deny pole,duct,conduit,and space.petitioners also claim that the rules betray the requirements of reasoned under the administrative procedure act apa.
on the record presented,we find that the fcc orders are premised on reasonable interpretations of the act and that the disputed rules do not interfere with petitioners rights to negotiate contracts or to deny space for legitimate reasons.certain of the disputed rules are unripe for review,so we offer no judgment on them.we otherwise hold that,in promulgating the disputed orders,the fcc took into account the relevant factors,provided reasoned explanations for its decisions,and grounded its justifications in record evidence.accordingly,we reject petitioners claim that the rules are arbitrary,capricious or contrary to law,and hereby deny the petitions for review.
background 
in,congress enacted the pole attachments act to curb tendencies that limited the growth of the communications market,see also cable telecomm.ass n,gulf power,d fcc.power,d.the cable industry relied heavily upon the space on utility poles to secure the wires that delivered the signals to consumers.since building new poles was prohibitively expensive,cable operators instead leased existing space from utilities usually electricity and telephone service companies.power,at.at utility company poles provide,under such circumstances,virtually the only practical physical medium for the installation of television cables.however,utilities often exploited their market position to charge excessively high attachment rates.to restrain this practice,congress sought to establish a mechanism whereby unfair pole attachment practices may come under review and sanction,and to minimize the effect of unjust or unreasonable pole attachment practices on the wider development of cable television service to the public.senate report,reprinted in.
the original provisions in the act gave the fcc authority to regulate the rates,terms,and conditions for attachment contracts and the authority to assure that such rates are just and reasonable.a.the act defined a pole attachment as any attachment made by a cable television system to a pole,duct,conduit or right of way controlled by a utility.id.a.under the act,the commission could set rates ranging from no less than the additional cost of providing the pole attachments to no more than the share of the total operating expenses in proportion to the percentage of space on the pole occupied by the cable carrier.id.d see also.power,at.at.the fcc jurisdiction to enforce the statute applied in all places where state agencies had not previously adopted regulations.see senate report,at.
responding to the development of telecommunications technologies during the intervening years,congress substantially amended in the telecommunications act,stat.the major changes in the act reflect the view that telecommunications companies offering new services to the public should enjoy protections similar to those that the act made available to the cable industry.see conf,reprinted in.congress determined that expanding the act scope in this manner would ultimately improve telecommunications service options for consumers.
three specific changes in the act are relevant to the present case.first,the amended statute broadens the definition of pole attachment to include connections made by cable operators or any other provider of telecommunications service to poles,ducts,conduits,or owned or controlled by a utility.a.the act also calls on the fcc to develop a separate attachment rate scheme for telecommunications providers.id.e.finally,the act requires owners to provide access to attachers seeking space on poles,ducts,conduits,and.id.f.an owner may deny space where there is insufficient capacity and for reasons of safety,reliability and generally applicable engineering purposes.id.f.
the contested issues in this case fall into four general categories.first,the commission updated its formula for allocating the cost of other than usable or unusable space.the act directs that a utility shall apportion the cost of providing space on a pole,duct,conduit,or other than the usable space among entities so that such apportionment equals of the costs of providing space other than the usable space that would be allocated to such entity under an equal apportionment of such costs among all attaching entities.id.e.thus,the maximum rate for any single attacher decreases as the total number of attaching entities grows.in the reconsideration order,the fcc announced that it would calculate the costs for unusable space based on the following definition 
the term attaching entities includes,without limitation and consistent with the pole attachment act,any telecommunications carrier,incumbent or other local exchange carrier,cable operator,government agency,and any electric or other utility,whether or not the utility provides telecommunications service to the public,as well as any other entity with a physical attachment to the pole.
reconsideration order at,footnote omitted.this position reversed the commission position in the telecom order that both municipal agencies and utilities with wires on the pole were subject to the attaching entities classification only if they provided telecommunications services.id.at,see also telecom order at.to aid in rate calculations,the commission announced that poles located in areas with more than people have a presumed average of five attachers,while poles located in areas with fewer than people have a presumed average of three attachers.reconsideration order at.
second,pursuant to e,the fcc adopted a complaint resolution process for situations when the parties fail to resolve a dispute over rate charges.under the applicable rules,an attacher may sign a contract with a utility and later file a complaint with the fcc to contest an element of that agreement deemed to be unfair.telecom order at,reconsideration order at.this is the sign and sue rule.
third,the commission adopted regulations for overlashing,a technique whereby a telecommunications provider attaches a wire to its own or,for overlashing,to other attachers existing wires.the fcc rule provides that a overlasher shares space with the host attachment and,therefore,does not qualify as an attaching entity for purposes of the attachment rate formula.reconsideration order at.this rule changed the position taken by the fcc in the telecom order.see telecom order at.the commission also clarified that an overlashing party does not need to obtain advance consent from a utility if that party has a primary wire attachment already in place.reconsideration order at.the fcc recognized,however,that a utility is entitled to notice of the overlashing,and that the utility may recover any costs incurred for strengthening the pole to support the weight of additional wires.id.
fourth,the fcc adopted rules concerning the rate formula for attachment space in conduits the hollow underground structures that carry cables and telecommunications wires.in both the fee order and the reconsideration order,the commission determined that conduits contain no unusable space.id.at,fee order at.the commission found that any conduit area that could be utilized for a specific purpose was usable and therefore was subject to the rate formula 
a n electric utility is allowed to reserve capacity for future business purposes under a bona fide business plan,but must allow that capacity to be used for attachments until an actual business need arises.for whatever reason capacity may be reserved or designated for special uses,by or on behalf of the utility,and regardless of who may benefit directly or indirectly from those uses,the capacity is available for use and therefore remains part of the total capacity of the conduit for rate determination purposes.
reconsideration order at,footnotes omitted.the fcc also adopted an administrative presumption that each conduit attachment occupies only half the space within each duct,a subsection of the conduit.id.at,telecom order at.just as it found that its presumptions for the number of entities on a pole were rebuttable,the agency noted that any utility could offer data showing that specific attachments actually used a greater share of duct space.id.
ii.analysis 
petitioners assert that the disputed rules and procedures should be vacated,because they violate the act and betray the precepts of reasoned under a of the apa,a.
in deciding whether to defer to the fcc construction of the pole attachments act,we adhere to the tests enunciated by the supreme court in chevron natural resources defense council,d,and united states mead,d.in chevron,the court held that,i f the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.at.at.this is chevron step one review.if congress has not directly addressed the precise question at issue,and the agency has acted pursuant to an express or implicit delegation of authority,the agency interpretation of the statute is entitled to deference so long as it is reasonable and not otherwise arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute.id.at.at.this is chevron step two review.mead reinforces chevron command that chevron deference to an agency interpretation of a statute is due only when it appears that congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law,and that the agency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority.mead,at.at.
in this case,there is no doubt that the fcc promulgated the new rules pursuant to congressionally delegated authority and that the disputed orders purport to have the force of law.petitioners contend,however,that certain provisions in the new rules exceed the commission authority under the act.we reject this contention.the intent of congress is not unambiguously expressed in the provisions of the act at issue in this case.nonetheless,the fcc constructions of the act are entirely reasonable and thus deserving of deference under chevron step two.
petitioners also contend that,whether or not the new rules reflect permissible interpretations of the statute,they should be vacated as arbitrary and capricious under the apa.in motor vehicle mfrs.state farm mut.auto.ins,d,the supreme court explained the apa arbitrary and capricious test,as follows 
the scope of review under the arbitrary and capricious standard is narrow and a court is not to substitute its judgment for that of the agency.nevertheless,the agency must examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.in reviewing that explanation,we must consider whether the decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment.normally,an agency rule would be arbitrary and capricious if the agency has relied on factors which congress has not intended it to consider,entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem,offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency,or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.the reviewing court should not attempt itself to make up for such deficiencies we may not supply a reasoned basis for the agency action that the agency itself has not given.we will,however,uphold a decision of less than ideal clarity if the agency path may reasonably be discerned.
id.at.at citations omitted.as the court makes clear,the scope of judicial review under this standard is narrow.pursuant to this standard,we can find no basis for overturning the agency rules at issue in this case.
a.the pole space rules 
the act sets forth fairly general rules regarding allocations of the cost of usable and unusable space for attachments.see d,e.as noted above,the rate for any single attaching entity varies inversely with the total number of attachers.reconsideration order at.in applying the statute,the commission rules prescribe that any party with a physical attachment is an attaching entity.reconsideration order at.this means that even municipalities and utility owners themselves may be deemed attaching entities.petitioners challenge this rule,claiming that the statute only allows telecommunications and cable companies to be counted as attaching entities.
petitioners view of the statute is wrong.the specific provision at issue,e,merely says that the fcc must equally apportion costs among all attaching entities.petitioners argue,however,that the statutory definitions of pole attachment,a,and telecommunications carrier,a,which do not include utilities and municipalities,show that congress meant to exclude utilities and municipalities from the category of attaching entities.this argument fails,because the cited provisions do not establish what parties qualify as attaching entities for purposes of apportioning costs under e.in fact,to the extent the act mentions entities at all,the term bears different meanings depending upon the context.compare id.h describing obligations of an owner and any entity when either modifies a pole attachment,with id.i prohibiting charges to a party for attachment changes by any other entity including owners.the most that can be said is that e is unclear on whether utilities or municipalities count as attaching entities for purpose of apportioning costs.
the fcc decision to count utilities among attaching entities is an eminently reasonable interpretation of the statute.the fcc reasoned that its broader definition better reflects the operative language in the act.congress chose not to use a more specific term like telecommunications c
