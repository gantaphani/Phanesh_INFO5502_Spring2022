commissioners john strand,john shea,and david svanda of the michigan public service commission the mpsc appeal from the district court grant of a declaratory judgment in favor of verizon north,verizon in verizon suit challenging a february,order of the mpsc the february order or the order.verizon,an incumbent local telecommunications carrier in michigan,alleged that the order conflicted with,and was preempted by,the federal telecommunications act of the fta or the act,stat.codified in various sections of to the extent that it required incumbents to offer network elements and services to competitors through published tariffs and to combine unbundled network elements for competitors.the district court agreed and granted injunctive relief from both aspects of the order.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the district court judgment with respect to the tariff requirement,but vacate the judgment with respect to the bundling requirement.
this is the second time that this case has reached this court.in our first decision,issued on april,we explained the history and substance of the action brought by verizon which at the time was still gte 
in december,the mpsc initiated state law proceedings against gte and other incumbent local exchange carriers,or lecs in order to establish terms of interconnection to michigan local exchange networks generally in connection with these general interconnection proceedings,the mpsc required gte and ameritech,as michigan lecs,to file with the commission total service long run incremental cost tslric studies for both regulated and telecommunications services.in addition,the mpsc directed gte to publish tariffs in which gte would offer to sell its network elements and wholesale services to any interested party at rates predetermined by the commission.gte responded to the commission order by filing a petition for rehearing in which gte challenged the mpsc rates for unbundled loops as confiscatory in violation of the fta.the mpsc denied gte petition for rehearing,and gte appealed the mpsc order to the michigan court of appeals.on december,the court affirmed the mspc order,and the mpsc proceeded to use gte and ameritech tslric studies to determine prices for new entrants access to bundled and unbundled network elements and basic local exchange services throughout michigan.
on february,in the course of the state proceedings against gte and ameritech,the mpsc issued the order contested in this appeal.in the february order,the mpsc used gte tslric studies to establish the rates at which gte would be compelled to sell unbundled network elements to its competitors.in addition,the order stated that the fta requirement that gte allow competitors to access pieces,or unbundled elements,of gte local network did not preclude gte competitors from requesting access to,fully operational local service platforms.upon receiving the order,gte sued the mpsc in the district court,alleging that the commission,acting pursuant to michigan law,violated the fta when it issued the february order directing gte to provide competitors with access to,fully operational service platforms and requiring gte to publish tariffs offering to sell elements of its network at rates predetermined by the commission.

in that first decision,this court reviewed the district court dismissal of the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.the district court had held that it lacked jurisdiction in the case,because e of the act e gives federal courts jurisdiction to review state commission orders approving or rejecting final interconnection agreements and the february order was not such an order.this court determined that the limitation on federal review set forth in e did not apply and held that,since the action presents a potential instance of federal preemption,the district court had jurisdiction to review the order under its general federal question jurisdiction.see verizon i,at.further,this court held that verizon suit against the individual commissioners in their official capacity,which seeks only prospective injunctive relief,is appropriate under ex parte young.see verizon i,at.accordingly,this court remanded the case to the district court for consideration of the merits.
on remand,the district court granted verizon motion for summary judgment and struck down both challenged portions of the mpsc order,holding that they conflicted with and were preempted by the fta.first,the court held that the tariff requirement was invalid,because it would allow competitors to circumvent the negotiation and arbitration process set out in of the act.verizon north,strand,d.second,the court held that requiring incumbents to combine previously unbundled network elements at competitors request violated the plain language of the act,which requires incumbents to provide competitors access to network elements in a manner that allows requesting carriers to combine such elements.verizon north,d at quoting c emphasis added.the mpsc filed a timely appeal from both holdings.
the tariff requirement 
congress passed the fta in order to end local telecommunications monopolies and engender competition in local telecommunications markets.to attain these goals,the act imposes various requirements on incumbent telecommunications providers.the requirements include the duty to permit competitors who have built their own telecommunications networks to interconnect with the incumbent network for the transmission and routing of traffic between the networks,c permit competitors to lease elements of the incumbent network in order to allow the competitors to provide retail services through such a network,id.at c and permit competitors to purchase telecommunications services at wholesale prices in order to allow the competitors to resell those services to retail customers,id.at c.
in order to facilitate this interconnection,leasing,and wholesaling,congress designed a comprehensive system,under which requesting competitors and incumbent providers are to enter into interconnection agreements setting forth the terms and conditions of their business relationship.id.at c.first,the act explains that,u pon receiving a request for interconnection,services,or network elements an incumbent local exchange carrier may negotiate and enter into a binding agreement with the requesting telecommunications carrier id.at a.in this regard,the fta places on incumbents the duty to negotiate in good faith the terms and conditions of such agreements.id.at c.however,either party to the negotiation may ask the relevant state commission to mediate any unresolved issues.id.at a.if negotiation between the incumbent and the competitor does not produce an agreement,the fta provides that either party can,during a specific time period,ask the state commission to undertake binding arbitration of any open issues,and the fta provides specific guidelines for such arbitration.id.at b d.
once an interconnection agreement is reached,either through negotiation or arbitration,the fta requires the relevant state commission to approve or reject the agreement,and it provides specific guidelines for the approval process.id.at e.if the state commission does not act within a prescribed time period,the fta provides for the federal communications commission fcc to decide,which action preempts the state commission.id.at e.if the state commission makes a determination on the proposed interconnection agreement within the required time,the fta provides that a party aggrieved by the commission determination may bring an action for review in federal district court.id.at e.
the mpsc order at issue here establishes a different route for competitors to obtain services and network elements from incumbents.the order requires verizon to file tariffs with the state,set ting forth the rates,terms,and conditions under which competitors might acquire network elements and services.mpsc,order at,at.as the district court in this case explained,the order requires incumbents to file tariffs offering its network elements and services for sale on fixed terms to all potential entrants without the necessity of negotiating an interconnection agreement.verizon north,d at emphasis added.in this way,the mpsc order permits competitors to purchase the services and elements directly off of the tariff menu,obviating the need to negotiate or arbitrate an interconnection agreement.
after surveying the provisions of the fta discussed herein,the district court wrote 
congress designed a deregulatory process that would rely in the first instance on private negotiations to set the terms for implementing new duties under the act.in contrast to the private,negotiation and arbitration system created by congress,the process for sale of network elements required by the mpsc order is a public rule of general application.by requiring verizon to file public tariffs offering its network elements at wholesale services for sale to any party,the mpsc order improperly permits an entrant to purchase verizon network elements and finished services from a set menu without ever entering into the process to negotiate and arbitrate an interconnection agreement.it thus evades the exclusive process required by the act,and effectively eliminates any incentive to engage in private negotiation,which is the centerpiece of the act.accordingly,the court finds that the tariff requirement in the february order is inconsistent with and preempted by the fta.
verizon north,d at.
we agree with the district court.the central question in preemption analysis is always whether congress intended that federal regulation supersede state law.louisiana pub.serv.comm fcc,d.by its terms,the fta does not preempt state commission rules if such regulations are not inconsistent with the provisions of the fta.b.see also id.at c permitting state commissions to impose certain additional requirements on telecommunications carriers,as long as the state requirements are not inconsistent with the fta.therefore,congress has clearly stated its intent to supersede state laws that are inconsistent with the provisions of the fta.see verizon i,at it is precisely because state utility commissions play such a critical role in administering the fta regulatory framework that they must operate strictly within the confines of the statute see also mci telecomms.bell,cir congress,exercising its authority to regulate commerce has precluded all other regulation except on its terms.further,as the district court in this case pointed out,state law provisions can be inconsistent with,and therefore preempted by,federal law even if the federal and state laws share a common goal.see verizon north,d at.even in the case of a shared goal,the state law is preempted if it interferes with the methods by which the federal statute was designed to reach its goal.gade solid wastes mgmt.ass n,d quoting int l paper ouellette,d 
in the present case,the mpsc order completely bypasses and ignores the detailed process for interconnection set out by congress in the fta,under which competing telecommunications providers can gain access to incumbents services and network elements by entering into private negotiation and arbitration aimed at creating interconnection agreements that are then subject to state commission approval,fcc oversight,and federal judicial review.this is inconsistent with the provisions of the fta,and therefore preempted.
the best argument to the contrary,set out by the mpsc and amici,is that while the interconnection agreement process set out in presents competitors one option for achieving interconnection,it is not necessarily the only permissible process.under this theory,congress set out the federal review process,not as the central method for market entry,but as one method.therefore,state commissions,armed with the power granted them by d to establish access and interconnection obligations of local exchange carriers and by c to impose requirements on a telecommunications carrier for intrastate services that are necessary to further competition as long as such obligations and requirements are consistent with the act,would be free to devise alternative methods under which competitors could acquire services and network elements from incumbents.
in support of this reading,the mpsc points out that the fta does not expressly state that the negotiation and arbitration of interconnection agreements is the sole method for competitors to gain access to incumbents network elements and services.in this way,according to the mpsc,the present case is like the situation faced by the supreme court in verizon communications fcc,d fcc,wherein the court held that the act requirement that incumbents provide network elements that may be bundled by competitors did not foreclose an fcc rule requiring incumbents to also combine elements at the competitors request.in so holding,the court wrote that it takes a stretch to get from permissive statutory silence to a statutory right for the incumbents,and the court refused to read the act silence on any obligation or lack thereof on the part of incumbents to bundle elements as an affirmative statement that the imposition of any such obligation would be inconsistent with the act.id.at.the mpsc would have this court hold similarly with respect to the interconnection agreement process contained in of the congress affirmative statement of that method was not intended to foreclose any alternative methods designed by state commissions.
the difference between the bundling obligation in fcc and the interconnection agreement process in the present case is that the detailed procedural negotiation,arbitration,state commission approval,fcc oversight,and federal judicial out in is central to the fta in a way that a bundling requirement is not.one strong sign that the interconnection agreement process is central to the act,and is therefore not to be evaded by state is the requirement of federal judicial review of state commission determinations.as explained above,e of the act provides that all interconnection agreements must be reviewed,and approved or rejected,by the relevant state commission.after this review,e provides that any party aggrieved by the state commission determination may appeal that determination in the federal district courts.emphasizing the importance to congress of this federal review,e states that n o state court shall have jurisdiction to review the action of a state commission in approving or rejecting an agreement under this section.e.however,there is no provision for federal court review of state tariff orders.therefore,aside from bringing a federal law preemption action pursuant to to challenge each tariff order,an incumbent aggrieved by a state commission tariff decision might not be able to seek federal review.
in asserting that the interconnection agreement process is not central to the act,the mpsc proffers f as an example of a situation in which competitors can acquire services from incumbents without engaging in the interconnection agreement process.however,the mpsc reliance on this section is misplaced 
bell operating companies have long been prohibited from offering long distance telephone service however,of the fta permits these companies to enter the long distance market if they can demonstrate that they have opened their local exchanges to competition.the bell companies can demonstrate that they have done so in one of two ways.they can enter into a qualifying interconnection agreement,c a,c b,or,in the event that no market competitors request such an agreement,they can file a qualifying statement of the terms and conditions that the company generally offers to provide with the relevant state commission.id.at.section f provides the procedure under which the bell companies may file,and the state commissions may review,these statements.as with the interconnection agreement process,e requires the fcc to review the statement if the state commission fails to do so.also,again,as with the interconnection process,e provides for federal district court review of the state commission determination.
according to the mpsc,competitors of bell companies that have filed such statements may choose to purchase services directly from these statements,without first entering into an interconnection agreement with the incumbent the
