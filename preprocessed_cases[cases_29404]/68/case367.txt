in june and april,dominion transmission,dominion a major provider of natural gas transportation and storage services in six and with the majority of its customers,submitted two proposed settlement agreements to the federal energy regulatory commission ferc or commission for its approval both agreements provided,inter alia,for a fixed set of rates and fuel retention percentages for dominion services for a fixed time period.they also required dominion to file an annual report with ferc containing sixteen discrete items about dominion fuel accounting practices.ferc reviewed and approved both of the proposed settlements,ultimately finding them fair and reasonable and in the public interest.dominion transmission,at,dominion transmission,at may.just seven months after it approved the second settlement,however,the request of dominion dominion to supplement its annual reports with additional information about its fuel accounting practices.for the reasons set forth below,we believe ferc order is invalid under the doctrine and we therefore grant dominion petition for review.
on september,dominion filed a request with ferc under section of the natural gas act nga,stat,codified as amended at,to increase the rates for its natural gas transportation and storage services see annual transportation cost rate adjustment filing,no,at.several of dominion customers protested the proposed rate increase.see,mot.to intervene protest of city of richmond,no,at.after nine months of negotiations,on june,dominion,its customers and other interested parties submitted a proposed settlement agreement to ferc.see stipulation agreement settlement,nos.et,june.on september,ferc approved the settlement without modification,finding it fair and reasonable and in the public interest.dominion transmission,ferc at.under the settlement,dominion agreed not to seek any rate increase under section of the nga before july.settlement.dominion also agreed to include in its next section filing a report containing sixteen types of information detailing the pipeline actual system gas requirements and gas retained during the relevant time periods.id.in the event that dominion did not make a section filing by the close of the rate moratorium is,by june,agreed to provide the same sixteen items to ferc in a separate informational filing fuel report for the period ending on march.id.dominion also agreed to provide the fuel report on june of each year until its next section filing.id.the settlement also provided for a set of fixed fuel retention percentages to remain in effect until at least july,settlement.
dominion filed the required fuel report on june,and again on june.see informational fuel report,no.june,informational fuel report,no.june.it is undisputed that these two fuel reports contained each of the sixteen items required under the settlement.see,order accepting fuel reports subject to conditions,nos,at,conditions order.based on information contained in dominion fuel report,keyspan a dominion recourse its subsidiaries collectively keyspan became concerned that dominion recourse customers may have been subsidizing certain of its customers.see mot.to intervene comments,nos.et,at july,keyspan mot.see also supra note.keyspan filed a motion with ferc asking,inter alia,that it require dominion to disclose three additional pieces of information about its fuel retention practices which were not required under the settlement but which keyspan believed were necessary to determine whether subsidization had in fact occurred.see keyspan mot.
in the fall of,before ferc had acted on keyspan motion,the new york public service commission pscny notified dominion that it intended to file a complaint under section of the nga,challenging dominion rates as excessive see offer of settlement explanatory statement,nos.et,at.dominion and pscny jointly proposed a second settlement agreement which was ultimately,in some cases,not the majority of dominion customers.see id.at stipulation agreement settlement,nos.et,app.a april.under the settlement,dominion agreed to lower its rates,totaling approximately million per year a million per year reduction in transportation rates and a reduction in the storage fuel retention percentage of million per year in rate relief for dominion customers.dominion transmission,at.the parties also agreed to a five year moratorium period during which the parties were prohibited from seeking any changes to dominion generally applicable transportation or storage rates or fixed fuel retention percentage under sections and of the nga settlement.the settlement did not,however,preclude ferc from initiating a section proceeding against dominion so long as ferc acted on its own volition.id.emphasis added moreover,the settlement continued the settlement requirement that dominion file an annual fuel report each june until dominion next section filing sometime after the end of the moratorium period in.id.the settlement provided that it was an integrated package and that n one of the terms we re agreed to without each of the others.id.on may,ferc approved the settlement,finding it fair and reasonable and in the public interest.dominion transmission,at.
on june,dominion filed its fuel report.see fuel report fuel report,no.june.as with the earlier reports,it is undisputed that dominion fuel report contained each of the specified items of information.see,conditions order.about this time,keyspan asserts,it became aware from postings on dominion website that dominion was waiving a significant quantity of fuel for certain of its customers.keyspan br.keyspan filed a second motion with ferc on july,requesting that it require dominion to modify its fuel report to include three additional pieces of information relating to dominion fuel retention practices.request of the keyspan delivery companies for further information,no,at july,keyspan mot.
after considering keyspan motions,ferc found under section of the nga that the settlement was unjust and unreasonable insofar as it fails to require the additional information requested by keyspan.see conditions order.ferc directed dominion to its and fuel reports with the additional information and to include the additional information in all future fuel reports.see id.ferc reasoned that granting keyspan request for more detailed information in dominion fuel reports would enhance the transparency of dominion transactions,and assure all parties and the commission that there is no or subsidization on dominion system.id.ferc explained that although dominion fuel retention percentage was fixed during the moratorium period,the additional information was important because of its potential use in any subsequent fuel retention proceeding after the moratorium expires.id.
dominion requested rehearing.see request for reh g,nos.in its request,dominion argued,inter alia,that ferc erred in failing to apply the doctrine to keyspan request to abrogate the terms of the rate settlement erred in deviating from its policy supporting the sanctity of settlements violated section of the nga in ordering dominion to modify its tariff without adequately demonstrating that dominion t ariff is unjust and unreasonable and that the commission proposed change is just and reasonable and erred by retroactively applying the ordered changes to dominion june,and june,fuel reports.id.at footnote added.ferc acknowledged that dominion last assignment of error was correct and modified its order so that dominion was required to disclose the additional information prospectively only.see order on reh g,compliance filing fuel report,nos.et,rehearing order.ferc rejected each of dominion other arguments.on march,dominion timely filed a petition for review pursuant to b.
ferc opens by challenging dominion standing to challenge its order to provide the additional information.pursuant to b of the nga,b,only a party that is aggrieved by an order issued under the act may obtain judicial review thereof.el paso natural gas ferc.a party is aggrieved within the meaning of the nga if it can establish both the constitutional and prudential requirements for standing.pub.power,ferc,quoting pub.util.dist.of snohomish county ferc.in order to establish constitutional standing,a plaintiff must,inter alia,show it has suffered an injury in fact that is a concrete and particularized and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl.servs.toc,d quoting lujan defenders of wildlife,d.according to the commission,dominion petition does not allege that dominion has suffered a concrete and particularized injury.ferc br.specifically,ferc argues that dominion petition leaves unclear whether its alleged injury derives from the precedent set by the commission addition of filing requirements to the tariff or settlements the filing requirement itself the potential for future changes to dominion rates based upon the informational filings or something else.id.at.we,however,do not share ferc confusion.dominion opening brief makes clear that it has been aggrieved by ferc altering the terms of its settlement agreements.dominion br.ferc alteration of dominion obligations under the and settlements suffices to establish standing under the nga.indeed,it would be difficult to see how ferc could order dominion to disclose private data about its operations and that dominion could nonetheless lack standing to challenge the order.sierra club epa,in many if not most cases the petitioner standing to seek review of administrative action is in particular,if the complainant is an object of the action at issue as is the case usually in review of a rulemaking and nearly always in review of an should be little question that the action or inaction has caused him injury quoting lujan,at.
standard of review 
we review the commission interpretation of the and settlements under a variation of the now familiar first performed by the united states supreme court in chevron,natural resources defense council,d.ameren servs.ferc.f irst,we consider de novo whether the settlement agreement unambiguously addresses the matter at issue.if so,the language of the agreement controls for we must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of the parties.id.quoting chevron,at.citation omitted.if the settlement agreement is ambiguous,however,we then examine the commission interpretation of that agreement under the deferential reasonable standard.id.quoting cajun power coop.ferc,footnote omitted.
under the doctrine ferc may abrogate or modify freely negotiated private contracts that set firm rates or establish a specific methodology for setting the rates for service only if required by the public interest.atl.city ferc,citing texaco ferc,footnote added.the doctrine requires ferc to presume that the rate set out in a freely negotiated contract meets the just and reasonable requirement imposed by law.the presumption may be overcome only if ferc concludes that the contract seriously harms the public interest.morgan stanley capital group pub.util.dist.of snohomish county,d.generally,this requires a finding that the existing rate might impair the financial ability of a public utility to continue its service,or that the rate would cast upon other consumers an excessive burden,or be unduly discriminatory,or that there are other circumstances of unequivocal public necessity.pub.power,at quoting fed.power comm sierra pac.power.permian basin area rate cases,d.
in its rehearing order,ferc concluded that the doctrine was inapplicable for three reasons.first,ferc explained that the conditions order has not modified the terms of the settlement by directing dominion to add more information items to the annual fuel reports.reh g order emphasis added.ferc explained that n one of the enumerated informational filing requirements is modified or eliminated.the commission has merely directed that the information to be submitted to the commission each june be supplemented to include additional information the commission finds would be helpful.id.emphasis added see also id.the december,order does not modify that settled list of information,the fuel report it will still be filed.rather,the commission order simply adds to it.we find this argument can not withstand chevron review under step one.during the intensive settlement negotiations,notification of settlement filing,no,at,the parties precisely defined the information to be contained in dominion annual fuel reports.see,settlement d ominion shall be required to make an informational filing as described in section attached on appendix see also supra note.we find no ambiguity in this language and therefore decline to defer to ferc suggestion that it can add to or supplement a contractual obligation without at the same time modifying it.see,oxford english dictionary ed modify means,in part,make partial or minor changes in to change an object in respect to some of its qualities to cause to vary without radical transformation webster third new int l dictionary modify means make minor changes in form or structure of alter without transforming.
second,ferc suggests that the conditions order does not implicate because it is consistent with the purpose and intent of the settlements.reh g order.there are two variations on this theme.first,ferc argues that so long as it does not change the terms of primary service for which the parties have bargained its order does not modify the contracts,even if it affects them.ferc br.quoting am.gas ass ferc,emphases added according to ferc,t he primary bargain struck by the settling parties relates to the rates requiring additional information to be submitted does not,in and of itself,change those settled rates.reh g order see also ferc br.ferc claims that its reasonabl e interpretation of the settlements is entitled to deference under chevron.ferc br.we disagree.even granting that the primary purpose of the settlement was to establish dominion transportation and storage service rates,the settlement made clear that the information contained in the fuel report was also an integral part thereof.indeed,the settlement specifies that it is an integrated package and that n one of the terms of the settlement is agreed to without each of the others.settlement.
ferc second variation on the theme,its intent of the parties argument,fares no better.ferc argues that t he purpose and intent in requiring information to be filed,the items was to provide a minimum set of information to be used to determine whether section action adjusting the settled fuel retention percentages would be appropriate the purpose clearly was not to blind the commission to additional information if such information were deemed important to fulfill the commission oversight responsibilities under the nga.reh g order emphasis added.in effect,ferc argues that its understanding of the purpose of the settlements takes precedence over their respective provisions.not so.see ameren servs,at.both settlements unambiguously define dominion reporting obligations.see supra note settlement incorporating settlement reporting requirement.the plain language of the provides for a fuel be overridden by a purported purpose and intent that would significantly alter that language.
finally,ferc argues that the doctrine is inapplicable because the settlement provides that it shall not preclude the commission from initiating an nga section proceeding on its own volition.reh g order quoting settlement emphasis added.as we noted earlier,section,in relevant part,authorizes ferc to establish just and reasonable rules and regulations relating to the rates and charges collected by any company in connection with any transportation or sale of natural gas.a.because the settlement expressly allows for a section proceeding on ferc initiation,ferc argues,it need ensure only that the additional disclosure requirements are just and reasonable,see,which,as previously noted,is less demanding than.see discussion supra page this argument too is without merit.under section,ferc initiates a proceeding either upon its own motion or upon complaint of any gas distributing company.a emphases added.but section of the settlement refers only to ferc authority to bring a section action only on its own volition.settlement emphasis added.as ferc acknowledges,the conditions order issued at the behest of keyspan.se
