petitioner southern company services,an agent for five electric utilities,challenges orders of the federal energy regulatory commission ferc that rejected two of southern agreements to roll over transmission service.ferc rejected the agreements because they limited the ability of southern customers to roll the agreements over again upon their expiration.according to ferc,any restrictions that a transmission provider wants to impose on rollover rights must be included in the original service agreement between the parties,not in the rollover agreements themselves.southern argues that ferc did not announce this original agreement requirement until after southern entered into the relevant original service agreements,and that applying it to those agreements is therefore arbitrary and capricious.ferc contends that the requirement was contained in two orders issued prior to the execution of southern original service and that southern objections thus are untimely collateral attacks on those orders.
there are two separate agreements at issue here one between southern and williams energy marketing trading company,and another between southern and oglethorpe power corporation.we conclude that southern petition regarding the williams orders is moot because the williams agreement has since expired.we conclude that southern petition regarding the oglethorpe orders,however,is neither moot nor a collateral attack on order and.and because we find that ferc original agreement requirement was not contained in either order or order,and ferc offers no other reason why the requirement is properly applied to the oglethorpe agreement,we vacate the oglethorpe orders as arbitrary and capricious.
in,ferc issued an order,widely known as order,that restructured the wholesale electric power market by requiring all jurisdictional public utilities to unbundle wholesale electric power services and to provide nondiscriminatory transmission services.see promoting wholesale competition through open access nondiscriminatory transmission services by public utilities recovery of stranded costs by public utilities and transmitting utilities,ferc stats.regs,on reh g,ferc stats.regs.order,on reh g,order,on reh g,order,aff,transmission access policy study group ferc,aff sub nom.new york ferc,d.
among its numerous provisions,order generally requires utilities to allow their firm transmission customers to roll over service agreements that have a duration of one year or longer.see order,ferc stats.regs,at a ll firm transmission customers,upon the expiration of their contracts or at the time their contracts become subject to renewal or rollover,should have the right to continue to take transmission service from their existing transmission provider.this provision gives those customers a limited right of first refusal to match the rate offered by another potential customer.id.order,which addressed petitions for rehearing and clarification of order,announced the following exception to this rule 
i f a utility provides firm transmission service to a third party for a time until native load needs the capacity,it should specify in the contract that the right of first refusal does not apply to that firm service due to a reasonably forecasted need at the time the contract is executed.

in nevada power issued on december,ferc used new language to describe how a provider should specify the reservation of transmission capacity,stating that such reservations for native load should be included in the original transmission service agreement,at emphasis added.the following year,ferc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that sought to change the wording of the pro forma issued as part of order and incorporate this original agreement requirement.remedying undue discrimination through open access transmission service and standard electricity market design,notice of proposed rulemaking,app.a.
southern is a transmission provider,and two of its agreements form the basis of the disputes here.in october,southern and oglethorpe signed a contract for firm transmission service to go into effect on december,and expire one year later.oglethorpe sought to roll over the agreement before it expired,and in response southern filed an executed rollover agreement with ferc on december.the rollover agreement included a provision conditioning oglethorpe right of first,its right to demand future inter alia the availability of sufficient transmission capacity after specified other c ustomers exercise their rights to transmission service and after the allocation of capacity to meet the transmission provider native load needs.southern,at oglethorpe order.on may,ferc accepted the filing but required oglethorpe to remove the limitation on rollovers,stating since issuing order and,the commission has consistently reaffirmed that any limitations to rollover rights must be stated clearly in the original transmission service agreement.id.because the rollover service agreement submitted by southern added language that was not in the original service agreement,the limiting language was deemed unacceptable.id.
on may,southern submitted a compliance filing under protest,along with a petition for rehearing that challenged the original agreement requirement.southern contended that the requirement was a new policy,first announced in nevada power,and that it was arbitrary and capricious to apply it retroactively where a transmission entered into an original service agreement before that case.ferc disagreed,insisting that the requirement was not new,and that southern request for rehearing was basically a collateral attack on the commission rollover rights policy as established in order.southern,at oglethorpe order on reh g.during and subsequent to these proceedings,oglethorpe continued to make rollover on september,and another on september,that the service agreement between it and southern is still in effect.see southern supp.br.at.
similar circumstances attended southern transmission agreement with williams.in october,williams requested a rollover of its original service agreement,and southern filed with ferc an unexecuted rollover agreement that placed limitations on future rollovers.in orders similar to those addressing the oglethorpe agreement,ferc accepted the filing subject to elimination of the rollover limitations,see southern,and then denied rehearing,see southern.southern arguments to limit williams rollover rights,the commission said,were virtually identical to those arguments raised in the oglethorpe case,and ferc rejected them for the same reason the limitations were not included in the original transmission service agreement.southern,at.unlike oglethorpe,however,williams did not make a subsequent rollover request,and the agreement between southern and williams expired on december.see ferc br.at southern br.at.
southern now petitions for review of ferc orders,arguing that they are arbitrary and capricious because southern had no notice of the original agreement requirement when it entered into its original agreements with oglethorpe and williams,and that the requirement impairs its ability to provide reliable transmission services.
we begin with the question of mootness,as it is a threshold jurisdictional issue.coalition of airline pilots ass ns faa.southern challenge to ferc oglethorpe orders plainly is not moot,since a oglethorpe agreement remains in effect.the williams agreement has expired,however,and southern agrees that there is no live controversy regarding that agreement.
nonetheless,southern contends that its challenge to ferc orders regarding the williams agreement meets the mootness exception for cases that are capable of repetition,yet evading review,spencer kemna,d.this exception applies if the challenged action is in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to cessation or expiration,and there is a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party will be subject to the same action again.id.alterations in original internal quotation marks omitted.the burden is o
