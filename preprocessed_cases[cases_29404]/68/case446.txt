the federal communications commission assessed in forfeiture penalties against for slamming two is,changing their telephone service without their authorization.having paid the forfeiture,now petitions for review,arguing that in both instances it complied with the commission procedures for verification of telemarketing sales.concluding that we have jurisdiction over challenge to the forfeiture,we hold that the commission requirement that telecommunications carriers guarantee that the actual line subscriber has authorized the service change order exceeds the commission statutory authority to prescribe procedures to verify that authorization.accordingly,we vacate the relevant portions of the forfeiture orders.
in order to prevent telecommunications carriers from making unauthorized changes to subscribers telephone practice known as slamming the telecommunications act of makes it unlawful for telecommunications carriers to submit or execute a change in a subscriber selection of a provider of telephone exchange service or telephone toll service except in accordance with such verification procedures as the commission shall prescribe.a.in its rules implementing section conforming its preexisting regulations to the new commission established various procedures that carriers must use to verify the subscriber authorization to submit the preferred carrier change order.these procedures,which vary depending on how the carrier chooses to market its services,include obtaining the subscriber written authorization,or,if the carrier has solicited the subscriber over the telephone,using an independent third party to confirm the subscriber preferred carrier change order and obtain appropriate verification data,the subscriber date of birth or social security number.b,d currently codified as amended at a,c,c.in all circumstances,however,commission rules require that carriers obtain both i authorization from the subscriber,and ii verification of that authorization in accordance with the procedures prescribed in this section.a formerly codified at a.

before considering the merits of challenge,we must address the commission argument that we lack jurisdiction over appeals from nal forfeiture proceedings.the nal procedure is just one of two ways in which the commission may impose forfeiture penalties,each of which comes with a different set of jurisdictional that are relevant to the issue before us.see generally action for children television fcc,describing the two forfeiture procedures.
under the first and more formal procedure,the commission provides notice to the alleged violator and affords it an opportunity for a hearing before an administrative law judge,who may then choose to impose forfeiture penalties.b a.the resulting forfeiture order is then subject to review in the court of appeals.id.if the penalty remains unpaid once the forfeiture determination becomes final,the united states may bring a collection action in district court.id.b b.
under the less formal nal procedure at issue in this case,the commission issues a notice of apparent liability to the alleged violator,affording it only the opportunity to show,in writing,why no forfeiture penalty should be imposed.id.b.the commission may then issue an order directing payment of the proposed forfeiture,reducing the amount to be paid,or canceling the forfeiture altogether.f.if the order becomes final and the forfeiture subject refuses to pay,then communications act section a permits the commission to refer the matter to the department of justice for commencement of a civil action to recover the forfeiture in a district court,where the forfeiture subject is entitled to a trial de novo.a.
the commission argues that unlike the formal hearing forfeiture process,where the communications act expressly gives courts of appeals jurisdiction to review forfeiture orders,the less formal nal forfeiture proceedings are not subject to review in courts of appeals.the plain language of the communications act indicates otherwise.section a,the act general review provision,vests in courts of appeals exclusive jurisdiction over a ny proceeding to enjoin,set aside,annul or suspend or determine the validity of final commission orders,a see a category that includes forfeiture orders,see illinois citizens comm.for broad.fcc,holding that the court of appeals has jurisdiction over a third party challenge to a paid forfeiture order pursuant to section a.and although section a creates an exception to that general rule,that exception is,by its express terms,limited to government actions for the recovery of forfeiture penalties section a provides that nal forfeitures shall be recoverable in a civil suit in the name of the united states brought in the district court,and that any suit for the recovery of a forfeiture imposed pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall be a trial de novo.a emphasis added.because section a says nothing about district court jurisdiction where the forfeiture has already been recovered,it appears to leave court of appeals jurisdiction intact where,as here,the forfeiture subject has paid the assessed penalty.
though the commission agrees that section a deals only with challenges to unpaid forfeiture orders,it argues that section a nevertheless overrides section a,albeit implicitly,for purposes of challenging paid forfeiture orders.for that proposition,the commission relies on pleasant broadcasting fcc.addressing the question of court of appeals jurisdiction over nal forfeiture orders,pleasant broadcasting states that section of the communications act of vests exclusive jurisdiction in the district courts to review,in the first instance,licensee challenges to forfeiture orders.id.at citation omi
