this case arose from a contractual dispute between plaintiffs,who are eight small companies and the intervenor,consumers energy,a michigan utility.consumers energy purchases power from plaintiffs pursuant to negotiated agreements,the terms,conditions and interpretation of which is governed by a complex state and federal regulatory scheme.plaintiffs contend that consumers energy is not paying them upon amounts,and they have sought relief in several different forums over the past several years,including state and federal courts,as well as state and federal regulatory agencies,all arising from the same dispute.despite the convoluted procedural history raising many issues,the only issue to be decided in this appeal is whether the district court properly declined to exercise its discretionary jurisdiction under the declaratory judgment act.
plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief in the court below from an order of the michigan public service commission concerning the power purchase agreements.the suit named the michigan public service commission and the individual commissioners in their official capacities as defendants,and consumers energy intervened.relying on the declaratory judgment act,the district court declined to exercise jurisdiction over the matter and dismissed the complaint without prejudice,noting particularly the pending appeal in the michigan court of appeals plaintiffs brought that action in the michigan state courts after the michigan public service commission upheld consumer energy interpretation of the power purchase agreements between plaintiffs and consumer energy.
plaintiffs argue on appeal that the complaint was not one solely for declaratory judgment and the district court erred in treating it as such.they also contend that the district court erred in declining jurisdiction because the complaint raises preemption issues under the supremacy clause,as well as claims of violations of federal statutes,thereby bringing it within the court subject matter jurisdiction.
we affirm the district court judgment declining jurisdiction,but do so based on the alternate ground of abstention.in addition,we remand the case for the district court to enter a stay until the conclusion of the state proceedings rather than dismiss the case.plaintiffs pending state court action,along with the stay of the federal action,gives plaintiffs an adequate judicial forum to air their grievances,including any federal claims.
plaintiffs are eight small power producers that sell power to consumers energy company,a michigan utility,and an intervenor in this case.the sale of power from these small producers is governed by a complex set of federal and state regulations,as well as the power purchase agreement each plaintiff has with consumers energy.plaintiffs are nonutility power producers known as qualifying small power production facilities and qualifying cogeneration facilities collectively often referred to as qfs.see c,b.qualifying facilities are a class of facilities,defined by their size,fuel use,efficiency,and ownership,see ferc mississippi,d,entitled to special treatment under federal and state laws regulating power producers.see e c.they generate electricity using alternative fuel sources and sell their output to this case to consumers energy.congress enacted the public utility regulatory policies act of often referred to as purpa to overcome traditional electric utilities reluctance to purchase power from nontraditional electric generation facilities and to reduce the financial burden from state and federal regulation on nontraditional facilities.federal power act,et,as amended,et.the utility must purchase the qualifying facility power for its full avoided cost the amount it would have cost the utility to generate,or to construct facilities to generate,the same power itself or to purchase the power from a facility using fuel sources.the federal energy regulatory commission sometimes referred to as ferc promulgates regulations affecting qualifying facilities.
state public utility commissions are responsible for implementing the federal energy regulatory commission rules and for setting the rates.id.f.under the public utility regulatory policies act,the states play the primary role in calculating avoided costs and in overseeing the contractual relationship between qualifying facilities and utilities operating under the regulations promulgated by the federal energy regulatory commission.see indepen.energy producers ass n,cal.pub.util.comm n,cir stating that the federal energy regulatory commission afford ed the states a great deal of flexibility both in the manner in which avoided costs are estimated and in the nature of the contractual relationship between utility and qf.citing administrative determination,iv federal energy reg.comm cch at.
the procedural history of this case is lengthy.the controversy began when plaintiffs claimed that consumers energy was not properly interpreting certain aspects of the power purchase agreements,resulting in underpayment to plaintiffs.during the term of the power purchase agreements with plaintiffs,consumer energy updated its generating plants to burn a cheaper kind of coal,and then reduced the price it paid plaintiffs under the avoided cost formula in the power purchase agreements.plaintiffs challenged consumers energy reduction of the price paid,alleging that the method of calculating the avoided cost was fixed under the power purchase agreements because consumers energy was required to use the cost of the original type of coal used in its avoided cost other words,the type of coal used when the agreements were signed was a fixed reference in the avoided cost formula and could not be changed even if the type of coal used by consumers energy changed.
in october,consumers energy asked the michigan public service commission to determine whether consumers energy was properly construing the contracts and paying plaintiffs the correct amount under the contracts.before the michigan public service commission ruled on consumer energy application,plaintiffs filed suit against consumers energy in ingham county court in michigan on october,seeking declaratory judgment and alleging breach of contract,promissory estoppel,constructive trust and unjust enrichment.plaintiffs seek to recover over million from consumers energy for alleged underpayment under the terms of the power purchase agreements.consumers energy filed a motion claiming that the entire dispute was within the primary jurisdiction of the michigan public service commission.the ingham county circuit court agreed and entered an order on february,dismissing the case and deferring to the primary jurisdiction of the michigan public service commission.plaintiffs appealed the transfer ruling to the michigan court of appeals,which upheld the transfer.adrian energy assocs.consumers energy,wl,at.
the proceeding before the michigan public service commission included full discovery and a hearing with witnesses.on february,the michigan public service commission determined that consumers energy was not required under the power purchase agreements or any other orders or regulations to base its avoided cost on the price of the coal burned when the agreements were signed and that avoided costs may be calculated on consumers energy actual ongoing coal costs.in re consumers energy,no,wl.pub.serv.comm,at.
based on the michigan public service commission ruling,plaintiffs simultaneously filed an appeal with the michigan court of appeals,an appeal to the federal energy regulatory commission and a complaint in the district court for the western district of michigan which is the subject of this appeal for declaratory and injunctive relief on march.the federal complaint sought a ruling from the district court that the michigan public service commission february,order violates federal law because it relied on state law when only federal public utility regulatory policies act and the federal power applicable to resolve the dispute between plaintiffs and consumers energy.the suit names as defendants the michigan public service commission and the individual commissioners in their official capacities.
plaintiffs first amended complaint requests relief from enforcement of the order on three grounds i the february order violates the public utility regulatory policies act ii the february order violates the federal power act and iii the february order violates the supremacy clause of the united states constitution because the state law relied on by the michigan public service commission in the order is preempted by federal law.plaintiffs assert jurisdiction under and the declaratory judgment act,et.specifically,the first count in the first amended complaint requests declaratory relief in the form of a judgment enjoining the michigan public service commission from enforcing its february,order because it is preempted by federal law and the count also requests an injunction prohibiting the michigan public service commission from failing to follow the public utility regulatory policies act and requiring consumers energy to pay plaintiffs amounts of money wrongly withheld under the power purchase agreements.the second count requests a declaratory judgment that the michigan public service commission order is in conflict with the federal power act,is preempted by federal law and that the michigan public service commission should be enjoined from enforcing its order.the third count seeks a declaratory judgment that the michigan public service commission orders are preempted by federal law pursuant to the supremacy clause and the michigan public service commission should be enjoined from enforcing its orders.consumers energy was granted intervenor status due to its possible liability to plaintiffs for over million should plaintiffs interpretation of the energy rate calculation under the power purchase agreements be adopted.
as noted above,in addition to filing a complaint in the federal court in michigan,plaintiffs also appealed the order to the michigan court of appeals and that appeal has been fully briefed and remains pending.see adrian energy assocs.pub.serv.com n.in may,plaintiffs moved the michigan court of appeals to hold the appeal in abeyance pending the outcomes of the federal case and the appeal to the federal energy regulatory commission.in the alternative,plaintiffs requested to file a brief only on state law issues and to reserve the federal issues.the motion was summarily denied plaintiffs then filed a motion to withdraw appeal with the michigan court of appeals that was denied on january.plaintiffs filed an application for leave to appeal with the michigan supreme court challenging the court of appeals refusal to let them withdraw their appeal,but the supreme court denied that application on february.adrian energy assocs.pub.serv.com n.
pursuant to plaintiffs appeal,on june,the federal energy regulatory commission issued a notice of intent not to act,thereby declining to initiate an enforcement action against the michigan public service commission however,the federal energy regulatory commission clarified that its decision not to act did not constitute a ruling on the merits of any issue raised nor did it prohibit plaintiffs from bringing a private action against the michigan public service commission in the appropriate court.
the court below entered a judgment of dismissal without prejudice,which is the basis of this appeal.the court found that it had jurisdiction under,but,due to the posture of the complaint as one for declaratory relief,it would not exercise its discretionary jurisdiction under the declaratory judgment act.a.the opinion is very narrow,reaching only the jurisdictional issue and making no findings about the merits of the case adrian energy assocs.pub.serv.comm n,wl.the plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration requesting that the district court grant a stay in lieu of dismissing the case or that they be allowed to file a second amended complaint.the district court denied the motion.at 
plaintiffs raise several issues on appeal,most of which were not discussed or ruled upon by the district court.plaintiffs devote much of their opening brief in our court to discussions about the merits of the attacking the substance of the michigan public service commission february,which the district court said nothing.because we generally do not reach issues not ruled upon by the district court,the only issue before us on appeal,therefore,is whether the district court erred in declining to exercise discretionary jurisdiction under the declaratory judgment act.we decline to address whether the michigan public service commission erred in concluding that consumers energy was paying the proper rate under the power purchase agreements 
the district court,although not discussing the merits of the case,agreed that it had jurisdiction.as the supreme court noted in shaw delta air lines,d 
it is beyond dispute that federal courts have jurisdiction over suits to enjoin state officials from interfering with federal rights.see ex parte young.a plaintiff who seeks injunctive relief from state regulation,on the ground that such regulation is by a federal statute which,by virtue of the supremacy clause of the constitution,must prevail,thus presents a federal question which the federal courts have jurisdiction under to resolve.
however,simply because a federal court may have subject matter jurisdiction does not mean that it must be exercised in every instance.in certain limited instances,federal courts may decline to exercise their jurisdiction,in otherwise exceptional circumstances,where denying a federal forum would clearly serve an important countervailing interest.quackenbush allstate ins,d quoting.river water conserv.dist.united states,d.these exceptional circumstances may relate to a policy of accommodating relations.
we first briefly discuss the declaratory judgment act,the law used by the district court to decline exercise of its jurisdiction.the granting of declaratory relief is entrusted to the discretion of the district court.a says 
in a case of actual controversy within its jurisdiction,any court of the united states,upon the filing of an appropriate pleading,may declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration,whether or not further relief is or could be sought.any such declaration shall have the force and effect of a final judgment or decree and shall be reviewable as such.
emphasis added.this section of the act gives district courts statutory discretion to decide whether to entertain actions for declaratory judgments.section explicitly provides that any court of the united states,upon the filing of an appropriate pleading,may declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration.emphasis added.
this court reviews the district court exercise of discretion under the declaratory judgment act for abuse of discretion.scottsdale ins.roumph,cir.d istrict courts possess discretion in determining whether and when to entertain an action under the declaratory judgment act,even when the suit otherwise satisfies subject matter jurisdictional prerequisites.wilton seven falls,d.
in brillhart excess ins,the court warned district courts against g ratuitous interference with the orderly and comprehensive disposition of a state court litigation and directed them to exercise discretion in deciding whether or not to proceed.the supreme court,however,did not articulate all of the considerations which should guide a district court decision in this regard it did provide,however,that the court should ascertain whether the questions in controversy between the parties to the federal suit can better be settled in the proceeding pending in the state court,assess the scope of the pending state proceeding and the nature of the defenses open there,and evaluate whether the claims of all parties in interest can satisfactorily be adjudicated in that proceeding,whether necessary parties have been joined,and whether such parties are amenable to process in that proceeding,id.
in determining the propriety of entertaining a declaratory judgment action,competing state and federal interests weigh in the balance,with courts particularly reluctant to entertain fede
