municipalities in idaho do not have the power to exercise eminent domain extraterritorially for the purpose of constructing electric transmission lines.neither the idaho constitution nor the idaho legislature has expressly or impliedly given idaho cities that power.because cities in idaho are creature s of the state,they can not receive that power from any other source.caesar state,idaho.because the city of idaho falls need only provide electric power at its lowest possible cost whatever that cost may be,it can not claim the extraterritorial use of eminent domain is necessary to accomplish its declared objects and purposes.black young,idaho.we therefore affirm the district court decision denying idaho falls extraterritorial eminent domain power.
undisputed facts procedural background 
the city of idaho falls the city owns and operates idaho falls power ifp,an electrical utility supplying power to approximately residential and commercial customers within the city.ifp generation,transmission,and distribution systems are currently located both inside and outside the city geographical boundary.
this litigation arose from the city recent efforts to complete its power system expansion plan first conceived in and in.ifp seeks to finalize the plan by constructing a new substation to be located north of the city and constructing transmission lines outside the city limits to connect two existing substations.this appeal concerns only the construction of the transmission lines.the proposed route for the new lines forms a semicircle,running from the westside substation located southwest of the city around the city north end then down to the sugarmill substation located on the city east side.the entire transmission line route travels outside the city limits.
to construct the transmission lines along the proposed route,ifp must obtain easements for power lines over the real property of individuals residing outside of the city limits.ifp first sought to obtain these easements by offering to purchase them from the owners of the property over which the proposed lines would travel.some of those owners members of the alliance for property rights and fiscal responsibility the alliance rejected those offers.
on march,the alliance sought declaratory and injunctive relief in idaho state court.essentially,the alliance alleged that the city had threatened to condemn the easements if the members of the alliance would not sell them.the alliance sought declaratory and injunctive relief,arguing that the city lacked the power to condemn property outside its boundaries for the purpose of building electric transmission lines.the alliance also alleged that,because the city lacked the condemnation power,any taking pursuant to that power would violate the fourteenth amendment due process clause.
on march,the city removed the case to federal court.the alliance fourteenth amendment claim provided the federal district court with subject matter jurisdiction,a.on september,the district court entered summary judgment in favor of the alliance,finding that idaho law did not grant the city or,by extension,ifp the power to condemn property outside its corporate limits for the purpose of constructing electric transmission lines.the city appealed.

discussion 
eminent domain 
in this appeal,we must determine whether the city and,by extension,ifp may exercise the right of eminent domain to condemn easements located outside of its boundaries for the purpose of constructing electric transmission lines.idaho has long recognized the proposition that a municipal corporation,as a creature of the state,possesses and exercises only those powers either expressly or impliedly granted to it.caesar,at.accordingly,we must review idaho to determine whether the city has that power.
when interpreting state law,federal courts are bound by decisions of the state highest court.berkeley,at.however,the idaho supreme court has not specifically addressed this question in the context of the relevant statutory provisions.but it has articulated principles that guide the construction of these relevant statutes.the idaho supreme court mandates that municipal corporations have three sources of power and no others p owers granted in express words p owers fairly implied in or incident to those powers expressly granted and p owers essential to the accomplishment of the declared objects and purposes of the corporation.black,at.reviewing each of these sources of power in turn,not one confers upon the city the power of extraterritorial eminent domain for the purpose of constructing electric transmission lines.
express words 
the city argues that two statutes expressly grant it the power of extraterritorial eminent domain idaho general eminent domain statutes,and idaho revenue bond act.
idaho general eminent domain statutes 
idaho general eminent domain statutes do not expressly grant the city the power to exercise eminent domain extraterritorially for any purpose.instead,under those statutes,a ny municipality at its option may exercise the right of eminent domain for any of the uses and purposes mentioned in section.idaho code section,in turn,specifies eleven different public uses.see.relevant here,paragraph authorizes the use of eminent domain for e lectric distribution and transmission lines for the delivery,furnishing,distribution,and transmission of electric current for power,lighting,heating or other purposes and structures,facilities and equipment for the production,generation,and manufacture of electric current for power,lighting,heating or other purposes.significantly,neither nor outlines where municipalities may use their eminent domain power.
certainly,does not contain any language limiting the exercise of the eminent domain power to within the geographic limits of a municipality.but in the eminent domain context,the absence of such a limitation in a general grant of eminent domain power normally is not construed as an authorization to exercise the power extraterritorially.see mcquillin the law of municipal corporations ed.a municipality can not condemn lands within the state but outside its own corporate limits unless the power has been delegated by the legislature or granted by the state constitution.the legislature may delegate such power,as frequently has been done in express terms.footnotes omitted emphasis added see also d eminent domain it may be provided for by statute that municipalities may condemn land beyond their limits.however,it has been held that a grant of power to municipal corporations to condemn any land for any municipal or public purpose does not include land outside the city limits.footnotes omitted.consistent with these authorities,the idaho supreme court requires that statutes conferring the power of eminent domain must be strictly construed.mckenney anselmo,idaho.
moreover,the idaho legislature has expressly granted cities extraterritorial eminent domain power for purposes other than constructing electric transmission lines.for example,a grants cities the power to exercise the right of eminent domain under the provisions of chapter to acquire lands not exceeding acres in body outside of the corporate limits for the purpose of constructing a cemetery.emphasis added.likewise,authorizes municipalities to acquire by condemnation lands either wholly or partly within or without the boundaries or corporate limits of the municipality for the purpose of constructing and maintaining aviation fields,airports,hangars and other air navigation facilities.emphasis added.these express grants of extraterritorial eminent domain power evidence that the idaho legislature knows how to grant extraterritorial eminent domain power to the cities of idaho and does so expressly and for a specific purpose when it intends that the cities have that power.therefore,the absence of an express grant of extraterritorial eminent domain power in and evidences that the idaho legislature did not grant such power in the general eminent domain statutes.
idaho revenue bond act 
next,the city argues that idaho revenue bond act rba grants it extraterritorial eminent domain power for the purpose of constructing electric transmission lines according to the city,because a paragraph a authorizes it to acquire land to construct transmission lines outside the city and c paragraph c authorizes it to employ eminent domain for any of the works,purposes or uses provided by this act,it may use eminent domain to acquire the property rights it seeks in this case.
the text of the statute forecloses this argument.paragraph c only permits cities to exercise the power of eminent domain in like manner and to the same extent as provided in section.emphasis added.these words of limitation indicate that the legislature did not intend paragraph c to augment the scope of the eminent domain power beyond what already permitted.as discussed,does not grant cities extraterritorial eminent domain power,so the language in paragraph c precludes the rba from granting the city that power.
additional statutory text also forecloses the argument.paragraph a lists specific means of acquiring property rights related to the works it describes.namely,it authorizes cities to acquire by gift or purchase lands or rights in lands.emphasis added.however,acquisition by condemnation is not listed in paragraph a.therefore,idaho precedent suggests that we must assume that the legislature excluded condemnation from this list deliberately.idaho press club,state legislature of idaho,idaho w here a constitution or statute specifies certain things,the designation of such things excludes all others.quoting local of int l ass of firefighters city of coeur,idaho.supporting this determination,in previous versions of the rba,paragraph a did expressly list eminent domain as a means by which municipalities could acquire property outside of its boundaries.see idaho sess.laws.the legislature subsequent deletion of the term from the list forecloses the conclusion that expands the scope of cities eminent domain power.
lastly,finding a grant of extraterritorial eminent domain power in the rba would render redundant the clearer grant of such power in at least one other statutory section.section expressly grants idaho municipalities the power to acquire lands either wholly or partly within or without their boundaries by condemnation for the purpose of constructing and maintaining aviation fields,airports,hangars and other air navigation facilities.similarly,the rba identifies airport facilities and air navigation facilities as works for which paragraph c authorizes the use of eminent domain.see a.if paragraph c grants extraterritorial eminent domain power to acquire air navigation facilities,then becomes a redundant grant of the same power.idaho courts avoid such constructions.see verska,at when determining the plain meaning of a statute,effect must be given to all the words of the statute if possible,so that none will be void,superfluous,or redundant.emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted.
appellants argue that paragraph c itself is superfluous if it does not add to the eminent domain powers that already grants.however,this argument incorrectly assumes that paragraph c could serve no purpose except for expanding the scope of the eminent domain power.instead,paragraph c makes clear that eminent domain is one means of acquiring works,and that cities may finance such acquisitions by issuing revenue bonds.see c,e.without that specific authorization and with the explicit grants of power to acquire by other means in paragraph a namely,by gift or purchase,there would be ambiguity as to whether the rba authorized cities to finance eminent domain acquisitions by issuing revenue bonds.thus,paragraph c is not superfluous 
powers fairly implied or incident to express powers 
even though idaho statutes do not grant the city the express power of extraterritorial eminent domain to construct transmission lines,that power may be fairly implied in or incident to those powers expressly granted.black,at.in determining whether statutes imply this power,fair,reasonable,substantial doubt s as to the existence of a municipal power must be resolved against the city.city of grangeville haskin,idaho.
the city argues that its extraterritorial power of eminent domain arises by implication from its general power to own property outside city limits,and the powers expressly granted to it under the rba to acquire property rights for the purpose of constructing electric utilities outside city limits we disagree.
general power to acquire and use land 
the city general power to acquire and use lands outside its corporate limits does not fairly imply that the city can use the power of eminent domain to acquire easements there.the city cites no authority to support the proposition that the power to acquire and use real property through voluntary means implies the power of eminent domain.the absence of any authority for the city position gives rise to a fair,reasonable,substantial doubt that this power can be implied from.city of grangeville,at.thus,we must conclude that does not grant extraterritorial eminent domain power to the city.
power granted under the rba 
the city also argues that its extraterritorial eminent domain power can be fairly implied from the power the rba grants it to acquire by gift or purchase lands or rights in lands outside the city boundaries in connection with the construction of transmission lines and other parts of the municipal electrical system.see a.the city argument appears to be that,if the city has the express power to acquire and own property outside its borders for the purpose of constructing components of its municipal electrical system,then it must also be able to use the power of eminent domain when necessary to make use of those extraterritorially located components.however,in context,extraterritorial eminent domain power can not be fairly implied from this grant of power.
as discussed,the plain text of the statute reflects a deliberate choice by the legislature not to expand the power of eminent domain beyond the borders of a municipality in the rba.it would contradict this intent to permit the city to make an around the statutory text by acquiring property outside of its boundaries,then implying the power to use eminent domain to facilitate the city desired use of that property.implication of such power under these circumstances could not be considered fair.black,p d at.
policy reasons not to imply extraterritorial eminent domain power 
the idaho supreme court adheres to the policy that all fair,reasonable,substantial doubt s as to the existence of a municipal power must be resolved against the city.city of grangeville,at.even if the foregoing analysis does not compel the conclusion that idaho statutes do not grant the city the power it seeks,it at least raises such a doubt.and,under city of grangeville,the existence of that doubt compels the conclusion that the city must be denied the power.
if the city has no other option for providing sufficient electricity to its growing population,then it should ask the legislature not the courts to expand its eminent domain power to accommodate that growth.see farber idaho state ins.fund,idaho the arguments provided to this court would be better targeted at the legislature,which is empowered to change existing law,abrogated on other grounds by verska.
powers essential to corporation declared objects purposes 
finally,the city extraterritorial power of eminent domain may be implied if having that power is essential to the accomplishment of the declared objects and purposes of the city.black,at.the city argues that power to condemn easements outside of city limits is essential to accomplishing the
