section of the motor carrier safety reauthorization act of,stat,imposes a limit on the retroactivity of federal energy regulatory commission orders changing quality bank adjustments paid to oil shippers on the trans alaska pipeline system taps.specifically,it provides that for proceedings starting after the date of enactment such orders can not reach back more than months before the earliest date of the first order of the federal energy regulatory commission imposing quality bank adjustments in the proceeding.b emphasis added.in a proceeding covered by b,the commission identified its initial order,allowing a adjustment to take effect and setting the matter for hearing,as b first order.we find this interpretation inconsistent with the statute language and purpose,and vacate and remand the commission orders.
multiple shippers use taps to transport crude oil extracted from oil fields in northern alaska.the oil they tender to the pipeline varies in quality,but it flows through the pipeline in a commingled stream.in the absence of an accounting adjustment,shippers tendering oil would gain a windfall on their ultimate receipt of the same quantity of oil as they shipped,while those tendering oil would be harmed.
the taps quality bank is an accounting arrangement designed to put the shippers in the same economic position that they would have enjoyed absent commingling.ferc,which regulates taps under the interstate commerce act,et ica has been involved from the outset in establishing the methodology for valuing different types of oil called cuts.for a general description of the process,see exxon,ferc,f d.
we deal here with the valuation assigned the heavy distillate cut.this had been valued on the basis of platts west coast spot price for diesel fuel of a specified sulfur content,less an adjustment for processing costs.effective june,platts dropped that quote in favor of a quote for a diesel with a much lower sulfur content.acting under a provision of the tariff governing all the carrier firms owning the pipeline,the carriers and the quality bank administrator the latter being an office set up to manage the quality bank filed on july,a notice of radical alteration in basis for west coast heavy distillate price quotation and recommended replacement price notice.the notice proposed an alternative formula for valuation of heavy distillate,to take effect,absent action by ferc and the regulatory commission of alaska,as of the day after filing.it is undisputed that the notice and its provision were in accord with the tariff and with of the ica,which governs rate changes.
the filing precipitated the usual commission proceedings and the usual stream of orders.first,the commission on september,issued its hearing order,which accepted the proposed adjustment subject to refund,and ordered a hearing on a disputed element the processing cost adjustment.bp pipelines alaska,ferc the hearing order.the administrative law judge held a hearing and on september,issued an initial decision,rejecting the filing provision on processing costs and substituting another.bp pipelines alaska,ferc.the commission on march,affirmed that decision.bp pipelines alaska,ferc opinion.besides doing so,opinion directed the taps carriers to make a compliance filing,establishing the processing cost component of the heavy distillate valuation as prescribed by the commission.the carriers made such a filing on april,and the commission on december,accepted it and made it retroactive to june,date of the cessation of the old platts quotation.bp pipelines alaska,ferc the compliance order.petitioners sought rehearing with respect to the effective date,which was denied august.ferc rehearing order.
to recapitulate key events in the sequence 
september,hearing order.
march,opinion.
december,compliance order.
the parties have radically different ideas as to which of these orders qualifies as the first order imposing quality bank adjustments.in the compliance order,the commission chose its hearing order.petitioners prefer the compliance order itself.one of the petitioners before us previously championed opinion,but has since dropped that position.
because ferc is entrusted with the administration of,we review its interpretation under the principles of chevron,natural resources defense council.these of course require us,if the statute is ambiguous,to defer to any reasonable commission interpretation.although we find the language of ambiguous in the sense of permitting more than one interpretation,the commission is not among them.
the statute limits retroactive orders as follows 
in a proceeding commenced before the date of enactment of this act,the federal energy regulatory commission may not order retroactive changes in taps quality bank adjustments for any period before february.
proceedings commenced after the date of a proceeding commenced after the date of enactment of this act,the commission may not order retroactive changes in taps quality bank adjustments for any period that exceeds the period immediately preceding the earliest date of the first order of the federal energy regulatory commission imposing quality bank adjustments in the proceeding.
congress adopted in response to a particular commission decision issued in a prolonged quality bank proceeding.in that proceeding a ferc order required quality bank adjustment refunds,authorized by of the ica,going back to december,eleven years before the order date.trans alaska pipeline system,ferc,p.see also exxon,at issuing the rulings that in the end required such refunds.because alaskan refiners would be among those required to pay refunds with interest going back more than ten years,alaska representative and senators introduced bills in congress that would abolish ferc authority to order any retroactive quality bank adjustments,cong,cong.see cong.rec.daily ed,statements of murkowski and stevens cong.rec.daily ed,statement of young.but the bills were not enacted as proposed.instead congress imposed the limit on retroactive changes quoted above.
the parties have argued the case largely as if the hearing order played only the conventional role of such an order under,namely,allowing the rate filed by the carriers to go into effect as filed potentially subject to suspension for a maximum of seven months.there was in fact a curious wrinkle,but we first deal with the matter as the parties have.
under the tariff,the adjustment would take effect of its own accord within days.in a conventional commission exercise of its authority under and under this tariff,the commission hearing order would apart from the possible suspension simply allow the carriers new rate to take effect in accordance with the carriers filing.see ica providing that the commission can not suspend the rate more than seven months beyond the time when it would otherwise go into effect.a commission decree under which nature simply takes its in this case being the new,in the conventions of ordinary discourse,be described as imposing the adjustment.
the unaddressed wrinkle here is that the commission made the newly filed rate effective as of a date earlier than the one specified by the carriers and quality bank administrator,namely june,the date as of which the old platts quotation ceased to be effective in accordance with the tariff.hearing order,ferc p notice,at.the hearing order does not explain what authorized the commission to choose such a date.section does not provide any obvious support for it.and finally,the passage of the tariff provided to us by the parties specifies that the controlling adjustment in such an interim period between the lapse of a price quotation and the carriers proposed effective date should be the unit value for the last month for which a product price was available.id.at.
accordingly,if we were to characterize the commission footnote filling the gap between cessation of the old and initiative of the new as imposing an adjustment,it seems most unlikely to have been an adjustment,or an imposition of an adjustment,of the sort that the drafters of b might have contemplated.
if ordinary language is somewhat against the commission theory,far more so is the usual conce
