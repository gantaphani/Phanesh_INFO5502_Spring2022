local governments,reacting to the rapid expansion of wireless cellular communications and accompanying infrastructure,have adopted ordinances to regulate the placement and aesthetics of wireless cellular telephone towers and ancillary equipment through a discretionary permitting process.the wireless telecommunications ordinance wto adopted by defendant county of san diego county,the enforceability of which is challenged in this appeal by plaintiff sprint telephony pcs,sprint,prescribes an approval process for applications to install cellular telephone infrastructure,including equipment that will be installed in a public right of way row within county jurisdiction.in this action,sprint argues the wto is invalid under public utilities code section asserting that section prevents local governments from regulating the installation of telecommunications equipment in the row except insofar as is necessary to accommodate the public right to use the row county contends the rights conferred by section do not apply to cellular telephone equipment at all,or alternatively,the statutory scheme preserves to local governments the power to regulate the location and appearance of equipment placed in the row.the trial court upheld the validity of the wto,and this appeal followed.
factual backgrounda.the relevant statutory scheme 
section provides 
telegraph or telephone corporations may construct lines of telegraph or telephone lines along and upon any public road or highway,along or across any of the waters or lands within this state,and may erect poles,posts,piers,or abutments for supporting the insulators,wires,and other necessary fixtures of their lines,in such manner and at such points as not to incommode the public use of the road or highway or interrupt the navigation of the waters.
the language of section has evolved to reflect some of the technological advances in communications.the predecessor of section,civil code section,was first enacted in as part of the original civil code.citation.the language was identical to the current section except that there was no reference to telephone corporations reading telegraph corporations may construct lines of telegraph along and upon,citation.the reason for this omission was that the telephone was completely unknown in,not having been invented until.citation.in,civil code section was to add telephone corporations and telephone lines to the statute.citation.in,civil code section became section.the language of section remains as it was in.anderson time warner telecom of california th,d.
the public utilities code,of which section is a part,has also undergone an evolutionary process.shortly after telephone corporations and telephone lines were added to section predecessor statute,the california constitution was amended to vest in the public utilities commission puc the exclusive jurisdiction to supervise and regulate public utilities.pacific.city of los angeles cal d.thereafter,the legislature in enacted the public utilities act,which required among other things that a telephone corporation that sought to construct telephone lines would first be required to obtain a certificate of public convenience and necessity cpcn from the puc public utilities act,subd.a,stats,repealed,and a telephone corporation that sought to exercise the right to a franchise would first be required to obtain a cpcn from the puc id.at subd.b.the public utilities act,providing definitions for terms when used in this act,defined a telephone corporation as every corporation owning or operating a telephone line within the state for compensation id.at,subds.a,t,and defined a telephone line to include all conduits,ducts,poles,wires,cables,instruments and appliances,and all other real estate,fixtures,and personal property owned,controlled,operated or managed in connection with or to facilitate communication by telephone id.at,subds.a,s.the absence of any reference to wireless communications from the initial definition of telephone corporations or telephone lines is understandable because wireless forms of communication were then in their infancy 
in,the legislature repealed the public utilities act and incorporated many of its provisions into part of the public utilities code.see stats,ch,et,et the legislature continued the requirement that a telephone corporation seeking to embark on new service first obtain a cpcn from the puc.the new law,which provided that many definitions imported from the former public utilities act would govern the construction of part of division of the public utilities code,imported without change the definition of a telephone corporation formerly contained in the public utilities act.the legislature also imported the definition of a telephone line formerly contained in the public utilities act,but amended that definition to add the clause whether such communication is had with or without the use of transmission wires.
as part of the same enactment,the legislature also moved former civil code section into division of the public utilities code.former section became section without any change to the statutory language.see stats,ch.
in,the legislature adopted section,which specified it was the intent of the legislature,consistent with section,that municipalities shall have the right to exercise reasonable control as to the time,place,and manner in which roads,highways,and waterways are accessed.stats,ch,subd.a.
b.the county wto 
general requirements 
in county enacted the wto,the stated purpose of which is to establish comprehensive guidelines for the placement,design and processing of wireless telecommunications facilities in all zones within the county of san diego.the wto,which added sections through to county zoning ordinance zo,establishes a structure for processing applications for the installation of wireless facilities.zo.tier applies to applications for wireless facilities that are invisible or have very low visual impacts.tier applies to applications for low visibility facilities in commercial,industrial or special purpose zones,or to facilities in any of the zones that are covered by a wireless community master plan zo.tier applies to noncamouflaged towers greater than feet in height,or feet above the maximum height limit in the zone,whichever is lower,and all facilities in residential and rural zones except those within tiers and.tier is a residual category that applies to all facilities other than those meeting the criteria of tiers,or.zo.the wto permitting process applies to applications to install wireless facilities in a row.
the wto requires all applicants to submit detailed information regarding the proposed wireless facility.among other things,applicants are required to provide a map showing all the applicant existing sites in the local service network associated with the gap the facility is meant to close zo a a visual impact analysis including photographic simulations showing the maximum silhouette,viewshed analysis,color and finish palette and proposed screening id.at subd.b evidence that establishes the proposed facilities have been designed to the minimum height required from a technological standpoint for the proposed site subd.c the anticipated maintenance and monitoring program for the antennas,equipment and landscaping subd.c noise and acoustical information subd.c a plan showing all proposed landscaping,screening and proposed irrigation subd.c and a letter stating the applicant willingness to allow other carriers to on their facilities subd.c.furthermore,county may require additional information based upon specific project factors.id.at.
the wto also imposes general and design regulations,including the requirements that the facilities be camouflaged in residential and rural locations,and be designed to visually blend into the surrounding area in a manner consistent with community character and existing development,to be compatible with existing architectural elements,building materials and other site characteristics,and to have minimal visual impact.zo c,b,f,o.the wto also articulates a setback requirement that,telecommunications towers located adjacent to a residential use shall be set back from the nearest residential lot line by a distance at least equal to its total height or feet,whichever is greater.zo c.
application structure 
applications under tier are processed as administrative site plans,reviewed by the director of the department of planning and land use director.zo a.applications under tier are processed similarly to tier applications except they are also subject to review by the appropriate citizen advisory board,which makes a nonbinding recommendation regarding the application.zo a.the director decisions on tier and applications are appealable to the planning commission.zo.
applications under tiers and are processed as minor use permits and major use permits,respectively,and must comply with the generalized requirements of sections through of county zoning ordinance,which govern all applications for use permits.applications for minor or major use permits tiers and applications require the applicant to submit documents including a list of the names of all persons having an interest in the application as well as the names of all persons having any ownership interest in the property involved complete plans including a plot plan and a description of the property involved and the proposed use permit.zo b.all applications for a use permit are subject to a public hearing requirement.zo.in determining whether to grant a use permit,the planning commission or the director,in the case of a minor permit is required to find that the location,size,design,and operating characteristics of the proposed use will be compatible with adjacent uses,residents,buildings,or structures zo a.
use permits may be granted or modified subject to the performance of such conditions and for such period of time as the planning commission,the board of supervisors or the director shall deem to be reasonable and necessary or advisable under the circumstances so that the objectives of the zoning ordinance shall be achieved.zo.a use permit may be revoked or modified if one or more of the conditions upon which such permit was granted have been violated.zo a.a major use permit decision may be appealed to the board of supervisors.zo a,and a minor use permit decision may be appealed to the planning commission.zo a.following the filing of an appeal,a public hearing shall be scheduled and noticed and all interested persons may appear and present evidence.zo h.the authority with appellate jurisdiction may grant or modify the use permit subject to specified conditions it may impose under section or it may revoke or deny the use permit as is appropriate.zo i.
additional factual background 
in the months between the time the wto became effective and county filed its opposition to sprint summary judgment motion,applications for placement of wireless facilities had been submitted,six of which sought to place wireless facilities in the row.all of the row applications have been subjected to tier review,with none yet approved.utility providers other than wireless telecommunication providers seeking county approval for permits to place equipment in the row are not subject to the wto permitting processes.
the present action 
sprint filed this action asserting the wto was invalid.sprint moved for summary judgment asserting section granted it a franchise to install wireless telecommunications facilities in the row and the wto was invalid because it infringed on the rights conferred on sprint by section and exceeded the limited authority reserved to local governments under sections and.county motion for summary judgment asserted section does not apply to wireless telecommunication providers and equipment and even if sprint qualified as a provider under section,the wto was a permissible regulatory scheme under sections and.
the trial court agreed with county contentions,concluding the rights conferred by section were intended to inure only to those telephone corporations that construct and operate telephone landlines,and sprint wireless telecommunications facilities and equipment did not qualify as telephone lines within the ambit of section.the court also concluded,although sprint qualified as a telephone corporation under section for purposes of the provisions of division of the public utilities code,section did not thereby qualify sprint as a telephone corporation for purposes of division of which section was a part of the public utilities code.the court alternatively concluded that,even if sprint qualified as a telephone corporation for purposes of section,the wto was valid because section recognizes the right of municipalities to exercise reasonable controls over the time,place and manner by which telephone corporations use the row to install and operate their facilities.accordingly,the court concluded the wto,which employs the permitting process to regulate the place location of the equipment and manner the appearance and characteristics of the equipment in which wireless providers use the row,was authorized by sections and.
standard of review 
because we are called upon to construe a statutory scheme,we accord no deference to the trial court determination.instead,we apply de novo review to the issues posed by this action radian guaranty,garamendi th,d.
this appeal requires resolution of two issues do wireless telecommunications providers enjoy the privileges conferred by section to install necessary equipment in a row and,if so,does the scope of the privileges accorded by section preclude local governments from imposing design and siting restrictions when a wireless telecommunications provider exercises the privilege to place equipment in a row before addressing these issues,it is appropriate to examine briefly the scope of the privileges conferred by section.
a.the rights conferred by section 
the state has sovereign authority over public row and retains the right to control those row except insofar as constitutional or statutory provisions reserve or relinquish control to local authorities.western union.hopkins cal.in pacific.city county of san francisco cal d,pacific.i,the court construed section as constituting a continuing offer extended by the state to telephone and telegraph companies which offer when accepted by the construction and maintenance of lines citation gives a franchise from the state to use the public highways for the prescribed purposes without the necessity for any grant of a franchise by a subordinate legislative body.accordingly,section confers on telephone companies the right to use public rights of way to install lines and equipment without the necessity of seeking a separate franchise from local governments for that purpose see city of petaluma pacific.cal d,city can not compel telephone company to obtain a municipal franchise to use the streets and other public places for its lines and equipment,subject to the proviso that such equipment must be installed in a manner and at such points as not to incommode the public use of a row.by virtue of section,a local government may neither entirely bar a telephone company from installing necessary equipment in a row pacific.i,supra,at,nor make the installation of such equipment conditional on payment of a fee except insofar as the fee is reasonably necessary to pay for the costs of mitigating or defraying the cost of any alleged impacts on public improvements or facilities.williams communications city of riverside th,d.
the rights conferred by section,although broad,are not unlimited.section itself delimits row rights by declaring telephone companies may not install equipment in a location or in a manner that obstructs public use of a row.additionally,the legislature enactment of section confirmed that local governments were delegated the power to exercise reasonable control as to the time,place,and manner in which roads,highways,and waterways are accessed,subd.a pacific.city county of san francisco d.pacific.ii thus,because of the state concern in communications,the state has retained to itself the broader police power of granting franchises,leaving to the municipalities the narrower police power of controlling location and manner of installation.whether these qualifications on a telephone company franchise to install equipment in a row are very narrow constraints,as contended by sprint,or instead permit a local municipality to regulate installations in a row based on considerations beyond construction practices and possible interferences with travel along a row,as asserted by county,is addressed in part.of this opinion.
section confers equivalent privileges to install necessary equipment in a row on all telecommunications providers 
county asserts the wto is valid because,even assuming the privileges conferred by section largely preempt local regulation of equipment placed in a row,sprint is not eligible for those privileges because section is limited to telephone corporations that construct telephone lines and sprint does not install lines but instead builds wireless facilities in row.sprint counters that wireless equipment qualifies for the privileges bestowed by section because statutes enacted concurrently with and subsequent to section confirm the legislature intended wireless equipment qualified as a line under section,the courts have interpreted section to encompass advances in telecommunications technologies,and sprint does even within the narrowest meaning of section install and employ lines to effectuate telephonic communication.
we conclude that wireless equipment falls within the purview of section.the legislation that moved former civil code section into the public utilities code and renumbered it as section without any change to the statutory language also imported the definition of a telephone line formerly contained in the public utilities act and at the same time amended that definition to add the clause whether such communication is had with or without the use of transmission wires.under ordinary rules of statutory construction the legislature,when it enacts a law that uses a term defined in another statute,is aware of the statutory definition colmenares braemar country club,cal th,d,and when the same term or phrase is used in a similar manner in two related statutes concerning the same subject,the same meaning should be attributed to the term in both statutes dieckmann superior court d.except for those circumstances where the legislature has indicated otherwise.hassan mercy american river hospital cal th,d.these principles support the conclusion that a telephone line,not separately defined for purposes of section,should encompass the meaning incorporated in section,which defines a telephone line as any instrument operated to facilitate communication by telephone,whether such communication is had with or without the use of transmission wires.under this definition,there appears to be no basis for excluding sprint wireless equipment from the privileges conferred by section.
subsequent legislative enactments confirm the legislature intended equipment installed by wireless telecommunications to fall within the purview of section.in the legislature,seeking to promote the expanded availability of wireless services by blunting the impact of localized opposition to building new cellular facilities,enacted government code section.that statute required the state to compile a list of property that would be made available to lease for purposes of cellular facilities.section states the listed property would be the state sole inventory of real property available for this purpose.the term real property,as used in this section,excludes property subject to section of the public utilities code,subd.a.moreover,the legislature declared that n othing in section alters any existing rights of telephone corporations pursuant to section of the public utilities code,subd.d.the legislative recognition that the listed property would be the exclusive inventory except for property subject to section and the proviso preserving any existing rights of telephone corporations pursuant to section ibid,contained in an enactment limited to wireless providers,would be superfluous if the legislature intended as county asserts that section wholly excluded wireless providers from the privileges to install wireless equipment in a row subject to section 
although california decisional law has not directly held the privileges conferred by section are enjoyed by wireless providers there is no case law holding to the contrary,and dicta in numerous decisions and opinions suggests section does apply to wireless providers.see,williams communications city of riverside,supra,th at,d employing definitional provisions of sections and to construe rights conferred by section ops,although we recognize that section definition applies to the public utilities act sections and not expressly to section,we feel that no reason exists for a telephone line to have any different definition as used in section.although each of these decisions evaluated distinguishable issues,we are convinced the statutory scheme as a whole evinces a legislative intent that wireless telecommunications providers qualify for the privileges bestowed by section to install wireless communication equipment in row.
california authorizes local governments to impose limited regulations on a utility use of the row 
the privileges conferred by section,although significant,are not unlimited.section precludes installing equipment in a location or in a manner that incommodes the public use of the row.additionally,the legislature by its enactment of section has declared its intent that a telephone company privileges under section be subject to a municipality right to exercise reasonable control as to the time,place,and manner in which roads,highways,and waterways are accessed.id.at subd.a.we must determine whether the regulatory authority over row installations preserved to local municipalities under california law is narrowly limited as sprint contends or encompasses discretionary permitting ordinances like the wto.
both the courts and the puc,whose construction of the statutory scheme is entitled to great weight golden gate scenic steamship lines,public utilities com.cal d,have suggested that local governments may regulate the location and appearance of telephone equipment without transgressing the franchise conferred by the state on telephone companies by section.in western union.city of visalia cal,the city passed an ordinance,accepted by the utility,purporting to grant the utility a franchise and limiting the height and location of certain poles.when the city subsequently assessed and sought to collect a franchise fee from the utility,the utility challenged the fees.the court,holding the fee was improper,explained 
the real question,therefore,is,as before stated,does the ordinance create a franchise and,in our opinion,it does not.if it can be construed as an attempted granting of an original franchise to operate a telegraph line through the streets of the city,it would be merely an empty form of granting what the plaintiff already had and of which the city could not deprive it.the plaintiff had that right not only from the act of congress above referred to but also from section of our civil code,which provides that telegraph corporations may construct lines of telegraph along and upon any public road or highway.but we do not think that the ordinance purports to grant any franchise.while the appellant had the right,of which the city could not deprive it,to construct and operate its lines along the streets of the city,nevertheless it could not maintain its poles and wires in such a manner as to unreasonably obstruct and interfere with ordinary travel and the city had the authority,under its police power,to so regulate the manner of plaintiff placing and maintaining its poles and wires as to prevent unreasonable obstruction of travel.and we think that the ordinance in question was not intended to be anything more,and is nothing more,than the exercise of this authority to regulate.but such regulation is not the granting of a franchise it is a restriction of and burden upon a franchise already existing it is not an original and affirmative granting of anything in the nature of a franchise.indeed,the ordinance and its acceptance by acceptance was necessary to give it any in the nature of a contract between the parties.the plaintiff poles and wires were still in the same place in which they had been for many years and by the ordinance the city agreed in writing that the poles and wires as they then stood were in a proper place and might remain there if plaintiff would agree to allow the city to use them for certain purposes,and plaintiff by accepting the ordinance so agreed.such was evidently the purpose of the ordinance,and we do not see in it the creation of anything in the nature of a franchise.therefore,the assessment was for an asserted franchise which had no existence.id.at,italics added.
thus,the visalia court apparently concluded an ordinance that is a valid exercise of a city police power over the location and appearance of structures,although burdening and regulating the exercise of the franchise conferred by section,was not itself an invalid arrogation of the power reserved to the state and exercised by the predecessor to section to grant a franchise.pacific.i,supra,cal d at,telephone company concede d the power in the city to require utility to apply to city engineer for a permit control ling the particular location of and manner in which all public utility facilities,including telephone lines,are constructed in the streets and other places under the city jurisdiction.
the puc appears to have similarly concluded that local municipalities are not barred from regulating the location and appearance of equipment eligible to be installed in a row under section.in order instituting rulemaking re competition for local exchange service,cal.puc lexis decision,the puc extensively reviewed the statutory scheme to address a host of issues,including the rights of various utilities to place their equipment in a row.the puc noted the obligations of a local government to provide access to a row under its control is governed in part by section,which provides a municipal corporation may retain the power to supervise and regulate the relationship between public utilities and the general public in matters affecting the health,convenience,and safety of the general public,including matters such as the use and repair of public streets by any public utility,the location of the poles,wires,mains,or conduits of any public utility,on,under,or above any public streets.moreover,the puc noted section,subdivision a contains the legislative declaration that local governmental bodies shall have the right to exercise reasonable control as to the time,place,and manner in which roads,highways,and waterways are accessed,provided the local governmental does not abuse its discretion or arbitrarily or unfairly deny requests for access,and article xi,of the california constitution expressly recognizes the authority of a city to prescribe regulations governing persons or corporations that provide public utility service.decision,supra,at.
the puc,evaluating the rights of noncellular telecommunications carriers to obtain reasonable access to a row to engage in necessary construction under section concluded the respective roles of the puc and local governments with respect to row access should incorporate the general approach adopted in the puc order instituting rulemaking re radiotelephone utility facilities d,may,cal.puc lexis go,which revised the rules relating to the construction of cellular radiotelephone facilities in california.the puc in decision,supra,cal.puc lexis,discussing the resolution reached in go,stated 
recognizing local government interest in cell siting locations and land use policies as well as the puc interest in promoting development of wireless technologies and its duty to protect ratepayers,in go the puc ceded regulatory jurisdiction in circumstances where the local agency has a specific interest,yet recognized the puc obligation to protect the overriding state interests.go acknowledges that primary authority regarding cell siting issues belongs to local authorities.local authorities continue to issue permits,oversee the california environmental quality act ceqa compliance,and adopt and implement noticing and public comment requirements,if any.in like manner,local agencies have an interest in managing local row and requiring compensation for the use of public row.the puc,on the other hand,has an interest in removing barriers to open and competitive markets and in ensuring that there is recourse for actions which may violate state and federal laws regarding nondiscriminatory access and fair and reasonable compensation.moreover,section also authorizes the puc to order the erection and to fix the site of facilities of a public utility where found necessary to promote the security or convenience of its employees or the public to secure adequate service or facilities the statewide interest in promoting competition and the removal of barriers to entry and nondiscrimination are equally important with respect to row access rights accordingly,the puc shall intervene in disputes over municipal row access only when a party seeking row access contends that local action impedes statewide goals,or when local agencies contend that a carrier actions are frustrating local interests.in this manner,the commission reserves jurisdiction in those matters which are inconsistent with the overall statewide procompetitive objectives,and ensure that individual local government decisions do not adversely impact such statewide interests.decision,at.
thus,the puc has ceded to local authorities the primary authority on issues relating to the row access authorized by section,including the power to process and issue discretionary permits those required by local or california environmental quality act ceqa statutes and to adopt and implement appropriate noticing and public comment requirements.however,the puc also concluded that section protects the statewide interest in the deployment of telecommunications services from being frustrated by local parochialism by empowering the puc to override local decisions through issuance of a cpcn for specific facilities upon a particularized showing the telecommunications carrier effort to obtain all necessary local permits and to negotiate mutually acceptable terms of access with the local governmental body to a row has been unsuccessful.decision,supra,cal.puc lexis,at.
the approach adopted by the to local authorities the primary authority to issue discretionary permits for row installations while retaining the ability to preempt local decisions where a superseding state interest is undermined by local an appropriate resolution that balances the interests of local governments in managing and preserving local row against indiscriminate use while ensuring the interest in the deployment of ubiquitous communications systems is protected.because under decision,supra,cal.puc lexis the privileges accorded to traditional telephone companies by section to use a row to install equipment remains subject to local discretionary permitting ordinances,and we find no meaningful basis for concluding wireless providers are accorded any greater rights under section than are accorded to traditional telephone companies,a discretionary permitting ordinance for wireless providers does not offend section 
sprint asserts that discretionary permitting by local authorities is inconsistent with the statutory scheme because the only limitation on row installations is that the equipment be installed in such manner and at such points as not to incommode the public use of the road.sprint asserts that,as long as the equipment is installed at a time and in a place that does unreasonably obstruct the public ability to traverse the row,section otherwise creates a carte blanche for telephone companies to install any necessary fixtures free from oversight by local governments.although we agree section expressly precludes installing equipment in such a manner as to unreasonably obstruct and interfere with ordinary travel pac.ii,supra,d at,we do not agree this language concomitantly preempts all other local regulation of row installations 
local governments may enact all local,police,sanitary,and other ordinances and regulations not in conflict with general laws cal,art.xi,and a local law is invalidated by preemption only when it conflicts with state law.city of los angeles cal th,d.a conflict with state law will be found to exist when the local law is duplicative of state law because it is coextensive therewith,or contradicts state law because it is inimical thereto,or it purports to regulate in an area fully occupied by state law.id.at,d.the wto is neither duplicative of any state law,nor inimical to state law because the wto does not prohibit what section commands or command what it prohibits,at,d.accordingly,the wto is invalid as preempted by state law only if it seeks to regulate in an area fully occupied by state law.
a local ordinance enters an area fully occupied by state statutes either when the legislature has expressed its preemptive intent,an intent not declared in section,or when its intent to fully occupy the field can be implied.when examining whether the wto is invalid as impliedly preempted by section,we remain mindful of the admonition that,i n general,courts are cautious in applying the doctrine of implied preemption i n view of the long tradition of local regulation and the legislatively imposed duty to preserve and protect the public health,preemption may not be lightly found.quoting people ex rel.deukmejian county of mendocino cal d.where local legislation clearly serves local purposes,and state legislation that appears to be in conflict actually serves different,statewide purposes,preemption will not be found.san diego gas electric city of carlsbad th,d.
for purposes of this case,only two indicia of preemption by implication appear relevant either the subject matter has been so fully and completely covered by general law as to clearly indicate that it has become exclusively a matter of state concern or the subject matter has been partially covered by general law couched in such terms as to indicate clearly that a paramount state concern will not tolerate further or additional local action in re hubbard cal d,disapproved on other grounds in bishop city of san jose cal d,fn.although state law fully and completely covers the exclusive right of the state to empower telephone companies to use row pacific.i,supra,cal d at,and to disable local governments from extracting franchise fees from telephone companies for the right to operate therein,williams communications city of riverside,supra,th at,d,there is no general state law regulating the siting or appearance of the equipment so authorized 
we are also convinced the partial coverage of the subject matter under state law is not couched in such terms as to indicate clearly that a paramount state concern will not tolerate further or additional local action.to the contrary,the statutory scheme is couched in terms suggesting the state contemplated and preserved further or additional local action on placement of equipment in a row.when the legislature enacted the public utilities act in,section predecessor was in existence and provided partial coverage of the subject matter by according to telephone corporations the privilege to construct lines in a row.however,the public utilities act expressly specified the statewide regulatory powers vested in the puc over all utilities,including telephone companies,shall not be construed to authorize any municipal corporation to surrender to the puc its powers of control to supervise and regulate the relationship between a public utility and the general public in matters affecting the health,convenience,and safety of the general public,including matters such as the use of public streets by any public utility,and the location of the poles,wires,mains,or conduits of any public utility,on,under,or above any public streets,italics added.thus,the statutory scheme evinces a legislative intent that the franchise to use the row would coexist with,rather than preempt,local regulation promoting the convenience of the general public in matters involving the use of the row for equipment accord,western union.city of visalia,supra,cal.at,regulation of height and location of poles restricts and burdens existing franchise but is not a grant of a franchise.
sprint alternatively argues that,even assuming state law reserves to local governments some ability to regulate the location and appearance of wireless facilities,the wto is nevertheless invalid because it far exceeds the permissible scope of regulation by granting unfettered discretion to grant or deny applications to build facilities in the row sprint complains the wto requires lengthy applications calling for information irrelevant to legitimate local interests,imposes extensive design criteria based on subjective and malleable concepts of community and neighborhood character,provides for public hearings and appeals,and purportedly confers carte blanche discretion on county to grant or deny an application for any reason or subject to any condition it chooses.however,zoning ordinances with even fewer guidelines and granting even broader discretion have been upheld in the face of similar attacks see,stoddard edelman d.lucas valley homeowners county of marin d,and sprint does not articulate a rationale apart from the state preemption issues for measuring the wto provisions against a standard stricter than that applied to similarly situated zoning ordinances.furthermore,we are not presented with a case in which it is contended county denial of the required wto permit constitutes,in effect,a denial of the privileges of the franchise granted by the state in section by denial of a permit after the applicant good faith efforts to negotiate reasonable conditions for issuance of the permit.
disposition 
the judgment is affirmed.each party shall bear its own costs on appeal.
all statutory references are to the public utilities code unless otherwise specified.
sprint does not in this proceeding contend the wto is unenforceable insofar as it prescribes a permitting process for installing telecommunications equipment on property outside of public roads or highways.however,in a concurrent federal action see sprint telephony pcs,county of san diego d,sprint asserted the wto is unenforceable in its entirety because it violates the federal telecommunications act of,stat.the tca,and more particularly offends title united states code section,as a local statute or regulation hav ing the effect of prohibiting the ability of any entity to provide any interstate or intrastate telecommunications service.the federal district court,although acknowledging federal law permits local governments to impose aesthetic requirements or placement restrictions in the exercise of their zoning authority see,sprint pcs assets,city of la canada flintridge cir,dicta apt pittsburgh penn township butler county cir upholding validity of zoning ordinance restricting towers to certain districts in township,concluded the wto was invalid because it prohibited or had the effect of prohibiting the provision of wireless service.accordingly,the district court enjoined county from enforcing the wto.sprint telephony pcs,county of san diego,supra,at.however,county has appealed the decision to the ninth circuit court of appeals,and we take judicial notice people united states currency th,d that the ninth circuit has stayed the district court decision pending the appeal.in the present action,we are not called on to decide the federal preemption issue for the wto as a whole,but instead must decide the limited issue of whether the wto is enforceable under california law insofar as it applies to equipment to be installed in the row.
