the city of anaheim the city,which operates its own electric utility,was required by the california department of transportation caltrans to relocate certain electrical transmission facilities to accommodate a freeway widening project.caltrans is obligated under the streets and highways code to pay for the relocation,but is entitled to a credit against its liability for the amount of any betterment to the relocated facilities.the city relocated the transmission facilities by undergrounding them because its municipal code generally requires undergrounding of utilities for aesthetic and safety reasons.at issue in this case is whether caltrans was obligated to pay the full costs of undergrounding the facilities,or whether it was entitled to a credit for the betterment of the facilities due to the undergrounding.we agree with the trial court that the undergrounding constituted a betterment,and caltrans did not abuse its discretion by claiming a credit for the relocation costs attributable to the betterment of the facilities.accordingly,we affirm.
we depart from our normal practice of first discussing the facts and procedure.we find it useful to instead first set forth the pertinent law regarding caltrans statutory obligations regarding the relocation of publicly owned utilities.
streets and highways code section provides in pertinent part,whenever caltrans requires a publicly owned utility to relocate within a freeway any utility facility lawfully maintained in any freeway which was not a state highway at the time such utility facility was originally installed therein,caltrans shall pay the cost of such relocation.but there are limitations to caltrans obligations.streets and highways code section provides in pertinent part,in any case in which caltrans is required to pay the cost of removal or relocation of any utility facility,it shall be entitled to credits as follows in the amount of any betterment to the utility facility resulting from such removal or relocation,not in excess of the cost of the increased capacity of the facility.italics added.
the caltrans manual contains the following pertinent sections.section states,streets and highways code section credit on relocation in any case in which caltrans is required under the provisions of this law to pay the cost of removing or relocating any facility,caltrans shall be entitled to credits as shown in the table entitled allowable credits on the following pages.
the table referred to in section of the manual provides the following regarding betterment credit caltrans should only pay for a functional equivalent replacement of the impacted utility facility.any increase in the size or capacity of the facility that is for the owner benefit is considered the owner betterment.caltrans shall receive a credit for the difference between the cost of the functional replacement of the original facility and the cost of the facility as constructed.there are,however,exceptions to the general rule.all betterments that result in increased capacity or more desirable placement,such as undergrounding,that the owner may claim to be at caltrans expense must be carefully reviewed.the following types of betterment may be accepted as part of caltrans liability.required by the highway project.required by state or federal law or regulation.required by current design practices regularly followed by the owner in their own work,if there is a direct benefit to the highway project betterment is normally measured by an increase in size or capacity such as a larger pipe,a greater number of telephone circuits,additional conduits,or a higher capacity power line 
finally,section of the caltrans manual provides as follows regarding the undergrounding of utilities when a project conflict exists and caltrans must relocate an existing aerial utility facility,caltrans can not pay any portion of the undergrounding costs unless the undergrounding is based on an engineering need for caltrans project or is the most cost effective.undergrounding requirements as established by local government for aesthetic purposes are not binding upon caltrans.caltrans is only obligated to pay for replacement of the functional utility that previously existed.
facts and procedure 
the city owns and operates a municipal electric utility that serves most of its residents.in,the city adopted chapter of the anaheim municipal code requiring the undergrounding of utilities including,when feasible,existing and future overhead electric transmission facilities.anaheim municipal code section states the purposes of the ordinance,which include improving aesthetics,service reliability,and safety.
the california public utilities commission puc did not mandate the city to adopt an undergrounding ordinance.the puc has no jurisdiction over municipally owned utilities.rather,its jurisdiction is over privately owned utilities.however,certain tariff rules require specific private utilities to underground utility transmission facilities at their own expense under certain circumstances if the municipality in which the private utilities are located has adopted an ordinance requiring the undergrounding of the facilities.the city adopted its ordinance,in part,so it could require those private utilities to underground their own facilities at their own expense 
in the,caltrans began widening the freeway in the city.the city owned and maintained aerial electrical power facilities within the freeway that had to be relocated to accommodate the widening.the city relocated the facilities underground.
the city and caltrans entered into four separate utility agreements,each relating to specific phases of the project and specific facilities that needed to be relocated.the city would perform pay for the relocation work and bill caltrans for its share of the actual costs.in each utility agreement,the city and caltrans acknowledged caltrans was required to pay the costs of relocating the power lines,but will not pay for any betterment or increase in capacity of the city facilities the parties agreed that relocation as herein contemplated includes betterment to the city facilities by reason of increased capacity resulting from undergrounding existing aerial facilities in lieu of replacement in kind and they set forth estimated percentages of the total relocation costs the city would incur that were attributable to the betterment by undergrounding of the facilities.however,they also acknowledged there was a dispute as to whether the betterment was one for which caltrans was ultimately responsible 
in the stipulated facts,the city agreed undergrounding of the lines in question was in general,a betterment,and the lines the city elected to underground were not undergrounded due to engineering reasons,but rather were undergrounded for aesthetic reasons and reasons,including anaheim municipal code chapter.
in,the city filed its claim with the state claims board for the betterment costs associated with relocating the disputed lines million.after the claim was denied,the city filed the instant action against caltrans for breach of statute and breach of contract seeking to recover the betterment costs associated with undergrounding the lines.following a bench trial on stipulated facts,the court ruled in caltrans favor.
caltrans was not required to reimburse the city for the betterment costs.
the city contends caltrans was required to pay the full cost of undergrounding its facilities pursuant to streets and highways code sections and.acknowledging caltrans is entitled to a credit towards the relocation costs it must pay in the amount of any betterment to the utility facility resulting from such relocation,the city argues what is meant by betterment in streets and highways code section is ambiguous.thus,the city argues we must resort to the caltrans manual,which contains caltrans interpretation of the term betterment to ascertain whether in this case undergrounding the utilities was a proper relocation cost.
we agree with the city and the trial court as it concluded in its statement of decision,the term betterment as used in streets and highways code section is somewhat ambiguous.in its ordinary sens
