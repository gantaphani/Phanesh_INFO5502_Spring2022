pegastaff is an agency that provides temporary staffing for its clients.a large part of pegastaff business was the provision of staffing to pacific gas electric pg e,through a staffing agency with which pg e directly contracted,initially corestaff services,lp corestaff and later agile.
the california public utilities commission cpuc adopted general order to implement public utilities code sections through article the purpose of which is to encourage and develop the use of women,minority and disabled business enterprises wmdvbes within the public utility sector.pegastaff is not a wmdvbe and after pg e adopted a program to increase the utilization of wmdvbes,its provision of staff to pg e was substantially reduced.
pegastaff filed suit against the cpuc,pg e,corestaff and agile.its claims against the cpuc consisted of constitutional challenges to article and general order.the trial court determined that it did not have subject matter jurisdiction to consider pegastaff constitutional challenges,granted the cpuc motion for judgment on the pleadings,and entered judgment in favor of the cpuc.the trial court also denied pegastaff motion to transfer its claims against the cpuc to the court of appeal.
on appeal pegastaff maintains that the trial court has subject matter jurisdiction to hear its claims against the cpuc.pegastaff also argues that if the trial court did not err on the jurisdictional issue,then it erred by denying the motion to transfer.we find no merit in pegastaff arguments and affirm.
background 
the cpuc is an agency created by the california constitution to regulate privately owned public utilities such as pg cal,art.xii.
pegastaff is a division of pegasoft corporation,a california corporation,that provides temporary staffing in the fields of information technology and engineering.mark arshinkoff,a white male,owns percent of pegasoft stock.
for nine years prior to filing suit,pegastaff provided contract labor to pg e through a program administered by corestaff,another staffing company.pegastaff placement of workers at pg e peaked in at about workers.in that year,pegastaff received about job orders and revenue of about million from pg e.the revenue from pg e comprised about percent of pegastaff gross revenues for the year.
in october,at the direction of pg e,corestaff created a tier structure whereby all wmdvbes were placed in the first tier and all other businesses,such as pegastaff,were placed in the second tier.first tier businesses received preference in job orders for temporary workers.corestaff created the tiered system because its contract with pg e required it to spend a substantial percentage of its dollars on wmdvbes.
the number of pg e job orders routed to pegastaff dropped substantially as a consequence of the tier structure.many contingent workers placed by pegastaff were transferred to wmdvbes by corestaff,to pegastaff financial detriment.between january and september,pegastaff received only one job order for pg e from corestaff and employed only four temporary workers at pg e.in,defendant agile replaced corestaff as the administrator of pg e contingent worker program.
on september,pegastaff filed suit.the operative first amended complaint fac was filed on september,naming pg e,corestaff,agile and the cpuc as defendants.the fac asserts causes of action violation of civil code section barring discrimination by businesses based on enumerated characteristics,asserted against corestaff and pg e violation of california constitution,article i,section barring discrimination by the state based on race,sex,color,ethnicity or national origin in the operation of public employment,public education or public contracting,asserted against the cpuc violation of the equal protection clause of the california constitution cal,art.i,asserted against the cpuc injunctive relief for violation of california unfair competition law ucl bus,et,asserted against corestaff and pg e intentional interference with prospective economic advantage,asserted against pg e negligent interference with prospective economic advantage,asserted against pg e civil conspiracy,asserted against agile intentional interference with prospective economic advantage,asserted against agile negligent interference with prospective economic advantage,asserted against agile and violation of the ucl,asserted against agile.pegastaff sought,among other relief,a declaration that article and general order are unconstitutional,invalid,unenforceable and void,both on their face and as applied here.
on may,the cpuc filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings,asserting that section deprives the superior court of subject matter jurisdiction over pegastaff two claims asserted against it.pegastaff opposed cpuc motion but eight days before the hearing set for that motion moved for transfer to this court,should the trial court determine that it lacked jurisdiction.
a hearing on the parties motions,as well as other matters,was held on july.at the hearing,the trial court stated that the cpuc motion for judgment on the pleadings would be granted.the court also denied as untimely pegastaff motion to transfer.on july,the court filed an order formally making the rulings that it stated at the hearing.it granted the motion based on section,concluding that it lacks jurisdiction to review constitutional challenges to sections because it would interfere with defendant cpuc job duties and lacks jurisdiction to hear constitutional challenges to general order because it lacks jurisdiction to review,reverse,correct,or annul any order or decision of the commission.
the court entered judgment in favor of the cpuc on july.pegastaff timely filed a notice of appeal on september.
discussion 
the primary issue in this appeal is whether the trial court has subject matter jurisdiction over pegastaff constitutional claims against the cpuc.we conclude that the court correctly determined that it lacks jurisdiction.
also at issue is whether the trial court erred in denying pegastaff motion to transfer to this court.we conclude that there was no error because the trial court did not abuse its discretion.
i.the superior court correctly held that it lacked jurisdiction over pegastaff claims against the cpuc.
we review a trial court ruling on a motion for judgment on the pleadings de novo.smiley citibank cal th.we treat as true all material facts properly pleaded,but not contentions,deductions or conclusions of fact or law.dipirro american isuzu motors,supra,th at.
further,w hether the superior court has subject matter jurisdiction over an action against the cpuc is a question of law we independently review.disenhouse peevey th.
a.the constitution,the cpuc and the legislative scheme 
the california constitution establishes the cpuc and charges it with certain functions.cal,art.xii.as relevant here,the constitution provides that the cpuc may fix rates,establish rates,examine records,issue subpenas,administer oaths,take testimony,punish for contempt,and prescribe a uniform system of accounts for all public utilities subject to its jurisdiction.it also provides that s ubject to statute and due process,the cpuc may establish its own procedures.
the constitution also provides that public utility companies are subject to control by the legislature.cal,art.xii.further,it confers on the legislature plenary power,unlimited by the other provisions in this constitution but consistent with this article,to confer additional authority and jurisdiction upon the cpuc and to establish the manner and scope of review of commission action in a court of record.
the legislature used this power to enact the public utilities act et and many other statutes comprising the public utilities code,including section,which confers expansive authority on the cpuc the commission may supervise and regulate every public utility in the state and may do all things,whether specifically designated in the public utilities act or in addition thereto,which are necessary and convenient in the exercise of such power and jurisdiction.the public utilities code also includes article,encouraging the procurement of goods and services by public utilities and their contractors from wmdvbes.article declares as state policy to aid the interests of wmdvbes in order to preserve reasonable and just prices and a free competitive enterprise,to ensure that a fair proportion of the total purchases and contracts or subcontracts for commodities,supplies,technology,property,and services for regulated public utilities,including,but not limited to,renewable energy,wireless telecommunications,broadband,smart grid,and rail projects,are awarded to wmdvbes,and to maintain and strengthen the overall economy of the state,subd.a.
in furtherance of that policy,article authorizes and directs the cpuc to require utilities to submit an annual,detailed and verifiable plan for increasing procurement from wmdvbes,subd.a provide guidelines for utilities to use in establishing programs pursuant to article,subd.c recommend a program for carrying out the policy of article,subd.e and file an annual report with the legislature on the progress of activities undertaken by utilities in the implementation of such programs,subd.e.article also directs that the utilities annual plans shall include short and goals and timetables,but not quotas,and shall include methods for encouraging both prime contractors and grantees to engage wmdvbes in subcontracts in all categories that provide subcontracting opportunities,subd.b.

general order includes a section on goals for increasing the engagement of wmvdbes in subcontracting opportunities.general order.the goals section specifies minimum goals that utilities must set in their plans.
b.the limits on jurisdiction over cases involving the cpuc 
superior courts are courts of general jurisdiction,and generally have the authority to determine the constitutionality of statutes.cal,art.vi,rescue army municipal court of city of los angeles cal d.however,pursuant to its plenary authority under article xii,section of the state constitution to establish the manner and scope of review of commission action in a court of record,the legislature has explicitly restricted the jurisdiction of the superior court in cases involving the cpuc no court of this state,except the supreme court and the court of appeal,to the extent specified in this article,shall have jurisdiction to review,reverse,correct,or annul any order or decision of the commission or to suspend or delay the execution or operation thereof,or to enjoin,restrain,or interfere with the commission in the performance of its official duties,as provided by law and the rules of court.
pegastaff two claims asserted against the cpuc challenge article and general order on california constitutional grounds,and pegastaff seeks a declaration that they are unconstitutional and unenforceable.the trial court determined that under section it was without jurisdiction as to the challenge to article because to declare it unconstitutional would be to interfere with the cpuc in the performance of its official duties.the trial court also determined that under section it was without jurisdiction as to the challenge to general order because to declare it unconstitutional would be to annul an order of the cpuc.
pegastaff contends that the court erred as to both jurisdictional findings,arguing that the cpuc official duties are not implicated in its causes of action and that section does not address original claims for relief from the effects of general order.we disagree.
the superior court lacked jurisdiction over pega staff challenge to article.
the first question we consider is whether a declaration that article is unconstitutional would interfere with the cpuc in the performance of its official duties within the meaning of section.pegastaff arguments are confusing,at best.its first argument is that article does not expressly confer on the cpuc the power to set goals for utilities procurement from wmdvbes,and that setting and enforcing such goals are not,therefore,part of the cpuc official duties.from this premise,a decision on the constitutionality of article will not interfere with any such official duties.it further argues that if article is unconstitutional,then the cpuc has no valid official duties under those provisions with which the superior court could interfere.it contends,citing bnsf railway public utilities com.th bnsf railway,that setting wmdvbe procurement goals can not be part of the cpuc official duties because such goals are not cognate and germane to the regulation of public utilities.finally,pegastaff urges us to construe section to exclude constitutional challenges to statutes and cpuc regulations because the cpuc itself can not resolve such challenges 
the first argument is entirely off the mark because it focuses on the validity of general order,and not on the effect of the declaratory and injunctive relief pegastaff seeks as to article itself.pegastaff specifically requested a declaration that the provisions of article themselves are unconstitutional and an injunction against their enforcement.pegastaff concedes that the cpuc official duties are those set forth in the constitution and statutes.if the superior court had held that article was unconstitutional,that would interfere with the cpuc duties under that statute.whether or not the general order is authorized by article or constitutes a part of the cpuc official duties is beside the point in deciding whether there is jurisdiction to consider the challenge to article.
pegastaff further argument that if article is unconstitutional it does not confer valid duties with which a superior court ruling could interfere turns the jurisdictional statute on its head.pegastaff interpretation of official duties would require the superior court to decide the merits of pegastaff challenge in order to decide whether it has jurisdiction to rule on that very challenge.section denies jurisdiction to review or reverse cpuc orders and decisions and to enjoin,restrain,or interfere with the cpuc performance of its official duties.pegastaff argument that the superior courts are free to hold statutes,orders and decisions invalid would entirely undermine section fundamental purpose of limiting judicial review over challenges to cpuc orders and actions so as to expedite the ir final operative effect.county of sonoma state energy resources conservation.com.cal d,in channeling judicial review of puc decisions to supreme court and later court of appeal,the legislature sought to expedite the final operative effect of those decisions see sexton atchison cal,sexton the clear intent of the provision as a whole is to place the commission,in so far as the state courts are concerned,in a position where it may not be hampered in the performance of any official act by any court,except to the extent and in the manner specified in the act itself disenhouse peevey,supra,th at referring to legislature aims in placing limits on judicial review of commission actions.
nor can pegastaff interpretation of official duties be squared with the language of section.the statute refers to official duties,as provided by law and the rules of court,making plain that a duty set forth in law is an official duty.nothing about that language suggests that a law must first be found constitutional or otherwise valid in order to be a source of the cpuc official duties.so long as a law was validly enacted by the legislature,any duties such statute imposes on the cpuc are official duties within the meaning of section,and the superior courts lack jurisdiction to interfere with the duties it imposes.
the california supreme court held precisely that a century ago in sexton.in that case,the plaintiff,a railroad shareholder,sought to challenge section of the public utilities act,which allowed commission members and employees to ride any railroad for free when in the performance of their duties.sexton,supra,cal.at.plaintiff contended that the section deprived the railroad of property without due process in violation of the federal and state constitutions.id.at the superior court sustained demurrers to the complaint for lack of jurisdiction under section predecessor to section,and the california supreme court affirmed.id.at.the plaintiff in sexton made the same arguments pegastaff asserts here that there can be no official duty,within the meaning of that term as used in the section,to enforce a provision of the act that is in violation of a constitutional provision,and that it was not the design of the section to interfere,in any way,with the jurisdiction of the superior court to inquire as to the validity of any provision of the act,and to prevent by injunction the attempted enforcement by the commission of the provision if it found it to be invalid.id.at.the court gave short shrift to these arguments the first of these arguments is not very earnestly pressed,and of course could not be in view of the language of the section.the matter of orders and decisions of the commission is dealt with in the first portion of the provision,while the latter portion,in language that can not be read otherwise,prevents any such interference as is therein declared with any official duty of the commission.we are satisfied that the second claim is equally untenable.the plain design of the provision was to prevent any interference with the commission by the courts,except as prescribed in the act itself,in the performance of any duty defined by the act.the term official duties as used therein can not reasonably be given any other meaning,especially when considered in connection with the first portion of the provision,as it must be.id.at.
pegastaff suggests that the law has significantly changed since sexton.but any doubt about the continued vitality of that decision is put to rest by justice baxter opinion,writing for the unanimous court,in greener workers comp.appeals bd.cal th greener.that case involved a constitutional challenge to a then new provision of the labor code terminating the power of the workers compensation appeals board to award attorneys fees to representatives of applicants who were not licensed attorneys.id.at.unlicensed representatives sued for declaratory relief to invalidate the statute on equal protection and other constitutional grounds.ibid.interpreting a workers compensation jurisdictional statute labor code section that was modeled after,and almost identical to section of the public utilities act current section id.at,the supreme court held that the superior court lacked jurisdiction to address a challenge to the constitutionality of the workers compensation statute.id.at.the court of appeal had held the opposite,accepting an argument similar to that made by the plaintiff in sexton and by pegastaff in this case that the action did not challenge an order of the board,and did not ask the superior court to interfere with the duties of the board,since the board had no duty to act under an invalid statute.id.at.
the supreme court reversed,observing that in sexton it had rejected the arguments on which the court of appeal relied that the jurisdictional limitations of section of the public utilities act applied only to review of orders of the commission and that granting the requested injunction against enforcement of the statute would not interfere with the commission performance of its duties because the commission had no duty to comply with an invalid statute.greener,supra,cal th at.the court concluded,as in sexton,that were the relief sought by plaintiffs granted,the effect of the superior court judgment would be to interfere with the board in carrying out the duty imposed on it by the challenged statutes id.at.
there is nothing about pegastaff constitutional challenge to article that is materially distinguishable from sexton and greener nor is there any merit to pegastaff argument,quoting bnsf railway,supra,d at page,that w hile the powers of the cpuc include under s ection to do all things which are necessary and convenient in the exercise of its power and jurisdiction,those powers are not unbounded and that additional powers and jurisdiction that the commission exercises must be cognate and germane to the regulation of public utilities.as pegastaff would have it,the cpuc adoption and enforcement of wmdve goals for utilities procurement contracts is not cognate or germane to the regulation of public utilities and thus not encompassed within the official duties addressed by section.pegastaff again ignores that official duties are the duties set forth in law.the legislature obviously viewed the goal of encouraging utilities increased use of wmdvbes for procurement as cognate and germane to the regulation of utilities when it enacted article if encouraging such procurement is cognate and germane,then that is so regardless of the method by which that objective is accomplished by goals or other mechanisms so long as quotas,prohibited by article,are not employed.to the extent pegastaff contends that the cpuc acted beyond the legislative authority conferred by article,that is irrelevant to whether there is jurisdiction over its challenge to article itself,as we have already stated.to the extent it is arguing that the legislature acted beyond its constitutional authority in enacting article,the argument fails for the same reason as its argument that article is unconstitutional and can not confer any valid duty.official duties encompass all duties imposed by law on the cpuc,and the superior court lacks jurisdiction to interfere with such duties on constitutional or any other grounds.
bnsf railway does not hold otherwise.the court there held simply that the additional and unspecified but broad supervisory and regulatory powers the legislature conferred on the cpuc under section were limited to powers that are cognate and germane to the regulation of public utilities.bnsf railway,th at.the issue was whether those additional unspecified powers were broad enough to allow the cpuc to issue an order that contravened a specific state statute.id.at.our sister court held they were not.id.at.unlike the cpuc directive in that case,which was in direct conflict with the legislation,the question here concerns a challenge to the legislation itself the legislature plainly concluded that encouraging procurement contracts with wmdvbes was germane to utility regulation.pegastaff argument that the cpuc efforts to comply with that statute are not ignores the legislature determination and finds no support in bnsf railway.
last,contrary to pegastaff final argument,the fact that the cpuc could not decline to enforce a statute duly enacted by the legislature on the ground that it violates the state or federal constitution does not require an interpretation of section that exempts such challenges from its limitation on superior court jurisdiction.pegastaff contends that article iii,section of the california constitution prevents the cpuc from declaring a statute unconstitutional or refusing to enforce it because it is unconstitutional absent an appellate court decision so holding.as pegastaff notes,the voters amended the california constitution with article iii,section in response
