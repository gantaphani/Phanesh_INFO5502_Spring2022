pacific gas electric company pg e provides electricity transmission services for customers in northern and central california.a small fraction of the company users are standby customers entities that generate their own electricity,but contract with pg e for supply in the event of power outages.the petitioners in this case,two unincorporated associations comprised of pg e standby customers,challenge how the utility determines the price for their service.at issue is whether the federal energy regulatory commission reasonably approved the unique rates pg e applies to standby customers.we hold that the agency decision was reasonable and therefore deny the petition for review.
under the federal power act act,et,the federal energy regulatory commission ferc or commission has exclusive authority to regulate the transmission and sale of electricity in interstate commerce.id.b.every utility must file with the commission a copy of its rates and charges.id.c.if a utility wants to change its pricing,the company must give sixty days notice to the commission,id.d,which has the authority to hold hearings on the proposed change,id.e,and the responsibility to ensure that all rates are just and reasonable,id.a.if the commission does not intervene,the rate goes into effect after the sixty days pass.see papago tribal util.auth.ferc,me.pub.utils.comm ferc.
this litigation involves a proposed rate change filed by pg e on january,that sought to boost its annual revenue from million to million.for all customers except the standby class,pg e applied what is called the peak method to determine the new rate.because of the unpredictable nature of the demand of standby customers,however,the utility determined the proposed rate for that class using a formula called the probabilistic method.
both formulas set prices on the basis of past demand.the method looks to the share of each customer class when demand is at its zenith.the utility begins by identifying the system peak,the hour in a given month when the system experiences its greatest demand for electricity.it then determines the percentage of peak usage that each class draws during that hour,averages the results over the course of a year,and divides the revenue pie accordingly.
the probabilistic method pg e applies to the standby customers is more complex.under this method,rates are based on the percentage of contract demand the standby class is likely to use,rather than usage at the time of system peak.contract demand is the maximum amount of electricity a standby customer can draw under the terms of its contract.for example,a standby customer may contract for up to megawatts mw,which means the customer can draw up to that amount of power at any time.because standby customers typically generate electricity for their own use and only draw electricity from pg e because of power outages,pg e does not charge them the full amount of contract demand.instead,using data reflecting historical usage by the standby customers,pg e determines what percentage of contract demand that class must shoulder.this percentage represents the cost allocation factor.for example,if contract demand is mw and past usage yields a cost allocation factor of,the standby customer only pays for mw of service,even though it has a right to draw up to mw.
this cost allocation factor,moreover,is made up of two parts a regional transmission allocation factor and a local transmission allocation factor.this division reflects the different pricing factors that apply at different stages in the transmission of electricity.pg e assesses the standby customers share of regional and local transmission costs,identifies an allocation factor for each,and then takes the weighted average of those two factors to produce the overall cost allocation factor.a witness for pg e testified that the company originally developed the regional factor for allocating the cost of generating electricity and then determined that this factor would reasonably reflect the costs of regional transmission as well.as for the local allocation factor,pg e randomly selected several standby customers,calculated their total contract demand,and then took note of their actual usage for each hour during the peak period monday through friday,to,may through october to produce a curve.the company then identified the ninetieth percentile point on that curve the hour where electricity usage by the sample of standby customers was greater than nine out of every ten hours during the peak period.pg e chose this point regardless of when system peak occurred.finally,the company calculated the demand at the ninetieth percentile point as a percentage of the sample total contract demand to produce the local allocation factor.
contract demand for the standby class is mw.in its proposed allocation,pg e assigned a factor for the regional costs and a factor for the local costs,producing a weighted average of approximately that is to say,the standby class would pay of the cost for mw.under the proposal,the standby class went from paying per kilowatt to for the same.
after pg e filed its proposed rate increase,the commission suspended the new rates and scheduled a hearing to determine whether they were just and reasonable.pac.gas.the administrative law judge alj issued a summary disposition on one issue and the parties resolved their dispute as to all other issues,except for the question now before us.see pac.gas,at describing procedural history.the alj concluded in principle it was reasonable to assign unique rates to standby customers based on contract demand because they were not similarly situated to other classes.the alj found that demand by standby customers is random they typically can not predict when their generating units will go offline and require electricity from pg id.at having pg e standing ready to provide service on demand is a valuable service and rates based on this potential use of power,rather than actual use are not per se unreasonable.
turning to the particular method pg e used to determine the standby customers share of regional and local transmission costs,however,the alj held that recent data did not support the methodology pg e used for its standby customers.id.at.instead,the alj concluded that more recent data supported applying the method,id.at,and observed that w hile standby service is unpredictable,the relatively small size of the standby class in this case mitigates this difficulty,id.at.pg e and ferc both filed exceptions to the decision,which the standby customers also opposed.
on review,the commission agreed with the alj that the standby class is not similarly situated to the other classes and that a rate based on contract demand may be lawful if supported by sufficient data on past demand.pac.gas,at.the commission,however,reversed the alj conclusion that the method was appropriate and instead held that substantial and persuasive evidence supported pg e proposed allocation of costs to the standby customers based on the application of the probabilistic method to contract demand.id.at.ferc denied a subsequent request for rehearing,pac.gas,and the standby class filed a timely petition for review in this court challenging both the methodology and the overall cost allocation factor that pg e proposed.
