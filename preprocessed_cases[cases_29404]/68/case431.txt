in these consolidated cases,we consider what remedies,particularly monetary ones with retroactive effect,are available for electric service providers and ultimately electricity consumers who experience substantial price increases when a deregulated energy market fails to operate properly.here,the federal energy regulatory finding serious problems in the market for operating reserves,imposing a prospective rate cap,and requiring other corrective that it lacked authority under the federal power act to revise rates retroactively.although we agree with that holding,we find that ferc failed to explain adequately why certain emergency procedures for rebilling were unavailable,erred in concluding that the independent operator had not violated its tariff for pricing different types of reserves,and failed to consider other alleged tariff violations.we therefore grant the petitions in part and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
the new york independent service operator nyiso,a corporation,operates the bulk power transmission system in new york.nyiso provides open access transmission service and maintains system reliability.cent.hudson gas,order on reh g.it also administers competitive,electricity markets and monitors them for exercises of market power.indep.operator,market monitoring plan or order.nyiso operates under tariffs filed with ferc,including the tariff involved in this case,the market administration and control area services tariff services tariff.unlike tariffs for traditional rates,the filed tariffs at issue here contain no precise prices instead,they set standards for nyiso administration of competitive electric power markets.
under the services tariff,nyiso maintains a market for ancillary services,including operating reserves.see services tariff,at.operating reserves allow utilities to produce electricity on short notice to meet load the total demand for service on a utility system.spinning reserve sr is synchronized to the system and available almost immediately.reserve nsr,though not loaded,can be synchronized within ten minutes.certain amounts of operating reserves must be available every hour to maintain system reliability.power suppliers offer bids to sell sr and nsr at certain prices in the nyiso market.entities lses transmission facility owners that provide electric purchase reserves from nyiso.
nyiso also operates under its market monitoring plan mmp and temporary extraordinary procedures tep,two measures filed with and approved by ferc that give nyiso authority to remedy specified problems that may arise in the deregulated market.while the precise scope of these measures is in some dispute,they allow nyiso to take certain actions,such as issuing letters under the mmp to request that a participant cease behavior that suggests the exercise of market power and recalculating the prices under tep to the level that would have cleared the market absent a software malfunction.
the federal energy regulatory commission oversees this system pursuant to the federal power act fpa,et,several provisions of which are at issue in this case.under sections and,ferc has both the authority and duty to regulate rates for wholesale electric power and to prohibit utilities from charging unreasonable rates.id.section d requires public utilities to file new rates or proposed changes with ferc,which typically take effect in sixty days.id.d.for good cause shown,however,ferc may waive the notice requirement,thus allowing rate changes to take effect immediately.id.under section a,ferc may investigate whether a particular rate or charge is just and reasonable.id.a.if ferc finds a rate unreasonable,it must order imposition of a just and reasonable rate.id.ferc may then order refunds for any period subsequent to the refund effective date,a date ferc establishes that must be at least sixty days after the filing of the complaint.id.b.under section,however,ferc may not order refunds for any period prior to the filing of the complaint.id.in contrast,fpa section gives ferc authority to order refunds if it finds violations of the filed tariff.see id.vesting ferc with authority to perform any and all acts it may find necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of the act towns of concord,norwood,wellesley,ferc,explaining that authority to give refunds derives from fpa section.
this case arises out of events that occurred approximately two months after nyiso began operations.between january,and late march the lses experienced a dramatic increase in prices in the market for nsr.prices spiked from averages of per megawatt per hour in november and the following month to an average of in february,reaching a high of that month.at the same time,the quantity of nsr that suppliers offered dropped dramatically.for example,nsr offered at less than declined approximately percent,from over megawatts prior to january to a low of just over megawatts during that period.according to nyiso,during the six weeks from january to march,the total cost to lses purchasing reserves rose by approximately million.during that same period,nyiso reported that the market for nsr was also highly three generators controlled percent of nsr capacity.see indep.operator,initial order.
on march,nyiso responded to this substantial price increase by filing a request with ferc pursuant to fpa section to suspend immediately bids for reserves.it also asked for authority to revise its services tariff to subject nsr bids to a cap,the highest market clearing price for nsr prior to january,the last day on which the market appeared to function normally,and rebill for march pending the outcome of an alternative dispute resolution adr process that nyiso requested ferc to initiate.request of nyiso for suspension of pricing for reserves and to shorten notice period,at.around the same time,the lses filed complaints with ferc pursuant to fpa section.according to the lses,nyiso violated its services tariff and operated under several market design as failing to accept bids from other qualified compounded the problems in the reserves market.the lses asked ferc to direct nyiso to correct the practices that allegedly violated the tariff and to order refunds for the alleged overcharges resulting from the violations.they also sought to compel nyiso to invoke its temporary extraordinary procedures,a set of remedial measures that ferc had previously approved.see indep.operator,first tep order,reh g denied.
in the first of three orders,ferc found that nyiso had presented sufficient evidence to call into question continued reliance on pricing for reserves.initial order,at.it found that the markets were even more concentrated than indicated in the original analysis,and that the conditions under which rate authority for ancillary services was granted do not match the current operational realities of the new york iso reserve markets.id.at.that said,ferc stated that it ma d e no finding here that any supplier engaged in the withholding of capacity.id.
based on its conclusion that the market was not operating properly,ferc granted nyiso request for a bid cap and waived the notice requirement so that the cap could take effect the day after the filing.id.at.explaining that it had no authority to grant retroactive relief,however,ferc rejected nyiso requests to rebill for reserves in march and to initiate adr procedures.id.ferc affirmed this decision in two subsequent orders.see first rehearing order second rehearing order.with respect to the lse complaints alleging nyiso tariff violations and market design flaws,ferc denied the request for refunds because it found that nyiso had not violated the services tariff.initial order,at.it also declined to require nyiso to implement its temporary extraordinary procedures.see id.at.granting prospective relief,however,ferc directed nyiso to make several changes in its administration of the reserves market.id.at.the commission affirmed this decision in its first rehearing order.see at.
both nyiso and the lses now seek review of these three orders.the suppliers intervene in support of ferc.before us are three issues whether ferc properly concluded that it lacked authority to provide retroactive relief under fpa section,found the temporary extraordinary procedures inapplicable and unavailable to provide relief,and determined that nyiso had not violated the services tariff.we address each issue in turn.
we begin with the question of retroactive relief under fpa section.section d provides 
unless the commission otherwise orders,no change shall be made by any public utility in any rate,charge,or rule,except after sixty days notice to the commission and to the public.such notice shall be given by filing with the commission and keeping open for public inspection new schedules stating plainly the change or changes to be made in the schedule or schedules then in force and the time when the change or changes will go into effect.the commission,for good cause shown,may allow changes to take effect without requiring the sixty days notice herein provided for by an order specifying the changes so to be made and the time when they shall take effect and the manner in which they shall be filed and published.
d.although ferc found good cause to waive the notice period,thus allowing the bid cap to become effective the day after nyiso filing,it concluded that it had no authority to grant retroactive relief for the two months prior to the filing despite the dramatic price spike.both nyiso and the lses insist that ferc may order such retroactive relief upon a finding of good cause.we disagree.
in columbia gas transmission ferc,we interpreted a provision in the natural gas act that is virtually identical to fpa section,holding that ferc good cause waiver authority does not permit it to make a retroactive rate adjustment.id.at.courts have applied interpretations of natural gas act provisions to their counterparts in the federal power act because the relevant provisions of the two statutes are in all material respects substantially identical.city of girard,ferc,quoting arkansas louisiana gas hall,d quoting fed.power comm sierra pacific power.internal quotation marks omitted.as ferc explains,moreover,its decision to deny nyiso retroactive relief rested on columbia gas filed rate doctrine and its corollary,the rule against retroactive ratemaking.the filed rate doctrine forbids a regulated entity to charge rates for its services other than those properly filed with the appropriate federal regulatory authority.gas,at.the related rule against retroactive ratemaking prohibits the commission from adjusting current rates to make up for a utility over or in prior periods.towns of concord,at.by authorizing only prospective rate changes,these doctrines ensure rate predictability,see columbia gas,at,and by preventing discriminatory pricing,they promote equity,see exxon,ferc.
courts have recognized only two circumstances in which a rate adjustment may take effect prior to a section filing when parties have notice that a rate is tentative and may be later adjusted with retroactive effect,or when they have agreed to make a rate effective retroactively.see id.at noting that t he rule against retroactive ratemaking does not extend to cases in which customers are on adequate notice that resolution of some specific issue may cause a later adjustment to the rate being collected at the time of service alteration and omission in original internal quotation marks and citations omitted city of holyoke gas dep t ferc,finding ferc decision to make the rate change effective prior to the filing date proper because the parties had contracted to make rate retroactive and a waiver was not against the public interest.neither of these circumstances undermines the twin goals of predictability and equity.see exxon,at finding that equity and predictability are not undermined when the commission warns all parties involved that a change in rates is only tentative and might be disallowed quoting oxy usa,ferc,internal quotation marks omitted columbia gas,at describing city of piqua ferc,in which the parties agreed to make a rate change effective on a date before the filing,as a case that did not implicate the filed rate doctrine.
nyiso argues that this case falls under the notice exception.it points to its market monitoring plan and temporary extraordinary procedures as sources of notice to suppliers that rates might be adjusted retroactively.although the mmp authorizes nyiso to undertake remedial measures to correct problems associated with the exercise of market power,nyiso points to nothing in the mmp suggesting that such measures may have retroactive effect.see mmp order,at.we thus see no way that the mmp could have provided the requisite notice to market participants.
nyiso reliance on tep as a source of notice also fails,but for a different reason.tep allows nyiso to recalculate prices to the level they would have reached absent market design or implementation flaws that produced noncompetitive prices.first tep order,at.according to nyiso,this demonstrates that suppliers had notice that rates could be adjusted retroactively even without a showing of market power.nyiso,however,failed to raise this argument before the commission,either in the initial proceedings or in its rehearing request,so we may not consider it now.see b no objection to the order of the commission shall be considered by the court unless such objection shall have been urged before the commission in the application for rehearing unless there is reasonable ground for failure so to do.
nyiso offers a second,more intriguing argument for avoiding the filed rate doctrine and the rule against retroactive ratemaking.pointing out that sellers and buyers in a deregulated market rely not on a single published rate,but rather on a filed tariff that provides for a competitive bid process,nyiso argues that participants expect to transact business pursuant to prices rebilling for past prices would therefore be neither inequitable nor unpredictable.this argument is twice waived nyiso never presented it to ferc,and although nyiso hints at the argument in its opening brief here,see petitioners br.at,it failed to develop it fully until its reply brief,see petitioners reply br.at see also mcnulty sec y of labor,b ecause this point appears for the first time in the company reply brief,we will not consider it.
we next turn to the lses argument that because of the design and implementation flaws associated with nyiso administration of the electricity market,ferc should have directed nyiso to provide a remedy under its temporary extraordinary procedures.tep is designed to address unanticipated market design flaws and transitional abnormalities.a market design flaw is defined as a market structure,market design,or implementation flaw which would result in market outcomes that would not be produced in a workably competitive market.first tep order,at.transitional abnormalities refer to systemic equipment malfunctions,including telecommunications failures or equipment outages.id.at.
the lses argue that ferc should have used tep to remedy two market flaws nyiso exclusion of a qualified supplier,the facility,from bidding into the nyiso reserves market,and nyiso failure to accept bids from western suppliers.these flaws,the lses charge,resulted in prices.according to the lses,using the extraordinary corrective actions under tep would have allowed nyiso,after following required procedures,to rebill the lses at the newly calculated rates that would have cleared the market had no flaws existed.this would have granted the presumably their monetary relief from the million spike.
although ferc acknowledged that tep allows for retroactive recalculation,it insisted that tep applies only in circumstances of straightforward calculation errors.first rehearing order,at.the nyiso tep authority,ferc concluded,was not designed to be used in circumstances such as these.id.ferc went on to explain that nrg power marketing,nyiso,in which it approved nyiso use of tep,was clearly distinguishable,since it involved limited,simple,and precise corrections to ensure that prices conformed to the filed rate.first rehearing order,at.
ferc explanation suffers from two related defects.first,ferc imposed no such limitation when it initially approv
