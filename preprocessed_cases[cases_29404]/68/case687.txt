this case involves a claim that mur lee grant,a customer,brought against southwestern electric power company,a public utility that provides electric service to east texas,arising out of a power fluctuation in her home.the issue is whether a provision in swepco tariff that limits swepco liability for personal injury damages resulting from power outages or service interruptions is enforceable.the trial court granted swepco motion based on this tariff provision.the court of appeals concluded that the tariff is prima facie unconscionable under the uniform commercial code and that grant produced enough evidence to raise a material fact issue about whether swepco owed grant a duty to prevent her injuries.we disagree that,in this case,swepco tariff limiting liability for personal injury is prima facie unconscionable under the ucc.rather,we conclude that the liability limitation in the tariff here is reasonable as a matter of law and thus enforceable against grant negligence claim.accordingly,we reverse in part and affirm in part the court of appeals judgment and render judgment for swepco.
background 
on june,grant noticed that lights were flickering and several appliances were not working in her home.grant called swepco to report trouble with her electrical service.upon arriving at grant home,swepco representative measured the voltage flowing into the house from the outside meter and found it was steady.thus,swepco representative advised grant to contact an electrician to determine if the problem was in her wiring or appliances.
the electrician found a problem and concluded that it came from swepco line.swepco technician returned to grant home and also discovered the problem.upon checking the surrounding power lines,the technician discovered a tree limb on an adjacent property had fallen and damaged a line.swepco technician repaired the line and restored regular voltage to the grant home.
later,grant spoke with a swepco agent,who allegedly assured grant that a representative would pick up the damaged appliances for repair.when swepco did not come to grant home,she again contacted the agent,who advised grant that she had to have her appliances checked and,if necessary,repaired.after learning swepco would not repair her appliances,grant unplugged several appliances and placed them on her kitchen table.later,as she walked by her kitchen table,grant alleges she suffered an electrical shock to her face that she claims came from either an unplugged television set,an electrical wall outlet,or a light switch.
grant sued swepco,claiming that it negligently failed to disconnect grant electricity service after it knew the fluctuating voltage had damaged grant appliances.swepco moved for a summary judgment under rules c and i of the texas rules of civil procedure.swepco asserted that its tariff precluded liability for personal injuries unless the utility acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct.swepco tariff,in relevant part,provides 
the company shall not be liable for damages occasioned by interruption,failure to commence delivery,or voltage,wave form,or frequency fluctuation caused by interruption or failure of service or delay in commencing service due to accident to or breakdown of plant,lines,or equipment,strike,riot,act of god,order of any court or judge granted in any bonafide adverse legal proceedings or action or any order of any commission or tribunal having jurisdiction or,without limitation by the preceding enumeration,any other act or things due to causes beyond its control,to the negligence of the company,its employees,or contractors,except to the extent that the damages are occasioned by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the company.
emphasis added.the public utility commission approved swepco tariff.the trial court granted summary judgment for swepco on grant negligence claim.the court of appeals affirmed in part,reversed in part,and remanded the case.at.the court of appeals determined that grant alleged negligence claims for her damages and property damage to her appliances,but she did not assert a claim.then,the court of appeals determined that the ucc applies to swepco tariff,and under the ucc,limiting liability for personal injury in a transaction is prima facie unconscionable.at see also.bus.c.because swepco failed to overcome the prima facie presumption,the court of appeals held that swepco tariff limiting liability for personal injury violated public policy.at.but the court of appeals affirmed summary judgment for swepco on grant claim.at.finally,the court of appeals concluded that a material fact issue existed about whether swepco owed grant a duty,and thus,the court of appeals remanded grant claim to the trial court.at.
we granted swepco petition for review to determine whether swepco tariff,which limits its liability for personal injuries,is prima facie unconscionable under the ucc and,if not,whether such a limitation on liability for ordinary negligence is reasonable.

state utilities regulation 
public utility regulatory act 
from to,the public utility regulatory act existed to establish a comprehensive and adequate regulatory system for electric utilities to assure rates,operations,and services that are just and reasonable to the consumers and to the electric utilities.a.because electric utilities were regional and service monopolies,the pura authorized the puc to regulate utilities as a substitute for competitive forces.see.b.the pura prohibited an electric utility from charging a rate that the puc did not authorize,granting an unreasonable preference or advantage to persons in a particular service class,or establishing an unreasonable difference in rates between localities or service classes.moreover,the pura prohibited an electric utility from raising rates to pass cost increases to retail customers.
the puc is a legislative creation with only those powers expressly conferred and necessary to accomplish its duties.see state public util.comm n.the pura gave the puc broad powers to do anything specifically designated or implied by the pura that is necessary and convenient to the puc authority.see.the pura also gave the puc exclusive jurisdiction to regulate utility rates,operations,and services.a,see also houston lighting power auchan usa,public util.comm v.at t.the puc required each utility to file a tariff that listed the utility services and rates and governed the utility relationship with its customers.admin.code.the puc defined a tariff as a schedule containing all charges,rules,and regulations listed separately by type of service and customer class.admin.code.the puc could reject any tariff that did not comply with the puc rules and regulations.admin.code g.once the puc approved the tariff,an electric utility could not charge a fee or impose any practices,rules,or regulations different from those the tariff described.a.admin.code b.furthermore,upon approval,the puc required that every utility make its tariff publicly available and that the utility employees assist the public in reviewing the tariffs.admin.code f.to change its rates,standards,classifications,rules,or practices,a utility had to file an amended tariff with the puc.
the legislature amended the pura in to deregulate the market and to permit certain electricity providers to compete for customers.senate comm.on util.restructuring,bill analysis.the pura states that the amendments may not interfere with or abrogate the rights or obligations of any party,including a retail or wholesale customer,to a contract with an electric utility.accordingly,the amendments do not affect a utility tariff filed under and governed by the pre regulatory scheme.
filed rate doctrine 
the doctrine applies when state law creates a state agency and a statutory scheme under which the agency determines reasonable rates for the service provided.arkansas.gas hall,d keogh chicago northwestern.southwestern bell.telecom,dist,writ denied.the doctrine holds that a tariff filed with and approved by an administrative agency under a statutory scheme is presumed reasonable unless a litigant proves otherwise.see western union.esteve.wegoland,nynex,cir telecom,at.thus,under the doctrine,filed tariffs govern a utility relationship with its customers and have the force and effect of law until suspended or set aside.see keogh,at.carter v.at t,cir telecom,at.
additionally,under the doctrine,regulated utilities can not vary a tariff terms with individual customers,discriminate in providing services,or charge rates other than those properly filed with the appropriate regulatory authority.maislin indus.primary steel,d arkansas.gas,at.telecom,at.and a utility obligations to its customers can not exceed its duties under a filed tariff.see texaco central power light,antonio,pet.denied central power light romero,antonio,writ denied see also arkansas.gas,at.it follows,then,that aggrieved customers can not enforce alleged rights that contradict the tariff provisions.henderson central power light,christi,pet.denied.consequently,the doctrine prohibits a customer from suing a utility in contract or tort over issues that a tariff terms govern.see at t central office,d maislin,at.
a regulatory agency authority authorizes it to approve a tariff provision limiting liability,because a limitation on liability is an inherent part of the rate the utility charges for its services.see western union,at.southwestern sugar molasses river terminals,d.and,because regulatory agencies have this authority,we have applied the doctrine to hold that a tariff provision that limits liability for economic damages arising from a utility negligence is reasonable.see auchan,at.in auchan,we considered several factors the puc has applied to conclude that a tariff can reasonably limit liability for economic damages.at see also.pub.util.comm n,application of cp l for approval of tariff amendment,docket.bull,june.we determined that a tariff limitation on liability for economic damages is reasonable because a utility must provide nondiscriminatory service to all customers within its area must maintain uniform rates and reduce costs can not accurately estimate its exposure to damages or efficiently insure against risks can not increase rates for all customers based on losses one specific class of customers incurs and must comply with puc regulations.auchan,at.
ucc article 
article of the ucc applies to sales that involve a transaction in goods.bus.the ucc defines a good as all things which are movable at the time of identification to the contract for sale other than the money in which the price is to be paid,investment securities and things in action.bus.a.if the ucc applies to a transaction,the parties can limit or exclude consequential damages arising from the transaction unless the limitation or exclusion is unconscionable.bus.c.in cases involving consumer goods,a limitation on consequential damages for personal injury is prima facie unconscionable,and the defendant must rebut this prima facie showing with evidence that the limitation is not unconscionable.bus.c.
but,the ucc does not govern a transaction if applying the ucc would impair or repeal any statute regulating sales to consumers,farmers or other specified classes of buyers.bus.courts have interpreted their states equivalents to texas section to mean that article does not apply if it supersedes or weakens special statutes regulating sales to a specified class of buyers.see,olson molacek,pugh stratton,utah.however,article may supplement a specific regulatory statute if it does not conflict with the statute and both article and the statute can be given full effect.see farmers livestock exchange,ulmer.gov t code a.if article conflicts with a regulatory statute,the regulatory statute prevails,and thus the regulated transaction does not fall within article scope.see hughes collegedale distributors,so d,gimbel kuntz.
iii.analysis 
does the ucc apply to swepco tariff 
swepco contends that the ucc does not apply here.swepco argues that its utility service is not a good under article of the ucc,because its dominant aspect is not the electric current physical characteristics,but the services that swepco provides.further,swepco contends that the ucc general presumptions must give way to specific tariff provisions that the puc approves under its exclusive jurisdiction.moreover,swepco asserts that even if the ucc applies to swepco tariff,the pura and puc regulations prohibit swepco from bargaining with its customers to vary the tariff terms.thus,swepco argues,swepco could not contract with grant for additional protections beyond those the tariff specifically provides.
in response,grant argues that a utility can not absolve itself from all responsibility for its negligence.furthermore,grant asserts that the puc approving swepco tariff does not relieve swepco of the duty to protect a customer from injuries the utility own negligence causes.grant argues that a tariff mere existence can not shield swepco from liability if it acts in an unreasonable manner.therefore,grant contends,the tariff limitation on liability for personal injury is unconscionable under the ucc.
we disagree with the court of appeals conclusion that article of the ucc applies here.see at.rather,we conclude that applying article would impair the comprehensive statutory scheme regulating the sale of electricity to texas consumers.and the ucc expressly prohibits such an application.bus.see also olson,at pugh,at.the pura expressly provides that its purpose is to establish a comprehensive and adequate regulatory system for electric utilities to assure rates,operations,and services that are just and reasonable to the consumers and electric utilities.a.under the pura,the puc controls a utility rates,operations and services.b.the puc does so as a substitute for competitive forces that would typically regulate prices in a free enterprise market.see.b.thus,unlike contracts for the sale of goods that unregulated companies may enter into in a free market,a public utility can only enter into contracts consistent with the regulatory scheme.accordingly,applying the ucc would impede the puc authority to approve and determine a utility rates,operations,and services.b.
additionally,the pura regulatory scheme directly conflicts with ucc section prohibiting limitations on liability in consumer goods transactions.when a regulatory agency approves a tariff,courts presume,under the doctrine,that the tariff is reasonable.see,western union,at.auchan,at telecom,at.here,under the pura,utilities had to submit tariffs for the puc approval before conducting business in texas,and they are bound by those tariffs terms.see.admin.code.to apply the ucc general provision prohibiting limitations on liability to swepco tariff would directly conflict with the presumption that the tariff is reasonable because the puc approved it under its ratemaking authority.see farmers livestock exchange,at.when such a conflict exists,the comprehensive regulatory scheme must prevail over the ucc general provisions.see hughes,so d at gimbel,at.
accordingly,we hold that the ucc does not apply to swepco tariff.consequently,the court of appeals erred in holding that ucc section requires a conclusion that the tariff limitation on liability for personal injury is prima facie unconscionable.
is swepco tariff reasonable 
swepco argues that the tariff provision limiting liability for personal injury is enforceable because the puc,which comprehensively regulates electric utilities rates and services,approved the tariff.moreover,swepco contends that because a tariff has the force and effect of law under the doctrine,the tariff is presumptively reasonable.swepco reasons that the electric utility industry differs from an unregulated industry in which a company can adjust its prices or services for liability risks.further,swepco asserts that the puc carefully defines a utility duties through its process and does not allow utilities to incorporate liability into its rates.finally,swepco contends that its tariff is reasonable under this court auchan analysis.see auchan,at.
in response,grant argues that whether a tariff limiting liability for personal injury is reasonable is a question for the.moreover,grant asserts that even if a utility can limit its liability,the utility nevertheless retains a duty to exercise proper precautions to anticipate and prevent injuries to customers.further,grant contends that the factors this court and the puc have applied to uphold a tariff provision limiting liability dealt solely with liability for economic damages and do not apply to liability for damages.finally,grant argues that the trial court granting summary judgment based on swepco tariff violates the provision of the texas constitution,article i,section.
we review a tariff reasonableness as a question of law.auchan,at.this court has never determined whether a provision in a utility tariff limiting liability for personal injuries is reasonable.however,we have held that a tariff provision limiting liability for economic damages resulting from a utility negligence was reasonable.auchan,at.likewise,a number of jurisdictions have upheld tariffs absolving utilities from liability for economic damages.see auchan,at citations therein.these jurisdictions only invalidate tariffs that purport to limit a utility liability for economic damages caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct.see auchan,at citations therein.
generally,the courts that have upheld tariff provisions limiting liability for economic damages hold that,when administrative agencies regulate utilities to ensure reasonable rates and nondiscriminatory service,such a liability limitation is presumed reasonable unless a litigant can show otherwise.see,western union,at.telecom,at.similarly,jurisdictions that have upheld a tariff provision limiting liability for damages did so because a regulatory agency comprehensively regulated the utility and approved the tariff so it had the force and effect of law.see los angeles cellular.superior of los angeles county,th,d,holding in a suit that a limitation on liability was valid because by its terms,the utility tariff applies to negligence actions without regard to the nature of the damages sought landrum florida power light,so d,holding in a and suit that a tariff validly approved by the public service commission,including a limitation on liability for ordinary negligence is valid.for these reasons,and those discussed below,we agree with these jurisdictions and conclude that swepco tariff provision limiting liability for personal injury is reasonable.
swepco tariff provision limiting its liability is reasonable because the provision is narrowly drawn and provides a remedy for swepco gross negligence or willful misconduct.see,landrum,so d at computer tool eng g,northern states power,a limitation for economic damages did not violate public policy because liability remains for gross negligence as well as willful or wanton acts.lee consolidated edison,misc d,a limitation for economic damages is reasonable so long as the company has not attempted to absolve itself from its own willful misconduct or gross negligence.furthermore,the tariff specifically states that swepco shall not be liable for damages occasioned by interruption,failure to commence delivery,or voltage,wave form,or frequency fluctuation caused by interruption or failure of service or delay in commencing service but it does not exclude claims against swepco that arise from swepco negligence in other contexts.for example,the tariff provision would not shield swepco from liability if an employee,in the performance of his or her duties,injures a person while driving to a job site.thus,swepco tariff provision limiting liability does not violate public policy,because it does not purport to relieve swepco from liability under all conceivable circumstances.see computer tool,at.
some of the factors we relied on in auchan also guide us in determining whether swepco tariff provision limiting liability for damages is reasonable.see auchan,at.in auchan,we observed that a tariff prevents a utility from refusing service to customers who have a greater potential for economic damages.see auchan,at.furthermore,we noted that if a utility customers suffer economic injuries,the utility can not raise rates to compensate for the losses it incurs if it is found liable.thus,we concluded a utility liability exposure could have a direct detrimental effect on its finances.see auchan,at see also landrum,so d at.additionally,we recognized that utilities consumers in a industry have protection,because utilities are subject to strict administrative review and control.auchan,at.based on these observations,and other factors not pertinent to our inquiry here,we held that the tariff limitation on liability for economic damages in that case was reasonable.
the auchan consideration that a regulated utility must provide service at uniform rates also applies in cases.if certain consumers are more likely to suffer personal injuries due to interruptions or fluctuations in electric service,a utility like swepco can not raise rates or deny service to compensate for these potential losses without the puc approval.rather,the pura regulatory scheme requires that a utility provide electricity at uniform rates on a nondiscriminatory basis.see arkansas.gas,at.keogh,at.thus,a tariff provision limiting liability for damages resulting under certain circumstances from a utility not gross negligence or willful the utility ability to provide effective,consistent,and nondiscriminatory service.
moreover,the auchan consideration that the electric utility industry affords consumers protection because the industry is highly regulated likewise applies in cases.auchan,at.the puc has broad regulatory authority to ensure utilities provide safe,adequate,efficient,and reasonable service.see.several puc regulations provide remedies to consumers and penalize utilities for unsafe or inadequate service.for example,the puc may institute a formal investigation against a utility on its own initiative or upon a customer complaint.admin.code a.a customer may complain to the puc about an electric utility acts or omissions that violate the pura or puc regulations.a.the puc resolves these complaints either through an informal proceeding or through a formal complaint process.admin.code c e.
the puc also imposes administrative penalties on utilities that do not provide safe,adequate,reasonable and efficient service to customers.see.pub.util.comm n,entergy gulf states.service quality issues severed from docket,docket,order on rehearing.pub.util.comm n,application of houston power and light,docket,wl,final order.these penalties can include lowering a utility reasonable return on investment capital,adopting minimum performance target levels the utility must meet,adopting performance benchmarks,requiring quality assurance through independent audits and consultants,and requiring the utility to provide notice to customers about a utility service quality requirements.see.pub.util.comm n,entergy gulf states,docket,at.
our conclusion that swepco tariff provision limiting liability for damages is reasonable does not conflict with crowell housing auth.of dallas.in crowell,the plaintiff alleged that a defective gas heater in an apartment that the dallas housing authority leased and maintained caused his father to die from poisoning.at.the court of appeals affirmed the trial court order granting the authority summary judgment based on a lease provision limiting the authority liability for personal injury and property damage.crowell.at.in decidi
