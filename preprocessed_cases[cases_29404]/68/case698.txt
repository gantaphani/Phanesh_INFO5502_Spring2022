the city of gainesville appeals a circuit court order dismissing its complaint,which sought validation of a proposed bond issue.we have jurisdiction.see art.v,b.const.the issue is whether the city stormwater fees constitute a user fee,which are authorized under florida statutes,or a special assessment,which generally may not be charged to state agencies.the issue is relevant to the bond validation because the city pledged the stormwater fees as collateral for the bonds.thus,if the fees are invalid,the bonds can not be approved.see,keys citizens for responsible gov t,florida keys aqueduct,so d,noting that where the municipality fees are tied to the financing agreement on which the bonds will be secured,the validity of the fees are part of the court inquiry into whether the public body has the authority to issue the bonds.for the reasons stated below,we find that the stormwater fees constitute valid user fees.therefore,we reverse the order and remand with directions to enter a judgment validating the bonds.
stormwater runoff may cause flooding and threatens water quality in urban areas.see.stat.noting that the objective of a stormwater management system is to prevent or reduce flooding and pollution.therefore,stormwater must be collected,conveyed,treated,and disposed of.florida law requires local governments to establish stormwater management programs.d.stat.stat.to fund such programs,local governments may c reate one or more stormwater utilities and adopt stormwater utility fees sufficient to plan,construct,operate,and maintain stormwater management systems set out in the local program required pursuant to.stat.a stormwater utility is defined as 
the funding of a stormwater management program by assessing the cost of the program to the beneficiaries based on their relative contribution to its need.it is operated as a typical utility which bills services regularly,similar to water and wastewater services.
the city created a stormwater utility.it based the rate structure for the utility fee on the impervious area of land.impervious area means that part of the land through which stormwater can not permeate,thus creating stormwater runoff the vast majority of stormwater utilities across the country establish their rate structures by measuring impervious area.
instead of calculating the exact amount of impervious area on each residential parcel,the city used statistical estimates.the most common unit that stormwater utilities use to measure impervious area is the equivalent residential unit eru.an eru is generally established as the average or median impervious area of a home.in this case,the city determined that the median property in the city included square feet of impervious area.based on this calculation,the city established square feet as one eru.it then created three classes of users and assigned different erus to each class.most properties are assigned one eru.the city found that the impervious area of residential units was generally lower than for homes.it therefore assigned erus for apartments and mobile homes and eru for condominiums and duplexes.
for nonresidential properties,the city measured each property individually over total and assigned an eru value to each.the eru value is determined by measuring the square footage of impervious area on the property and dividing by.
under the city rate structure,properties that do not use the stormwater is,that retain all stormwater not charged a fee for example,the city does not impose the fee on undeveloped properties because they contain no impervious area.also,the university of florida campus drains into a lake for which the university provides all stormwater management services.
the city charges the fees on a monthly basis.it uses the revenue generated exclusively for stormwater management services.gainesville,code art.v.delinquent charges may be referred to a collection agency,or to the city attorney.id.the code does not permit placement of a lien on property to collect delinquent charges.
the department of transportation dot refused to pay the city stormwater fees,arguing that it was exempt from such charges because the fees constituted either a tax or a special assessment the city filed a complaint seeking a judgment declaring that the stormwater fees constituted valid user fees and not special assessments,and claiming damages for unpaid fees.the circuit court dismissed the complaint on the dot motion,ruling as a matter of law that the city stormwater fees constituted a special assessment.the first district court of appeal reversed.in a thorough opinion,the court held that the city ordinance,if it operates as the city has alleged that is,if it assesses the cost of the program to the beneficiaries based on their relative contribution to its need and operates as a typical utility which bills services regularly imposes utility service fees rather than special assessments.city of gainesville state dep t of,so d,dca.the city,however,did not pursue that litigation and eventually filed a voluntary dismissal.
the issue of dot obligation to pay the stormwater fees arose again in,when the city commission approved issuance of revenue bonds to fund capital improvements to the stormwater system.revenues from the stormwater fees will pay for the bonds.the city filed a complaint under section,florida statutes,seeking to validate its proposed bond issue.the state and the dot opposed validation.the dot again argued that the stormwater fees were at least did not apply to state they constituted a tax or special assessment.all parties agreed that the only impediment to issuing the bonds was the validity of the underlying ordinance.
the circuit court held an evidentiary hearing.the court dismissed the complaint,finding that the city fee was not based on the amount of stormwater a customer contributes to the system and that the fee was not voluntary.the court concluded that the city of gainesville does not have the authority to incur the obligations which are the subject of this action.the court denied the city motion for rehearing and clarification.this appeal follows.
ii.scope and standard of review 
we have previously explained the scope of a bond validation proceeding c ourts should determine if a public body has the authority to issue the subject bonds determine if the purpose of the obligation is legal and ensure that the authorization of the obligation complies with the requirements of law.state city of port orange,so d.subsumed within the inquiry as to whether the public body has the authority to issue the subject bond is the legality of the financing agreement upon which the bond is secured.id.at.in this case,the stormwater fees are pledged to repay the bonds.the validity of those fees is the only issue.we review the trial court findings of fact for substantial competent evidence and its conclusions of law de novo.city of boca raton state,so d,upholding trial court findings that were based on competent substantial evidence panama city beach cmty.redev.agency state,so d,it is clear that this court review of the trial court conclusions of law is de novo.
iii.analysis 
to determine the legality of the financing agreement we must address two issues a whether the city fee is a user fee or a special assessment and b the propriety of the city fee structure.we address these issues in turn.
user fee or special assessment 
dot does not argue that the stormwater fees constitute a tax.therefore,in determining the validity of the bonds,we must decide whether the city stormwater fee constitutes a user fee or a special assessment.if the stormwater fee is a user fee,the fee is valid and the state and dot,as beneficiaries of the system,can be charged.if the fee is a special assessment,however,the state and dot can not be assessed the fee absent statutory authorization.see city of gainesville,so d at noting that state agencies may not be charged special assessments absent a statute specially authorizing special assessments on state property quoting blake city of tampa,so.
we acknowledge that under the authorizing statute a municipality may fund its stormwater management system either through the use of user fees or through special assessments.see generally.stat.however,when a municipality chooses to fund its stormwater management system through special assessments,it does so pursuant to section and therefore does not technically establish a stormwater utility.compare authorizing the creation of a stormwater utility and the imposition of stormwater utility fees,with authorizing special assessments to fund a stormwater management system.although section,florida statutes,authorizes special assessments,the city has not followed the required procedures under that section.rather,the city has established a stormwater utility under section and has imposed utility fees.therefore,the stormwater fees are only legal if they constitute user fees.
we have previously recognized that user fees and special assessments are similar.see collier county state,so d.we have defined user fees as 
charges based upon the proprietary right of the governing body permitting the use of the instrumentality involved.such fees share common traits that distinguish them from taxes they are charged in exchange for a particular governmental service which benefits the party paying the fee in a manner not shared by other members of society,and they are paid by choice,in that the party paying the fee has the option of not utilizing the governmental service and thereby avoiding the charge.
city of port orange,so d at citations omitted.similarly,special assessments are charge s assessed against the property of some particular locality because that property derives some special benefit from the expenditure of the money.workman,hernando county,so d,dca quoting atlantic coast line city of gainesville,so.
as the first district noted in the related case,t he boundary between special assessments and user fees is not always clear.city of gainesville,so d at.one leading authority has explained the difference between user fees and special assessments as follows 
in determining whether a charge for connecting property with the municipal water service is a fee or an assessment,the name given to the charge is not controlling it is the reason for the charge which controls its nature,and if it is a charge made for the improvement of a certain piece of property,it is an assessment.similarly,charges for connection to or the use of a sewer generally are not deemed taxes.
there is no test for distinguishing between a fee and a special assessment generally,a fee is exchanged for a service rendered or a benefit conferred,and some reasonable relationship exists between the amount of the fee and the value of the service or benefit,while a special assessment is a specific levy designed to recover the costs of improvements that confer local and peculiar benefits upon property within a defined area.user fees are those which are charged only to the person actually using the service,and the amount of the charge generally is related to the actual goods or services provided and is a monthly charge rather than a charge.
d,special or local assessments,at footnotes omitted,quoted in city of gainesville,so d at.
we therefore consider various factors in determining whether the stormwater fees in this case constitute a user fee or a special assessment.these include the name given to the charge the relationship between the amount of the fee and the value of the service or benefit whether the fee is charged only to users of the service or is charged to all residents of a given area whether the fee is is,whether a property owner may avoid the fee by refusing the service whether the fee is a monthly charge or a charge whether the fee is charged to recover the costs of improvements to a defined area or infrastructure or for the routine provision of a service whether the fee is for a traditional utility service and whether the fee is statutorily authorized as a fee.none of these factors is controlling nor are they necessarily exclusive.rather,we must consider each factor in light of the circumstances as a whole in each particular case.
in this case,considering all the circumstances,we conclude that the stormwater fees constitute a user fee,not a special assessment.the city itself calls the fee a user fee,which is not dispositive but is relevant.moreover,the city charges the fees on a monthly basis,not as a charge.
the city creation of a stormwater utility,as the statute authorized,is a strong factor militating in favor of finding the stormwater fees a user fee.the city establish ed stormwater management as a city utility enterprise in accordance with and establish ed a program of user charges for stormwater management service to be charged to all developed property within the city that contributes stormwater runoff to the city stormwater management systems to accomplish the functions of such utility.gainesville,code art.v.
we have previously recognized that the creation of a utility strongly favors the validity of the fees imposed.in pinellas county state,so d,footnote omitted,we noted that where a governmental entity provides access to traditional utility services,this court has not hesitated to uphold local ordinances imposing mandatory fees,regardless of whether the individual customer actually uses or desires the service.in a footnote,we cited stormwater management programs defined under section,florida statutes as one category of many programs imposing mandatory fees to recoup the costs of providing water service.id.at.in another footnote,we noted that water systems are equivalent to traditional utilities such as sewer systems.id.at.also,in city of port orange,so d at,we distinguished a transportation utility fee that we held to be a tax from stormwater utility fees,noting that utility fees are expressly authorized by section,florida statutes.see also city of dunedin contractors builders ass n,so d,dca the imposition of fees for the use of a municipal utility system is not an exercise of the taxing power nor is it the levy of a special assessment.citing state city of miami,so d,quashed on other grounds,so d.therefore,the fact that the city has created a utility to provide stormwater management services militates strongly in favor of finding that the stormwater fees are user fees.
the state and dot argue that the city fee constitutes a special assessment because it is not voluntary.the evidence showed,however,that in most cases the fee is voluntary.the city requires only properties that actually use the system to pay the fee.properties that are either undeveloped or implement ways to retain all stormwater on site are exempted.therefore,property owners can avoid the fee either by not developing the property or by implementing a system to retain stormwater on site.see city of gainesville,so d at holding that b ecause a landowner can refuse the city stormwater utility service and prevent liability for stormwater utility fees by containing runoff,the fees are neither a tax nor a special assessment.
nevertheless,the state and dot argue that regarding apartment complexes in particular,because the city charges the fee to the tenants,not the owners,and because the tenants can not avoid the fee,the fee is not voluntary as to those tenants.they rely on port orange,so d at,in which we noted that user fees are paid by choice,in that the party paying the fee has the option of not utilizing the governmental service and thereby avoiding the charge.in this case,however,tenants may avoid the charge by choosing to live in dwellings that do not use the city stormwater system.
even if we accept the proposition that tenants have no choice,although the voluntariness of the fee is one factor to consider,it is not dispositive.in pinellas county,so d at,we noted that we have upheld even mandatory fees for traditional utility services.a stormwater utility is similar to wastewater and sewer systems.florida courts have upheld mandatory fees for such systems.see state city of miami springs,so d holding that a municipality may charge a mandatory fee for sewer service unrelated to actual use town of redington shores redington towers,so d dca holding that the subject sewer fee applied to unoccupied condominiums without regard to actual use see also ston
