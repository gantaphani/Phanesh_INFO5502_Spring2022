background 
respondent bonneville power administration bpa is a federal agency charged by congress with marketing the hydroelectric power generated by a series of dams along the columbia river.see.petitioners kaiser,alcoa and vanalco are aluminum smelters permitted by the northwest power act to buy electric power directly from bpa as direct service industrial customers dsis.see,d a,and g.
bpa is governed largely by four statutes the bonneville project act of,project act the pacific northwest consumer power preference act of,preference act the pacific northwest federal transmission system act of,transmission act and the pacific northwest electric power planning and conservation act of,northwest power act.in association of public agency customers apac bonneville power administration,cir,we recognized that t hese statutes subject bpa to a variety of detailed and potentially conflicting statutory directives.for example,the northwest power act requires bpa to set its rates for electric power at a level sufficient to meet its costs and to repay the federal debt incurred in building the projects included in the federal columbia river power system.id.citing,a.in apac,we noted that while such a requirement would tend to encourage higher rates,the transmission system act requires that bpa market federal power with a view to encouraging the widest possible diversified use of electric power at the lowest possible rates to consumers consistent with sound business principles.id.quoting.additionally,bpa must also be environmentally conscious,support energy conservation,and act to protect the fish and wildlife of the columbia river basin.id.citing.
bpa customers include federal agencies,public bodies including public utilities,private utilities,and dsis such as petitioners.see aluminum of america alcoa i central lincoln peoples utility,d.public bodies are preference customers to whom bpa is required to give priority over customers.id.at.citing b.bpa primary marketing area,however,is the pacific northwest,which includes washington,oregon,idaho,the part of montana west of the continental divide,and the parts of utah,wyoming and nevada that are within the columbia river drainage.see aluminum of america alcoa ii bonneville power,cir citing.under the preference act,bpa may sell power outside the pacific northwest,but only if it has surplus energy to do so id.citing.surplus energy is defined as electric energy generated at federal hydroelectric plants in the pacific northwest which would otherwise be wasted because of the lack of a market therefore in the pacific northwest at any established rate.c.
in the,projections showed that due to increases in power demands,preferences to northwest public bodies would soon require all of bpa power.alcoa i,at.accordingly,in,bpa announced that new contracts to private utilities would not be offered.id.while bpa signed contracts with dsis in,bpa advised the dsis that their new contracts would not likely be renewed when they expired,sometime between.id.in order to avoid disputes over bpa proposed power allocations,in,congress enacted the northwest power act.id.at.the northwest power act allowed bpa to acquire resources to increase the supply of federal power,and required bpa to enter into long term contracts providing dsis the same amount of power to which they were entitled under the contracts.id.at.citing section d b of the northwest power act,d b.pursuant to this directive,in,bpa entered into contracts with the dsis the contracts.see apac,at.the contracts allowed the dsis to vary their power load depending upon market conditions and to terminate their contracts with one year notice to bpa.see see also power sales contract between alcoa and bpa executed on august,a.the contracts also required any dsi desiring to continue purchasing bpa power after the term to request a replacement contract by june.see apac,at.
in the,the price of wholesale power in the pacific northwest began to drop and,for the first time in history,bpa faced considerable price competition.id.by the fall of,competition for the dsis business was fierce.id.at.many dsis were considering offers from alternative power suppliers at prices below bpa rates.see id.bpa,therefore,began proceedings to create more competitive rates.see id.bpa responded to these competing offers by offering the dsis block sales contracts,including target rates which were later established as actual rates.see id.at.of the petitioners,kaiser was the only one to enter into a block sales contract.because kaiser did not terminate its block sales contract,kaiser prior contract terminated.
in a letter dated september,vanalco terminated its entire c ontract d emand effective march,and decided to buy power and services from other providers.on march,however,vanalco amended its termination letter to terminate only megawatts of its megawatts of contract demand.
in june,bpa issued its rate record of decision rate rod making findings and conclusions regarding its proposed rates.bpa completed its proceedings and,effective october,established the rate and the rate.the rates were confirmed and approved by the federal energy regulatory commision ferc on july.see ferc,wl july.the rate was more or less a fixed rate which applied to dsi customers purchasing under the contract full requirement dsi customers purchasing under the block sales contracts and partial requirement dsi customers purchasing under the block sales contracts.the rate was a more flexible rate which could react to market pressures,and was available for the purchase of firm power for use inside and outside the pacific northwest.
prior to ferc approval,on january,bpa and its customers including petitioners executed a settlement agreement the settlement agreement to resolve,without litigation,disputes concerning the aspects of the rate schedule.in the settlement agreement,bpa agreed to limit the amount of firm energy sold under the rate and adopt a rate cap,which provides that bpa shall not charge more than mills per for firm power on an annual average basis which is based on the costs of bpa resource.the settlement agreement also provided that t he parties shall not challenge the establishment or the confirmation and approval of the rate schedule in the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit.
effective march,alcoa agreed with bpa,in a firm energy sales agreement,to forego its contract at the rate for one year in order to purchase all of its power requirements with surplus firm energy at the rate.alcoa and bpa renewed that agreement in and.the version provided that d uring the term of this agreement,alcoa hereby waives its right to purchase power at the addy point of delivery under the power sales contract.the version also indicated that d uring the term of this agreement,the operating demand as this term is defined in the power sales contract at the addy point of delivery shall be deemed equal to zero.the version further provided that b eginning on april,and continuing for the duration of the power sales contract,any requested increase in operating demand for the addy point delivery shall be upon written notice by alcoa,and subject to approval by bpa.the version expired on june,unless extended.
from the date the rate became effective until approximately november,the rate has been more economical than the rate.during that time period,vanalco did not attempt to purchase power at the rate,other than the amw of power vanalco retained under its contrac
