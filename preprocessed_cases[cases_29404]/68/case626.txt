rincon del diablo municipal water district,vallecitos water district,valley center municipal water district,vista irrigation district and yuima municipal water district collectively the northern districts sued the san diego county water authority sdcwa and all other interested persons to invalidate the portion of sdcwa ordinance the ordinance setting the transportation rate,a component of the water rate.after the parties each filed summary judgment motions,the court granted summary judgment in favor of sdcwa.the northern districts appeal,contending the capital portion of the transportation rate capital portion is a capacity charge as defined by government code section and the capital portion violates section because it is not reasonable.we affirm.
factual and procedural history 
sdcwa is an independent public agency operating under the authority of the county water authority act,ch.it provides wholesale water service to member agencies,including the northern districts.sdcwa purchases all the water it provides from the metropolitan water district of southern california mwd.that water enters sdcwa aqueduct system at turnover points located near the border of san diego and riverside counties.
the northern districts comprise five of the water districts in the northeastern section of san diego county,which are near the turnover points.because mwd water enters at the northern boundary of san diego county,the northern districts use less of sdcwa aqueduct system than those water districts in the southern part of san diego county.in,the agencies comprising the northern districts plus fallbrook public utility system and rainbow municipal water district formed the economic study group esg and hired engineering to conduct a study of sdcwa water rates and propose modifications to fairly reflect the cost of service to esg members.the esg study allocated pipeline capital costs and system maintenance based upon the length of the pipeline needed to provide water to the various agencies.under that analysis,the northern districts would pay percent of total pipeline capital costs instead of the percent they had been paying.
historically,sdcwa charged a flat dollar rate for each of water.such a flat fee is also known as a postage stamp water rate.in november,sdcwa retained a n technical services to analyze and evaluate various water rate structures and recommend a revised rate structure.based on that analysis,sdcwa staff prepared a rate study in that unbundled water rates into four categories,one of which is the transportation rate.the transportation rate captures the capital costs as well as the operating and maintenance costs of sdcwa aqueduct system,excluding the costs to operate the system as a whole or significant portions of the system.the capital costs recovered by the transportation rate comprise about percent of the total revenue recovered.the operations and maintenance portion of the transportation rate recovers about percent of the costs of sdcwa operations and maintenance department,percent of its engineering department,percent of its department,as well as other costs.
the sdcwa rate study analyzed the following cost allocations for the transportation rate a,which is based upon distance from mwd delivery point and peak capacity b zones of cost,which separates the system into four geographic zones from north to south c shareholder,which captures the historic financial contributions of each agency based upon its voting shares and d postage stamp,which is a uniform charge per of water.the study also computed the relative percentages of costs to each water agency under each method and under the esg proposal.
in april,the sdcwa board the board adopted the proposed rate structure recommended by a subcommittee it had established to review the sdcwa rate study.the board submitted the rate structure it adopted to a peer review,which concluded that the rate structure is consistent with cost of service principles and reasonably allocates sdcwa cost of service to each of its member agencies.the review further states under typical cost of service allocations,transmission and distribution related costs are allocated to customers based upon peaking.this is due to the fact that these facilities are designed to handle customer peak demands.however,in sdcwa case,all member agencies are treated as a single class,as a result this allocation is less relevant and their use of a uniform rate is appropriate.two other allocation methods for this service category that are discussed in the rate report and are commonly considered to have cost of service qualities are the allocation and zones of cost allocation.these alternatives are considered particularly when system costs may vary by zone or distance.although these allocation approaches are sometimes considered,in our experience,they are not typical due to the fact that systems are often integrated and it is difficult to identify discrete costs.
on june,the board adopted the ordinance that incorporated the new water rate.the water rate consists of a customer service charge,an emergency storage program charge,the transportation rate,a supply charge that includes a capacity reservation charge and a charge,and an infrastructure access charge.the ordinance did not affect the standby availability charge or the capacity charge the ordinance sets the transportation rate at for each of water.revenue from the transportation rate and the other components of water sales are placed in sdcwa general fund and are not segregated to fund capital costs.the transportation rate is also the charge for wheeling,which is t he use of a water conveyance facility by someone other than the owner or operator to transport water metropolitan water district imperial irrigation dist.th,d mwd.
on october,the northern districts filed their complaint to invalidate the ordinance under government code section and code of civil procedure sections et,alleging the ordinance violates government code section.the parties filed for summary judgment.the court denied the motion brought by the northern districts and granted sdcwa motion.the court ruled the transportation rate is not a capacity charge under government code section because it is not a charge for facilities within the meaning of the statute but rather a charged for the delivery of water.the court further ruled that e ven if the transportation rate were a capacity charge,it does not exceed the estimated reasonable cost of providing the service.
discussion 
section,subdivision a provides fees for water connections or sewer connections,or capacity charges shall not exceed the estimated reasonable cost of providing the service for which the fee or charge is imposed.subdivision b defines a capacity charge as a charge for facilities in existence at the time a charge is imposed or charges for new facilities to be constructed in the future that are of benefit to the person or property being charged.
the facts are undisputed in the instant case.where the material facts are conceded or undisputed,as in this case,the issue becomes one of statutory interpretation and therefore is purely a question of law that we review de novo.san diego county water authority metropolitan water district of southern california th,d mwd.
when interpreting a statute our primary task is to determine the legislature intent.citation.in doing so we turn first to the statutory language,since the words the legislature chose are the best indicators of its intent.freedom newspapers,orange county employees retirement system cal th,d.but the plain meaning rule does not prohibit a court from determining whether the literal meaning of a statute comports with its purpose literal construction should not prevail if it is contrary to the legislative intent apparent in the statute.lungren deukmejian cal d.statutes should be construed so as to be given a reasonable result consistent with the legislative purpose.citations.the court should take into account matters such as context,the object in view,the evils to be remedied,the history of the times and of legislation upon the same subject,public policy,and contemporaneous construction.carlton santee pad
