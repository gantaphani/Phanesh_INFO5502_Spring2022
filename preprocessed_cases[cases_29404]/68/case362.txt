this appeal presents the issue of whether the federal energy regulatory commission may approve rates filed by a regional transmission organization rto to cover the cost of activity that for some purposes may be classified as lobbying.rejecting petitioners contentions that approval of the rates was arbitrary and capricious and violated their first amendment rights,we affirm ferc orders.
since,in an effort to facilitate the development of competitive wholesale power markets,ferc has required power utilities to provide open access transmission services.to this end it has encouraged creation of consolidating control of all transmission services in a particular region.promoting wholesale competition through open access transmission services by public utilities,order we continue to support the development of rtos.but the commission found that the requirement of access did not fully accomplish its efficiency goals.see regional transmission organizations,order detailing inefficiencies that remained after order.hence,in order,the commission stepped up the pressure,requiring utilities either to participate in an rto or to explain their failure to do so.see a,c,g,h regional transmission organizations.at.
order required all rtos to meet a minimum independence requirement,but allowed rtos to assume different organizational forms in order to satisfy the independence characteristic.regional transmission organizations.at the commission is not proposing a cookie cutter organizational format.among the forms explicitly approved in order,see id.at,was one that ferc had noted in order,an independent system operator or iso.this would separate operation of the transmission grid and access to it from economic interests in generation and provide what the commission called operational unbundling.order.at internal quotations omitted.
the rto involved in the present case is operated under just such an arrangement.it originated in with the formation of the new england power pool nepool,which in obtained ferc approval for the creation of iso new england,a private,entity to administer new england energy markets and operate the region bulk power transmission system.nstar electric gas ferc.ultimately requested approval to establish itself as an rto under order.ferc gave its approval in,relying,in part,on the fact that as a entity governed by an independent,board,met order independence requirement.iso new england new england power pool,ferc at p march,order on reh g,ferc,aff sub nom.maine pub.utilities comm ferc.

at issue in the current proceeding are the tariff sheets submitted for ferc approval covering its and revenue requirements.in each tariff sought over two million dollars in funding for accounts associated with government affairs,public information,and regulatory affairs collectively,external affairs.see,ferc at p,ferc at p.these accounts were elements of total administrative budgets exceeding a year.see,ferc at p,ferc at p.
in response to both tariffs,petitioners braintree electric light department,reading municipal light department,and taunton municipal lighting plant collectively,brt all and argued that further information was required to determine if the costs sought to recover for external affairs were just and reasonable within the meaning of.in particular,it pointed to reports that lobbyists engaged by had filed with the congress under of the lobbying disclosure act of at,as well as comparable reports filed under state law.brt argued that these filings showed that proposed charges included lobbying costs,which brt said were not permitted under ferc own precedent and regulations,and that ferc approval in effect compelled subsidization of speech in contravention of the first amendment.
in response to brt complaints,ferc sua sponte ordered a paper hearing in which it directed to clarify the nature of each activity listed in the lobbying reports filed by protestors and explain how each of the activities cited by protestors is an educational,informational,or monitoring activity on the one hand,or a lobbying activity on the other,ferc at p.submitted an almost filing,comprised of a brief,nine affidavits,and numerous exhibits,arguing that all of its communications with government officials were designed to address matters of direct operating concern,to ensure a reliable system and competitive energy markets.brief of on issues set for paper hearing,joint appendix.
the commission rejected brt substantive objections,but in a move to enhance transparency ordered to prepare and post on its website a monthly report concerning external affairs and corporate communications,ferc at p.on rehearing it made clear that the monthly posting did not have to include certain communications,such as inquiries to or from executive branch officials and the provision of information to state and federal,executive and legislative officials regarding the status of new england system,ferc at p.
on appeal brt challenges ferc decision to uphold both the tariff docket and the tariff docket.before proceeding to the merits,a brief bit of procedural housekeeping is in order.ferc argues that brt waived its challenge to the tariff because it failed to advance arguments specific to the tariff in its opening brief.brt responds that its arguments against the orders were equally applicable,and clearly intended to apply with equal force,to the orders.since we reject brt attacks on ferc orders covering the tariff,we need not reach the question of waiver.as to docket,brt admits in its opening brief that it was not briefing the sole issue that it would have raised in that appeal,see petr.br,and accordingly,that petition for review is dismissed with prejudice.see world wide minerals,republic of kazakhstan.similarly,as the massachusetts municipal wholesale electric company elected not to brief the matters in docket,see notice of petitioner massachusetts municipal wholesale electric company regarding briefing,we dismiss the petition in that docket.
apart from the first amendment challenge,we review ferc orders under the familiar arbitrary and capricious standard.midwest iso transmission owners,at citing a.this requires that we be persuaded that the commission has made a reasoned decision based upon substantial evidence and that the path of its reasoning is clear.nstar electric,at.
in approving rates ferc articulated a line between what we may loosely call informational lobbying recoverable and more political variants not recoverable.on the side of the line it identified activities such as participation in political action committees,candidate fundraising,entertainment expenses,meals,sporting events,junkets as clearly not recoverable lobbying activities,ferc at p.in contrast,it said that informational and educational activities as well as monitoring and communicating on issues of direct operating concern to the rto,such as those described by in the present proceeding,are much harder cases,which in fact it approved.
brt asserts two primary reasons to convince us that ferc approval of the rates as just and reasonable was not based on reasoned decisionmaking ferc alleged violation of its own precedent and its alleged blindness to the possibility that an iso might pursue goals different from those sought by members,in particular goals not shared by all members.
brt claims that ferc precedent broadly disallowed recovery for lobbying expenditures,even if informational and related to core purposes and objectives.ferc acknowledged that its prior statements on the subject had not always been clear.id.at p.this appears quite true.on the one hand is a case cited by brt,delmarva power light,ferc,order on reh g,ferc,further order on reh g,ferc,in which ferc asserted that a utility lobbying expenses,made in the form of contributions to lobbying activity by edison electric instit
