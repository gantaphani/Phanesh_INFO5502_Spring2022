the city of brentwood challenges the imposition of in mandatory minimum penalties for violations of the city wastewater discharge permit.we construe two provisions of the mandatory minimum penalty statute.we hold that the discharger bears the burden of proving that the exceptions in water code section,subdivision j relieve it of liability for violations that are subject to the mandatory minimum penalties.we also hold that period of six consecutive months,as that phrase is used in section,subdivision i,is measured by looking at the period preceding each violation that potentially is subject to mandatory minimum penalties under that subdivision.we reject the city substantive due process challenge to the amount of the penalties and its procedural due process challenge to the underlying administrative proceedings.we affirm the judgment denying the city petition for a writ of mandate.
factual and procedural background 
the city of brentwood city in contra costa county operates a wastewater treatment plant that discharges into marsh creek,a tributary to the san joaquin river and delta.treated wastewater from the plant is first discharged into percolation ponds where it either evaporates or infiltrates into the area groundwater.a mixture of groundwater and treated wastewater is then discharged into marsh creek.because the plant is surrounded by agricultural land,agricultural runoff may affect the composition of the groundwater and ultimately the effluent that is discharged into the creek.
at the end of and the beginning of,the city applied for a revised permit for its existing facility and a permit for a new facility.in june,the california regional water quality control board,central valley region board issued the city a single permit for both the existing and the new facilities.the permit established effluent limitations for discharges from the plants.as pertinent here,the permit provided that the dissolved oxygen concentration of the discharge shall not fall below at all times.the goal of this effluent limitation was to maintain a minimum dissolved oxygen level of in marsh creek.the city was required to monitor the dissolved oxygen level of its discharge on a daily basis and to report its monitoring results to the board by the first day of the second month following sample collection.the monitoring requirements became effective on july.
in its first monthly report under the new permit,which provided july monitoring results,the city tables showed that the dissolved oxygen level in the effluent from outlet ranged from to and averaged over the month.in a cover letter,the city wastewater supervisor noted that the levels were lower than normal and said he did not know the cause.the only changes noticed around the plant site is that the irrigation is now in progress with tail water going out of the new pipe and construction has started.operations are normal.to correct this problem an air diffuser manifold has been built and installed in the manhole to increase the dissolved oxygen level.an air blower has also been ordered and will be installed as soon as it comes in.a similar test was done with this system with very good test results for increasing the level to meet the state discharge requirement.we will continue monitoring and working on this problem until it is corrected.
the dissolved oxygen levels for august ranged from to and averaged.the city monthly report,dated september,again acknowledged the low levels,but explained that the air blower had been installed on september,and that levels had improved thereafter.in september,the dissolved oxygen levels ranged from to for the first five days of the month,but jumped to on september and ranged from to thereafter.
the city maintained the required dissolved oxygen levels throughout october.on two days in november,seven days in december,two days in january,and four days in early february,dissolved oxygen levels dropped below,but not below.the city did not draw attention to these shortfalls in its monthly reports because city officials were under the mistaken impression that the effluent limitation from its old permit,of dissolved oxygen,was still in effect.
from february to,the dissolved oxygen level fell below.the city explained in its monthly report that the air blower it had installed in september had malfunctioned on february and that a new blower which was ordered on an emergency basis did not arrive until february,at which time it was installed.to eliminate any future problems the air blower will be rebuilt and used as a backup.the city maintained the required dissolved oxygen levels thereafter.
in march,the board compiled a preliminary record of violations for mandatory minimum penalty enforcement.city representatives met with board staff in may to request relief from the penalties,but board staff explained that the penalties were mandatory.on june,the board issued administrative civil liability complaint,which charged the city with violations of the dissolved oxygen effluent limitation and proposed in mandatory penalties calculated as per violation times violations,excluding the first three violations pursuant to section,subdivision i.the city submitted a written response to the complaint.
at the administrative hearing in july,the board staff and city representatives presented oral testimony.at the conclusion of the hearing,the board voted to impose the penalties in full.the city petitioned the state water resources control board state board to review the regional board order,but the petition was dismissed.the city then petitioned the contra costa county superior court for administrative mandamus under code of civil procedure section.venue was changed to the alameda county superior court pursuant to section,subdivision b.after making evidentiary rulings,the court denied the city petition without explanation,noting that neither party requested a statement of decision.the city appeals the trial court order.
discussion 
the city raises four challenges to the mandatory minimum penalties.the first two raise questions of statutory interpretation which party bears the burden of proving whether the exceptions in section,subdivision j apply in a particular case,and how the period in section,subdivision i should be calculated.the city also raises a substantive due process challenge to the amount of the penalties,and a procedural due process challenge to the conduct of the administrative hearing.we address each of these arguments in turn.
burden of proof 
the city argues that the board failed to establish that two exceptions to liability under section,subdivision i did not apply to its case.it argues that the board had the burden of proof on this issue.the board argues that the exceptions are affirmative defenses for which the city bears the burden of proof.the trial court denied the city petition for writ of mandamus implicitly rejecting the city allocation of the burden of proof.
a.the statute 
as relevant here,section,subdivision i provides for mandatory minimum penalties of three thousand dollars assessed for each violation whenever the person exceeds a waste discharge requirement effluent limitation four or more times in any period of six consecutive months,except that the requirement to assess the mandatory minimum penalty shall not be applicable to the first three violations,subd.i,as amended by stats.again as relevant here,the exceptions to the mandatory assessment are an unanticipated,grave natural disaster or other natural phenomenon of an exceptional,inevitable,and irresistible character,the effects of which could not have been prevented or avoided by the exercise of due care or foresight and a n intentional act of a third party,the effects of which could not have been prevented or avoided by the exercise of due care or foresight,subd.j b and c,as amended by stats.
the issue before us is whether the exceptions to liability in section,subdivision j are elements of the offense the regional board burden of proof,or whether they are affirmative defenses the city burden of proof.
parties contentions 
in its written response to the administrative complaint and during the administrative hearing,the city contended that the natural phenomenon exception of section,subdivision j b relieved it of liability for the violations the natural phenomenon cited by the city was an unidentified change in the composition of the groundwater component of the plant effluent.the city produced no evidence that the dissolved oxygen levels had dropped in the groundwater component rather than in the wastewater component of the effluent,and it produced no evidence of what caused a drop in dissolved oxygen levels in the groundwater.it simply argued that the groundwater was most likely the cause of the violations because the city had found no source of the violations in its own plant.the city noted that the plant had had only one dissolved oxygen violation between and.it speculated that irrigation,pesticide use and other practices on the agricultural land surrounding the plant could have affected the composition of the groundwater component of the plant effluent.
addressing the statutory language,the city argued that the alleged change in the groundwater was exceptional because it had never occurred before,inevitable because it was unforeseeable,and irresistible because it could not be addressed instantaneously.the city further argued that the violation could not have been prevented or avoided by the exercise of due care or foresight.n ever having a problem like this,not knowing what caused it,we are unsure how we could have planned for it or seen it coming.
board staff took the position that t here was no great disaster or natural phenomenon of exceptional,inevitable,irresistible character.the assistant executive officer of the board told board members,i have no reason to believe that something naturally occurred to suddenly cause the groundwater to plummet naturally in the area.i know of no mechanism for that occurring,barring major earthquakes or something.staff speculated that the dissolved oxygen violations may have been caused by construction of the city new plant but readily acknowledged that they did not know what caused the violations.staff took the position that the violations were not beyond the city control.i t took the city about months to correct the problem and subsequent mechanical problems gave rise to additional violations.the record demonstrates that the city could have prevented the do violations had they better prepared and planned for it.
board members comments during deliberations indicate that the board considered the burden of proof in their decision to impose penalties.board member christopher cabaldon expressly raised the burden of proof issue i t would be a lot simpler for the state board to issue some guidance at least what the burden of proof is which is the default if you do know the cause of the violation of the effluent limitation.he noted that the cause of the city violations was unknown.board chair robert schneider took the position that the board had to assume the city was responsible in the absence of contrary proof.that is,schneider implicitly took the position that the city bears the burden of showing that one of the exceptions in section,subdivision j applied and had failed to meet that burden.the board voted to impose the penalties.
in sum,it appears that the board concluded that the cause of the violations was unknown and imposed the mandatory penalties because the city had failed to affirmatively establish that one of the exceptions to liability in section,subdivision j applied.
statutory construction 
statutory construction is a question of law we decide de novo.california teachers san diego community college dist.cal d.our primary objective in interpreting a statute is to determine and give effect to the underlying legislative intent.code civ.intent is determined foremost by the plain meaning of the statutory language.if the language is clear and unambiguous,there is no need for judicial construction.when the language is reasonably susceptible of more than one meaning,it is proper to examine a variety of extrinsic aids in an effort to discern the intended meaning.we may consider,for example,the statutory scheme,the apparent purposes underlying the statute and the presence or absence of instructive legislative history.see hughes board of architectural examiners cal th,d.
if the words of a statute are reasonably free of ambiguity and uncertainty,we look no further than those words to determine the meaning of that language.lazar hertz th,d,citing building industry city of camarillo cal d.here,the plain language of section,subdivision j is silent as to which party bears the burden of proof.it states that the mandatory penalty provisions do not apply to the listed circumstances,but does not indicate which party must demonstrate,establish,or show whether those circumstances were present.nor does it label the exceptions defenses or affirmative defenses.because the plain language of section does not indicate which party bears the burden of proof,we must look to extrinsic aids to guide our interpretation.
statutory scheme 
a court may consider the overall scheme in which an ambiguous statute is included in order to ascertain its intended meaning.hughes board of architectural examiners,supra,cal th at,d.the organization of the division,chapters,and articles is an aid to understanding its purpose.see people hull cal th,d.
section is part of state legislation that was enacted to comply with certain provisions of the federal clean water act the clean water act establishes a national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes,which prohibits discharges into the navigable waters of the united states absent a permit,subd.a.the act authorizes states to issue their own npdes permits for dischargers within their borders if the states establish programs that satisfy federal standards and that are approved by federal authorities,subd.b.expressly for that purpose,the california legislature enacted chapter of the water quality division of the california water code which includes section.sierra club union oil of california cir.permits issued under chapter,and enforced in part under section,are an integral part of the clean water act discharge permit system.
the clean water act is a strict liability statute.allegheny ludlum cir,stoddard western carolina regional sewer auth.cir,united states earth sciences,cir.the first principle of the statute is that it is unlawful to pollute at all.the clean water act does not permit pollution whenever that activity might be deemed reasonable or necessary rather,the statute provides that pollution is permitted only when discharged under the conditions or limitations of a npdes permit.natural resources defense council,see,subd.a.
enforcement of npdes effluent limitations is based on and reporting permit holders must submit regular discharge monitoring reports,which serve as admissions when discharges violate the effluent limitations established in the discharger permit.cps chemical.the purpose of this system is to keep enforcement actions simple and speedy one purpose of the monitoring requirements is to avoid the necessity of lengthy fact finding,investigations,and negotiations at the time of enforcement.enforcement of violations of requirements of this act should be based on relatively narrow fact situations requiring a minimum of discretionary decision making or delay,quoting,sess,reprinted in code cong.admin.news.
exceptions to liability for violations of npdes effluent limitations under the clean water act are affirmative defenses.cps chemical,supra.at.similarly,exceptions to liability under the clean water act for the costs of cleaning up oil spills are affirmative defenses,subds.f,f,f,g.
section is a part of the npdes system.the purpose and structure of the npdes system strongly support the argument that the exceptions in section,subdivision j should be construed as affirmative defenses.requiring water quality control boards to affirmatively disprove each of the exceptions in that subdivision would undermine the legislative goal of simple and swift enforcement with a minimum of and investigation.construing the exceptions as affirmative defenses is consistent with the fundamental structure of the permit system,which places the burden of monitoring and reporting violations on the dischargers themselves.
legislative purpose and history 
an examination of the legislative purpose and history of the mandatory minimum penalty provisions reinforces our view that the exceptions in section,subdivision j should be construed as affirmative defenses.when construing an ambiguous statute,a court may consider its apparent purpose.hughes board of architectural examiners,supra,cal th at,d.
mandatory minimum penalties were enacted in in two bills,senate bill and assembly bill.both bills were signed into law.each bill incorporated the following legislative finding recent investigations indicate that current enforcement efforts of the state board and the regional boards may not be achieving full compliance with waste discharge requirements in a timely manner,and that swift and timely enforcement of waste discharge requirements will assist in bringing the state waters into compliance and will ensure that violators do not realize economic benefits from noncompliance.stats,ch,subd.d assem.bill ch,subd.d bill.in other words,the goal of the legislation was to ensure prompt,streamlined enforcement to create a powerful incentive for dischargers to comply with permit requirements.
this clear statement of legislative purpose is amplified by reference to the statute legislative history.while the legislation was under consideration,the legislative analyst office published an analysis and recommended passage.legis.analyst,analysis of budget bill,bill,pp.to.the analysis cited statistics showing administrative penalties had been levied for only percent of the known violations of the act,pp.mandatory penalties,the legislative analyst office wrote,would increase enforcement and make it more consistent,which would likely result in a substantial increase in compliance.the legislative analyst office noted that assembly bill the predecessor to assembly bill was modeled on a mandatory minimum penalty law enacted in new jersey in,and it endorsed that model.legis.analyst,supra.
this legislative history strongly indicates that the exceptions in section,subdivision j are affirmative defenses.the mandatory penalties represent a further move away from discretion and detailed and toward swifter and more predictable enforcement.addressing concerns about the potential costs of increased enforcement,the legislative analyst office observed that the new jersey experience had shown the policy to be cost effective,in part because staff preparation for a penalty hearing under mandatory penalties is not as labor intensive as for hearings in cases where penalties are discretionary because less time is spent assessing mitigating factors to determine whether a penalty should be assessed.legis.analyst,supra.were we to construe the exceptions to be elements of the violation that must be proven by the board staff,we would undermine the legislature intent to enact a streamlined,cost effective and swift enforcement policy.
in sum,placing the burden of proof on the discharger rather than the board is more consistent with the statutory scheme of the clean water act and with the legislative purpose and history of the mandatory minimum penalty provisions.
descriptive nature test 
whether an exception to liability is an element of an offense or an affirmative defense depends on whether the exception is so incorporated with,and becomes a part of the enactment,as to constitute a part of the definition,or description of the offense.ex parte hornef cal.w here the exceptions afford matter of excuse merely,they are affirmative defenses.people lawrence d,quoting people jevne cal.although the genesis of these principles is criminal cases,the principles also have been applied to whether an exception to civil liability was an affirmative defense.sargent fletcher,able th,d.
applying the descriptive nature test to a statutory construction of the exceptions in section,subdivision j supports the board position that the exceptions are affirmative defenses for which the city bears the burden of proof.
the offense is defined as exceeding a waste discharge requirement effluent limitation,subd.i as amended by stats.the harmful conduct that the statute proscribes is the discharge of harmful substances into the state water supply.the exceptions set forth in section,subdivision j are excuses.they do not make the defendant conduct any less harmful the harmful substances are still discharged into the water supply,but they do provide a legal excuse to liability.the exceptions are carefully limited to circumstances outside a reasonably cautious defendant control.the natural phenomenon must be an unanticipated,grave natural disaster or an exceptional,inevitable,and irresistible event,the effects of which could not have been prevented or avoided by the exercise of due care or foresight,subd.j b,as amended by stats.an act of a third party will relieve the defendant of liability only if it was intentional and only if the defendant could not have prevented or avoided its effects with the exercise of due care or foresight,subd.j c,as amended by stats.these are limited exceptions to proscribed conduct,rather than exceptions that define the offense.the descriptive nature test supports placing the burden of proof on the discharger.
based on our construction of the statute,we hold that the discharger,rather than the board,bears the burden of proving that one of the exceptions in section,subdivision j,relieves the discharger of liability for mandatory minimum penalties under section,subdivision i.the exceptions in section,subdivision j are affirmative defenses to liability.because the board correctly allocated the burden of proof in the city case,we reject the city challenge to the civil liability order on the ground that the burden of proof was improperly shifted to the city.
ii.other arguments 
iii.period 
mandatory minimum penalties were imposed on the city pursuant to section,subdivision i,which provides a mandatory minimum penalty of three thousand dollars shall be assessed for each violation whenever the person does any of the following four or more times in any period of six consecutive months,except that the requirement to assess the mandatory minimum penalty shall not be applicable to the first three violations a exceeds a waste discharge requirement effluent limitation,subd.i,as amended by stats,emphasis added.the statute defined period of six consecutive months as the period beginning on the day following the date on which one of the violations described in subdivision i occurs and ending days after that date,subd.h c,as amended by stats.
the state board has interpreted any period of six consecutive months as a rolling period.consistent with this interpretation,the regional board applied the provision by looking at the period preceding each violation.if the violation was at least the fourth violation in the preceding period,the penalty was imposed.the city argues that the period should be measured from the date of a first violation.after that period expires,a new period would commence with the next violation.the first three violations in the second period would be exempt from the mandatory penalties,even if they occurred less than six months after the most recent three prior violations.had the board followed the city approach,the first period would have expired on january,that is,days after july,the day following the date of the first violation.a new period would have commenced on january,the date of the first violation following the expiration of the first period.the first three violations in the second period would be exempt from the mandatory minimum penalty requirement,resulting in a savings to the city.
judicial notice 
as a preliminary matter,we take judicial notice of a letter sent by legislators to the executive officer of the state board to protest the state board original interpretation of period in the mandatory minimum penalty provisions,subd.h,subd.a.
we reject the city argument that the letter is not an appropriate subject of judicial notice regarding the legislative history of the statute.letters express
