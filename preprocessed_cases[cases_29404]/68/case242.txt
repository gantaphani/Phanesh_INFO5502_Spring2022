the attorney general of california,bill lockyer,sues under section of the clayton act,seeking divestiture by the mirant defendants collectively,mirant of three electrical generating plants.the district court granted a stay pursuant to landis north american,pending the resolution of mirant chapter petitions in a bankruptcy court in texas.we hold that the district court had jurisdiction to determine whether the automatic stay of the texas bankruptcy court applied to the attorney general suit,and that the attorney general suit comes within the police or regulatory power exception of b to the automatic stay.we further hold,in the circumstances of this case,that a landis stay is not justified.accordingly,we vacate the stay and remand to allow the attorney general suit to proceed on the merits.
background 
in,california passed assembly bill,which required large utilities to divest certain electrical generating plants as part of the state deregulation of its electrical generation industry.pursuant to this mandatory divestiture,pacific gas electric in sold its pittsburg and contra costa power plants in contra costa county,as well as its potrero power plant in san francisco,to mirant delta,llc and mirant potrero,llc.the attorney general alleges that the combined generating capacity of these three plants amounts to approximately percent of the northern california wholesale spot electricity market.
on april,the attorney general sued mirant in federal district court,alleging that mirant ownership of the plants gives it the incentive and ability to exercise market power in violation of section of the clayton act.see.the attorney general sought equitable relief and damages under both the clayton act and california business professions code.the district court dismissed the claims for violation of california business professions code and for damages under the clayton act,but found that the allegations in the complaint were sufficient to state a claim for injunctive relief under section of the clayton act.see.
on july and july,mirant filed voluntary petitions to reorganize under chapter in the united states bankruptcy court for the northern district of texas.subsequently,mirant moved in the bankruptcy court for an order modifying the automatic stay to allow three suits,including two brought by the attorney general both separate from this suit,to proceed in the ninth circuit,where they were then pending on appeal the bankruptcy court granted the motion,but did not determine whether the appeals were,in fact,subject to the automatic stay.instead,it granted the motion and modified the stay only to the extent necessary and applicable.
on the same day that mirant moved in the bankruptcy court to allow the ninth circuit appeals to proceed,it also filed a suggestion of stay in district court in this case,advising the court to take notice that actions taken in violation of the automatic stay are void and may result in the imposition of sanctions by the bankruptcy court.the suggestion of stay did not explicitly argue that the attorney general clayton act suit was subject to the automatic stay,nor did it request that the district court determine the automatic stay applicability.
the district court invited a noticed motion in which the parties could present their positions on whether the automatic stay was applicable.the attorney general moved for a determination that the suit was exempt from the automatic stay because it sought to enforce california police or regulatory power within the meaning of b.without taking a position on the applicability of b,mirant urged the district court to exercise its discretionary power to stay the action.the district court declined to decide whether the attorney general suit came within b.citing mediterranean enterprises,ssangyong,cir,it granted the discretionary stay requested by mirant.
the court relied on three factors in granting the stay.first,it found that its jurisdiction to determine the scope of the police or regulatory power exception under b,and hence the applicability of the automatic stay,was doubtful under celotex edwards,d,and in re gruntz,cir en banc.second,it found that the applicability of b raised unsettled questions of law.third,it found that the stay was efficient for its docket,and that it was the fair and practical course for the parties.the attorney general timely appealed.we now vacate and remand.
ii.our jurisdiction to review the stay 
before considering the merits,we must first decide whether we have jurisdiction under to review the district court stay.we hold that we have jurisdiction over the appeal because the order puts the attorney general effectively out of court within the meaning of moses cone memorial hospital mercury construction,d,and idlewild bon voyage liquor epstein,d,and because the stay is an appealable collateral order under cohen beneficial industrial loan.
effectively out of court 
we first hold that the stay order in the district court is final under what has come to be known as the moses cone doctrine.in moses cone,a hospital had sued in state court seeking a declaration that a contract to which it was a party did not confer a right to arbitration.the other party to the contract then filed suit in federal district court seeking an order compelling arbitration.the hospital successfully moved for a stay in federal court pending resolution of the arbitration question in state court.relying on its earlier decision in idlewild,the supreme court held that the district court stay order was appealable under.as a result of the stay,there would be no further litigation in the federal forum and the state judgment on the arbitration issue would be res judicata,leaving the contractor effectively out of court.moses cone,at.
in idlewild,plaintiff idlewild liquor had sought a declaratory judgment in federal district court that the new york alcoholic beverage law was unconstitutional.rather than convene a district court,the court stayed the action under railroad commission pullman,to give the new york state courts the opportunity to address the issue.the supreme court held that the stay order was appealable,even though it was entirely possible that idlewild liquor would be able to return to federal district court after the state court dealt with questions.moses cone,at.even in that circumstance,where the case might well come back to federal district court,idlewild liquor was effectively out of court for purposes of appealability of the stay order.idlewild,at.
the stay in this case is much like the stay in idlewild.in dealing with mirant chapter petitions,the bankruptcy court may well order divestiture of the three power plants as part of a reorganization plan under chapter.if mirant chapter proceeding in the bankruptcy court results in divestiture of the plants,the attorney general clayton act case in the district court will be mooted,just as idlewild federal constitutional claims in the district court would have been mooted if the new york state courts had granted relief on grounds.see terra nova ins.bar,cir concluding that the danger that a stay would render a claim moot was equivalent to res judicata for the purposes of applying the moses cone test.
because the bankruptcy court has not yet determined whether mirant plants will be divested as a result of the reorganization,we can not say with certainty that the attorney general district court suit will be moot.however,as idlewild establishes,absolute certainty is not required in order to put a party effectively out of court within the meaning of the moses cone doctrine.see united states general dynamics,cir where a possibility existed that application of the collateral estoppel doctrine might result in dismissal,the stay was appealable under moses cone.although the mooting of attorney general lockyer clayton act claim is not inevitable,both parties and the district court appear to view it as a substantial possibility.indeed,the district court explicitly anticipated the possibility of mootness,citing the potential waste of significant judicial and party resources if the bankruptcy proceedings mooted the plaintiff claims before the district court rendered judgment.this case is thus distinguishable from situations in which the district court clearly foresees and intends that proceedings will resume after the stay has expired.see cofab,philadelphia joint,cir moses cone did not apply where district court had no intention to deep six the suit.
if the attorney general clayton act claim comes within the b exception to the automatic stay,no legal barrier exists,apart from the district court stay order itself,to his pursuit of his suit in the district court in california.in such circumstances,the stay puts him effectively out of court,and we have appellate jurisdiction to determine the propriety of the stay.
collateral order 
even if the stay did not constitute a final order under moses cone,we would have jurisdiction under cohen beneficial industrial loan,under which certain collateral orders of the district court may be immediately appealed.to be included among the small class of decisions excepted from the rule by cohen,an order must conclusively determine the disputed question,resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action,and be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.coopers lybrand livesay,d internal quotation marks omitted bracketed numbers added.
in moses cone,the supreme court held in the alternative that the district court stay was an appealable collateral order under cohen.at.the court concluded that the first criterion was satisfied because,although the stay was technically open to reconsideration,there is no basis to suppose that the district judge contemplated any reconsideration of the decision to defer to the parallel suit.id.at.it also concluded that the second and third cohen criteria were met,since a n order that amounts to a refusal to adjudicate the merits plainly presents an important issue separate from the merits and,because of the possibility of res judicata,this order would be entirely unreviewable if not appealed now.id.at.see also general dynamics,at where a district court enters a stay that can effectively end the litigation in that court,the court ability to lift the stay if it chooses would seem to be irrelevant.
we hold that the cohen criteria are also satisfied here.the first criterion is satisfied because,even though the stay order could theoretically be modified,the district court did not impose a time limit on the stay or note circumstances that might result in its modification.see moses cone,at.stay order was conclusive where there was no basis to suppose that the district judge contemplated any reconsideration of his decision to defer to the parallel suit burns watler,cir even where stay was nominally modifiable,there was no indication in the record that the district court intended to take further action.the second criterion is satisfied because the district court central justification for issuing the stay was the desirability of avoiding two analytically distinct determinations the applicability of the police or regulatory power exception to b and the legality of mirant ownership of the three power plants.finally,the third criterion is satisfied.either the bankruptcy proceedings will moot the clayton act claim,in which case the district court suit will be dismissed or the bankruptcy proceedings will not moot the clayton act claim,in which case the district court will lift the stay on its own and proceed with the suit.in either event,the propriety of the stay will be unreviewable on appeal.see marchetti bitterolf,cir unreviewability factor was met where it was likely that case would be mooted.we therefore conclude that the stay is reviewable under cohen as a collateral order.
aggrieved by the stay 
mirant argues that,even if the stay order is final under moses cone or a reviewable collateral order under cohen,the attorney general can not appeal because he is not aggrieved by the stay.in deposit guaranty national bank roper,d,the court held that a party who receives all that he has sought generally is not aggrieved by the judgment affording the relief and can not appeal from it.citations omitted.mirant contends that the attorney general is not aggrieved because either he will receive the divestiture remedy he seeks from the bankruptcy court or,if the bankruptcy court does not order divestiture and the district court stay is lifted,he will be allowed to seek divestiture in his clayton act litigation in the district court.mirant argues that the two pursuant to the bankruptcy proceedings and divestiture ordered by the district equivalent.
mirant argument fails to recognize two things.first,while it is possible that mirant will eventually be ordered to divest itself of the three power plants,the sequence of events envisioned by mirant may entail considerable delay.this is particularly so if the bankruptcy court does not order divestiture and the attorney general must await the conclusion of the bankruptcy proceedings before being allowed to resume his clayton act suit in the district court.if mirant ownership of the three power plants in fact violates the clayton act,northern california purchasers of electricity will have been unnecessarily injured by the delay resulting from the stay.
second,mirant argument fails to recognize that a divestiture order to cure a clayton act violation is different from a divestiture order entered pursuant to a bankruptcy reorganization.the clayton act could possibly be raised as an issue in the texas bankruptcy proceeding,for any confirmable reorganization plan must have been proposed in good faith and not by any means forbidden by law.a.see also pacific gas electric california,cir addressing preemption of laws under a and a in re texas extrusion,cir opponents to reorganization plan contended that the plan violated the federal antitrust laws court declined to reach the issue on the ground that the objection had been raised too late.but there is no guarantee or even likelihood that the bankruptcy court will consider the effect of the clayton act nor is there a guarantee,even if it does,that it will entertain briefing or hold hearings,or that it will justify or explain the reorganization plan in terms of the clayton act.if divestiture of the three power plants is ordered by the bankruptcy court on some basis other than the clayton act,the attorney general will not have received,in the relevant legal sense of the term,all that he has sought.roper,at.that the alleged clayton act violation by mirant might incidentally be cured in the course of the bankruptcy proceedings is not equivalent to a binding legal determination by the district court that mirant violated the clayton act and a divestiture order by that court.the difference is more than theoretical.for example,without a binding decision on the merits of the attorney general clayton act claim,a single entity could acquire the three plants from mirant.the attorney general would then be required to bring another clayton act suit,now against the new entity instead of mirant.
regardless of how events ultimately transpire,the stay order has deprived the attorney least temporarily and perhaps the legal remedy he seeks against mirant.he has thus been aggrieved within the meaning of roper,and we have jurisdiction over this appeal.
iii.the district court landis stay 
we review a district court stay order for abuse of discretion,but this standard is somewhat less deferential than the abuse of discretion standard used in other contexts.yong ins,cir intel advanced micro devices,cir.a district court abuses its discretion if it base s its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.cooter gell hartmarx,d.
the district court gave three reasons for granting a landis stay.first,it believed that its jurisdiction to determine whether the automatic stay applied to the suit before it was questionable.second,it believed that the applicability of police or regulatory power exception to the automatic stay under b was also questionable.third,in light of the foregoing,it held that granting the stay was efficient for its docket and is the fair and practical course for the parties.we consider these reasons in turn.
jurisdiction to determine the applicability of the automatic stay 
relying on celotex edwards,d,and in re gruntz,cir en banc,the district court expressed concern that it did not have jurisdiction to determine the applicability of the automatic stay.the district court concern was unfounded.
in celotex,the bankruptcy court issued a injunction preventing plaintiffs who had won a district court suit against the debtor from executing on a supersedeas bond that would have satisfied their judgment.see a.the district court allowed plaintiffs to execute on the bond despite the bankruptcy court injunction,on the ground that the judgment had been affirmed on appeal and the bond had become due before the bankruptcy filing.the decision of the district court was appealed to the fifth circuit,which affirmed.the supreme court reversed.without deciding whether the injunction was properly issued,the court held that the district court acted improperly in disregarding it.if plaintiffs wanted relief from the injunction,wrote the court,they should have sought modification in the bankruptcy court that issued the injunction.at.
in gruntz,gruntz had twice been convicted in state court of failure to pay child support.he filed for bankruptcy prior to sentencing in the first criminal proceeding,and prior to the institution of the second criminal proceeding.he brought an adversary proceeding in bankruptcy court seeking a declaration that the state criminal proceedings violated the automatic stay.the bankruptcy court denied relief,holding that it was collaterally estopped by the state court decision that the automatic stay did not apply.on appeal,we held that the state court has the power to decide whether the automatic stay applies to its proceedings.at thus,unless a specific injunction applies,state trial courts need not seek bankruptcy court approval before commencing criminal proceedings.but a state court makes such a decision at its peril,for the bankruptcy court is not precluded by the state court decision.if the bankruptcy court later decides that the state court was incorrect,the state court proceedings in violation of the stay are void.see,in re schwartz,cir in re shamblin,cir.on the other hand,if the state court is correct in deciding that the stay does not apply,the state court proceedings are not void.gruntz,at.we ultimately affirmed the result reached by the bankruptcy court based on our determination,independent of the state court decision,that the state criminal proceedings were not within the scope of the stay.
celotex and gruntz both stand for familiar propositions in bankruptcy law.neither case casts doubt on a district court ability to decide for itself whether proceedings pending before it are subject to an automatic stay.celotex tells us that a district court has no authority to modify or to disregard a injunction.only the bankruptcy court that issued the injunction has the authority to modify the injunction,and until the injunction is modified the district court is bound by it.gruntz tells us that a state court has the authority to decide whether its proceeding is within the scope of the automatic stay,but the state court holding is not entitled to preclusive effect in the bankruptcy court.
there is no reason why a federal court should have less power than a state court to decide whether its proceeding comes within the scope of the automatic stay.indeed,there are a number of cases,in this circuit and elsewhere,in which a federal court has decided whether the automatic stay applies to a proceeding pending before it.see,nlrb continental hagen,cir nlrb enforcement proceeding in the court of appeals comes within the b exception to the automatic stay nlrb twin cities,cir same commodity futures trading comm co petro marketing group,cir commodities exchange act proceeding in the district court comes within the b exception to the automatic stay chao hospital staffing,cir suit under the federal fair labor standards act in the district court does not come within the b exception to the automatic stay,but the district court has authority to decide the applicability of the exception nlrb edward cooper painting,cir nlrb enforcement proceeding in the court of appeals comes within the b exception to the automatic stay hunt bankers trust,cir whether the stay applies to litigation otherwise within the jurisdiction of a district court or court of appeals is an issue of law within the competence of both the court within which the litigation is pending and the bankruptcy court.citation omitted in re,cir the court in which the litigation claimed to be stayed is pending has jurisdiction to determine not only its own jurisdiction but also the more precise question whether the proceeding pending before it is subject to the automatic stay.sec first fin.group of texas,cir civil enforcement action under the federal securities laws in the district court comes within the b exception to the automatic stay.we are aware of no case holding to the contrary.
we therefore hold,in accordance with established law,that a district court has jurisdiction to decide whether the automatic stay applies to a proceeding pending before it,over which it would otherwise have jurisdiction.specifically,as applied to this case,we hold that the district court has jurisdiction to decide whether the attorney general section clayton act suit comes within the exception to the automatic stay for police or regulatory power under b.
exception from the automatic stay under b 
the applicability of the automatic stay,and the extent of the police or regulatory power exception under b,are questions of law that we consider de novo.in re hines,cir.bap,rev on other grounds by cir whether an act falls within statutory exception to the stay is reviewed de novo.the record is sufficiently complete that we may decide the question even though the district court did not.chang united states,cir.
section b provides that the filing of a bankruptcy petition does not operate as an automatic stay of the commencement or continuation of an action or proceeding by a governmental unit to enforce such governmental unit police or regulatory power.b.a government unit need not affirmatively seek relief from the automatic stay to initiate or continue an action subject to the exemption.edward cooper painting,at.the theory of the exception is that bankruptcy should not be a haven for wrongdoers.universal life church,united states in re universal life church,cir citations omitted.
the police or regulatory power exception allows the enforcement of laws affecting health,welfare,morals,and safety despite the pendency of the bankruptcy proceeding.the exception applies,for example,to suits to determine a federal income tax exemption,see to enforce federal labor laws,see twin cities electric,at to enforce state bar disciplinary rules,see wade state bar of arizona,cir to enforce federal employment discrimination laws,see eeoc hall motor transit,cir and to enforce state consumer protection laws,see in re first alliance mortgage,cir.bap.
mirant did not argue in the district court that the attorney general clayton act suit fell outside the b exception.in its initial briefing before us,mirant similarly did not argue that the suit fell outside the exception,even though the attorney general had briefed the question.after oral argument,we asked the parties to submit supplemental briefing in order to be sure that mirant had been given a full opportunity to address the question.
mirant now makes two arguments to us.first,it argues that the b exception does not apply because the statutory reference to such government unit police or regulatory power means that the government in question must be suing in furtherance of its own police and regulatory power.mirant contends that the state attorney general is not doing so in this case because his only remaining claim is for injunctive relief under section of the federal clayton act,which authorizes a ny person,firm,corporation,or association to seek injunctive relief against threatened loss or damage by a violation of the antitrust laws.
mirant suggests in its argument that a suit by a california official to enforce the federal clayton act would not be a suit within its own authority,and that only a suit by the united states attorney to enforce the clayton act would come within b.this suggestion is without foundation in the case law.a number of cases make clear that the b exception extends to a government enforcement of laws enacted by other governments.see,city of new york exxon,cir municipality enforcing federal environmental law in re commonwealth oil refining,cir united states enforcing puerto rico law new york mirant new york,state enforcing federal environmental law herman brown,state enforcing federal racketeering law people of the state of illinois electrical utilities,state enforcing federal environmental law in re canarico quarries,rico commonwealth enforcing federal clean air act in re pincombe,state enforcing federal employment discrimination law in re new york trap rock,county enforcing federal environmental law.
mirant argues explicitly that because section of the clayton act authorizes suits by private parties,a government unit suing to enforce that section can not be acting as a government within the meaning of b.this argument is also without foundation.while section does authorize suits by private entities,it also authorizes suits by state governments.see california am.stores,d upholding injunctive relief awarded to state in suit brought under section of the clayton act.when the attorney general seeks to enforce this law on behalf of the citizens of california,he is acting within the police power of the california government.his suit is authorized by the state,is in furtherance of the state authority,and uses state resources.we are aware of no authority,and mirant cites none,holding that a government suit that would otherwise be within the police or regulatory power exception of b ceases to come within that exception whenever the provision of law under which the government sues also authorizes suits by private entities.
second,mirant argues that the attorney general suit does not satisfy either of the two established tests for the police or regulatory powers exception of b.the two tests are the related,and somewhat overlapping,pecuniary purpose and public purpose tests.a suit comes within the exception of b if it satisfies either test.see universal life church,at the question in this case is whether the government action meets either test.emphasis added.we hold that the attorney general clayton act suit satisfies both tests.
under the pecuniary purpose test,the court determines whether the government action relates primarily to the protection of the government pecuniary interest in the debtors property or to matters of public safety and health.continental hagen,at internal quotation marks and modifications omitted.see also edward cooper painting,at in re state of missouri,cir.if the suit seeks to protect the government pecuniary interest,the b exception does not apply.on the other hand,if the suit seeks to protect public safety and welfare,the exception does apply.the purpose of the pecuniary purpose test is to prevent suits that would allow a governmental unit to obtain an advantage over creditors or potential creditors in the bankruptcy proceeding.
the attorney general section clayton act suit clearly satisfies the pecuniary purpose test.after having been trimmed down by the district court,the suit now seeks only divestiture.the attorney general does not seek a monetary recovery,and asserts no interest of the state in the three power plants that are the subject of his suit.rather,the attorney general seeks only an injunction that would require mirant to divest itself of the plants.there is nothing in this relief that would allow the attorney general to gain an advantage over creditors in the bankruptcy proceeding.if granted,the only effect of the remedy would be to require that the plants be sold,with the entire proceeds going to the bankruptcy estate.further,it is clear that the suit seeks to protect the welfare of electricity consumers in northern california by protecting them from the excessive charges that might result from an undue concentration of market power.
under the public purpose test,the court determines whether the government seeks to effectuate public policy or to adjudicate private rights.nlrb continental hagen,at.if the government seeks the former,the exception applies if the government seeks the latter,it does not.see also in re state of missouri,at.a suit does not satisfy the public purpose test if it is brought primarily to advantage discrete and identifiable individuals or entities rather than some broader segment of the public.see,chao,at suit to recover unpaid wages under the fair labor standard act does not come within b.the attorney general suit clearly satisfies the public interest test,for it is brought to protect the interest of all electricity consumers in northern california.
we therefore hold that the attorney general section clayton act suit comes within the police or regulatory power exception under b,and that the automatic stay does not apply.
landis stay 
a district court has discretionary power to stay proceedings in its own court under landis north american.in landis,two holding companies sued the securities and exchange commission sec in the district court for the district of columbia to enjoin enforcement of the public utility holding company act of on the ground that it was unconstitutional.numerous similar suits were filed,in the district of columbia and elsewhere,against the sec.the sec filed a complaint in the district court for the southern district of new york to compel other holding companies to comply with the terms of the act.the district of columbia district court stayed its suit,indicating that the stay would last until the new york district court suit was decided on appeal by the supreme court or was otherwise finally resolved.
the supreme court reversed 
a party seeking a stay must make out a clear case of hardship or inequity in being required to go forward,if there is even a fair possibility that the stay for which he prays will work damage to some one else.only in rare circumstances will a litigant in one cause be compelled to stand aside while a litigant in another settles the rule of law that will define the rights of both.
id.at.the court noted that resolution of the new york district court suit could help narrow the issues considerably 
true,a decision in the cause then pending in new york may not settle every question of fact and law in suits by other companies,but in all likelihood it will settle many and simplify them all.
id.at.nonetheless,the court held that a stay lasting until the new york district court suit was finally resolved exceeded the limits of a fair discretion.id.it then held that,in the circumstances now confronting it,where the new york district court had already had its case for a year,a stay lasting only until the new york district court decided the case might be appropriate.id.at.it therefore remanded to the district of columbia district court to consider whether to grant a stay of what was now likely to be fairly short duration.id.at.
we have sustained,or authorized in principle,landis stays on several occasions.in cmax,hall,cir,cmax,a common carrier by air,sued drewry,a shipper,in federal district court to recover,contending that drewry had not paid the full amount of the tariff.at least a dozen other suits were later filed in the same district court,in which cmax sued shippers on the same ground.the civil aeronautics board cab then instituted an administrative enforcement proceeding against cmax,contending that cmax had charged numerous shippers,including drewry,more than the approved tariff.the district court stayed cmax suit against drewry.cmax sought mandamus.
citing landis,we set out the following framework 
where it is proposed that a pending proceeding be stayed,the competing interests which will be affected by the granting or refusal to grant a stay must be weighed.among those competing interests are the possible damage which may result from the granting of a stay,the hardship or inequity which a party may suffer in being require
