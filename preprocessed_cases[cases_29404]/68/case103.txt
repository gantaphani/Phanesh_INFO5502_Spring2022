like cases should end in like judgments.once this court decides questions of law presented in a dispute,a nearly identical dispute ought to yield a similar outcome.emily rutherford challenges the columbia gas transmission corporation ability to maintain its pipeline easement by clearing certain trees from her land,but her appeal comes to us soon after we affirmed the same magistrate rejection of another landowner similar claims concerning a similar easement relating to the same gas pipelines.the facts and legal arguments of the two appeals are nearly indistinguishable,so our prior decision requires affirmance of the judgment below.
while the application of stare decisis to this case is straightforward,the procedural posture creates problems of appellate jurisdiction.this suit commenced when rutherford a citizen of ohio filed an ohio court suit to keep columbia from cutting down seven trees that grew on columbia easement on her land.she sought a declaratory judgment protecting the trees,a declaratory judgment defining the easement,damages,and costs.columbia incorporated in delaware principal place of business in west virginia removed based on diversity jurisdiction and filed various counterclaims.columbia counterclaims included a request for a declaratory judgment defining its easement,permitting it to remove the trees,and finding rutherford liable for various damages a claim for injunctive relief a claim for damages for breach of contract and property rights a claim for punitive damages and a claim for attorney fees and costs.
the magistrate made various findings of fact and conclusions of law that explicitly rejected each of rutherford claims.however,the magistrate did not address columbia counterclaims.nevertheless,the magistrate directed the clerk to enter judgment for columbia based on the findings,and rutherford filed a notice of appeal from the judgment,even though it was not final because it did not resolve all claims between the parties.see.b.
after we directed the parties to supplement their inadequate jurisdictional briefing and address this problem,the parties evidently asked the district court to amend the judgment.the magistrate entered an order entitled nunc pro tunc order entry of judgment.the order reiterates the previously entered judgment,without explanation adds a declaratory judgment finding a right of way of feet on each side of the pipelines,and dismisses columbia other counterclaims.
the magistrate did not seek leave under.a to correct the judgment while an appeal was docketed in this court,and it is hardly clear that an order that adds new relief to a judgment could be a correction within the scope of rule a.but resolution of that question is not necessary because at oral argument columbia explicitly stated that it was willing to relinquish all of its claims for relief in order to ensure appellate jurisdiction.while we do not encourage this procedure,it is enough to permit the exercise of appellate jurisdiction in this case.see scarbrough perez,cir marck,peng,cir but see smoot mazda motors of,cir both parties ordered to show cause why their counsel should not be sanctioned for deficient jurisdictional statements.all of columbia counterclaims,including its request for declaratory relief,are therefore considered dismissed with prejudice.we thus have jurisdiction to review the magistrate rejection of rutherford claims for relief.
these claims are largely controlled by our recent decision in andrews columbia gas transmission,cir.there we upheld the rejection of similar claims against columbia for removing trees from its easement across andrews land.see id.at.like rutherford,andrews had requested declaratory and injunctive relief to protect trees on the easement.id.at.as in rutherford case,the magistrate rejected andrews ohio law claims of laches,estoppel,and waiver.id.at.and as he did in rutherford case,the magistrate found that columbia planned tree removal was consistent with the terms of the easement.id.rutherford offers little to distinguish her case from the judgment affirmed in andrews.
in her reply brief,rutherford argues that the court should distinguish andrews because rutherford trees likely had been planted in the,around the time columbia predecessor obtained the last of the easements at issue.the andrews trees did not exist at the time of the creation of the easements at issue in that case.id.at.rutherford argues that the fact that the gas company allowed small trees to remain on the property when it installed the second gas line shows that the parties contemplated allowing large trees to grow on the easement.but in construing an express easement with unclear dimensions,the court considers not only circumstances surrounding the creation of the easement,but also what is reasonably necessary and convenient to serve the purposes for which the easement was granted.see id.at and cases cited therein.thus even if the circumstances surrounding the creation of the easements are marginally different in the two cases,rutherford has no developed argument as to how the magistrate finding that a cleared right of way is reasonably necessary is distinguishable from the similar finding upheld in andrews.see id.at.
because in andrews we upheld an indistinguishable factual finding that a cleared right of way is reasonably necessary to serve the purpose of the easement,we must uphold that magistrate finding in this case that columbia may clear trees from rutherford easement.and clearing even a right of way on each side of the pipelines would require the removal of the seven trees at issue here.thus,rutherford is not entitled to relief on any of her claims.
rutherford also contests the magistrate holding that various equitable doctrines do not apply to express easements as a matter of ohio law.but when pressed on this point at oral argument,her counsel conceded that andrews identical holding controls,and counsel merely invited us to reconsider andrews.a published prior panel decision remains controlling authority unless an inconsistent decision of the united states supreme court requires modification of the decision or this court sitting en banc overrules the prior decision.salmi sec y of health human,cir.without taking a case en banc,a panel can not reconsider a prior published case that interpreted state law,absent an indication by the state courts that they would have decided the prior case differently.blaine constr.ins.of,cir.or,as we recently stated in a diversity case,w e are bound by a prior published case that interpreted ohio law unless ohio law has measurably changed in the meantime.big lots stores,luv n care,cir.the tenth circuit has explained 
where no controlling state decision exists,the federal court must attempt to predict what the state highest court would do.in performing this ventriloquial function,however,the federal court is bound by ordinary principles of stare decisis.thus,when a panel of this court has rendered a decision interpreting state law,that interpretation is binding on district courts in this circuit,and on subsequent panels of this court,unless an intervening decision of the state highest court has resolved the issue.
wankier crown equip,cir.as no ohio court has suggested that andrews misapplied ohio law or reached a contrary holding,andrews holding that laches,estoppel,and waiver do not apply to expressly granted easements controls this case.see andrews,at.
that conclusion is sufficient to resolve this case.moreover,we decline to exercise our discretion to certify questions of state law to the ohio supreme court.first,no party has requested certification at any stage of this litigation.second,certification is not warranted because it would arguably be inconsistent with the andrews court determination not to seek such a certification sua sponte.third,available evidence does not suggest that the ohio supreme court is likely to disagree with andrews interpretation of ohio law.
at the parties request,we consider the district court purported nunc pro tunc order as a confirmation that columbia has agreed to the dismissal of its counterclaims.because the order appealed from properly denied rutherford relief on her claims,we affirm.
although i agree with much of the majority reasoning,i disagree with the notion that,at least with respect to rutherford claims regarding the equitable doctrines of waiver,laches,and estoppel,stare decisis requires us to blindly defer to our decision in andrews columbia gas transmission,cir.because andrews,in determining ohio law with respect to the application of these equitable doctrines,relied on an intermediate state appellate court decision to the exclusion of significant evidence that the supreme court of ohio would reach a different conclusion,our obligation to properly determine ohio state law conflicts with our obligation to respect and follow andrews.under these unique circumstances,the balance of interests strongly suggests that we should certify a question to the supreme court of ohio seeking its input on the proper scope of these doctrines under ohio law.therefore,i respectfully dissent as to the resolution of rutherford equitable claims.
our decision in andrews,like the magistrate judge decision in this case,relied almost exclusively on the ohio court of appeals decision in lone star steakhouse saloon of ohio,ryska,wl,ohio app.lexis,at ohio.june,to conclude that,unlike an easement obtained by prescription,an easement created by an express grant is not subject to the equitable doctrines of waiver,laches,and estoppel.there is no doubt that the ohio court of appeals held in lone star that equity does not acknowledge the extinguishment of such an expressly granted easement by recourse to estoppel or laches.id.at,ohio app.lexis,at.however,where a state highest court has not conclusively ruled on an issue,the decisions of intermediate state courts,although entitled to some weight,are not controlling.comm r of internal revenue estate of bosch,d quoting king order of travelers.instead,federal courts sitting in diversity are obliged to predict how the state highest court would rule by looking to all available data.prestige cas.mut.ins,cir quoting kingsley moll plasticrafters,cir.accordingly,while the holding of lone star provides presumptively persuasive datum for ascertaining state law,we may disregard that holding if we are convinced by other persuasive data that the highest court of the state would decide otherwise.west am.
a review of ohio law reveals very persuasive data that the supreme court of ohio would not accept the rule of lone star.the supreme court of ohio has applied these equitable doctrines in the context of other written contracts,see,pedler aetna life ins,ohio,applying the principles of equitable estoppel to written insurance contract,and holding that an insurer is estopped from denying the full value of coverage stated on the insurance certificate,based upon limitations or exclusions contained in the master policy,where the insured bargained and paid for such coverage,unless the insured knew or should have known of his ineligibility,and has interpreted agreements according to principles of contract law,see alexander buckeye pipe line,ohio.moreover,in considering claims regarding the alleged interference with a right of way created by an express agreement between adjacent landowners,the supreme court of ohio has expressly rejected the notion that a plaintiff remedy should be at law and not equity,recognizing that equitable remedies may provide the proper mode of enforcing the agreement.goldberger bexley properties,ohio.although not speaking to the applicability of the doctrine of laches and estoppel specifically,goldberger recognized that other equitable doctrines,such as unclean hands and adverse possession,apply with equal force in the context of express easements.id.our decision in andrews did not consider any of these decisions in determining that the supreme court of ohio would accept the rule announced in lone star.
furthermore,the rule announced in lone star seems to be predicated on a fundamental misreading of zimmerman cindle,ohio app d.although the syllabus to zimmerman states that an easement obtained by prescription is subject to the doctrine of laches and estoppel,nothing in the zimmerman opinion suggests that this is the only context in which those doctrines apply.if anything,zimmerman seems to imply that these equitable doctrines apply to all easements.id.at discussing equitable doctrine of estoppel in the context of an easement,and apparently referring to the original easement at issue in the case which was an express easement created by an instrument and duly recorded.lone star narrow reading of zimmerman also is belied by the fact that subsequent decisions by other ohio courts of appeals have held that express easements are subject to the doctrine of abandonment.see,bank agency,llc,wl,at,ohio app.lexis,at ohio.may.
to the extent that there is a conflict between zimmerman and lone star,we would be obliged to apply the earlier rule of zimmerman.see sowards loudon county,cir.that is especially true here given that lone star purports to apply the rule set forth in zimmerman,and also characterizes zimmerman as the leading authority in ohio on the extinguishment of easements via the doctrines of estoppel and laches.see lone star,wl,ohio app.lexis,at.
in addition,although the law of other states does not dictate the result here,it is relevant to our inquiry.see,herman miller,palazzetti imps,cir in reaching our decision regarding michigan law,we are also influenced by the number of states that have recognized a right of publicity.to that limited extent,then,it is important to note that other states have recognized that express easements are subject to these equitable doctrines.see,jewett leisinger,so d,crew die casting davidow,see also twp.of piscataway duke energy,cir applying new jersey law.at a minimum,these decisions demonstrate that there is nothing inherently unique about an expressly granted easement such that the rights created therein necessarily preclude considerations of equity.nor would such a limitation make sense given that the supreme court has applied the doctrine of laches to land claims between the states where a state title and rightful authority to disputed territory is at issue.see ohio kentucky,d the rule,and never doubted by this court,is that long acquiescence by one state in the possession of territory by another and in the exercise of sovereignty and dominion over it is conclusive of the latter title and rightful authority.quoting michigan wisconsin.massachusetts new york.long acquiescence in the possession of territory and the exercise of dominion and sovereignty over it may have a controlling effect in the determination of a disputed boundary.
despite this significant evidence that the holding of lone star is not an accurate statement of ohio law,our decision in andrews relied almost exclusively on lone star in determining that ohio law precludes the application of these equitable doctrines in the context of express easements.because of this likely error,i disagree with the majority conclusion that we have no choice but to resolve rutherford claims by reference to the rule set forth in andrews.the approach endorsed by the majority glosses over the shortcomings of our inquiry in andrews,and in fact compounds the error by lending credence to such an approach.
according to the majority,we are bound to follow andrews because no intervening ohio state court decision has suggested that andrews misapplied ohio law or reached a contrary holding.op.at citing blaine constr.ins.of,cir,and big lots stores,luv n care,app x,cir.underlying the majority position is the notion that stare decisis imposes on us an important obligation to respect and abide by the decisions handed down by prior panels of this court.see darrah city of oak park,cir.a number of circuits have reached a similar conclusion,reasoning that stare decisis applies with equal force to cases in which state law supplies the substantive rule of decision,broussard pac.transp,cir en banc,and thus holding that a prior panel decision should be followed by other panels without regard to any alleged existing confusion in state law,absent a subsequent state court decision or statutory amendment which makes this court prior decision clearly wrong,lee frozen food express,cir per curiam accord woodling garrett,cir a ruling of one panel of this circuit on an issue of state law normally will not be reconsidered by another panel absent a subsequent decision of a state court or of this circuit tending to cast doubt on that ruling.
what the majority fails to recognize,however,is that certifying a question to a state court does not implicate,much less contradict,our obligations under stare decisis.when we certify a question to a state court,we are not modifying,overturning,or otherwise refusing to follow prior precedent.rather,we are seeking guidance from a court to which we are bound to defer on issues of state law.certifying a question regarding ohio law to ohio highest court thus does not run counter to or even implicate whatever obligations we have to follow andrews,it merely reflects sound judicial management.
confronted with a wrongly decided prior panel decision,our only option normally would be to follow that decision and encourage the en banc sixth circuit or supreme court to reconsider the issue.in a diversity case such as this,however,we have the additional option of certifying a question to the state highest court,at least where that court rules make the certification procedure available.if the rules of the supreme court of ohio did not make the certification procedure available,then i would agree that we would be bound by andrews.but because the certification option is available here,and in light of the interests at stake,i believe that we are compelled to exercise our discretion and provide the supreme court of ohio an opportunity to address this issue.
the doctrine of stare decisis et non quieta to stand by things decided,and not to disturb settled points,black law dictionary ed reflects the principle that,for the sake of consistency and order,courts should follow prior decisions regarding the same points of law.but stare decisis is not an inexorable command.planned parenthood casey,d quoting burnet coronado oil gas.brandeis,dissenting.rather,determining whether to follow past precedent requires an exercise of judgment that is customarily informed by a series of prudential and pragmatic considerations designed to test the consistency of overruling a prior decision with the ideal of the rule of law,and to gauge the respective costs of reaffirming and overruling a prior case.id.in most cases,stare decisis is usually the wise policy,because in most matters it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled right.burnet,at.brandeis,dissenting.in certain circumstances,however,the balance of interests is shifted,and our responsibility to make sure that an issue is settled right is more important than the benefits of letting the issue remain merely settled.in such cases,the considerations that usually support our following prior precedent must give way to other competing interests.this is one of those circumstances.
where,such as here,our jurisdiction is predicated on the diversity of parties,we are obliged to apply state law in resolving the substantive issues presented.see erie tompkins.in fulfilling that obligation,we are required to determine what in fact is the applicable state law.our duty to properly determine state law is a serious responsibility that implicates principles at least as significant as those underlying stare decisis.in fact,unlike the pragmatic considerations underlying stare decisis,see casey,at,erie imposes on federal courts a duty and great responsibility to properly determine state law,see meredith winter haven.in all cases arising under our diversity jurisdiction,erie requires that we adjudicate the rights of the parties with the aid of such light as was afforded by the materials for decision at hand,and in accordance with the applicable principles for determining state law.id.at.this is an obligation from which we may not shrink.as the supreme court has emphasized,diversity jurisdiction was not conferred for the benefit of the federal courts or to serve their convenience,but rather was adopted by congress to afford to suitors an opportunity in such cases,at their option,to assert their rights in the federal rather than in the state courts.id.at.
in certain cases,our duty to properly determine and apply state law comes into conflict with the interests that normally would support our deferring to prior precedent.in such cases,some courts have recognized that the obligation to properly determine state law is more important than the general dictate to defer to prior federal precedent construing state law.see united states maness,cir refusing to follow fourth circuit interpretation of north carolina state law because the fourth circuit did not follow a contrary prior state supreme court decision even though we would usually defer to the fourth circuit prediction of an issue of first impression regarding north carolina state law factors,pro arts,cir emphasizing that prior federal determinations of state law should be followed for the benefit of both the orderly development of state law and fairness to those subject to state law requirements,but acknowledging that prior federal interpretations may be disregarded where prior state court decisions had been inadvertently overlooked by the pertinent court of appeals.
confronted with these competing considerations,the majority resolves the issue by suggesting that stare decisis operates in this case not as a merely prudential and pragmatic consideration,but as a binding rule.in other words,according to the majority,it is not just that we would usually defer to andrews,as was the case in maness,but that we are required to do so.
the majority position does have some appeal,at least superficially,in that our case law dictates that prior reported panel decisions are binding on all subsequent panels unless an inconsistent decision of the united states supreme court requires modification of the decision or this court sitting en banc overrules the prior decision.salmi sec y of health human,cir.even this court rules provide that r eported panel opinions are binding on subsequent panels.thus,no subsequent panel overrules a published opinion of a previous panel.cir.c.
but this binding rule is not implicated by our certifying a question of ohio state law to the supreme court of ohio because that procedure does not overrule andrews.while there may be sound and persuasive practical reasons not to exercise the certification option in certain of which are present certainly are not precluded from doing so by rule c or our decisions in salmi,blaine construction,or big lots.indeed,none of these decisions even considers whether the unique dynamics of cases arising under our diversity jurisdiction remove the certification protocol from the constraints of rule c.
significantly,the binding rule of salmi and rule c includes important elements that make it more constraining than the traditional doctrine of stare decisis.like stare decisis,the requirement that a subsequent panel must follow reported decisions of prior panels implicates considerations of consistency and order.that much is obvious.what perhaps is less obvious,however,is that this rule also includes the separate notion that the authority to modify or reverse a ruling should reside only in the hands of a superior body,and includes as a minor premise the unextraordinary proposition that panels within the same circuit are.while i do not disagree with either this rule or its underlying premises,the majority contention that this rule applies unyieldingly in this case overlooks several critical factors that suggest that this binding rule operates differently in diversity cases such as this.
most importantly,it makes sense to transform the pragmatic doctrine of stare decisis into a binding rule with respect to panels only because there are at least two higher en banc court and the supreme which a dissatisfied party can seek reconsideration of a wrongly decided question.as our rules suggest,it makes sense to construe reported panel decisions as binding on subsequent panels only because en banc recon
