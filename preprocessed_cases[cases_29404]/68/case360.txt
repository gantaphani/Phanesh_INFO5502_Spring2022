the petitioners,the public service commission of wisconsin pscw and american transmission company llc atc challenge two orders of the federal energy regulatory commission ferc or commission approving a proposed tariff revision filed by the midwest independent transmission system operator,miso,a regional transmission organization rto midwest indep.transmission.operator,order conditionally accepting and suspending proposed tariff revisions and establishing technical conference ferc tariff ord.midwest indep.transmission operator,order on technical conference,rehearing,clarification,and compliance ferc reh g ord.the proposed revision included a provision to allocate among miso transmission customers a portion of the costs of qualifying transmission upgrades built by individual miso transmission providers but to exclude from such cost sharing any upgrade project that was already planned as of the date the proposed revision was filed.the petitioners contend the cost allocation policy is arbitrary and discriminatory insofar as it excludes updates planned before the filing.applying our deferential standard of review to ferc ratemaking orders,we conclude that ferc did not err in approving the cost allocation policy miso proposed.

in an order issued july,addressing proposed revisions to miso tariff,ferc approved miso general proposal to implement the default pricing proposal of ferc order pending miso filing of its own proposal.midwest indep.transmission.operator,at.ferc order further advised 
we note that midwest iso states its intent that the default pricing proposal will remain in effect only until a pricing policy based on the principle of payment for upgrades by those that cause and benefit from the upgrades can be established by midwest iso and its stakeholders.this is a goal supported by many intervenors in this proceeding,and we encourage midwest iso to continue to work with stakeholders in considering such a pricing policy.midwest iso outlines the actions it is taking to develop such a proposal,and while we will not impose a deadline for filing the proposal at this time,we expect midwest iso to work with stakeholders to meet its goal of having a permanent pricing policy in effect by december.

in june,miso published the midwest iso transmission expansion plan mtep,which,inter alia,contained a list of upgrade projects contemplated by each miso transmission provider.the list identified each provider projects as either planned or proposed based on the provider characterization thereof.a planned project was defined as the preferred solution to an identified issue and a proposed project as a tentative solution to an identified issue.mtep app.
on september,the recb task force adopted a policy for allocating costs of new electrical generation projects,which the miso board of directors approved.cost allocation policy letter ferc tariff ord.at.accordingly,on october,miso filed with ferc proposed tariff revisions to implement the policy.the filing included a letter from miso vice president,general counsel and secretary stephen kozey to ferc secretary setting out the substance of the proposed policy and explaining the process leading to its adoption,along with two attachments attachment ff titled transmission expansion planning protocol included a cost allocation provision which proposed that twenty per cent of the costs of baseline reliability projects,upgrade projects needed to maintain reliability while accommodating the ongoing needs of existing market participants and transmission customers involving voltage of kv and above be allocated on a basis to all transmission customers and recovered through a rate,with the remaining eighty per cent of the costs to be allocated on a basis to all transmission customers in designated pricing zones.attachment ff ii a,iii a c ii.attachment ff also included a grandfathered projects clause which provided 
the cost allocation provisions of this attachment ff shall not be applicable to transmission projects identified in attachment,which is based on the list of projects designated as planned projects in mtep 
attachment ff iii a b.attachment,in turn,contained a list of planned projects to be excluded from regional cost allocation,which,without explanation,included projects that had been listed as proposed rather than planned in mtep.in an order issued february,ferc conditionally accepted the proposed tariff revisions,effective february,subject to further modifications,including a directive that miso correct language in section.on sheet which describes the excluded projects list as based on the planned projects of the mtep because the actual list is based on the planned project list with some additions of proposed projects that the midwest iso has determined to be in advanced stages of planning.ferc tariff ord.at,the commission concluded that miso proposed cost allocation policy was a reasonable compromise position from which this independent transmission provider,with significant stakeholder input,may start to apply regional cost sharing of transmission expansion projects and that it did not place any undue disadvantage on any one party.id.at.
on april,miso issued a new version of attachment ff,which revised the grandfathered projects clause to read 
the cost allocation provisions of this attachment ff shall not be applicable to transmission projects identified in attachment,which is based on the list of projects designated as planned projects in mtep and some additions of proposed projects that the transmission provider has determined to be in the advanced stages of planning.

atc and pscw filed requests for rehearing,which the commission denied in an order issued november,iterating that miso cost allocation policy reflected a reasonable compromise and was not unduly discriminatory.ferc reh g ord.

misplaced reliance on the recb task force 
the petitioners contend that ferc erred in g iving w eight to the n on c onsensus s takeholder p rocess,relying on the recommendation of the recb task force,which entity consist ed predominately of vertically integrated utilities located outside of wisconsin.pscw br.they claim that vertically integrated utilities could and did,to their economic benefit and without regard to benefits and cost causation,engage in an economic cram down of costs on wisconsin,a small minority.id.at.we find this argument unpersuasive.first,the commission often gives weight to a proposal that may not represent complete stakeholder consensus but is the position of the majority of the transmission owning members of the rto.am.power serv.midwest indep.transmission.operator,quoting pjm interconnection,opinion,alteration by court.further,the petitioners do not offer any evidence of majority overreaching or assert the process was not open or did not allow for extensive participation.pscw br.instead,they challenge the fairness of the policy the majority approved at the conclusion of the lengthy deliberative process,which,as we have noted,ferc reasonably determined to be just and reasonable.ferc tariff ord.at.that the allocation starting date the majority chose may have affected wisconsin projects disproportionately in the short term because of the large number of projects atc had planned before that not make the policy unduly discriminatory.as ferc explained on rehearing,atc will benefit from the cost sharing proposal in the future,noting that four projects by atc,amounting to over million,should qualify for regional cost sharing under the midwest iso cost allocation policy.ferc reh g ord.
the petitioners challenge in particular ferc finding that the exclusion list is a reasonable compromise position as not based upon any miso contention in the october filing,which nowhere characterized the exclusion list as a compromise.pscw br.see ferc tariff ord.at ferc reh g ord.the petitioners further contend that the proposal was in fact not a compromise midpoint between positions.pscw br.accord atc reply br.in any event,pscw contends,ferc had a federal power act duty to independently determine whether the proposal before it is just and reasonable.pscw br.footnotes omitted tejas power ferc,although court has consistently required the commission to give weight to the contracts and settlements of the parties before it,the commission may approve the settlement and certificate the proposed service only if,in its independent judgment,the new service is or will be required by the present or future public convenience and necessity quoting e internal citation omitted.we reject this argument as well.
first,in its october,filing,miso did characterize its cost allocation proposal,of which the excluded projects list is a part,as a compromise,that is,a midpoint between generators being directly assigned all costs as in other and the tariffs applicable to transmission providers that required the refunding of all costs.cost allocation policy letter.miso explained that the proposal was a tenuous balance that was voted on by task force members as a package,and to change individual elements would result in a proposal for which support for the proposal as a whole would be highly uncertain.id.see also mot.to intervene and supporting comments of the midwest iso transmission owners,describing negotiating positions and compromises.with regard to the excluded project list in particular,miso recounted that stakeholders had been concerned about the wide variability in then current investment projections,in addition to the fact that some midwest iso member systems we re currently in a building crest,while others we re not and,when discussions did not yield a method that stakeholders could agree on or uniformly support,the recb task force adopted the going forward approach,which was an equitable way to resolve this critical issue.cost allocation policy letter.in any event,the commission noted on rehearing that,notwithstanding some parties disagree d with the use of the phrase compromise position,their request for rehearing d id not change ferc findings in the february order with regard to the appropriateness of the recb task force process.ferc reh g ord.finally,as explained above,ferc did make its own,independent assessment that the policy was just and reasonable,ferc tariff ord.at,and that assessment is neither arbitrary nor capricious.
b.the proposed planned distinction 
we next address the petitioners contention that ferc reliance on the recb task force distinction between planned projects and proposed projects was arbitrary in several respects.we find none of their arguments persuasive.
the petitioners first argue it was arbitrary to create the excluded projects list based on an individual transmission owner planned and proposed transmission projects,noting in particular that some proposed projects have similar or even earlier dates than some that are planned.atc br.as t he most compelling evidence of the arbitrary nature of the planned and proposed designations,the petitioners cite the fact that the midwest iso included on the excluded projects list not just all of the planned projects in appendix a,but of the proposed projects.id.on the first point,ferc recognized that miso reasonably decided to focus not on the date but on the stage of a project planning as of october,in keeping with its going forward rationale.as for the second,that miso treated some projects as planned notwithstanding the owners proposed designation suggests that,contrary to the petitioners assertion,miso did not blindly accept the owners own characterization.
the petitioners also challenge ferc determination that miso changed the projects designations from proposed to planned because of those projects advanced planning stage.the petitioners assert that this explanation for the changes first appears in ferc february,tariff order,pointing out that only after that order issued did miso insert the rationale into its revised attachment ff.see ferc tariff ord.at noting proposed projects that were sufficiently advanced in the planning process were viewed by the midwest iso as being,for practical purposes,planned revised attachment ff iii a b issued april,the cost allocation provisions of this attachment ff shall not be applicable to transmission projects identified in attachment,which is based on the list of projects designated as planned projects in mtep and some additions of proposed projects that the transmission provider has determined to be in the advanced stages of planning.underlining of revised language in original.the record contains evidence,however,that at an august,meeting before the october,cost allocation policy letter designating the projects as proposed,the miso stakeholders voted to use the list of projects that were identified as planned in mtep or that were identified as proposed but were so far along that they really should be identifi
