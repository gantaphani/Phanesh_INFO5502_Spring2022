for the second time in as many years,petitioner,a local utility,seeks review of a federal energy regulatory commission order denying it the opportunity to continue purchasing transmission services through a contract that expired at the end of.finding petitioner claims meritless,we deny the petition.
under a contract signed in,pacific gas electric and several other california utilities provided petitioner,the sacramento municipal utility district smud,firm transmission service.for those uninitiated in the intricacies of energy regulation,f irm service permits customers to demand transmission at any time,while service permits the utility to cut service when there is not enough excess capacity.transmission access policy study group ferc,per curiam.the contract permitted smud to demand megawatts of transmission any time for a fixed a series of transmission facilities known as the pacific intertie.consisting of two kilovolt lines running from the pacific northwest through california,the intertie allows california utilities to purchase power from sources in oregon and washington.critical to the issue before us,had a similar contract with the western area power administration western.the smud and western contracts like other firm service contracts relating to the intertie expired on december.
as we explained in sacramento municipal utility district ferc,hereinafter sacramento i,while western and smud were receiving service under these contracts,the state of california and ferc radically restructur ed california energy market.id.at.as part of the restructuring,ferc required utilities to unbundle their electricity generation and transmission services and to file new open access tariffs guaranteeing access to their transmission facilities by competing generators.id.at see also promoting wholesale competition through open access transmission services by public utilities recovery of stranded costs by public utilities and transmitting utilities,stats regs.at summarizing ferc new regulation.at the same time,california created the california independent system operator corporation caiso,a organization that took over operation but not ownership of many transmission facilities,including the portions of the pacific intertie owned by.a year later in a proceeding in which smud intervened,ferc approved a new tariff proposed by caiso,under which caiso no longer offers firm transmission service,but instead requires utility customers to request transmission capacity in real time,on either an or basis.see sacramento i,at explaining caiso tariff pac.gas,at,wl hereinafter caiso ii approving caiso tariff.utilities are then charged an access fee,as well as a congestion price that fluctuates with demand.the caiso tariff provides transmission service to any utilities willing to pay the congestion charge.sacramento i,at.
recognizing that caiso new service model represented a significant change for the utilities,the commission declined to abrogate existing contracts and ordered customers to take service under the caiso tariff upon contract expiration.see also caiso ii,at.for this reason,smud and western continued receiving transmission service under the contracts until they expired at the end of.in addition to delaying implementation of the tariff for these utilities,ferc required caiso to find ways to allow utilities to hedge the risk of price fluctuations,pac.gas,at,wl hereinafter caiso i,and later adopted a caiso proposal that mitigated risk through the use of tradeable financial instruments,see cal.operator,at,wl.at oral argument in this case,ferc counsel indicated the commission is now investigating risk mitigation strategies through a comprehensive market redesign proceeding.oral arg.at.
early in,filed for permission to terminate transmission service to smud and western upon the expiration of their contracts at the end of that year.shortly thereafter,and caiso began negotiations with not with continue transmission service outside the caiso tariff.unlike smud,western owns and operates a segment of one of the two transmission lines that make up the pacific intertie.owns and caiso operates the remainder of this line.absent an agreement similar to western contract with,utility customers receiving power transmitted along the intertie would be charged twice,once by caiso and again by western a phenomenon ferc calls pancaked rates.pac.gas,at,wl hereinafter initial order.western,caiso,and,however,negotiated a transmission exchange agreement,whereby the parties agreed to exchange transmission without charging each other transmission rates,including congestion charges.this agreement effectively shielded western from the risks of congestion pricing under the caiso tariff in exchange for providing caiso and its customers capacity on western portion of the pacific intertie.calling the transmission exchange agreement a unique agreement which is beneficial to all the parties,ferc approved it,along with termination of service to western under the contract.id.at.
although smud lodged no objection to the transmission exchange agreement,it opposed filing to terminate its own service,alleging that termination would harm the public interest by subjecting smud to the financial risks of congestion pricing under the caiso tariff.smud also asserted that refusal to negotiate a successor agreement similar to the new western agreement was discriminatory.based on these arguments,smud urged ferc to reject filing or,in the alternative,to suspend termination until the commission could conduct an evidentiary hearing to resolve the issues.
ferc rejected smud arguments,denied its request for an evidentiary hearing,and accepted notice of termination.id.at.smud sought rehearing,reiterating its arguments and asserting that ferc should have reviewed termination request under a public interest rather than a just and reasonable standard.ferc denied rehearing,pac.gas,at,wl hereinafter rehearing order,and smud now petitions for review,see b granting judicial review of ferc orders made under the federal power act.
because termination of transmission service constitutes a rate change requiring ferc approval under section d of the federal power act fpa,d,a transmission service provider must file with ferc before terminating service,even if service is provided under a contract ending on its own terms.see also a.smud first argues that ferc may accept a filing requesting termination of service only if the termination serves the public interest.smud roots this contention in dictum from pennsylvania water power federal power commission,in which the supreme court held that ferc predecessor agency,the federal power commission fpc,had statutory authority to order penn water to continue its practice of integrating its power output with that of another public utility.id.at.the court explained that penn water could nonetheless seek commission approval to discontinue service under fpa section d,provided penn water can prove that its wishes are consistent with the public interest.id.emphasis added.smud also points to two previous ferc orders,in which the commission stated that proposed termination s must be shown to be consistent with the public interest.power light,at see also pub.serv.of,at.according to smud,by refusing to make a public interest determination,ferc departed from these precedents without explanation.
we see no merit in smud argument.the words public interest appear nowhere in section d.instead,the statute requires ferc to determine whether a proposed change in service is just and reasonable and free from any undue preference or advantage.a,b.nothing in penn water,moreover,suggests that in using the term public interest the supreme court intended to expand the scope of the commission inquiry beyond these statutory criteria.nor,as ferc indicated in its rehearing order,has the commission ever defined the scope of its inquiry differently.see rehearing order at referring to cases cited by smud in support of its position,ferc pointed out that i n these cases,the commission determined that it should make a just and reasonable determination el paso,at t he notice of cancellation has not been shown to be just and
