public utilities code section grants telephone corporations the privilege to construct infrastructure upon public rights of way,subject to a municipality right to exercise reasonable control as to the time,place,and manner in which roads,highways,and waterways are accessed,subd.a.in the proceeding under review,the california public utilities commission commission or puc classified nextg as a telephone corporation and approved nextg proposed construction project in the city of huntington beach the city.
the city is opposed to aspects of nextg project.as its first line of defense to the nextg project,the city asserts that nextg is a wireless provider and therefore not a telephone corporation.the city contends that the definition of telephone corporation for purposes of section does not include wireless providers,as opposed to traditional landline providers.but in our view,the commission correctly interpreted and applied the public utilities code in designating nextg as a telephone corporation entitled to the privileges of section.
as its second line of defense to the nextg project,the city relies on municipal ordinances requiring,subject to exceptions,the undergrounding of wires and other communications equipment.the city claims the commission erred by purporting to preempt local ordinances in approving nextg construction project in the city.we agree with this contention.throughout the puc proceedings,the parties and the commission emphasized that a court,not the commission,would adjudicate the validity of the city municipal ordinances.the commission exceeded the scope of the proceedings when it ruled,via a modification to its initial decision,that its approval of nextg project preempted local ordinances 
we therefore affirm in part commission decisions the october initial decision and the january rehearing decision,but reverse and set aside those portions of the decisions purporting to preempt local ordinances,subd.a appellate court shall enter judgment either affirming or setting aside the order or decision,subd.a providing jurisdiction to reviewing court to reverse puc orders and decisions.
nextg builds and owns fiber optic networks.however,nextg does not directly serve individual customers whose calls are carried over nextg networks.instead,nextg sells capacity on its networks to other companies,who use the capacity to serve their customers.nextg is thus a carrier carrier.
the project at issue is the completion of a distributed antenna system within the city the communications network is intended to transmit wireless voice and data communications to clients in the city the project.the project includes aerial fiber cable and underground fiber cable.part of the project already has been constructed under previously granted authority.nextg customer for the project is metropcs,a company that provides commercial mobile radio service to its customers.
nextg regulatory status with the puc and the history of the dispute between nextg and the city are relevant to our review.this summary chart of the puc proceedings mentioned in this opinion may be useful as a reference point.
editor note tabular or graphical material not displayable at this time.
the january decision 
in january,the commission issued a certificate of public convenience and necessity to nextg,which authorized nextg to provide limited and resold local exchange,access and interexchange telecommunications services.the authorization was conditioned on nextg complying with various rules applicable to its class of competitors.nextg application was uncontested.
the commission issued the certificate under the authority of section,which provides in relevant part,no telephone corporation shall begin the construction of a line,plant,or system,or of any extension thereof,without having first obtained from the commission a certificate that the present or future public convenience and necessity require or will require such construction.it is implied in the issuance of a certificate under section that the puc considered nextg to be a telephone corporation,but the january decision did not explicitly address this question.
the april decision 
in april,the commission issued a decision granting nextg request for full local exchange services authority and expedited environmental review like that previously authorized for firms engaged in similar activities.this expansion of nextg authority was necessary for it to engage in new pole installations,trenching and underground conduit installation,and and installation of laterals.
the commission also approved the use of its previously developed expedited ceqa review process for individual nextg projects.nextg would submit a description of the proposed project to the ceqa staff in the energy division of the puc,with all necessary documentation required to support the project approval under ceqa.
with regard to the issue of utility poles in underground districts,the commission ruled that the procedure we adopt here will apply to installing utility poles in underground districts where local jurisdictions grant such exceptions.the april decision did not purport to preempt all local ordinances that would limit nextg ability to engage in ground breaking activities.indeed,in denying nextg petition for rehearing of the april decision,the commission observed we are aware that the california constitution does provide this commission with preemptive authority over local jurisdictions with respect to the regulation of utilities.at the same time,the constitution provides cities the power to make and enforce local ordinances and regulations not in conflict with general laws.the process adopted in the april decision is consistent with long standing commission policy to recognize local government concerns and require utilities to accommodate local land use requirements in constructing their facilities.in re application of nextg networks of california,cal.no,fns.omitted the july decision.
nextg application to the city 
in march,nextg formally applied to the city for authorization to conduct business as a telecommunications company operating with infrastructure located in the public ways.nextg requested a agreement or other appropriate form of authorization in order to install,operate,and maintain fiber optic cable and associated equipment,including optical repeaters and antenna facilities,on,over,and under the public way in connection with the provision of telecommunications provided by nextg as a carrier carrier to its wireless carrier customers.
the city did not readily accede to nextg requests.as of september,nextg representative professed to be disappointed and frustrated with the city.although further discussion continued as evidenced by written communications,nextg and the city were unable to resolve their differences.the city took the position that pertinent local ordinances precluded aspects of the project,which called for the construction of new utility poles and aerial lines.
pertinent local ordinances 
in,the city adopted ordinance,adding chapter to its municipal code,commonly referred to as the undergrounding ordinance.the city cites various portions of the undergrounding ordinance as pertinent to its refusal to allow nextg unfettered access to the public right of way in the city.pursuant to municipal code section,which was amended in,all new public and private utility lines and distribution facilities shall be installed underground,subject to certain exceptions.municipal code section lists exclusions from the provisions of this chapter unless otherwise provided in the resolution designating the underground utilities district,including f antennas used by a utility for furnishing communication services.the city contends this exclusion permits attaching antennas to existing,pre utility poles,but any equipment or facilities accessory to an antenna must be installed underground.
also of note to this opinion is the city wireless ordinance,which consists of chapter of the city zoning and subdivision ordinance.as its name implies,the wireless ordinance regulates the deployment of wireless communications equipment in the city.
puc energy division proceedings 
on november,nextg submitted a notice of proposed construction to install a distributed antenna system on behalf of metro pcs in the city.the notice requested the energy division to determine that the project was categorically exempt from ceqa.on december,the energy division found the project categorically exempt from ceqa,and issued a notice to proceed with construction.the city objected to the notice to proceed and it was suspended by the energy division.according to the energy division,the city submitted three concerns the accuracy of the project description the energy division conclusion that the project is categorically exempt from ceqa and,the installation of overhead equipment in an underground utility district.
on march,the energy division,u pon review of the full administrative record,concluded that nextg project description is accurate and complete.upon review of the complete project description,the energy division finds that the project is consistent with the activities identified by the commission as categorically exempt under ceqa and no further environmental review is required.with regard to the installation of overhead equipment in an underground utility district,the energy division simply noted a district court injunction described in the next section of the recitation of facts in this opinion.the energy division did not purport to address the applicability or enforceability of the undergrounding ordinance or wireless ordinance.on march,the energy division authorized nextg to proceed with the construction of the project.
federal action 
on december,nextg sued the city in federal court,in a case styled nextg networks of california,city of huntington beach cal,no.sacv abc the federal action.the district court issued injunctions in february and march,enjoining the city from enforcing its undergrounding ordinance or wireless ordinance so as to prevent nextg from fulfilling its contractual obligations,or enforcing its ordinances against nextg in a manner inconsistent with the city enforcement incumbent telecommunications and cable television providers.
pursuant to the injunctions issued against the city in the federal action,the city issued encroachment permits authorizing nextg to install seven of the antennas constituting the project pursuant to a new set of construction plans on may.since those seven antennas and related lines and equipment were completed on or about september,no further work has been performed on the project.the project stalled because,in september,the injunctions were vacated on appeal and the federal action was remanded to the district court for further proceedings.nextg networks of california,city of huntington beach cir.
the city complaint 
in april,the city filed a complaint against nextg with the puc.the city made three claims.first,the city alleged that the energy division erred by approving nextg project under a ceqa categorical exemption,tit.this is a pure ceqa issue over which this court has no jurisdiction,as explained below.
second,the city alleged that the undergrounding ordinance prohibits nextg from installing of its proposed antennas,and may prohibit the installation of a fourth antenna,if the pole to replace the existing pole in order to accommodate the antenna is taller and materially different than the existing pole.the city referenced the april decision,in which the commission stated with regard to the issue of utility poles in underground districts that the procedure we adopt here will apply to installing utility poles in underground districts where local jurisdictions grant such exceptions.the city took issue with the energy division issuance of a notice to proceed with nextg project following an expedited ceqa review despite the fact that the undergrounding ordinance prohibited the installation of new utility poles.the city requested that the commission invalidate the notice to proceed with nextg project and declare that nextg does not have authority to install new poles,antenna,or aerial fiber optic cable facilities in the public.
third,the city alleged that nextg can not be a telephone corporation as a matter of law and therefore can not be eligible to use public rights of way under section.the city reasoned that nextg is a wireless provider and o nly land line telephone carriers are telephone corporations.the city requested that the commission declare as a matter of law that nextg is not a telephone corporation within the meaning of section and that nextg has no right to use the public within the city 
nextg motion to dismiss the city complaint 
in june,nextg filed a motion to dismiss the city complaint,which argued on various grounds that the complaint was procedurally improper and substantively without merit.
in november,in a joint ruling from an assigned commissioner and administrative law judge,nextg motion was granted in part and denied in part.the joint ruling granted the motion to dismiss as to the city third cause of action,that nextg is not a telephone corporation.according to the ruling,the plain language of the relevant statutes as well as previous commission decisions compelled this result.the joint ruling denied the motion as to the other two causes of action.
parties stipulation 
in december,the parties submitted a stipulation to the puc setting forth an agreed upon procedure and narrowing the issues in dispute.instead of pursuing project approval by way of a notice to proceed,and to resolve the remaining issues in dispute between the parties in this complaint proceeding,nextg shall file a proponent environmental assessment and request commission authorization for the project that reflects nextg current project plan the parties request that the commission prepare a negative declaration,mitigated negative declaration or environmental impact report for the project.
the parties agree that the following issues are the only issues that remain in dispute whether the ruling dismissing the city third cause of action should be affirmed or reversed by the full commission whether the commission should certify the environmental document for the project,and if so,what if any mitigation measures may be required and whether the commission should approve the project.italics omitted.
importantly,the parties stipulated that the validity of any city ordinance would not be resolved by the commission this proceeding will not adjudicate the validity of the city undergrounding ordinance,wireless ordinance,or other ordinances or regulations consequently,if approved by the commission,the approval of nextg project and certification of a negative declaration,mitigated negative declaration,or environmental impact report for the project under ceqa shall not exempt or excuse nextg from complying with any and all valid local ordinances or regulations,including,but not limited to,the city undergrounding ordinance,wireless ordinance or other ordinances or regulations.nextg may challenge the validity of any such ordinances or regulations in any federal or state court of law.nextg is currently challenging the validity of the city undergrounding ordinance in the federal action.
initiation of state court action 
in february,the district court in the federal action granted the city motion for judgment on the pleadings with regard to nextg federal claims and declined to exercise jurisdiction over nextg state law claim,specifically whether sections and preempt the city ordinances.the district court did not order the removal of the part of the project already installed,but directed nextg to either apply for city approval of its project or seek relief in state court.
on march,nextg filed nextg networks of california,city of huntington beach,orange county superior court case the state court action nextg sought declaratory and injunctive relief.nextg first cause of action alleged that t he terms and conditions that the city imposes in the rules,regulations,and requirements in the city code,including but not limited to those identified in the wireless ordinance and undergrounding ordinance,on their face and as applied to nextg and nextg deployment of its facilities in the public,exceed the scope of the city authority under and are preempted by section s and.nextg second cause of action made similar allegations but on the specific ground that the city has discriminated against nextg as compared to incumbent providers of telecommunications services.nextg third cause of action alleged that the city,in violation of government code section,seeks to improperly require nextg to pay permit fees in excess of the reasonable costs incurred by the city for providing services to nextg.
nextg puc application 
on march,nextg filed an application with the puc to confirm the authority it had received from the commission to construct the project,and to have the commission review nextg environmental assessment,an approximately page document.
nextg explained in its application that it had completed the majority of the project pursuant to the notice to proceed issued by the energy division,but that the city had refused to permit the completion of the construction.nextg requested in the application that the commission address the city assertion that additional portions of the project should be undergrounded in compliance with its local ordinances by conditioning approval of the project on compliance by nextg with any lawful local ordinances and regulations.importantly,the application stated that the applicability and lawfulness of these ordinances to the project is now at issue in pending litigation between the parties.the parties have stipulated that the scope of the puc proceeding will not adjudicate the validity of the city ordinances.
the city filed a protest to nextg application nextg application proposes a project in violation of city ordinances.the city contends that in light of nextg pending state court lawsuit testing the validity of the city ordinances,this application should be stayed until that lawsuit is final.for the commission to consider a project that violates local regulations is a pointless exercise,particularly where the parties have already agreed that state suit is the proper forum to determine the validity of the city ordinances.the city accused nextg of attempting to have it both ways,litigating preemption in the state court action and determining whether nextg must comply with city regulations through this application.
nextg responded in a subsequent filing.let there be no mistake about it nextg has not requested that the commission make a determination regarding whether nextg must comply with city regulations through its application.in fact,in conformance with the stipulation of the parties,nextg has specifically requested that the commission not address the validity of the city regulations.as noted in its application,nextg requests that the commission simply address the city local ordinances by conditioning approval of the project on compliance by nextg with any lawful local ordinances and regulations.t he commission could not meaningfully evaluate whether nextg project complies with lawful local ordinances until after the state court has held whether the city ordinances are lawful.
scoping memorandum 
in july,the assigned commissioner and administrative law judge issued a joint ruling setting the schedule for the commission proceeding and determining the scope of the proceeding.the ruling recategorize d the consolidated proceeding as ratesetting and determine d that an evidentiary hearing was not necessary.an evidentiary hearing was unnecessary because,as to environmental issues,the city would have the opportunity to submit evidence as part of the commission environmental review of the process.moreover,the joint ruling determined that the question of whether the project complies with local ordinances is a matter of law,as the project will be fully described in the environmental document it produced.
the joint ruling recognized that nextg was seeking authorization to complete its project.although most of the project had already been constructed,several aspects of the project had not been completed,including the installation of overhead aerial fiber,underground cable,and three new poles.the joint ruling described the scope of the consolidated proceeding before the puc as including a number of issues related to the project environmental impact,and also whether nextg is a telephone corporation.
the scoping memorandum also stated t his proceeding will not adjudicate the legal validity of the city undergrounding ordinance,wireless ordinance,or other ordinances or regulations adopted by the city.in a subsequent trial brief,nextg emphasized this limitation on the scope of the proceeding t he application does not ask that the commission decide the validity of the undergrounding issue and the city has specifically stipulated that the commission will not address this legal issue.in this respect it is significant that nextg application does not request that the commission preempt the city undergrounding ordinance although the puc clearly has the authority to do so.instead nextg with the agreed stipulation of the city has left that issue for the courts to decide.
negative declaration 
in february,a document entitled final initial study and negative declaration was completed by the energy division.this document concluded that the project as proposed by nextg would have no significant impacts in the areas of aesthetics,agricultural resources,air quality,biological resources,cultural resources,geology and soils,hazards and hazardous materials,hydrology and water quality,land use and planning,mineral resources,noise,population and housing,public services,recreation,transportation and traffic,and utilities and service systems.in the land use and planning section of the report,it was indicated that the project would have a l ess than significant impact with regard to conflicts with applicable land use plans,policies,or regulations within the applicable jurisdiction.
as to the undergrounding ordinance and wireless ordinance,the report stated the project has been modified to underground the new cable network wherever existing aboveground utility lines do not currently exist and to the extent feasible.the project includes adding one additional overhead cable where existing overhead utilities occur,along the existing publicly owned,and adding three new poles also within the existing publicly owned.the project would not result in a significant change from existing conditions and is not considered to be a substantial conflict with the ordinances.
the october initial decision 
in october,the commission reached the merits of the issues presented.the commission explained that,pursuant to the parties stipulation,it would determine only three issues whether the city cause of action pertaining to the status of nextg as a telephone corporation was properly dismissed whether the commission should certify the environmental document prepared for the project proposed by nextg and whether the commission should approve the project proposed by nextg.
first,with regard to the question of whether nextg was a telephone corporation,the commission affirmed the prior joint ruling as to both its reasoning and its result.we hold that nextg is now,and has been continuously since we granted its first certificate of public convenience and necessity,a telephone corporation within the meaning of the public utilities code.we necessarily determined this issue when we granted each certificate as well stated in the joint ruling that we affirm today,the plain language of the statutory definition of telephone line is sufficiently broad to include facilities and equipment installed by carriers in connection with or to facilitate both wireless and landline telecommunications services.the plain language also suggests the legislature intended to include a broad range of technologies within the definition of telephone line.finally,the commission noted that in other proceedings it had made clear that all competitive local exchange carriers and interexchange carriers of which nextg is an example are telephone corporations.
second,the commission approved the negative declaration prepared in connection with nextg proposed project.the commission rejected the city argument that violation of its local ordinances compelled a different result under the commission ceqa analysis.the commission stated,what does or does not constitute a significant effect on the environment is defined under ceqa and the ceqa guidelines.the city has not shown that ceqa law,or any judicial interpretation of the law,compels the finding that inconsistency with local ordinances is,in itself,a significant environmental effect.our independent judgment and analysis confirms that nextg project will not have such an effect.the commission added,in adopting the final negative declaration,we do not make any determination as to the validity of the city ordinances,nor as to the compliance of nextg project with these ordinances.moreover,we do not purport to these ordinances.the consequence of any beyond what we have concluded above with respect to ceqa is a subject for another day,and another forum.
third,the commission approved nextg application and authorized nextg to construct its project.in doing so,the commission concluded the project would not have a significant impact on the environment,and that the project was consistent with,and authorized by,the previously issued certificates of public necessity and convenience.our approval does not relieve nextg from obtaining such local permits or complying with such other requirements as may lawfully be imposed under section.
the commission added that the scoping memorandum had correctly rejected the city request for an evidentiary hearing.there are no material factual issues in dispute rather,the controversy concerns the legal consequences that follow from facts that,in all material respects,are not disputed.
the january rehearing decision 
in november,the city applied for rehearing of the october initial decision.the city raised four contentions the puc lacked jurisdiction to determine that nextg is entitled to use public rights of way pursuant to section nextg is a wireless carrier rather than a telephone corporation and therefore ineligible to utilize public rights of way pursuant to section nextg project violates the undergrounding ordinance and therefore should be prohibited because nextg was ordered in the july decision to comply with local land use requirements and the negative declaration should be rejected because a fair argument can be made that the project will have a significant environmental impact.
in response,the commission issued the january rehearing decision,which rejected each of the city contentions but modified the october initial decision to insert additional analysis.as to the first two arguments,the commission repeated its prior analysis with regard to the statutory definition of telephone corporation and the applicability of this definition throughout the public utilities code.the commission added that it has the exclusive jurisdiction to grant certificates of public convenience and necessity to public utilities,including telephone corporations.the commission rejected the argument that it lacked jurisdiction to classify an entity as a telephone corporation entitled to the benefits of section.the commission explained that its decision was consistent with prior puc practice,in that nextg may use the certificate of public convenience and necessity to enforce its rights pursuant to section.if the local government body refuses to grant access in accordance with the commission order,nextg recourse shall be to file a lawsuit in the appropriate court of civil jurisdiction seeking resolution of the dispute over access citation,which nextg has done.the decision in this case does not order the city to grant access to nextg rather it merely confirms the commission prior certificate decisions.
the fourth argument pertaining to compliance with ceqa is outside our purview.the commission rejected the argument,concluding the city failed to support a fair argument that the nextg project may have a significant environmental impact.
with regard to nextg third argument,project approval was in conflict with the city ordinances,the commission switched course from its initial decision.the commission ordered two modifications to the october initial decision,inserting analysis and a conclusion of law stating that the city ordinances are preempted to the extent they are inconsistent with the commission approval of the project.we quote the relevant analysis in detail.although the city is correct that a portion of the nextg construction is inconsistent with its undergrounding ordinance,the approved installation is still within the scope of nextg certificate of public convenience and necessity.the october initial decision does not explicitly discuss whether the nextg installation is consistent with the city undergrounding ordinance.the city and nextg stipulated that the proceeding will not adjudicate the validity of the undergrounding ordinance.citation.however,at the same time,the parties stipulated that the proceeding should determine whether the commission should certify the environmental document for the project as well as whether the commission should approve the project.citation.some consideration of the ordinance is necessarily within the scope of our approval and review of the nextg installation because ceqa contemplates that an agency will review applicable land use regulations.citation.although the city does not mention the negative declaration discussion in its current challenge,the negative declaration,following the ceqa guidelines checklist,considers the undergrounding ordinance and determines that the project is consistent with the ordinance.
under the plain terms of the stipulation,the commission necessarily must evaluate the validity of the ordinance to the limited extent that it impacts the commission review and approval of the project.moreover,in its application for rehearing citation,as well as in its comments during the proceeding,the city has squarely raised the issue of whether its undergrounding ordinance conflicts with nextg project.the city is correct that a small portion of the nextg installation is inconsistent with its undergrounding ordinance.this is contrary to the conclusion reached in the negative declaration.the undergrounding ordinance forbids new poles,with certain exceptions not applicable here.although there have been questions about whether the city has applied the ordinance consistently,it is clear that the literal wording of the ordinance does not permit nextg installation.at the same time,because utilities may need to construct poles to house antennas,the statewide interest in public utility service preempts this ordinance in the event of a conflict,as is the case here.italics added.
although the october initial decision does not specifically rule on the undergrounding ordinance,it adopts the negative declaration,and therefore,the negative declaration findings.we will modify the negative declaration to correct the statements that the project is consistent with the city ordinance.although there is indeed a conflict with the ordinance,this does not impact the viability of the project because utility regulation is a statewide concern,and the commission has the authority to preempt local ordinances that are inconsistent with its regulation.citation.in addition,we will modify the language in the decision to clarify that we are preempting the city to the extent that the ordinance is inconsistent with the nextg project the commission is now approving.the decision added that because the commission provided a full review of the project rather than expedited ceqa review with the energy division,nextg was authorized under its certificate of public convenience and necessity to complete its project.
the city petitions for writ of review 
on february,the city petitioned this court for a writ of review of the october initial decision and the january rehearing decision.on june,this court ruled that the petition violated public resources code section to the extent it raised ceqa issues.we also,however,granted the city request for leave to file an amended petition limited to issues.
subsequent proceedings in state court action 
in february,the trial court in the state court action denied the parties respective motions for summary judgment summary adjudication,except the court granted nextg motion for summary adjudication on its third cause of action.the trial court held it was bound by the puc interpretation of telephone corporation,which could only be reviewed by the court of appeal or the california supreme court.the court order did not discuss preemption of the local ordinances.thus,the state court action was ready to proceed to trial on the other two causes of action pertaining to whether the city undergrounding ordinance or wireless ordinance could be enforced despite nextg asserted right under section to use the public right of way.
on april,the city petitioned this court for a writ of mandate,prohibition,or other extraordinary relief with regard to the state court action.the city argued a writ and stay of the trial were necessary to stop a trial on the preemption issues,the effect of sections and on the local ordinances in the state court action because the premise of such a trial that nextg was a telephone corporation entitled to utilize the public right of way was incorrect.upon notice from nextg that it did not oppose a stay of the state court action,this court ordered the trial stayed until further order of this court.

is nextg a telephone corporation 
a telephone corporation is a p ublic utility subject to regulation by the puc,subds.a,b see cal,art.xii.the puc has concluded that nextg is a telephone corporation pursuant to various sections of the public utilities code.see.in two earlier proceedings,the commission issued certificates of public necessity to nextg,impliedly ruling that nextg was a telephone corporation.no telephone corporation shall begin the construction of a line or of any extension thereof,without having first obtained from the commission a certificate that the present or future public convenience and necessity require or will require such construction see gte mobilnet of california limited partnership city and county of san francisco d,gte mobilnet proof of authorization to use public rights of way typically takes the form of a certificate of public convenience and necessity issued by the puc.in the proceeding now before this court,the commission directly revisited its implied determinations and found they were correct under the plain language of the public utilities code.
the city takes issue with the puc determination that nextg is a telephone corporation,entitled to construct its telephone lines on public rights of way.in this petition,the city attacks the puc conclusion from four different angles the correctness of the commission statutory interpretation of the phrase telephone corporation,particularly as such term is used in section the commission jurisdiction to classify a purported wireless carrier as a telephone corporation,in light of federal law pertaining to wireless telecommunications providers the sufficiency of the findings and the evidence to support classifying nextg as a telephone corporation and the lack of an evidentiary hearing to decide the question of whether nextg was a telephone corporation.
we begin with an examination of the relevant statutory provisions.telephone corporation includes every corporation or person owning,controlling,operating,or managing any telephone line for compensation within this state,subd.a.telephone line includes all conduits,ducts,poles,wires,cables,instruments,and appliances,and all other real estate,fixtures,and personal property owned,controlled,operated,or managed in connection with or to facilitate communication by telephone,whether such communication is had with or without the use of transmission wires,italics added.the word telephone is not defined in the public utilities code,but telephony is generally understood as a communication by speaking as well as listening at a distance.coml.communications public util.com.cal d.the plain language of sections and,subdivision a,suggests that the legislature intended to define the term telephone corporation broadly,without regard to the particular manner by which users of telephones are put into communication.see coml.communications public util,supra,cal d at in holding that mobile communication systems using radio technology to communicate with individuals in vehicles were telephone lines,observed that t he exact form or shape of the transmitter and the receiver or the medium over which the communication can be effected is not prescribed by law.
telephone corporation does not include any of the following any hospital,motel,or similar place of temporary accommodation owning or operating message switching or billing equipment solely for the purpose of reselling services provided by a telephone corporation to its patients or guests.any paging service utilizing facilities that are licensed by the federal communications commission,including,but not limited to,personal communications services described in the code of federal regulations,subd.b see stats,ch,adding italicized portion to,subd.b.these textual exclusions within section illustrate that the legislature despite its demonstrated capability has not seen fit to explicitly exclude companies providing mobile or wireless telephone service from the definition of telephone corporation.
according to the city,the legislature did just that in,by adding section,subdivision d,to the public utilities code.stats,ch.but all this statute does is define a type of service mobile telephony service means commercially available interconnected mobile phone services that provide access to the public switched telephone network pstn via mobile communication devices employing radiowave technology to transmit calls,including cellular radiotelephone,broadband personal communications services pcs,and digital specialized mobile radio smr,subd.d.section,subdivision d,does not establish or define any new type of entity.the public utilities code contemplates that telephone corporations may provide mobile telephony services.see,subd.a the commission shall require every telephone corporation furnishing mobile telephony service,as defined in section,to establish a pricing system made available to subscribers,subd.b the commission shall request that the federal communications commission grant authority for the commission to order telephone corporations to assign telephone numbers dedicated to mobile telephony service and mobile data service,as defined in section,to a separate area code.
the importance in this case of designating nextg as a telephone corporation is that telephone corporations are entitled under state law to utilize public rights of way for the deployment of their telephone lines under section telegraph or telephone corporations may construct lines of telegraph or telephone lines along and upon any public road or highway,along or across any of the waters or lands within this state,and may erect poles,posts,piers,or abutments for supporting the insulators,wires,and other necessary fixtures of their lines,in such manner and at such points as not to incommode the public use of the road or highway or interrupt the navigation of the waters,italics added.it has been uniformly held that section is a continuing offer extended to telegraph and telephone companies to use the highways so long as telegraph or telephone service is continued.citation.the company accepts this franchise by the construction and maintenance of lines and thereby assumes the duty to furnish proper and adequate communication service to the public.citation.thus,in return for the privileges granted under this section,the state is assured of a continuing benefit.the state and the company enter into a binding agreement supported by valid consideration.if the company fails to render the service,the franchise terminates.citation.moreover,the statute has consistently withstood various constitutional attacks.anderson time warner telecom of california th,citing county of southern cal.cal d.cities may not charge telephone corporations with franchise fees for the privilege of installing telephone lines in public rights of way.williams communications city of riverside th.
the preceding analysis indicates that the puc interpretation of sections,and was correct,even disregarding any deference owed to the commission the plain language of the pertinent statutory provisions leads to only one reasonable conclusion the definition of telephone corporations for purposes of section is not limited to those entities utilizing technology invented at the time section or its prior iterations in the civil code were enacted.if an entity owns,controls,operates,or manages telephone lines in connection with telephone communication,the entity is a telephone corporation under section.see gte mobilnet,supra,d at wireless carriers are included in the definition of telephone corporation in cox communications pcs,city of san marcos d,fn.applies to any telephone corporation that provides wireless or landline services.
in light of the plain language of the public utilities code,the city construction of the relevant statutes,though couched in terms of arcane legislative history,really amounts to a policy argument,modern mobile phone companies and companies like nextg that partner with mobile phone companies do not need the public right of way to facilitate their infrastructure as landline telephone providers did in their heyday.this argument,however,is better addressed to the legislature.
the commission also made sufficient findings and had sufficient evidence before it to conclude that nextg was a telephone corporation.the commission found,and the city does not dispute,that nextg builds and owns fiber optic networks,on which nextg sells capacity for telecommunications services provided by other carriers that serve customers.this finding supports the commission conclusion that nextg is a t elephone corporation in the business of owning,controlling,operating,or managing telephone line s for compensation within this state,subd.a.nextg telephone lines are used in connection with or to facilitate communication by telephone,whether such communication is had with or without the use of transmission wires,italics added.it simply does not matter that nextg telephone lines will be used to provide wireless services to metropcs individual customers.nor does it matter that nextg does not directly service individual telephone customers but instead provides services to wireless companies.see williams communications city of riverside,supra,th at interexchange carrier entitled to benefits of.no evidentiary hearing beyond the process provided by the commission was necessary for the commission to make its findings because the city was not contesting any facts relevant to the classification of nextg as a telephone corporation.
finally,the city contends that federal law preempts the commission from regulating nextg.federal law prohibits state and local governments from regulating the entry of or the rates charged by any commercial mobile service or any private mobile service,but does not prohibit a state from regulating the other terms and conditions of commercial mobile services.c a.in deference to federal law,the puc does not issue certificates of public necessity and convenience to wireless carriers because federal law preempt s its authority to regulate the entry of wireless carriers.gte mobilnet,supra,d at.
the commission specifically found in the october initial decision that nextg was not a wireless carrier because nextg builds and owns fiber optic networks on which nextg sells capacity for telecommunications service provided by other carriers that service customers.the commission also cited its prior issuance of certificates of public convenience and necessity to nextg as proof that nextg was not a wireless carrier.the puc therefore distinguishes between wireless carriers,commercial mobile services or private mobile services under federal law and a carrier carrier like nextg.
the city condemns this distinction,but offers no legal authority or reasoned analysis for the proposition that nextg is a commercial mobile service or private mobile service,defined terms under the relevant federal statute the city does not refer to these definitions in its briefs,does not cite to cases or regulatory decisions applying these definitions,and does not make a reasoned argument for why nextg falls within these definitions.the city therefore waives this argument.see cahill san diego gas th,appellate briefs must be supported by reasoned argument and citations to authority or else issue is waived.absent clear authority for doing so,we are not inclined to upend the commission longstanding practice of distinguishing between firms like nextg and wireless providers.
because we agree with the commission interpretation and application of the relevant statutes on the merits,we need not address the various alleged procedural bars to our review that are asserted by the commission and nextg,that prior final commission decisions preclude the city petition or that some of the specific arguments raised in the petition were not properly raised at the puc in the petition for rehearing.
