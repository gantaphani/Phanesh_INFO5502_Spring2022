james knott,and the riverdale power electric knott petition for review of three orders by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc.the orders assert mandatory licensing authority over knott hydroelectric project,require him to install gages to measure stream flow at the project,and direct him to submit project design revisions on microfiche cards.knott alleges that ferc improperly asserted jurisdiction over the project,that the required compliance would effect a fifth amendment taking of his property,that ferc improperly denied him an evidentiary hearing,and that ferc unreasonably ordered gages and microfiche cards.for the reasons stated,we deny knott petition for review.
factual and procedural background 
originally built in the century,knott riverdale mills project project is located on the blackstone river in worcester county,massachusetts.the project includes a,dam,an water impoundment,and a generator located within a mill building.knott purchased the project,which had been abandoned since,in.through a separate entity,the riverdale mills corporation,knott uses the hydropower generated by the project to produce steel wire for use in lobster traps.
the federal power act fpa,grants ferc two types of licensing authority over hydroelectric projects.section e of the act authorizes ferc to grant voluntary licenses for any project that develops power in any body of water over which congress has commerce clause authority.e.section b requires the mandatory licensing of projects located on any of the navigable waters of the united states or located on a body of water over which congress has commerce clause authority where project construction occurred on or after august,and the project affects the interests of interstate or foreign commerce.
in,knott applied for and received a voluntary license to operate the project,subject to numerous conditions.because knott received a voluntary license,ferc had no occasion to determine whether it had mandatory licensing jurisdiction over the project.
in early ferc received letters alleging extreme fluctuations in the blackstone river below the project and noted a concern by state agencies and conservation groups that the fluctuations might be the result of knott failure to operate his project to allow a continuous stream flow.in a series of letters ferc repeatedly requested stream flow gaging records,and knott repeatedly responded that he had no obligation to install stream flow gages.in december ferc issued a compliance order requiring knott to file a plan for installing stream flow gages at the project,in accordance with article of knott license knott filed a request for rehearing,which ferc denied on may.
in november knott filed for ferc approval to install an unrelated flood flow modular gate.ferc approved the proposal,but required knott to file revised drawings of the gate on aperture cards x on silver or gelatin mm microfilm.knott sought rehearing of this requirement,which ferc denied.ferc noted that its regulations require exhibit drawings to be microfilmed onto aperture cards,that aperture cards provide an inexpensive and durable information medium,and that some of knott paper drawings were inaccurate.knott timely petitioned for review.
during the course of his earlier proceedings,knott contended that ferc had no jurisdiction over the project and,thus,could not compel him to comply with either his license or agency regulations.in response,ferc instituted a proceeding to reexamine the basis for its jurisdiction.in november ferc staff prepared a supplemental study of the navigability of the blackstone river.the study described in detail a expedition in september,organized by local businesses,environmental groups,and governmental bodies,in which approximately thirty canoeists traversed the river from worcester,past the project,into rhode island and then narragansett bay.based on this expedition,which was accomplished with a minimum of overland transport,or portages,ferc staff concluded that the blackstone river is suitable for interstate use by recreational boaters and is thus a navigable waterway within the meaning of fpa.see defining navigable waters.ferc therefore concluded that the project is subject to its mandatory licensing authority,and ordered knott to abide by its orders and all license terms and conditions.
knott filed a request for rehearing,which ferc denied.ferc upheld the finding of the staff navigability report and also found,as a separate basis for jurisdiction,that the blackstone river has an effect on interstate commerce the project has an effect on interstate commerce and project construction had occurred since august because knott had substantially rebuilt project facilities and returned them to operation after the project had been abandoned in.ferc additionally rejected knott takings and due process arguments.knott timely petitioned for review.

ii.mandatory jurisdiction 
knott challenges both grounds upon which ferc based its finding of mandatory jurisdiction that the blackstone river is navigable and that knott reconstruction work after a period of abandonment sufficed to confer jurisdiction.because we hold that ferc properly based its jurisdiction on a finding of navigability,we do not reach the issues of abandonment and reconstruction.
the fpa,adopted in,defines navigable waters as 
t hose parts of streams or other bodies of water over which congress has commerce clause jurisdiction and which either in their natural or improved condition notwithstanding interruptions between the navigable parts of such streams or waters by falls,shallows,or rapids compelling land carriage,are used or suitable for use for the transportation of persons or property in interstate or foreign commerce,including therein all such interrupting falls,shallows,or rapids.
emphases added.based on this definition,and case law interpreting it,ferc correctly found that the september canoe trip demonstrated that the blackstone river and project site were suitable for use in interstate commerce notwithstanding the shallows compelling land carriage.
knott first argues that ferc authority must be limited to waterways used for actual,ongoing interstate commerce,not hypothetical possibilities of unrealized commerce.this argument is unavailing.the statutory language applies to waters in use or suitable for use for personal transportation,notwithstanding interruptions.id.the supreme court has held that the absence of actual commercial traffic does not bar a conclusion of navigability where personal or private use by boats demonstrates the availability of the stream for the simpler types of commercial navigation.united states appalachian power.see also united states utah.the extent of existing commerce is not the test.irregular canoe trips may support a finding of navigability.see fpl energy me.hydro llc ferc,upholding a determination of navigability based on three canoe trips made for the purpose of litigation.nor does the fact that the blackstone river required portages defeat a finding of navigability.the statute explicitly contemplates that waterways may be naviga
