in this appeal we were originally asked to review two orders of the georgia public service commission the gpsc,which interpreted the contract between bellsouth telecommunications,bellsouth and mcimetro access transmission services,mcimetro,and the contract between bellsouth and worldcom technologies,worldcom.both contracts were interconnection agreements mandated by the federal telecommunications act of,pub,stat.ftca.the gpsc was asked to interpret the meanings of provisions in each contract which established reciprocal compensation rates for local telephone traffic bellsouth claimed that calls made to internet service providers isps could not be considered local traffic subject to reciprocal compensation under the contracts.mcimetro and worldcom both claimed that such calls were local and therefore subject to reciprocal compensation.they demanded payment under their respective contracts and sought relief before the gpsc.the gpsc determined that calls to isps were local traffic under the contracts and thus reciprocal compensation must be paid by bellsouth.bellsouth then commenced an action in the district court,asserting that the gpsc decision was contrary to federal law and claiming that the district court had jurisdiction under e and.the district court affirmed the gpsc order and bellsouth appealed.a split panel of this court did not reach the merits of the appeal,reversing the district court order on the grounds that there was no statutory authority for the gpsc to interpret and enforce these interconnection agreements in the first instance.
a majority of the judges in active service granted the petition for rehearing en banc filed by mcimetro access transmission services and worldcom technologies and vacated the panel opinion in this case.we now address,en banc,the appropriateness of the gpsc order and the extent of federal jurisdiction over challenges to that order.
discussion 
to address the natural monopoly in place in the telecommunications industry and promote competition in local telephone service,congress passed the ftca in.pub,stat.its regulatory scheme was designed to counteract the deterrence of competition inherent in the high,fixed initial cost of telephone service and the need for all customers to interconnect with one another.thus,in order to open intrastate telephone markets to competition,it required incumbent local exchange carriers ilecs,such as bellsouth,to share access to loops and exchanges with competing lecs clecs,like mcimetro and worldcom.a the ftca further required ilecs and clecs that are sharing resources to establish reciprocal compensation arrangements for the transport and termination of telecommunications.b these agreements were to be submitted for approval or rejection to the state public service commission and,in making this determination,the commissions were to consider several specific factors.e provides 
e approval by state commission.
approval required.
any interconnection agreement adopted by negotiation or arbitration shall be submitted for approval to the state commission.a state commission to which an agreement is submitted shall approve or reject the agreement,with written findings as to any deficiencies.
grounds for rejection.
the state commission may only reject 
a an agreement or any portion thereof adopted by negotiation under subsection a of this section if it finds that 
i the agreement or portion thereof discriminates against a telecommunications carrier not a party to the agreement or 
ii the implementation of such agreement or portion is not consistent with the public interest,convenience,and necessity or 
b an agreement or any portion thereof adopted by arbitration under subsection b if it finds that the agreement does not meet the requirements of section,including the regulations prescribed by the commission pursuant to section,or the standards set forth in subsection d of this section.
preservation of authority.
notwithstanding paragraph,but subject to section usc,nothing in this section shall prohibit a state commission from establishing or enforcing other requirements of state law in its review of an agreement,including requiring compliance with intrastate telecommunications service quality standards or requirements.
schedule for decision.
if the state commission does not act to approve or reject the agreement within days after submission by the parties of an agreement adopted by negotiation under a,or within days after submission by the parties of an agreement adopted by arbitration under b,the agreement shall be deemed approved.no state court shall have jurisdiction to review the action of a state commission in approving or rejecting an agreement under this section.
commission to act if state will not act.
if a state commission fails to act to carry out its responsibility under this section in any proceeding or other matter under this section,then the commission shall issue an order preempting the state commission jurisdiction of that proceeding or matter within days after being notified or taking notice of such failure,and shall assume the responsibility of the state commission under this section with respect to the proceeding or matter and act for the state commission.
review of state commission actions.
in a case in which a state fails to act as described in paragraph,the proceeding by the commission under such paragraph and any judicial review of the commission actions shall be the exclusive remedies for a state commission failure to act.in any case in which a state commission makes a determination under this section,any party aggrieved by such determination may bring an action in an appropriate federal district court to determine whether the agreement or statement meets the requirements of and this section.
while expressly gives state commissions authority to approve or reject interconnection agreements,the statute does not specifically say that this empowerment includes the interpretation and enforcement of interconnection agreements after their initial approval.we agree with all the parties before us,however,that a common sense reading of the statute leads to the conclusion that the authority to approve or reject agreements carries with it the authority to interpret agreements that have already been approved.we find further support for this conclusion in the recent decision of the supreme court in verizon,psc,d,in the decisions of all other circuit courts to have considered the question,and in the determination of the federal communications commission,fcc,which is entitled to deference in the interpretation of the pertinent statute.see in re starpower,at,wl.
the verizon case involved a public service commission order like the one before us that had resolved the question of whether calls made to an isp could be considered local calls subject to reciprocal compensation pursuant to the interconnection agreement of the parties.while the procedural posture of verizon differs from that of the case at bar,the verizon case arose from a set of facts identical to those here.in verizon,worldcom and verizon had negotiated an interconnection agreement that had been approved by the maryland public service commission the mpsc.several months after the interconnection agreement had been approved,verizon refused to pay worldcom for calls made to isps.worldcom filed a complaint with the mpsc.the mpsc determined that,as a matter of state contract law,isp calls were compensable local traffic under the interconnection agreement between verizon and worldcom.verizon sued the mpsc in federal district court,asserting jurisdiction under e and.verizon claimed that the mpsc order violated the ftca and a ruling of the fcc.the district court dismissed the action without reaching the merits,holding that neither the ftca nor usc gave it jurisdiction over verizon claims against private defendants.the fourth circuit affirmed.the supreme court granted certiorari,addressing the question of whether federal district courts have jurisdiction over a telecommunication carrier claim that the order of a state utility commission requiring reciprocal compensation for telephone calls to isps violates federal law.verizon.at.the court reversed the fourth circuit and held that the federal district court had jurisdiction under to review the state utility commission interpretation of the interconnection agreement at issue.id.at.because it found jurisdiction under,the court did not decide whether there was also jurisdiction under e.the determination that the district court did have jurisdiction to review the mpsc order interpreting the interconnection agreement assumed that the state utility commission had the authority to interpret the interconnection agreements in the first instance.the court noted that the parties dispute whether it is in fact federal or state law that confers this authority,but no party contends that the commission lacked jurisdiction to interpret and enforce the agreement.id.at.
other circuits have expressly recognized state commissions authority to interpret the interconnection agreements at issue.in bell atl,mci worldcom,cir,the court noted that the critical question is not whether state commissions have authority to interpret and enforce interconnection believe they whether these decisions are to be reviewed by state courts or federal courts.as noted,the fourth circuit determination that federal courts did not have authority to hear challenges to the decision of the mpsc was vacated by the supreme court in verizon.at.the fifth circuit,in southwestern bell.puc,cir,noted that the act grant to the state commissions of plenary authority to approve or disapprove these interconnection agreements necessarily carries with it the authority to interpret and enforce the provisions of agreements that state commissions have approved.in southwestern bell.brooks fiber communs.of,cir,the court deferred to the fcc conclusion that state commissions have the authority to interpret and enforce interconnection agreements.in puerto rico.telecommunications regulatory,cir,the court held that there was no jurisdiction over a dispute between an ilec and a clec regarding whether charges applied to certain cellular calls but did not question the state commission authority to resolve the dispute in illinois bell.worldcom,cir,the court stated that,in deciding a dispute between a clec and an ilec over whether isp calls were local traffic,the state commission was doing what it is charged with doing in the act and in the fcc ruling.it was determining what the parties intended under the agreements.finally,in iowa util.bd,cir,the court commented that state commissions retain the primary authority to enforce the substantive terms of the agreements made pursuant to sections and.iowa utilities was reversed in part on other grounds by iowa utils,d,which held that,under the ftca,the fcc has authority to design a pricing methodology and to promulgate rules regarding various other matters.
no court has held or suggested that a state commission does not have the authority to interpret and enforce interconnection agreements after they have been approved.moreover,the entity charged with the implementation of the ftca,the fcc,has clearly stated that state commissions have the authority to interpret interconnection agreements.in re starpower.in starpower,the fcc held that a determination of whether isp traffic was subject to reciprocal compensation under an interconnection agreement was a determination that a state commission was required to make under e.id.in that case,starpower communications had asked the fcc to preempt the jurisdiction of the virginia state corporation commission virginia commission to resolve disputes over interconnection agreements between starpower and bell atlantic virginia and gte south.id.as in this case,the dispute in starpower was over whether calls to isps were local calls.id.starpower filed petitions with the virginia commission against bell atlantic and gte,seeking compensation under the interconnection agreements for calls made to isps.id.the virginia commission declined jurisdiction in both of starpower actions.id.starpower then petitioned the fcc to hear its complaint.id.because the virginia state corporation commission had failed to make a determination concerning the dispute over isp traffic,the fcc assumed jurisdiction of the dispute id.at.in determining whether to take jurisdiction,the fcc stated that it must first determine whether a dispute arising from interconnection agreements and seeking interpretation and enforcement of those agreements is within the states responsibility under section.id.at.the fcc decided that interpretation and enforcement of interconnection agreements were responsibilities of the states under section,citing southwestern bell,and illinois bell,for support.id 
under chevron,natural resources defense council,d,agency determinations are entitled to due deference if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the issue at hand and the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at.a court may not substitute its own construction of a statutory provision for a reasonable interpretation made by the administrator of an agency.id.at.although the fcc ruling in starpower relied on federal court decisions that were based on a vacated fcc ruling,the fcc also pointed out,approvingly,that the courts had based their decisions on a recognition that due to its role in the approval process,a state commission is to address disputes arising from interconnection agreements.starpower,fcc rcd.at.this observation of the state commissions suitability for the interpretation of interconnection agreements is not unreasonable,nor is it contrary to the language of the statute 
moreover,the language of persuades us that in granting to the public service commissions the power to approve or reject interconnection agreements,congress intended to include the power to interpret and enforce in the first instance and to subject their determination to challenges in the federal courts.section e gives federal courts jurisdiction to review determinations made by state commissions.e.in contrast,e abrogates state court jurisdiction to review the action of a state commission in approving or rejecting an agreement under this section.e.the use of the word determination in e rather than a specific reference to the approval or rejection of agreements leads us to believe that congress did not intend to limit state commissions authority to the mere approval and rejection of agreements.see russello united states,d where congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same act,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.quoting united states wong kim bo,cir.it is reasonable to read the grant of authority in e as encompassing the interpretation of agreements,not just their approval or rejection.
given the extensive federal regulation of interconnection agreements and the role state commissions play in their formation,it would be illogical to say that the gpsc interest in an interconnection agreement is extinguished as soon as the agreement is approved,and that the agreement should thereafter be treated as any other contract at least one circuit has described state commissions as deputized federal regulator s authorized to exercise regulatory power and ensure compliance with federal law as set out in the ftca.mci telcoms.illinois bell,cir.interconnection agreements are tools through which the ftca enforced.thus,it is consistent with the ftca to have state commissions interpret contracts and subject their interpretations to federal review in the district courts.
additionally,the supreme court has specifically held in verizon that federal courts have jurisdiction under to hear challenges to the orders of state public service commissions interpreting interconnection agreements exactly like the one before us.at.section provides that the district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the constitution,laws,or treaties of the united states.there is no question that the controversy before us arises under the ftca and that all of the public service commission decisions are permeated by federal questions.for example,e a ii requires public service commissions to interpret negotiated agreements prior to approval to ensure that they are consistent with the public interest,convenience,and necessity.e a ii.after an agreement is approved,each party to the agreement is required to make available any interconnection,service,or network element provided under the agreement to any other requesting telecommunications carrier upon the same terms and conditions as those provided in the agreement.i.
the resolution of each issue need not depend completely upon an interpretation of federal law.for purposes of jurisdiction,all that is required is that there be an arguable claim arising under federal law.as the supreme court said in verizon 
it is firmly established in our cases that the absence of a valid as opposed to arguable cause of action does not implicate jurisdiction,the court statutory or constitutional power to adjudicate the case.as we have said,the district court has jurisdiction if the right of the petitioners to recover under their complaint will be sustained if the constitution and laws of the united states are given one construction and will be defeated if they are given another,unless the claim clearly appears to be immaterial and made solely for the purpose of obtaining jurisdiction or where such claim is wholly insubstantial and frivolous.here,resolution of verizon claim turns on whether the act,or an fcc ruling issued thereunder,precludes the commission from ordering payment of reciprocal compensation,and there is no suggestion that verizon claim is immaterial or wholly insubstantial and frivolous.
in this case,as in verizon,the complaint alleges that the gpsc determination is inconsistent with the ftca and its implementing regulations and also argues that the gpsc erred in its interpretation of the contracts.this involves the same federal question presented in verizon.federal courts must resolve the question of whether a public service commission order violates federal law and any other federal question as well as any related issue of state law under its pendent state jurisdiction.thus,pursuant to verizon,the georgia public service commission had the authority to interpret and enforce the interconnection agreements that it had approved in the first instance and the federal district court had jurisdiction over this case pursuant to.moreover,through the ftca,congress conferred upon the public service commissions the power to interpret and enforce the interconnection agreements mandated by the ftca and federal district courts have jurisdiction over challenges to these interpretations and enforcement orders.
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we conclude that the georgia public service commission has the authority under federal law to interpret and enforce the interconnection agreements at issue between the parties and that its determination is subject to review in the federal courts.we refer all other issues to a panel of this court and instruct the clerk of the court to assign this case to the next available oral argument panel to resolve the merits of this case.
i concur in the judgment of the court and in the opinion by judge barkett,except that i decide nothing about jurisdiction under e.
i concur and join most of the opinion of judge barkett.the parties were asked to brief two issues for the en banc court first,does federal law give state commissions,like the georgia public service commission gpsc,the authority to resolve disputes between telecommunications carriers regarding the interpretation of the contractual terms of an interconnection agreement that has already been approved pursuant to e and,second,if not,does georgia law give the gpsc this authority.
with respect to the first issue,i agree with judge barkett that the most plausible reading of the federal statute is that it contemplates that gpsc not only has the expressly stated authority to approve or reject the interconnection agreement at issue here,but also has the implicit authority to interpret the agreement after it has already been approved.i agree with judge barkett that it would make little sense to grant the obvious authority to interpret the agreement in connection with the approval thereof,but then deny the authority to later implement and enforce same and resolve disputes as to the original interpretation.in so holding,we are joining the numerous circuit courts of appeal discussed by judge barkett,and providing appropriate deference to the federal communications commission fcc.see in re starpower communications,fcc red,wl.having thus resolved that gpsc has authority pursuant to the federal statute,i need not address the second issue briefed by the parties en banc,whether or not such authority might also have been provided by state law.
i also agree with judge barkett that the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to to entertain bellsouth claim in the instant case i agree with judge barkett that bellsouth claim is precisely the same as that presented by verizon,with respect to which the supreme court held that the district court had jurisdiction under.in both cases,the dispute between the parties revolved around whether or not the incumbent local exchange carrier ilec verizon in the supreme court case and bellsouth here was required to pay reciprocal compensation to a competitive local exchange carrier clec with respect to calls to local access numbers of internet service providers isps.in both cases,the interconnection agreement between the two parties was one which had been voluntarily negotiated in both cases,the public service commission had originally approved the interconnection agreement at an earlier time,and the dispute arose later.in both,the dispute was presented to the state agency which rendered its determination resolving the dispute.in both cases,the decision of the public service commission was challenged in federal district court.thus,the dispute at issue in the instant case is factually identical to that in verizon,and the posture of the claim before the district court is the same.
bellsouth claim in the instant case is that the gpsc order is inconsistent with the act and its implementing regulations.bellsouth claim is indistinguishable from that asserted by verizon in the supreme court case.verizon had taken the position that it would no longer pay reciprocal compensation for telephone calls made by verizon customers to the local access numbers of internet providers isps,claiming that isp traffic was not local traffic subject to the reciprocal compensation agreement.id.at.after maryland public service commission ruled against it,verizon filed a complaint in the district court challenging the public service commission order,and claiming that the determination that verizon must pay reciprocal compensation for isp traffic violated the act,and the fcc ruling.id.bellsouth claim is identical.like verizon,bellsouth claims that the gpsc order here,construing isp calls as local and requiring bellsouth to pay reciprocal compensation,violates the act and its implementing regulations.as in verizon,bellsouth relies upon the fcc ruling characterizing such isp traffic as.the instant case being indistinguishable from verizon with respect to the jurisdictional issue,i readily conclude that the district court had original jurisdiction of bellsouth claim pursuant to 
although the jurisdictional issue can begin and end with verizon,it is appropriate to note,as judge barkett does,that jurisdiction requires only an arguable federal claim,that is,one which is not wholly insubstantial and frivolous.a concise summary of bellsouth federal question argument illustrates why the court in verizon found that the claim was not frivolous and that there was jurisdiction.bellsouth several reasons for finding federal question jurisdiction follow.
first,bellsouth points out that the interconnection agreement at issue here was mandated by federal statute.b.
second,the federal statute mandates that it be nondiscriminatory.e a i.this means that the terms of the agreement must be available to all carriers,similar to a tariff.
third,the statute mandates that the terms of the agreement must be consistent with the public interest,convenience and necessity.e a ii.bellsouth implicitly suggests that this provision probably adopts and perhaps federalizes state standards.
fourth,in addition as a practical matter,even a voluntarily negotiated agreement,as here,is cabined by the obvious recognition that the parties to the agreement had to agree within the parameters fixed by the federal standards set out in and.bellsouth reasons that the negotiating parties obviously know that if they do not agree,such standards will be imposed.section b.thus,the parties know that they can not deviate significantly from all of the federally imposed standards.accordingly,bellsouth argues that significant nondiscriminatory and public convenience standards are absolutely mandatory,and that the rest of the federal standards,including the pricing standards of d,are as a practical matter coerced by the federal statute into such agreements.
fifth,and significant in light of the particular matter at isp calls are local telecommunications traffic bellsouth points out that the definition of local telecommunications traffic is set out in regulations promulgated by the fcc.b.bellsouth argues that the construction of that federal definition presents a federal question.
sixth,further with respect to the particular matter at issue,bellsouth argues that the fcc has ruled that isp calls,such as the ones at issue here,are interstate rather than local in nature,and therefore not governed by the reciprocal compensation provision of b.see implementation of the local competition provisions in the telecommunications act of,compensation for traffic,fcc rcd,wl applying an analysis to exclude isp calls from reach of b on theory that they are indeed not local,vacated and remanded by bell atlantic,reinstated on remand by fcc rcd,wl fcc determining that it was authorized under g to carve out isp calls from b reciprocal compensation provision and establish a bill and keep system,remanded by worldcom,remanding because it rejected the fcc reliance on g,but stating that it is likely that the fcc has authority from some other source to elect the system set forth in the remand order.bellsouth notes that the gspc in its consideration of these issues and almost every other court have always looked to the fcc rulings in ascertaining the meaning of such terms of art which obviously fall squarely within the core concerns of the agency expertise.
seventh,the supreme court in verizon,indicated in dicta that e may not be a simple procedural device setting forth federal court jurisdiction to review state commissions decisions,but rather reads like the conferral of a private right of action.at.if a federal statute creates a private cause of action,there would clearly be a federal question.
finally,bellsouth argues that the interconnection agreement at issue here should not be considered an ordinary commercial contract because it really constitutes a kind of federally mandated agreement similar in many ways to a tariff,and points to cases holding that the interpretation of such federally mandated agreements raise issues of federal law.see thurston motor lines,jordan rand,d notwithstanding that the dispute involves a simple contract collection,the duty and obligation to pay grows out of and is dependent upon the federal act mandating the agreement between the parties louisville rice.western union int l data,cir same with respect to a suit to collect payment of a tariff under the communications act of 
considering bellsouth arguments as summarized above,i can not conclude that bellsouth makes a merely frivolous claim that the issue before us presents a federal question.indeed,as explained above,the supreme court in verizon so held.
in sum,i conclude that the gpsc had authority to entertain this case,and that the district court had jurisdiction under to entertain the claim presented by bellsouth like judge barkett,i would refer other issues to a panel.
i concur in judge anderson separate opinion.i write to expand upon the deference this court owes the decisions of the federal communications commission under chevron,natural res.def.counsel,d.
as judge barkett states,agency interpretations of the statutes they are charged with administering are entitled to deference under a analysis.first,if congress has spoken to the precise question at issue,then the unambiguously expressed intent of congress governs.id.at.at.second,if the statute is silent or ambiguous,then the agency interpretation must be given effect so long as it is based on a permissible reading of the statute.id.at.at.fcc has interpreted the telecommunications act to authorize public service commissions to adjudicate disputes under.see in re starpower,at,wl.under chevron,the fcc interpretation is entitled to deference.
at chevron step one,the precise question at issue here has no clear answer in the statutory text.we granted rehearing en banc to answer the following question 
does federal law,specifically and,give state commissions,like the gpsc,the authority to resolve disputes between telecommunications carriers regarding the interpretation of the contractual terms of an interconnection agreement that has already been approved pursuant to e 
no statutory text clearly authorizes or forecloses psc adjudications of disputes.the statute authorizes pscs to approve or reject interconnection agreements submitted to them.e.the statute goes on,however,to refer to determination s under this section.id.e.while it may be possible to cabin these determinations to psc decisions approving or rejecting interconnection agreements,determinations can also be fairly construed to encompass determinations in disputes.congress could have easily avoided this interpretation by replacing the phrase makes a determination under this section in e with the words approves or rejects.in this statutory context,the narrower interpretation is hardly the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.chevron,at.at.because congress did not express its intent so clearly,we must conclude that this statute is ambiguous 
at chevron step two,we must defer to the agency interpretation if it is based upon a permissible reading of the statute.chevron,at.at.there should be little doubt that fcc interpretation in starpower is entitled to deference in this case.see zandford,d finding that an sec interpretation in the context of a formal adjudication is entitled to deference.that conclusion is not disturbed by the recent supreme court cases articulating some limits on chevron deference.see united states mead,d recognizing that t he fair measure of deference to an agency administering its own statute has been understood to vary with circumstances,and courts have looked to the degree of the agency care,its consistency,formality,and relative expertness,and to the persuasiveness of the agency position citations omitted christensen harris county,d declining to defer to an agency interpretation reached without formal adjudication or rulemaking see also edelman lynchburg,d d eference under chevron does not necessarily require an agency exercise of its express rulemaking power citation omitted.
nor is the deference owed to fcc altered by any dissatisfaction we may have with the quality of the agency legal reasoning in starpower.agencies derive their authority to interpret the statutes they thereby bind federal congressional delegation.chevron,at.at by virtue of that congressional delegation,an administrative agency need not cite any cases in reaching its interpretation its interpretation is authoritative because it has been posited by the agency.of course,the agency interpretation can not be procedurally defective,arbitrary or capricious in substance,or manifestly contrary to the statute,mead,at.at,and legal errors in the agency decision might transgress these limits.within these boundaries,however,an agency is entitled to deference simply because it has acted 
it follows,therefore,that deference to an agency interpretation is not automatically by any perceived weakness in judicial opinions on which the agency relies in formulating its interpretation.in this respect,an agency interpretation differs from a judicial precedent.the authoritativeness of an opinion might be diminished if its rationale is undermined a valid agency interpretation,on the other hand,is like a statute,which continues to be authoritative even if the reasons for enacting the statute pass.like a statute,an agency interpretation is entitled to deference because it has been posited by an institution with this case,the fcc,which derives its authority from a congressional delegation.fcc need not have cited any legal precedent in its starpower decision its interpretation of would have been entitled to exactly the same deference from this court 
i do not think fcc starpower decision is based on an impermissible construction of the telecommunications act,so we must defer to the agency interpretation.i concur with the conclusion that the georgia public services commission has the authority to interpret and enforce the interconnection agreements at issue here.
background 
a.the telecommunications act of and reciprocal compensation 
in,congress amended the communications act of,see telecommunications act of act,pub,stat.codified at et,in an effort to deregulate the telecommunications the local exchanges once thought to be entrenched natural monopolies.sections and form the heart of the act.section imposes several obligations on incumbent local exchange carriers ilecs section covers the implementation of these obligations,giving significant authority to states in a regulatory scheme that has been dubbed cooperative federalism.see,philip weiser,chevron,cooperative federalism,and telecommunications reform,vand.section establishes two tracks for interconnecting ilecs and competitive local exchange carriers clecs.one is the voluntary track pursuant to section a and section e if the ilec and clec enter into a voluntary agreement,the state public service commission psc is charged with the task of approving or rejecting the agreement.see e.there are only two available grounds for rejecting the agreement.first,the psc might believe that the agreement is discriminatory and thus unfair to a clec.second,the psc might believe that the agreement is inconsistent with the public interest,convenience,and necessity.see e a.the psc can not impose specific obligations on the parties who reach a voluntary agreement.in other words,the parties are exempt from the specific obligations of section.see a ilecs and clecs may enter into a binding agreement without regard to the standards set forth in subsections b and c of section of this title.another option comes into play if the ilec and clec refuse to come to an agreement the state psc can arbitrate the dispute and,in the process,impose section obligations on the parties.see b agreements arrived at through compulsory arbitration.both determinations by the decision to approve or reject a voluntary agreement and the decision to impose various requirements through reviewable in federal court.see e 
one obligation that all lecs have under section is the duty to form a reciprocal compensation agreement with competing lecs.see b.when a customer of lec a calls a customer of lec b,lec b is entitled to demand compensation for terminating the call of lec a customer.one option the lecs have is to agree to a bill and keep system of compensation whereby each lec considers the total termination costs a wash,thereby eliminating the necessity of a billing arrangement and its concomitant administrative costs.see stuart benjamin,douglas lichtman,and howard shelanski,telecommunications law and policy.another option is for each lec to pay the other for every call termination.in the past,ilecs and clecs have frequently chosen the latter option in their voluntary agreements.this choice caused ilecs trouble when clecs sought as their primary customers certain entities that were net receivers of telephone calls and therefore rarely placed calls to the customers of ilecs.one such customer is the internet service provider isp,whose metaphysical status has caused the fcc tremendous definitional problems.
the fcc eventually weighed in,however,in an effort to fix the perceived asymmetry the fcc made the tentative conclusion that calls are interstate,rather than local,and thus not subject to reciprocal compensation charges.that is,ilecs were not required to pay clecs for the termination of calls.in accordance with the statute,the fcc left open the possibility of private agreements to the contrary.a clec and an ilec could,for example,pay each other for the termination of calls notwithstanding the fcc conclusion that calls are not local.
b.this dispute 
the ilec in this case,bellsouth telecommunications,bellsouth,declined to pay reciprocal compensation fees to various clecs.the georgia public service commission gpsc adjudicated the dispute,holding that the parties were required to compensate each other for the termination of calls bellsouth sought review in federal district court of the gpsc order,asserting federal jurisdiction under and e.the district court rejected bellsouth arguments on the merits,holding that the gpsc order did not violate federal law and the gpsc application of georgia contract law to the voluntary agreement was not an arbitrary and capricious analysis a panel of this court reversed,holding that the gpsc lacked authority under state and federal law to enforce and interpret interconnection agreements and that this authority must rest with state courts rather than pscs.the panel also held that the district court lacked jurisdiction under e.see bellsouth,mcimetro access transmission,cir,vacated,bellsouth,mcimetro access transmission,cir.after the panel decision was rendered,the supreme court issued its decision in verizon.pub.serv.comm of,d,which touches upon many of the issues in this case.
i would hold that the authority of the gpsc under georgia law is a state law issue that this court should decline to reach,and that federal law does not preclude pscs from adjudicating disputes if states make the choice to allocate adjudicative power to their pscs the district court did not have jurisdiction under e for several reasons,not least among which is the fact that the plain language of the statute does not provide for appellate review in the district courts of psc adjudications of disputes the district court did not have jurisdiction under over any of the claims bellsouth now presses on appeal primarily because the posture of the district court was that of an appellate court and not a court of original jurisdiction the district court did have supplemental jurisdiction over bellsouth state law federal element claim pursuant to the supreme court holding in city of chicago int l coll.of surgeons,d,because the district court had original jurisdiction over the claim of federal preemption and on the merits,there is no way the district court could have determined whether the gpsc held a that the parties intended to track evolving standards of federal law or b that the parties intended to pay each other for the termination of traffic notwithstanding federal law.accordingly,i would vacate the decision of the district court and instruct it to remand the case to the gpsc so that it can more clearly articulate the basis for its conclusion,and also so that it can adjudicate the dispute in light of the fcc recent regulations.
ii.section jurisdiction 
is there section jurisdiction if one assumes,arguendo,that the proceeding before the district court was an original proceeding 
there are many claims in this litigation that are allegedly federal in nature.assuming,for the moment,that the litigation before the district court in this case was an original proceeding,it is questionable whether all of bellsouth complaints arise under federal law for purposes of.
federal preemption 
one contention in bellsouth petition for judicial review is that the gpsc order violates the act and the fcc regulations thereunder.although the petition for judicial review is unclear on this point,i think i understand bellsouth to be adopting the position more clearly articulated by the plaintiff in verizon,where the plaintiff sought relief on the ground that such regulation is by a federal statute which,by virtue of the supremacy clause of the constitution,must prevail.verizon.at.an identical cause of action could have been asserted in this case under or under shaw delta air lines,d holding that plaintiffs may assert a private right of action directly under the supremacy clause of the constitution.
on appeal,bellsouth no longer disputes that the gspc could have ordered the parties to pay each other for the termination of calls,and for good reason the fcc has consistently promulgated regulations,consistent with the act affinity for voluntary agreements,that enable ilecs and clecs to enter into reciprocal compensation agreements on the subject of traffic notwithstanding any federal regulations that might deem traffic interstate as a matter of law.in the fcc first and isp ruling,for example,the fcc was careful to note that parties may voluntarily include this traffic within the scope of their interconnection agreements as those agreements are interpreted and enforced by state commissions.implementation of the local competition provisions in the telecomms.act of intercarrier compensation for traffic,at,wl.the fcc concluded,nothing in this declaratory ruling,therefore,necessarily should be construed to question any determination a state commission has made,or may make in the future,that parties have agreed to treat traffic as local traffic under existing interconnection agreements.id.on remand from the circuit,the fcc reached an identical conclusion.see implementation of the local competition provisions in the telecomms.act of intercarrier compensation for traffic,at,wl the interim compensation regime we establish here does not alter existing contractual obligations,except to the extent that parties are entitled to invoke contractual provisions.this order does not preempt any state commission decision regarding compensation for traffic for the period prior to the effective date of the interim regime we adopt here.since the gpsc conclusion that bellsouth owed the clecs reciprocal compensation fees was based upon its interpretation of the voluntary interconnection agreement,federal law certainly creates no impediment to the gpsc order.indeed,i might be inclined to find that bellsouth claim does not meet the standard for complaints under bell hood,and its progeny.see steel citizens for a better env t,d holding that district courts do not have jurisdiction if the claim clearly appears to be immaterial and made solely for the purpose of obtaining jurisdiction or where such a claim is wholly insubstantial or frivolous.however,the supreme court held that an identical claim in verizon was not immaterial or wholly insubstantial and frivolous,verizon.at,and so this court is obliged to extend bellsouth the same treatment as that received by verizon.
coerced contracts and federal common law 
another argument is that either the rule of decision for all disputes is some sort of federal common law of contracts,or else the disputes arise under federal law even if state law provides the rule of decision because the agreements are coerced by the federal government and they are an integral part of a federal regulatory scheme.therefore,bellsouth argues,all interconnection disputes can wind up in federal court pursuant to.
coerced contracts 
the fact that the interconnection agreements are coerced and made pursuant to a federal regulatory scheme is not enough to make contract,a dispute over performance or to section jurisdiction.if state law is the rule of decision,then ordinary contract claims would not raise a federal issue for district courts to resolve.indeed,one supreme court case has expressly held that a federally compelled contractual provision was not to be construed in federal court under principles of federal law,but rather under state law applied in state courts.see jackson transit auth.local div,amalgamated transit union,d.
many interconnection disputes would raise only state law claims,and any federal ingredient would be so far removed from the issues for judicial resolution that many claims would not even come close to what justice frankfurter called the litigation provoking problem of a federal element in a state law cause of action.see textile workers union of am.lincoln mills of,d frankfurter,dissenting.the only possible theory that bellsouth might invoke is the idea of protective jurisdiction the notion that with regard to subjects concerning which congress has legislative power under article i,it can pass a statute granting federal jurisdiction and that the jurisdictional statute is itself a law of the united states within article iii,even though congress has not enacted any substantive rule of decision and thus state law is to be applied.charles alan wright,arthur miller,edward cooper,federal practice and procedure ed.this theory is inapposite to this discussion,however,because we are positing that the only jurisdictional statute is.the theory of protective jurisdiction applies only within the context of a special jurisdictional statute no one has ever argued that section itself amounts to a grant of jurisdiction to entertain state law claims on particular matters of federal concern.moreover,doubt on the validity of protective jurisdiction was cast by mesa california,d.in that case,the court held that the jurisdictional provision found in a required federal officers to raise a federal defense before removing to federal court.the court refused to take the broader position that even if no federal issue is presented for judicial resolution,congress can enact a statute granting federal courts jurisdiction in order to protect the federal interest at stake.such an interpretation of the statute would,according to the court,raise serious doubt about to the statute constitutionality,because it would implicate the outer boundaries of congress ability to define the scope of federal jurisdiction.mesa,at.at.
federal common law 
if interconnection agreements are to be interpreted under a federal common law of contracts,then all disputes would raise a federal question and thereby satisfy the arising under requirement of.however,there is no compelling reason why federal common law should be the rule of decision in adjudications of disputes between clecs and ilecs.
there is no indication in the act that congress intended the rule of decision to be one of federal common law.the fact that the contracts are coerced is inapposite as the court held in jackson transit,supra,federally compelled contractual provisions are not necessarily to be construed in federal court under principles of federal common law.jackson,at.at.rather,the court held that the contract in that case had to be enforced in state courts under principles of state law.id.
without explicit congressional authorization for the courts to craft rules for interpreting interconnection agreements,state law must be the rule of decision.professor chemerinsky describes the presumption against federal common law 
there long has been a strong presumption against the federal courts fashioning common law to decide cases.the rules of decision act,which was part of the judiciary act of and which remains largely unchanged to this day,states that the laws of the several states,except where the constitution or treaties of the united states or acts of congress otherwise require or provide,shall be regarded as rules of decisions in civil actions in the courts of the united states,in cases where they apply.this law,by its very terms,seems to deny the existence of federal common law the rules of decision act commands that in the absence of positive federal law,federal courts must apply state law.
see erwin chemerinsky,federal jurisdiction,at ed.footnote omitted.
in a narrow category of cases,congress has authorized federal courts to create a body of common law rules.see,textile workers union of am.lincoln mills of,d contract disputes soc y of eng rs united states,d antitrust.even so,the presumption and modern trend is to the contrary.the supreme court,for example,refused to extend its authority to craft substantive rules of antitrust law in a way that would also allow it to make rules governing contribution among antitrust defendants.see,radcliff materials,d.commenting on this case,professor chemerinsky concludes,texas industries thus reaffirms the basic principle the federal judiciary will formulate a body of common law rules only pursuant to clear congressional intent for such action.chemerinsky,supra,at emphasis added.
there is no clear congressional intent for courts to craft common law rules in the context of disputes over interconnection agreements.indeed,the invocation of federal common law would be in considerable tension with the provision in the act and the act scheme of cooperative federalism both of which are discussed in part,infra by ceding new authority to the federal courts where none existed before,while simultaneously displacing state law.
federal element in a state law cause of action merrell dow 
a final position bellsouth takes is that a the parties intended that their mutual obligations under the interconnection agreement track evolving standards of federal law and b federal law provides that traffic is interstate rather than local and therefore lecs need not pay each other for the termination of calls.this is the argument that bellsouth has advanced throughout this litigation,though one is hard pressed to find it in its petition for judicial review.after reciting at length the definitions of various terms under fcc regulations,bellsouth states in paragraph that i t was in the context of the foregoing provisions of law that bellsouth and executed the interconnection agreement.in paragraph,bellsouth alleges that the psc order holding that the use of local facilities to connect to an isp constitutes local traffic under the interconnection agreement is inconsistent with the facts and contrary to the provisions of the act.i will stretch these sentences,respectively,to mean that a the parties intended to track federal law and b federal law means x rather than,as the gspc held,see lykins pointer,cir holding that a district court could exercise federal tort claim liability jurisdiction,despite the plaintiff failure to allege statutory authority for such jurisdiction,because the requisite facts were alleged.resolution of this claim boils down to contractual,whether the parties intended to compensate each other for the termination of calls.it is therefore a state law claim.
this claim,then,squarely confronts this court with the litigation provoking problem of a federal issue embedded in a state law cause of action.in smith kansas city title trust,the plaintiff sued in federal court under the theory that the violated state law when it purchased various bonds.state law delineated permissible investments to those consistent with state and federal law,and the bonds,according to the plaintiff,violated the constitution.the court held that the district court had section jurisdiction to hear the claim.more recently,the court stated in franchise tax board construction laborers vacation trust,d,that when it appears that some substantial,disputed question of federal law is a necessary element of one of the claims,then federal jurisdiction is appropriate.id.at.at.in moore chesapeake ohio,the court took the opposite turn,holding that arising under jurisdiction rarely exists outside of the context of federal causes of action.the court attempted to reconcile these cases in merrell dow pharmaceuticals,thompson,d.there,the court declined to find jurisdiction over a state tort claim that alleged a violation of an fda regulation as an element of the cause of action.the court cautioned that careful judgments must be made.id.at.at.it ultimately concluded that since congress did not create a federal cause of action for violations of the fda regulation,its intent would be defeated if the court allowed district courts to entertain an identical claim under state law.id.at.at.
in the case at bar,it is unclear whether there would be jurisdiction under the framework established in merrell dow.on one hand,the federal mere declaratory ruling by the fcc that traffic is interstate is clearly not a federal cause of action.on the other hand,federal regulatory policy is definitely intertwined with the state law cause of action and merrell dow is therefore easily distinguishable.i need not undertake a jurisdictional analysis under merrell dow,because i think that the district court posture below was that of an appellate court and therefore is inapplicable 
was the proceeding below an original proceeding 
are all e proceedings,in which lecs seek review of psc orders in federal district court,undertaken pursuant to the original jurisdiction of district courts under 
at first blush,it may appear strange to call the district court posture in the e context to be that of a court asserting original jurisdiction.after all,the district court is reviewing the ruling of a lower body,and the district court role therefore seems to be appellate in nature.however,there is a colorable argument that all such proceedings are,in fact,original.if this argument prevails,then the proceeding in the district court below was an original proceeding,and the district court might have had jurisdiction over the state law claim depending upon how an analysis of the case under merrell dow would be resolved.
yes a potential argument 
in verizon,the court asserted that section e may not be a jurisdictional provision rather,it might be a provision that confers a private right of action.see verizon.at section does not establish a distinctive review mechanism for the commission actions that it covers and it does not distinctively limit the substantive relief available.indeed,it does not even mention jurisdiction,but reads like a private action.in the same passage,the court went on to cite steel,at.at,for the proposition that even a statutory provision that uses the word jurisdiction may not relate to subject matter jurisdiction.thus,if one takes the court language seriously,then there must be a separate jurisdictional basis for all e actions in the district courts,because e does not have anything to do with jurisdiction and is merely a cause of action.
one must ask,then,what is the jurisdictional basis for district court review of determinations that pscs must make pursuant to e since there must be a jurisdictional basis outside of e,then it is tempting to look at.that provision states the district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the constitution,laws,or treaties of the united states.the italicized term is striking section is about original rather than appellate jurisdiction.suppose,for example,that a psc arbitrates an interconnection agreement.suppose further that a clec feels that the psc has not required the ilec to meet all of the obligations that is required of it under,and it seeks review of the psc determination in federal district court.is the proceeding before the district court an original proceeding if it is not,then e is without effect congress drafted a private cause of action,but district courts have no jurisdiction to review pscs because congress did not amend to provide for appellate jurisdiction in the district courts.
one option is contend that jurisdiction under section,in the context of an appellate proceeding to resolve a single federal claim,is not troublesome.that may be the position of justice souter who,in a concurring opinion joined by justice breyer and justice ginsburg,stated that the proceeding in verizon was an appellate proceeding while simultaneously agreeing that jurisdiction existed pursuant to.verizon.at souter,concurring verizon accordingly seeks not a simple order of relief running against the state commission,but a different adjudication of a federal question by means of appellate review in federal district court,whose jurisdiction to entertain the claim of error the court today has affirmed.emphasis added.but that is not a satisfactory result,because section clearly says the word original and says nothing about appellate jurisdiction in the district courts 
after verizon,we are thus left with four possible conclusions appellate jurisdiction and can coincide with respect to the same claim e is surplusage all proceedings before district courts under e are original proceedings or the court discussion was dicta and e is,in fact,a jurisdictional special,closely cabined conference of appellate jurisdiction upon district courts to review psc determinations.the first two are clearly wrong,leaving only the last two options.if the third option is correct,then i would be willing to embrace the idea that the proceeding below was an original proceeding and i might therefore find jurisdiction under if this result is in accordance with merrell dow.
no the better argument 
a reading of verizon that would tag the nature of district court review of psc orders with the original label poses several problems that ultimately force me to take option four rather than option three.first,anyone familiar with jurisprudence would believe that the district court posture in the setting is that of an appellate court.compare black law dictionary ed.defining appellate jurisdiction as jurisdiction to revise or correct the proceedings in a cause already instituted and acted upon by an inferior court,or by a tribunal having the attributes of a court,with id.at defining original jurisdiction as jurisdiction to consider the case in the first instance.in the example of the clec challenge described above,the psc considers the case in the first instance,while the district court is being asked to correct the proceedings in a cause already instituted and acted upon by a tribunal having the attributes of a court.
more importantly,e provides that the fcc is to make the determination if the psc does not act.as justice souter points out in his opinion,see verizon.at souter,concurring,there is no special review statute for the fcc in the act.rather,the fcc is reviewed pursuant to its ordinary review statute.see.that provision states that aggrieved parties may file a petition to review the fcc order in the court of appeals where venue lies.clearly the action taken in the latter case is an appeal.one does not,for example,say that a party aggrieved by an agency order files an original action in a court of appeals.rather,one would say that the original proceeding takes place within the agency and that the proceeding before a court of appeals is an appeal.i think it would strain logic to call a proceeding in a court of appeals challenging the fcc determination an appeal while simultaneously contending that an identical proceeding in a district court challenging a psc determination is an original action.
two other considerations inform my conclusion that the proceedings before district courts on review of psc orders are appellate proceedings.first,three justices of the supreme court agreed with an opinion that explicitly called the district court posture to be that of an appellate court second,many courts have held that district courts must give deference to certain psc determinations and deference is a hallmark of appellate review.
since district court review of psc determinations is an appellate rather than original proceeding,this leaves me with option four i decline to read the court suggestion that e is a private right of action as a holding.since this conclusion is,in fact,the best reading of the court language,i read the court discussion as dicta and distinguish the present case from verizon.
the verizon court never analyzed whether the e is a private right of action.it never invoked the factors employed in cort ash,d,for determining whether a statute creates a private cause of action nor did it engage in any kind of analysis whatsoever.rather,it was merely attempting to reinforce its argument for the unexceptional proposition that e does not cabin the original federal question jurisdiction of district courts.indeed,the court expressly reserved the question of whether e amounts to a jurisdictional grant,concluding that even if e does not confer jurisdiction,it at least does not divest the district courts of their authority under to review the commission order for compliance with federal law.verizon.at.my reading is entirely consistent with this principle it reads e as an expansion of federal jurisdiction because cases arising under federal law can still be brought in federal district court as an original matter under,and appeals from psc determinations can be brought in federal district court pursuant to e.
my reading is consistent with the facts in verizon.in that case,the plaintiff claimed that federal law precluded the maryland psc from ordering the payment of reciprocal compensation,notwithstanding the psc conclusion that,under principles of state contract law,the parties agreed to pay each other for the termination of calls.as the court put it verizon sought relief from the commission order on the ground that such regulation is by a federal statute which,by virtue of the supremacy clause of the constitution,must prevail.verizon.at citing shaw delta air lines,d,which held that litigants may assert a private right of action for preemption under the supremacy clause.the claim in verizon,in short,was one that was brought to the district court as an original matter.the psc never passed on the issue it was precisely the psc action that was allegedly illegal under federal law.the claim was not merely an error in legal judgment by a lower body.as will be discussed infra,the latter is what we have claim of the appellate variety.
was the proceeding below,in which bellsouth sought review of the psc order in federal district court,undertaken pursuant to the original jurisdiction of the district court under 
the answer to this question is a resounding no.as stated in part,bellsouth abandoned its claim that the gpsc was preempted by federal law and therefore could not order the payment of reciprocal compensation fees for traffic.the district court had original jurisdiction over this claim,because the crux of the claim is that the psc did something illegal.a private right of under the constitution directly pursuant to shaw or the vehicle for such a claim.the only potential claim left is the state law claim with a federal element.see supra part.in short,bellsouth argues that a the gpsc agreed that the parties intended to track federal and b the gpsc made a legal mistake when it found that,as a matter of federal law,traffic is local rather than interstate.this is merely a claim of legal claim fit for an appeal,but not an original action.this is so even if bellsouth dresses up its claim by seeking declaratory relief.
indeed,bellsouth itself must have believed that the proceeding below was an appellate proceeding.if it were an original proceeding,bellsouth would have asked the district court to ignore the psc order entirely.instead,it argued before the district court that a the gpsc believed that the parties intended to track federal law and b that this conclusion was correct,but that the gpsc got the law part wrong.it asked the court,in short,to give vitality to part of the gpsc analysis rather than ignoring it entirely.moreover,paragraph of bellsouth petition for judicial review asks the district court to reverse the psc order because it was erroneous as a matter of law.that language is typical of appellate proceedings,not original proceedings.
for all of these reasons,i would hold that the posture of the district court in this case was that of an appellate court.while district courts are granted appellate jurisdiction within the narrow confines of e,they do not have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to.the only remaining strategy for the parties is to argue that this case does,in fact,come within the narrow confines of e,or else supplemental jurisdiction exists under.
iii.section e jurisdiction 
a.the source of psc authority to interpret and enforce interconnection agreements is not section e,but residual authority reserved to states under the act 
proponents of federal jurisdiction are eager to find that the source of psc authority to interpret and enforce voluntary agreements resides in section e rather than residual authority under the act because the jurisdictional e restricts federal review only to psc determinations made under this section,and section e contains the section only operative list of what determinations pscs may make.
i am convinced that psc authority does not reside in section e.my primary reason is that the plain language of the act says nothing of the sort.i have looked long and hard at the provision,and i find only this language a state commission to which an agreement is submitted shall approve or reject the agreement,with written findings as to any deficiencies.e emphasis added.bellsouth asks this court to insert by judicial fiat the following additional language state commissions shall also enforce and interpret interconnection agreements if any dispute arises.it is up to congress,not judges,to make this proposed statutory amendment,and i decline to read into the statute language that does not exist.to the majority,it would not make sense to grant pscs authority to ensure that interconnection agreements comply with the requirements of the act on the front end without also instructing pscs to engage in adjudication on the back end.i will show in due time why congress choice made perfect sense.for now,it is enough to say that the authority is not found within the text of e.o ur problem is to construe what congress has written.after all,congress expresses its purpose by words.it is for us to to add nor to subtract,neither to delete nor to distort.cases,more or less,each containing six jars of jam.
aside from the obvious concern,there are two additional problems with judicially manipulating section e so as to insert language about adjudication.first,since this interpretation would give federal courts jurisdiction to review all interconnection disputes under section e,such as price and performance disputes,all of the problems discussed in part,infra,apply.second,this reading would foreclose states from allocating adjudicative authority to enforce and interpret interconnection agreements to state trial courts rather than state pscs,and congress likely did not intend such a result.suppose,for example,that a state wants its trial courts to make the initial decision to approve or reject an interconnection agreement rather than its psc.it could not do this under the clear language of the statute,which says that the authority to approve or reject an interconnection agreement must rest with a state psc or,if the psc does not act,with the fcc.see e,e.this mandatory scheme makes sense,since the decision is a policy determination that ought to rest with an expert agency.suppose,however,that a state makes the following conclusion we state x understand that policy decisions,such as the decision to approve or reject interconnection agreements,ought to rest with our psc.but we do not feel comfortable allowing public service commissioners,many of whom are untrained in the law to immerse themselves in the business of ascertaining contractual intent and deciding other issues that require skill in applying contract law.therefore,we make the decision to allocate this adjudicative power to state trial courts rather than our psc.this sounds like a perfectly reasonable conclusion,and nothing in the statute explicitly prevents it in my view.moreover,the provision of the act,stat,codified at c note would seem to countenance against a conclusion that federal law preempts states from allocating judicial power in this fashion if they so desire.yet under the proposed interpretation,psc adjudicative power,like the power to approve or reject interconnection agreements,stems from section e,which places this authority exclusively with state pscs and not with state courts or any other entity the state deems appropriate.indeed,under the proposed interpretation,if a state psc refrains from adjudicating contract disputes perhaps because a state law gives this power only to its trial courts,the fcc would be given the task of interpreting the contract by likely under principles of state contract law this bizarre result can not be what congress intended.
it is not section e,but rather residual authority left to states under the act that gives states and potentially pscs,if the state so chooses authority to interpret and enforce interconnection agreements by enacting this novel scheme of cooperative federalism,congress deliberately preserved state regulatory bodies as key vehicles for driving the transition to competition.prior to,intrastate regulation was left largely in the hands of states the provision in the act,discussed above,makes clear that any assignment of responsibility remains with states unless the act explicitly takes it away.
suppose that prior to,a bell operating company in state x desired to let a clec interconnect with its system for a fee,of course.the state,invoking its exclusive authority over the intrastate arena,would a decide whether to permit the new entry b possibly require i certain contractual provisions ii state approval of the final agreement and c adjudicate any dispute.moreover,the state would have authority to designate the entity charged with each particular task.the chosen entity might well be a court,regulatory agency,or even the legislature itself.the act altered the scope of state authority,but this alteration was only partial.for example,states no longer have the choice to deny new entry altogether,and so state authority to undertake task a has been completely abrogated.see removal of barriers to entry states also have little freedom to choose the entity that undertakes task b,because section requires that state pscs rather than,say,courts or legislatures approve or reject voluntary agreements otherwise,the fcc will conduct the section tasks itself.the act also defines the basic terms of the agreements,since,even in the voluntary setting,compulsory arbitration always looms in the background.as for task c,the act is silent.therefore,the natural conclusion one must reach in light of the provision and scheme of cooperative federalism is that states still retain the authority to decide which entity engages in adjudication.this conclusion,then,is in considerable tension with the proposition that psc authority to adjudicate disputes stems from section e,because such an interpretation would foreclose states from choosing a different adjudicative entity.this tension,in conjunction with the plain language of the statute and host of problems discussed in part,infra,causes me to believe that the source of the state authority and ultimately the psc authority,if the state legislature chooses to vest a psc with such authority stems from residual authority under the act rather than section e.
b.why there is no jurisdiction under section e 
plain language 
having determined that the gpsc authority to enforce and interpret interconnection agreements does not arise from section e,i know that federal jurisdiction does not exist under section e to review the gpsc adjudication.this is because the two provisions work in tandem.the judicial review provision,section e,provides that review of a psc determination in federal court is for the purpose of determining whether the agreement meets the requirements of this section.the italicized portions of the statute are instructive,leading me to conclude that the only subject of judicial review in the federal courts is the agreement compliance with the act,not other issues such as disputes about the parties objective contractual intent.the scheme,then,is a simple one under section e,a psc is empowered to make one decision to approve or reject an agreement with written findings as to any deficiencies.the grounds for rejecting a voluntary agreement are found in section e a,which precludes the psc from rejecting an agreement for any reason other than a finding that it is discriminatory against,say,a clec or flunks the public interest test.appellate review of the determination rests exclusively with the federal district court.section e makes this clear by precluding state court review of the psc decision and section e provides for federal review of the psc determination that an agreement does not comply with the requirements of the,the requirements that,in the voluntary agreement setting,agreements meet the public interest test and not discriminate against other clecs.the statute simply has nothing to say about adjudication.
cooperative federalism and the presumption against federal jurisdiction 
clearly,state commission decisions that are not expressly designated for review in federal court are left for review by state courts,as provided by the existing law of the state that created the state commission.the provision of the act stands for the proposition that state jurisdiction should be retained to the exclusion of federal jurisdiction unless there is a clear statement to the contrary.another clear statement rule is at play in this case because federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction,when their jurisdiction is created by statute,the statute is strictly construed.see turner bank of,dall.stating that because federal courts are of limited jurisdiction,the fair presumption is that a cause is without its jurisdiction,until the contrary appears.see also jackson transit auth.local div,amalgamated transit union,d powell,concurring because a federal court should exercise extreme caution before assuming jurisdiction not clearly conferred by congress,we should not condone the implication of federal jurisdiction over contract claims in the absence of an unambiguous expression of congressional intent.the presumption of the federal scheme,combined with this venerable principle of federal jurisdiction,demands a clear statement that state review is abolished in lieu of federal review.both polices stand for one overarching principle federal jurisdiction is not to be presumed or implied.i can not find a clear statement indeed,the plain language forces me to reach the opposite conclusion thus,although the state commission may have had jurisdiction to administer and enforce interconnection agreements,review of such decisions by the commission is taken to the state courts as determined by the state review procedure preserved by the act.bell atl.mci worldcom,cir,rev,verizon.pub.serv.com of,d.
special problems of deference protective jurisdiction reconsidered 
if the proponents of section e jurisdiction are correct,what rule of decision must state pscs utilize in adjudicating generic contract disputes,such as whether the parties have performed under the terms of an interconnection agreement and what level of deference,if any,must federal courts give to the psc conclusion under my interpretation of the act,the answer is easy state entities whether a psc or trial court review contracts under state law,and appeals are taken as provided by state rules of appellate review.under the opposing view,these questions become intractable problems which lead to absurd results,lending further credence to the proposition that federal jurisdiction was never intended by congress.
one possible argument is that state pscs interpret contracts according to a federal common law of contracts rather than state contract law.i reject this view for the reasons discussed at part.b,supra.i also note that if federal common law is the rule of decision,and if federal courts review all psc adjudications of disputes under section e,then this interpretation would create considerable problems when the issue of deference is considered.federal courts rarely give deference to state interpretations of federal law indeed,federal courts do not give deference to the federal law interpretations of state high courts,see martin hunter lessee,wheat,much less to state psc commissioners,many of whom are untrained in the law yet if no deference is given,there would be little point in having the psc adjudicate the matter in the first instance.the federal district court,giving no deference,would have the parties relitigate all of the issues again.i can not interpret the act in a way that would create such a wasteful scheme.to make the most sense out of the initial state review,one must conclude that congress did not want there to be de novo review,and that the voluntary agreements are therefore not to be interpreted under principles of federal common law.
perhaps anticipating these devastating arguments,bellsouth concedes that the rule of decision might well be state law but if federal courts have jurisdiction to review the psc state law conclusion,then this argument is as ridiculous as the first because federal courts would be reviewing to see if the state agency correctly applies state law.whether deference is given or not i know of no comparable scenario to this one,in which a federal court sits in judgment of a state agency or court on a complaint that sounds only in state law.as one court put it,it would be surpassing strange to preserve state authority in this fashion and then to put federal courts in the position of overruling a state agency on a pure issue of state law.telecomm.regulatory bd.of,cir.the first circuit concluded that section e does not confer authority on federal courts to review the actions of state commissions for compliance with state law.id.at.indeed,the federal courts might decide to certify a state contract law question to the state high court.proponents of jurisdiction evidently think that congress did not intend that state trial or intermediate appellate review the psc application of state contract body ultimately reviewable by the state high court.rather,they think that congress wanted federal district courts to review the psc application of state contract law,and that federal courts are nonetheless free to seek guidance from the state high court.this interpretation,then,would superfluously wedge federal district courts into an scheme akin to a state intermediate appellate court that is ultimately resolved by the state high court on an issue of state a strange result.these problems disappear,however,when the scheme is interpreted as the plain language dictates under section e,federal courts review only psc determinations to approve or reject voluntary interconnection agreements and nothing more.
i also note that if the statutory scheme were interpreted so as to prescribe federal review of state entities on questions of state law,the scheme would push the boundaries of congress authority under article iii to define the scope of federal jurisdiction without a federal rule of decision,how does such a dispute centered around a state law contract issue arise under federal law the only possible argument would be based on the theory of protective jurisdiction discussed in part.a,supra.does section e amount to a special grant of appellate jurisdiction to entertain state law claims although this is a provocative argument,courts must interpret statutes so as to avoid difficult constitutional questions.see mesa california,d nlrb catholic bishop of chicago,d.
other circuits 
against this array of arguments consisting of venerable principles of federal jurisdiction,the presumption against federal jurisdiction and the presumption against federal common law the provision and the act scheme of cooperative federalism the constitutional avoidance canon and a host of intractable problems that federal jurisdiction would yield,one would think that proponents of jurisdiction would be able to point to an statement that congress intended federal jurisdiction to exist over all disputes regarding compliance with existing interconnection agreements.as part demonstrates,however,the plain language of the act leads to the opposite conclusion,further buttressing the argument against jurisdiction under section e.instead,proponents of federal jurisdiction both litigants and courts point to amorphous concepts of inherent and conclusory fluff.the fourth circuit assessment of other circuits reasoning mirrors mine 
the seventh circuit stated simply,decisions of state agencies implementing the act are reviewable in federal district courts,without providing analysis to support this broad statement in the context of a suit challenging a commission interpretation or enforcement actions.illinois bell,at quoting an earlier order in the same case that was similarly devoid of jurisdictional analysis,see illinois bell.worldcom,cir.and the eight circuit,in dictum and without analysis,first stated its belie f that the enforcement decisions of state commissions would be subject to federal district court review under subsection e.iowa utils.bd.fcc,at.this statement appeared in a footnote in a section of analysis that the supreme court held the eight circuit should not have reached because the issue was not ripe for review.see iowa,at.then later,it simply deferred to the fcc in finding jurisdiction.see southwestern bell.connect communications,cir.
the fifth circuit held that federal court jurisdiction extends to review of state commission rulings on complaints pertaining to interconnection agreements and that such jurisdiction is not restricted to mere approval or rejection of such agreements.southwestern bell.public util.comm n,cir.in reaching this conclusion,the court recognized that e could be read literally to limit federal review of state commissions to decisions approving or disapproving,or arbitrating,an interconnection agreement.id.at.but the court rejected that reading because it concluded,we do not think such a narrow construction was intended.id.the court then reasoned that assignment to state commissions of plenary authority to approve or disapprove these interconnection agreements necessarily carries with it the authority to interpret and enforce the provisions of such agreements.id.

sensing that conclusory assertions about inherent jurisdiction will not carry the day,proponents of federal jurisdiction mount one last ditch effort by invoking chevron deference.see chevron,natural res.def.counsel,d.in that case,the court held that agency determinations are entitled to deference if the statute is silent or ambiguous and the agency answer is based on a reasonable construction of the statute.see id.at.at.it is argued that we should give deference to the fcc conclusion in starpower,at,that psc authority to adjudicate disputes comes from e.
i do not think chevron deference is appropriate in this case.first,section e lists only two possible psc determinations,to approve or reject an agreement section e cabins federal jurisdiction to section e determinations by its very terms.the statute is clear as a bell,and no deference is owed when the statute is unambiguous.second,the clear statement rules and absurdities discussed above reinforce my conclusion that congress did not intend section e to be a broad conferral of federal jurisdiction to review all disputes see chevron,at.at instructing courts to use traditional tools of statutory construction in order to ascertain congressional intent.third,i do not think deference is owed on a question that is ultimately about federal matter that is uniquely within the province of the judiciary to decide.fourth,the constitutional avoidance cannon,discussed at part,supra,trumps chevron deference.see edward debartolo fl.gulf coast const.trades council,d.finally,i hesitate to give deference to an fcc order that was based not upon the agency expertise,but rather upon the conclusory statements of other circuits that are in no way binding on this court the supreme court made clear that chevron deference arises out of a tradition of court restraint when encountering complex issues that are best suited for resolution by expert agencies.see chevron,at.at grounding chevron deference in the expertise of agency decisionmakers.i do not think the chevron court intended that litigants be able to launder circuit court opinions through federal agencies and thereby make those opinions binding on other circuits even if the agency offers no analysis of its own.any of these five reasons standing alone would eliminate the requirement of deference.all of them exist in this case,however.
summary of section e argument 
the jurisdictional question before this district courts have jurisdiction to review all psc orders interpreting and enforcing voluntary interconnection agreements under e could be decided in one of several ways.first,we might conclude,as the panel did,that the silence of e on the subject of psc adjudication of disputes is tantamount to a congressional conclusion that pscs are precluded from adjudicating interconnection disputes.second,we might conclude that e grants pscs inherent authority to interpret and enforce interconnection agreements,making this a e determination subject to federal review pursuant to e,even as to state law issues.this is the approach taken by,among other circuits,the fifth circuit.see southwestern bell.pub.util.comm of,cir.this is also the approach taken by the majority of this court.third,we might conclude that e grants pscs inherent authority,but that the scope of federal review is limited to whether the state commission,in construing and enforcing the interconnection agreements,correctly applied federal law.this is the approach taken by the seventh circuit.see.bell.worldcom,w e would not review those actions for compliance with state law.fourth,we might read language out of the statute,judicially deleting the phrase this section from section e,thereby allowing district courts to review all determinations made by pscs rather than the determinations made pursuant to section e,the determination in the voluntary agreement context.fifth,we might conclude that psc authority resides not in e,but rather stems from state residual authority under the act and,moreover,federal courts have no appellate jurisdiction to review psc adjudications,which traditionally sound in state contract law,under section e.this is the conclusion i reach 
the fourth circuit recognized that interconnection disputes may amount to tens of thousands of cases.see bell atl,mci worldcom,cir see also kathleen wallman,a birthday party the terrible or terrific two federal telecommunications act,fed.comm,finding that roughly interconnection agreements had been reached by.one would think that if congress had wanted this mountain of interconnection disputes to wind up in federal court,it would have clearly said so.this potentially enormous increase in the federal docket,in conjunction with the plain language of the statute,the constitutional avoidance canon,two clear statement rules,and a host of anomalies that would ensue leads me to the conclusion that federal courts do not have jurisdiction to hear all psc orders that interpret and enforce interconnection agreements.rather,appellate review in the district courts is confined to psc determinations.the district court therefore did not have section e jurisdiction over bellsouth claims.
iv.section jurisdiction 
the supplemental jurisdiction statute provides that in any civil action of which district courts have original jurisdiction,the district courts shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same controversy under article iii of the united states constitution.a.in this case,the district court had original jurisdiction over the claim of federal preemption.see part,supra.therefore,the district court had discretion to assert jurisdiction over the supplemental claim for administrative though that claim is appellate in nature.see city of chicago int l coll.of surgeons,d holding that a district court had supplemental jurisdiction over one claim,a challenge to an agency action under the state administrative procedure statute,because it had original jurisdiction over a second claim that the ordinance administered by the agency violated the claim that was asserted for the first time in the district court.therefore,absent my conclusion in part v,infra,the district court would have been within its discretion to assert jurisdiction over the supplemental claim in this context,the district court should have assumed the posture of a georgia superior court,which would ordinarily entertain administrative challenges to psc orders.see.ann.b.i emphasize that the decision to assert supplemental jurisdiction was a discretionary call for the district court to make in the first instance,because the original claim in this case was quickly rejected by the district court,and also because the supreme court cautioned that principles of comity might warrant abstention in scenarios like the one in college of surgeons,at.at.
unclear gpsc order 
after examining the gpsc order in this case,i am unable to conclude,as did the district court,that the gpsc in fact determined that the parties agreed to pay reciprocal compensation fees for traffic even though they were not required to do so under federal law.much like bellsouth cryptic petition for judicial review,i am unable to make sense of the gpsc order.on one hand,it claims that the parties agreed to deem traffic local,in addition to pointing to factors such as usage of trade and course of dealing.the latter are state law interpretative tools used to shed light on the parties intent at the time of contracting.see restatement second of contracts.therefore,bellsouth position that the gpsc holding was driven solely by the fact that it determined,as a matter of law,that such traffic is local is incorrect.on the other hand,there is no question that the gpsc erroneous assessment of federal law was a significant factor in its conclusion,occupying most of the pages in the gpsc order.the fact issue in this the parties objective intent called for the payment of reciprocal compensation fees for never clearly answered by the gpsc.did the parties intend to track federal law or did they intend to pay each other for the termination of calls notwithstanding federal law these are fact questions that must be clearly answered in the first instance by the gpsc or a court exercising original jurisdiction.the district court conclusion that the parties intended to compensate each other for the termination of traffic notwithstanding federal law was based on a conclusion that the gpsc had answered the question in the first instance.i do not believe that the gpsc necessarily arrived at that conclusion,but i am unsure.i feel that the best course would be to remand the case to the gpsc,which can consider the fcc most recent isp ruling and clearly articulate the basis for its conclusion.see mail order ass of am.united states postal,holding that a court must remand unless it is clear that the agency would have reached the same decision in the absence of the legal mistake cissell dep t of labor,cir if an agency makes an error of law in its administrative proceedings,a reviewing court should remand the case to the agency so that the agency may take further action consistent with the correct legal standards.
vi.conclusion 
the crux of bellsouth position is that the gpsc made an error of law in its analysis of bellsouth federal element state law claim,and that the district court should have corrected the alleged error.bellsouth cites only two possible grounds for jurisdiction in this and section e.each of these positions suffers from a fatal flaw.the district court lacked section jurisdiction because the proceeding before the court on the federal element claim was an appellate rather than an original proceeding.section e is equally unavailing because that statute cabins district court appellate jurisdiction to determinations that pscs make pursuant to e.
the district court did,however,have supplemental jurisdiction over bellsouth federal element claim.this is because bellsouth initially brought another claim in addition to its claim for administrative,that the gpsc was federally preempted from ordering the payment of reciprocal compensation fees for calls.thus,although the district court did not have jurisdiction under section to hear bellsouth claim for administrative review,it had supplemental jurisdiction over that claim notwithstanding its appellate nature because the court had original jurisdiction over the preemption claim.
even though the district court had supplemental jurisdiction over the federal element claim,it is unclear what,precisely,the gpsc held with regard to that claim.i would therefore vacate the decision by the district court and remand the case to the district court with instructions to remand to the gpsc.

an agency interpretation of a statute is unreasonable and thus does not merit deference if it is arbitrary,capricious,or clearly contrary to law.alabama power ferc,cir citing chevron,at.
a state commission authority to approve or reject an interconnection agreement would itself be undermined if it lacked authority to determine in the first instance the meaning of an agreement that it has approved.a court might ascribe to the agreement a meaning that differs from what the state commission believed it was,the agreement as interpreted by the court may be one the state commission would never have approved in the first place.to deprive the state commission of authority to interpret the agreement that it has approved would thus subvert the role that congress prescribed for state commissions.
because there is jurisdiction,i would not address whether there may also be jurisdiction under e.to the same effect,see verizon,pub.serv.comm of,d.
no party suggests that there is any difference in the language or substance of the interconnection agreement in the two cases that would affect the resolution of this case.
judge tjoflat comprehensive and forceful opinion deserves comment.whatever the merit of judge tjoflat position,i respectfully suggest that it is not consistent with verizon.in attempting to distinguish bellsouth claim from that of verizon,judge tjoflat draws a distinction between an argument that the agency order is preempted by a federal statute,on the one hand,and on the other hand,an argument that the agency order violated the statute and its implementing regulations.judge tjoflat posits that verizon held there was jurisdiction over the former,but not the latter.i respectfully submit that this attempt to parse the language of the verizon opinion is not consistent with the opinion itself.rather,justice scalia opinion equates the argument that the agency order violated the act and the fcc ruling,with the argument that the order was preempted by federal alleged in its complaint that the commission violated the act and the fcc ruling when it ordered payment of reciprocal compensation for calls.verizon sought a declaratory judgment that the commission order was unlawful,and an injunction prohibiting its enforcement.we have no doubt that federal courts have jurisdiction under to entertain such a suit.verizon seeks relief from the commission order on the ground that such regulation is by a federal statute which,by virtue of the supremacy clause of the constitution must prevail,and its claim thus presents a federal question which the federal courts have jurisdiction under to resolve.shaw delta air lines,d.id.at.the court first states verizon claim as being that the order violated the act and the fcc ruling,and with respect to that claim the court stated we have no doubt that federal courts have jurisdiction under to entertain such a suit.then the court apparently restates the same claim in terms of preemption.respectfully,i do not believe that the fourth circuit on remand from the supreme court opinion in verizon would feel free to parse the holding of the supreme court as suggested by judge tjoflat.like verizon,bellsouth in the instant case claims that the public service commission order violates the act and its implementing regulations and rulings,the same claim asserted by verizon in the supreme tjoflat also expresses concern that all state public service commission decisions affecting interconnection agreements will be deemed federal questions and will flood the federal courts.i would not address such other claims i would address only the claim asserted by bellsouth here,which i submit is the same claim presented by verizon to the supreme court.incidentally,i note that bellsouth never asserts in its briefs on appeal a state law contract claim.indeed,bellsouth notes that the district court in an alternative holding did address a state contract law issue,but bellsouth argues only that such issue is irrelevant because the contract is governed by federal law and the fcc rulings.thus,the potential pure state law concerns judge tjoflat has not been argued and is not before us.
section e provides in any case in which a state commission makes a determination under this section,any party aggrieved by such determination may bring an action in an appropriate federal district court to determine whether the agreement or statement meets the requirements of and.
bellsouth points out that federal law requires of bellsouth the following with respect to the interconnection agreements to negotiate these agreements to discharge their obligations under the federal act to enter into negotiations with a clec against its wishes and indeed,even if state law would otherwise prohibit such negotiations and agreements to agree within the minimum terms subject to governmental approval to publicly file the agreements to make the same terms and conditions available to any requesting clec and to provide service in accordance with an approved agreement.

perhaps the best judicial expression of bellsouth arguments appears in southwestern bell connect communications,cir.although the eighth circuit there holds the identical claim is subject to federal court jurisdiction pursuant to e,its reasoning parallels bellsouth argument that the claim presents a federal question over which district courts have original jurisdiction pursuant to.
because i conclude that the district court has original jurisdiction under,i need not address whether or not there would have been supplemental jurisdiction under if bellsouth had also presented a pure state law claim.
judge tjoflat now claims the statute is unambiguous,indeed,that it is clear as a bell.tjoflat opinion at.i note,however,judge tjoflat earlier chevron analysis concluded that the statute was silent on the precise question at issue.see bellsouth,mcimetro access transmissions,cir in this case,the statute in question,the federal telecommunications act of,is silent as to whether state commissions have the authority to interpret previously approved interconnection agreements,vacated and reh g en banc granted by cir.
judge tjoflat asserts chevron deference is grounded in the expertise of agency decisionmakers,suggesting that where agencies fail to exercise their expertise,they are entitled to no deference.tjoflat opinion at.the supreme court in chevron,however,cited congressional inherent agency the source of the authority afforded administrative agencies.see chevron,at.at if congress has explicitly left a gap for the agency to fill,there is an express delegation of authority to the agency to elucidate a specific provision of the statute by regulation.congress may choose to delegate because of the agency perceived expertise,or,as the supreme court has recognized,it may delegate because of a failure to recognize the precise question at issue or because it failed to achieve a legislative compromise that could be codified in the statute.see id.at.at.according to the supreme court,for judicial purposes,it matters not which of these things occurred.id.agency expertise may give a reason for congressional delegation,but it is the fact of delegation,not expertise,that provides the source for agency authority.
judge tjoflat does not argue that fcc starpower decision was procedurally defective or arbitrary and capricious.as discussed above,the ambiguity that exists in the telecommunications act means that fcc interpretation is not manifestly contrary to the statute.
while judge tjoflat says initially that he only hesitates to defer to fcc interpretation because of its reliance on the precedents of our sister circuits,tjoflat opinion at,he later cites this as a sufficient reason not to defer.tjoflat opinion at any of these five reasons standing alone would eliminate the requirement of deference.
there are certain well known exceptions to this common law understanding of the authority of judicial decisionmaking.see,rodriguez de quijas express,d.
for this reason,i think it does not matter that fcc interpretation is h ardly a model of legal reasoning.tjoflat opinion at.nor is there any problem posed by litigants allegedly laundering circuit court opinions through administrative agencies.tjoflat opinion at.if an administrative agency has been delegated authority by congress to resolve statutory ambiguities,then we can expect the agency to exercise that delegated authority in good faith.if,in its considered judgment,the agency agrees with the result reached by circuit courts confronting the same issue,it can exercise its authority consistent with any applicable limitations on that authority to interpret the statute in accordance with those judicial opinions.the agency interpretation would then be entitled to deference,not because of the authority of the precedents it relied upon,but only because of the authority congress delegated to the agency to make a decision.within certain limits,see mead,at.at,the agency need not exercise model legal reasoning because it simply posits its interpretations and thereby renders them binding on the courts.
