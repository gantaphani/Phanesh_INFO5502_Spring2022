plaintiff susan henderson counsel went all in on a bad bet.first,he waited until the eleventh hour to begin opposing a summary judgment motion he had known about for months.next,he assigned the preparation of that opposition to a paralegal who he failed to supervise.finally,learning that the paralegal had left the state with the opposition the last business day before it had to be filed without his having seen it,he hoped for a miracle instead of immediately going to court to request an extension of time.because these are inexcusable mistakes,the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying henderson request for discretionary relief under code of civil procedure section,subdivision b hereafter section b,from entry of summary judgment in favor of pacific gas and electric pg e.we also agree,with the majority of courts who have decided the issue,that henderson is not entitled to mandatory relief under section b because such relief is not available for summary judgments.accordingly,we affirm the order denying henderson motion to vacate the summary judgment.
background 
the underlying facts are irrelevant to the issues on appeal.in march,henderson filed a complaint against her former employer,pg e,asserting causes of action for employment discrimination in violation of the california fair employment and housing act feha,et and breach of contract.the case was initially set for trial on may,but the trial date was continued to august.
on may,pg e moved for summary judgment,offering evidence to negate various elements of henderson claims and establish a complete defense to the action.a hearing on the motion was set for july.on june,the trial court ordered pg e to produce discovery henderson had requested within days.on june,henderson filed an ex parte application to continue the trial date and the hearing on the summary judgment motion so she could receive this discovery and conduct additional discovery based on the information provided.the court granted the application and continued the hearing on the summary judgment motion to september,and trial to the week of october.pursuant to section,subdivision b,the opposition to the motion was due on september,days before the september hearing date.
on september,the only document henderson filed was the declaration of her attorney,rod mcclelland,in which he stated that evidence would be presented at the hearing on the summary judgment motion to show a triable issue of material fact existed.one exhibit was attached to the declaration of a former pg e employee which mcclelland stated supported henderson gender discrimination claim.on september,henderson filed two points and authorities,two responses to pg e separate statement,and the declaration of mcclelland law clerk,and on september,she filed mcclelland declaration authenticating various documents attached to it.
on september,henderson filed an ex parte application for an order compelling the depositions of individuals she claimed were the subject of the court june,discovery order and continuing the hearing on the summary judgment motion pursuant to section,subdivision h.in a declaration attached to the application,mcclelland stated that pg e refused to produce for deposition seven individuals who were subject to the trial court june,ruling.he also stated that he had entrusted preparation of the summary judgment opposition to his paralegal,who had just taken the california bar exam,because he was handling other matters related to his law practice.on thursday,september,his paralegal,who was working on the opposition from home and had the majority of the case file with her,called him and told him the opposition documents would be in his office the following day.the next morning,however,he received a voicemail message from her while on his way to work,in which she stated she had made arrangements with an attorney service in fresno to email the opposition directly to the service,who would file and serve it on monday,september.on september,he contacted the attorney service,who denied having spoken with his paralegal,and had his secretary call the superior court clerk,who could not confirm any filings until the following morning.in an effort to protect his client,he filed his declaration and a copy of the witness declaration.the following morning,he confirmed that only two other opposition documents had been filed.on september and,his office received emailed copies of some of the documents his paralegal prepared.finally,he stated that he was throwing himself on the court mercy relating to the late filing and service of the summary judgment opposition.
the following day,pg e filed a written opposition to henderson application.on september,the court continued the ex parte hearing to the following monday,september,with the application to be heard prior to the summary judgment motion.although the court also gave henderson permission to file a reply to pg e opposition,henderson did not file one.also on september,henderson filed and served an entirely new set of documents constituting her opposition to the summary judgment motion.
at the september,hearing,the trial court denied henderson request for continuance under section,subdivision h,finding there was an insufficient factual basis to support the continuance,as the depositions henderson sought to take had not even been noticed and no factual declaration was made as to what information she expected to obtain from them,and the request was untimely and not diligently made.the court further found that,assuming mcclelland declaration was filed under section,it did not support a finding of excusable neglect,and henderson was not entitled to mandatory relief under section b because that provision does not apply to summary judgment motions.accordingly,the court denied the application to continue the summary judgment motion.
the court then granted pg e motion to strike the opposition and concluded pg e was entitled to summary judgment based on the evidence it had submitted in support of its motion.a written order granting summary judgment in pg e favor was filed on october.the court entered judgment against henderson on november,and notice of entry of judgment was served on mcclelland by mail on november.on december,henderson filed a motion for a new trial.by order filed january,the trial court denied the motion.
on march,henderson filed a motion under b to vacate the summary judgment against her.in support of her motion,mcclelland submitted a declaration in which he claimed he did not begin preparing the opposition to the summary judgment motion immediately because he was involved in several other cases,including a mediation and preparation of an opposition to a summary judgment motion in another employment case,when he began preparing the opposition in this case,he was served with a summary judgment motion in another case,with that opposition due one week before the opposition in this case,when counsel in the other case refused to agree to continue the motion,he was forced to focus on that opposition and allowed his paralegal,who he had worked with for several years,was a certified law student,had prepared a summary judgment opposition before,and was familiar with henderson case,to prepare the opposition in this case,and he gave his paralegal the task of preparing the opposition more than four weeks before the deadline to file it.
mcclelland further explained that he had requested a continuance of the summary judgment motion in july because he had not yet received personnel records he had subpoenaed from pg e on july and.after the court granted his request and continued the hearing to september,on august,defense counsel requested that he not depose certain individuals whose personnel records were produced,as specific documents showed that their information was irrelevant to henderson claims.however,he had not received the documents and therefore requested defense counsel provide them.by august,his office had received documents responsive to the july and subpoenas,and documents identified in the august letter.he believed additional documents existed that had not been produced and the seven individuals pg e refused to produce for deposition,whose depositions were never taken,had information relevant to henderson claim of pretext,as they were male employees who were not terminated despite having committed severe misconduct.
mcclelland stated that throughout the month before the opposition was due,his paralegal,who was leaving for an alaskan cruise on friday,september,assured him the preparation was going well and would be filed timely.on thursday,september,she left his office early to work on completing the opposition at home,taking the majority of henderson file with her without his consent.later that day,she called him and said the opposition would be in his office on friday morning,september,for his review and filing the following monday.on his way to work on september,he received a voicemail message the paralegal left on his cell phone at,stating that her computer crashed the night before,so she took the entire file with her on the cruise and made arrangements to have the documents emailed to an employee of an attorney service in fresno,who would then file and serve the documents on september.on september,mcclelland contacted the attorney service employee,who said he had never spoken with the paralegal.mcclelland secretary called the superior court clerk,who could not confirm the filing of any documents until the next morning.mcclelland could not contact the paralegal because she was without cell phone access.in order to protect henderson,mcclelland filed his declaration,with a copy of one witness statement attached.mcclelland stated it was not until september that he confirmed that only two pleadings in opposition to the motion were filed,the opposition points and authorities and response to the separate statement.on september and,his office received emailed copies of some,but not all,of the documents and exhibits the paralegal prepared.
mcclelland declared that the paralegal removed the entire file without his authorization and unilaterally decided to scan the opposition and all supporting documents and exhibits,from a remote location out of state.the paralegal also employed another service provider in an attempt to have the opposition filed on september.after the paralegal returned from vacation,she told mcclelland that when she tried to retrieve the original documents from the service provider,she learned that only two of them had been emailed,and she then went to the magistrate office in canada,where she received permission to use their equipment to electronically serve the opposition,including exhibits,on defense counsel.in an effort to timely file a complete opposition,mcclelland filed and served the ex parte application to compel depositions and continue the summary judgment motion on september,and also filed and served a complete opposition to the summary judgment motion.
mcclelland stated the current motion was timely because it was filed within six months of the september hearing,and he delayed in filing the motion because he hoped the court would grant the new trial motion and he needed time to reconstruct his calendar and the course of discovery in the case.he admitted making a mistake in entrusting the paralegal with preparation of the opposition,as he should have required her to provide him with drafts a week earlier.
henderson requested that the summary judgment be set aside in accordance with section b,based on mcclelland inadvertence,surprise or excusable neglect resulting from the action of a former rogue employee.she argued the element of surprise was satisfied when the paralegal computer crashed on september and she took the case file with her on vacation,and mcclelland committed excusable neglect when he relied on the paralegal to prepare the opposition in its entirety.
as pertinent here,pg e opposed the motion to vacate on the grounds that it was an improper request for reconsideration of henderson september,ex parte application for continuance of the summary judgment motion,henderson was not entitled to mandatory relief from the judgment pursuant to section b,and henderson was not entitled to discretionary relief based on section b.pg e also filed objections to henderson evidence.pg e attorney explained in her declaration that pg e had objected to the subpoenas henderson had served in july,which sought the employment records of pg e employees,because the subpoenas were procedurally defective.pg e,however,agreed to informally respond to the subpoenas and had provided henderson with all located documents by august.the parties had scheduled the depositions of three witnesses for,but they were taken off calendar on august at the request of pg e attorney.henderson never noticed new depositions.on september,mcclelland asked to depose seven individuals,some of whom were no longer employed by pg e,but he did not notice the depositions or subpoena the former employees.pg e attorney further explained that given henderson late filing of the summary judgment opposition,pg e did not have time to substantively reply to it.
in a reply brief,henderson stated mcclelland did not file his september declaration with the intent to declare a mistake and had never previously applied for relief pursuant to section.henderson claimed mcclelland had been diligent,as he tried to ensure relevant documents were received before the depositions previously set and noticing the remaining depositions,and stated she was entitled to discretionary relief under section because mcclelland made a mistake in not setting an earlier deadline for his paralegal to complete the opposition,the paralegal computer crashed while preparing the opposition and she had removed the entire file without his permission.
following oral argument,the trial court took the matter under submission.on may,the court issued a written ruling denying the motion to set aside the october,order and november,judgment.the court found that all of the facts needed to support a motion for continuance of the summary judgment motion were known in sufficient time for mcclelland to have timely filed a motion for continuance under section,subdivision h,and his failure to timely do so was not adequately explained or justified by excusable mistake or neglect.the court further found the failure caused undue prejudice to pg finally,the court found that an attorney affidavit of fault can not be relied upon to obtain relief from a summary judgment purportedly caused by attorney error,citing huh wang th,huh,and ambrose michelin north america,th,ambrose.
this appeal followed.as we stated in our december,order denying pg e motion to dismiss the appeal,our review is limited to whether the trial court erroneously issued the may,order denying relief under section,subdivision b.
discussion 
henderson contends the trial court abused its discretion when it denied her motion to vacate the order on the motion for summary judgment and resulting judgment under section b.we conclude the trial court did not err in denying the motion.
section b provides a means for relief from judgment entered as a result of mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or neglect.first,the section contains a discretionary provision the court may,upon any terms as may be just,relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a judgment,dismissal,order,or other proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or excusable neglect.b.a requirement for discretionary relief is that the application be accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed therein,otherwise the application shall not be granted ibid.
section b also contains a mandatory or attorney affidavit provision.state farm fire casualty pietak th,state farm.it provides notwithstanding any other requirements of this section,the court shall,whenever an application for relief is made no more than six months after entry of judgment,is in proper form,and is accompanied by an attorney sworn affidavit attesting to his or her mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or neglect,vacate any resulting default entered by the clerk against his or her client,and which will result in entry of a default judgment,or resulting default judgment or dismissal entered against his or her client,unless the court finds that the default or dismissal was not in fact caused by the attorney mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or neglect.b.under this provision,a party will be relieved if a default judgment or dismissal is the result of its attorney mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or neglect,without regard to whether the neglect is excusable.entertainment,reed th.
as a preliminary matter,we note that in henderson moving papers on the motion below,she appeared to rely only on the discretionary relief provision.in her points and authorities,henderson stated that the request to set aside the order and judgment was made in accordance with section b and arose out of her counsel inadvertence,surprise excusable neglect.only after pg e argued the mandatory provision did not apply to summary judgments did henderson assert in her reply the motion should be granted because there was no trial on the merits the trial court ultimately decided in its written ruling that the mandatory provision did not apply to summary judgments purportedly caused by attorney error.while henderson noted in her opening brief on appeal that there is a split of authority on whether mandatory relief is available with respect to motions to set aside summary judgments,she did not assert that we should adopt one view over the other,and instead argued that her attorney neglect was excusable.after pg e pointed out in its appellate brief henderson failure to address the trial court ruling,in her reply brief henderson argued we should find that mandatory relief is available here.since pg e and henderson both briefed the application of mandatory relief in this court,and we have discretion to consider a new issue on appeal where it involves a pure question of the application of law to undisputed facts see yeap leake th,fn,disapproved on another ground in hosain hosain th,considering application of mandatory relief provision although appellant argued it only obliquely below and not at all in the opening brief on appeal,we will consider both mandatory and discretionary relief.
mandatory relief under section b 
the mandatory relief provision of section b is a narrow exception to the discretionary relief provision for default judgments and dismissals.zamora clayborn contracting group,cal th,zamora.its purpose was to alleviate the hardship on parties who lose their day in court due solely to an inexcusable failure to act on the part of their attorneys,original italics.an application for mandatory relief must be filed within six months of entry of judgment and be in proper form,accompanied by an attorney sworn affidavit attesting to his or her mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or neglect.huh,supra,th at.the defaulting party must submit sufficient evidence that the default was actually caused by the attorney error.citation.if the prerequisites for the application of the mandatory relief provision of section,subdivision b exist,the trial court does not have discretion to refuse relief.huh,supra,th at.
the issue of whether the mandatory provision of section b applies to summary judgments is a task of statutory construction,subject to de novo review.huh,supra,th at.by its express terms,the mandatory relief provision applies only to defaults,default judgments,and dismissals.id.at.some courts,however,have construed the provision to reach other circumstances deemed to be procedural equivalents of defaults,default judgments,and dismissals.see,e,in re marriage of hock th,relief granted in dissolution case where neither the party nor her attorney appeared for trial avila chua th avila summary judgment.the rationale of these cases is that,where there is no hearing on the merits,an attorney neglect should not prevent the party from having his or her day in court.in re marriage of hock,supra,at.other courts have rejected that rationale,characterizing such decisions as understandable,yet ultimately misguided quests to salvage cases lost by inept attorneys,which have applied the mandatory provision far beyond the limited confines the legislature intended.huh,supra,th at,citing english ikon business solutions,th,english.
henderson urges us to follow those cases that have construed the mandatory provision to reach the summary judgment entered here,citing avila.henderson argues that following avila serves the public policy of protecting the innocent client,imposing the burden on the responsible attorney,and avoiding more litigation in the f or m of malpractice suits.in avila,the court of appeal concluded the mandatory provision required the trial court to vacate a summary judgment entered in the defendant favor after the trial court denied the plaintiff request for a continuance of the hearing,struck the plaintiff opposition that was filed one week late due to a calendaring error,and granted summary judgment.avila,supra,th at.in holding that section b mandatory relief provision applied to the summary judgment,the appellate court reasoned that there had been no litigation and adjudication on the merits,therefore the plaintiff lost his day in court due solely to his lawyer failure to timely act.id.at.the court found the case directly analogous to a default judgment,noting the purpose of the mandatory relief provision is to relieve innocent clients from the burden of their attorneys mistakes and that the law strongly favors disposition of cases on their merits,with any doubts regarding application of section b resolved in the moving party favor.avila,supra,th at.
pg e contends the cases holding that the mandatory provision of section b does not apply to summary judgments control here,citing huh,supra,th and english,supra,th.in english,the plaintiff opposed a defense summary judgment motion based solely on a requested continuance to conduct discovery.english,supra,th at.after denying the request,the trial court granted summary judgment.id.at.the plaintiff sought relief under section b mandatory relief provision based on her attorney declaration of fault for failing to oppose the summary judgment motion on the merits.ibid.after thoroughly reviewing the legislative history of the mandatory relief provision and the case law interpreting it,the court of appeal concluded the mandatory relief provision does not apply to summary judgments.id.at.
the court reasoned that a summary judgment is neither a default,nor a default judgment,nor a dismissal.english,supra,th at.the court explained that a summary judgment is not a default within the meaning of section b because the statute refers only to a default entered by the clerk or the court when a defendant fails to answer a complaint,not to every omission or failure in the course of an action english,supra,th at,fn.omitted.a summary judgment likewise is not a default judgment,which is a judgment entered after the defendant has failed to answer the complaint and the defendant default has been entered.ibid.finally,a summary judgment is not a dismissal,which is defined as the withdrawal of an application for judicial relief by the party seeking such relief,or the removal of the application by a court.id.at.while the court acknowledged that the summary judgment statute allows a court to grant summary judgment if the opposing party fails to file a separate statement of disputed and undisputed material facts,it noted that even in that situation,the court can not grant the motion until it has considered all of the papers and determined no triable issue of fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.id.at.thus,a defense summary judgment can not be considered a dismissal because it does not constitute a removal of the plaintiff application for judicial relief,but rather an adjudication based on the undisputed facts before the court.ibid.
the english court disagreed with other courts expansive interpretation of the statute under which the dispositive test,largely detached from the language of the statute itself,is whether the ruling from which relief is sought was in the nature of a default and whether the party seeking relief had her day in court.english,supra,th at.english deferred to the express dictates of the mandatory
