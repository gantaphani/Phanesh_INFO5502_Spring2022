background 
nextel,cingular wireless llc cingular,and sprint spectrum,sprint,as wireless service providers,charged their customers a federal programs cost recovery fpcr fee in order to maintain services mandated by federal law.the providers used the fee to pay for enhanced capabilities,wireless local telephone number portability lnp,and telephone number pooling capabilities.federal regulation permits the wireless companies to recoup those costs associated with the services by charging customers a fee.nextel charged its customers these fees under a line item listed as tax,fees,and assessments.
several classes of plaintiffs in various states filed actions challenging nextel recoupment of the fpcr costs by this means.the plaintiffs essentially alleged that nextel impermissibly disguised a rate hike as a tax,fee,or assessment.the blando plaintiffs,who filed their action in missouri state court,were on the forefront of this litigation.the blando plaintiffs complaint included state law claims for unfair merchandising practices,unjust enrichment,and breach of contract.nextel vigorously fought to remove these actions to federal court.
nextel succeeded in removing the blando action to the united states district court for the western district of missouri.the blando plaintiffs argued that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction,and filed a motion in the district court seeking a remand of the case to state court.the district court did not rule on the blando plaintiffs removal motion.while the case was pending,the blando plaintiffs entered into settlement negotiations with nextel.in the meantime,several other cases filed in various state courts were removed to federal court.nextel motioned for consolidation pursuant to.the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation jpml created finding that 
all actions present common,complex legal and factual questions concerning the disclosure propriety of fees charged by wireless telephone service providers to customers for recovering the costs of complying with one or more federally mandated telecommunications programs.plaintiffs challenge essentially the same billing conduct and seek relief on behalf of frequently commonly defined if sometimes geographically separate plaintiff classes.
at the time was created,blando nextel had proceeded further than any of the other cases.thus,the western district of missouri was called on to preside over.in blando,a proposed settlement had been filed and nextel moved for an injunction to stay all related federal and state actions pending approval of the settlement 
after was formed,the blando plaintiffs and nextel settled all claims arising out of the fpcr fee on a nationwide class basis.to ensure the validity of the settlement,blando filed an amended complaint alleging a federal cause of action so as to make certain federal jurisdiction.the blando plaintiffs and nextel then submitted expert reports on the value the proposed settlement would provide to the class members.the district court conducted a fairness hearing and considered objections.after the fairness hearing,nextel submitted additional evidence in camera upon the court request.despite several objections,the district court approved the settlement.
the approved settlement creates two classes.class a is defined as current nextel subscribers who paid the fpcr fee during defined periods.class a receives free nextel services,including minutes,text messaging,and phone internet access.class b is described as former nextel subscribers who paid the fpcr fee during defined periods but terminated nextel service prior to september.because class b members are no longer nextel subscribers,they may receive cash reimbursement,a phone card,or a credit if they resubscribe to nextel.the settlement also requires nextel to disclose on its bills that the fpcr fee is not a tax but a fee that nextel elects to collect to recover its cost of funding and complying with government mandates and initiatives.
following the settlement approval,several parties and objectors brought the instant appeal.for sake of clarity,the various parties to this appeal will be referred to by the name of the lead party or objector in the underlying suit.
ii.discussion 
jurisdiction 
daniels and daniels,pa,et the daniels plaintiffs now challenges the district court jurisdiction.the daniels plaintiffs assert that the district court improperly assumed jurisdiction when the blando plaintiffs essentially conceded jurisdiction in order to get the settlement approved.the district court below maintained jurisdiction in this case pursuant to as the plaintiffs filed suit under a federal statute,b,challenging the rates charged by various wireless telephone carriers.lack of subject matter jurisdiction can not be waived by the parties or ignored by the court.hunter underwood,cir.
we hold jurisdiction was proper in the district court.the blando plaintiffs initially filed their cause of action in missouri state court relying solely on state law.nextel succeeded in removing the case to federal district court based upon federal preemption.initially,the blando plaintiffs opposed the removal and sought to have the case remanded to missouri state court.then,on the same day that the blando plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary settlement approval,they filed an amended complaint alleging violations of the federal communications act fca under b.the daniels plaintiffs contend that jurisdiction could not be predicated on the amended complaint,and that the district court should have looked to the face of the original complaint to determine jurisdiction.
it is that an amended complaint supercedes an original complaint and renders the original complaint without legal effect.in re atlas van lines,cir citations omitted.rule c of the federal rules of civil procedure allows an amended complaint to relate back when the claim in the amended pleading arose out of the conduct,transaction,or occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in the original complaint.as such,where a plaintiff has filed an amended complaint,federal courts must resolve questions of subject matter jurisdiction by examining the face of the amended complaint.atlas,at 
however,when a district court orders a party to amend its complaint,or when the decision to amend is otherwise involuntary,the question of proper removal must be answered by examining the original rather than the amended complaint.atlas,at citing humphrey sequentia,cir.in humphrey,the plaintiff filed a motion to amend his complaint after the district court determined that his state law claims were preempted by federal law.humphrey sequentia,cir.we held that such a motion was involuntary because the plaintiff faced the hobson choice of amending his complaint or risking dismissal.id.in atlas,we applied humphrey when a district court determined that the plaintiff claims were preempted and then granted the plaintiff leave to file an amended complaint.atlas.there,we explained that the plaintiff was confronted with a patently coercive predicament in that the plaintiff could either file an amended complaint or risk dismissal of her entire case.atlas,at.
daniels urges us to extend the humphrey exception to cases where jurisdiction is conjured up at the eleventh hour in order to get a settlement approved.we decline.unlike the situation in both humphrey and atlas,the blando plaintiffs did not face the choice of amending their complaint or risking dismissal.here,if the original complaint failed to confer jurisdiction on the federal district court,the blando plaintiffs faced a distinctly different choice.specifically,they could either amend their complaint or risk having their case remanded back to missouri state court.we will not extend the humphrey exception beyond cases where the plaintiff faces dismissal.
in this case,the violations of the fca alleged in the blando plaintiffs amended complaint arose out of nextel billing the fpcr same transaction that gave rise to the blando plaintiffs original complaint.therefore,we hold that the amended complaint properly conferred jurisdiction on the district court to approve the settlement.
preserving a right to appeal 
on appeal,the robertson objectors seek clarification of whether an objector right to appeal a settlement is conditioned upon the objector successful intervention.the robertson objectors attempted to intervene as named parties in the blando case under.the district court denied intervention and the robertson objectors filed two motions for reconsideration.they now appeal as that is,they are unnamed members of the blando class who object to the settlement with nextel.specifically,the robertson objectors rely upon devlin scardelletti,d,as authority for their right to appeal in a case to which they were never granted status as parties.
the district court in this case concluded that there is no need for the unnamed class member to be granted intervenor status in order to appeal a decision by the district court regarding settlement.we recognize that the robertson objectors earnestly request clarification of whether intervention is a prerequisite to appeal.however,they fail to challenge any aspect of the district court approval of settlement in this case.in their reply brief,the robertson objectors maintain that they are simply ask ing this court to clarify the scope of snell allianz life ins.of north america,cir refusing to address the issue when the party in an case failed to make any objections to the settlement either before the settlement was final or after she was reintroduced to the class for the guidance of future objectors lest it become a trap for the unwary.as such,the robertson objectors are seeking an advisory opinion.we refuse.the constitution charges article iii courts with the resolution of cases and controversies,precluding them from rendering advisory opinions.in re bender,cir citing flast cohen,d const.art.iii.accordingly,we are without jurisdiction to address the issues raised by the robertson objectors.
c.in camera review 
steve strange et,the strange objectors argues that the district court erred by considering material submitted to the court by nextel in camera blando and nextel submitted expert opinion evaluations valuing the additional minutes to be accorded class members in the settlement at between million and million.the strange objectors objected to the settlement and specifically challenged the expert opinions received and reviewed by the district court in camera.
on january,the district court conducted a fairness hearing on the settlement.the court noted that neither the plaintiffs nor the experts properly identified the documents used to reach the settlement.thus,the court ordered nextel to provide a listing of the documentation that was provided to the experts,a listing of the personnel who interpreted the data,and affidavits explaining the methodology employed to calculate the minutes.to comply,nextel filed a listing of the documents under seal for the court to review in camera.the strange objectors filed a motion objecting to the in camera evaluation.the court did not rule on that motion,but after an amended settlement agreement was filed on march,the court entered an order dated april,approving the settlement.
the strange objectors maintain that they were entitled to view the documents submitted to the court by nextel under seal.the strange objectors contend they were not afforded an opportunity to make a meaningful response to the settlement without being able to view the documents considered in the in camera review.although the district court did rely on the documents submitted in camera to approve the settlement,it never ruled on the strange objectors objections.in the absence of specific findings regarding the fairness of the settlement,we must assume that the district court did not abuse its discretion unless the record establishes the contrary.deboer mellon mortgage,cir,cert denied,d citing protective comm.for indep.stockholders of tmt trailer ferry,anderson,d.where the district court fails to make findings,we will reverse the district court only if there is no basis upon which it could have found that the settlement is reasonable,or if the settlement is improper as a matter of law.id.the strange objectors have not met this burden.
we have held due process satisfied where class members received notice of the settlement proposal and were able to argue their objections to the district court.see deboer,at.one district court has explained that due process was served where objectors were allowed to view sealed records provided they agreed to be bound by the terms of a protective order.in re bankamerica.securities.the court noted,however,that the objectors have pointed to no authority suggesting that a settlement fails to comport with due process when the record includes documents filed under seal pursuant to a protective order.id.
according to nextel,the documents reviewed by the district court in camera contained only limited information used to support the declarations already revealed in the public docket.the district court described the documents as merely providing supporting data for the number of nextel customers who would use bonus minutes as contemplated by the settlement.while the better practice would have been to allow opposing counsel access to the information,we have reviewed the documents under seal and conclude that the strange objectors suffered no prejudice by the district court in camera review.the sealed portion of the record contains a list of the documentation provided to opposing counsel,the personnel who compiled the data,affidavits of those personnel attesting to the methodology of compiling the data,and conclusions that nextel maintained could be derived from the data.the strange objectors were given all the underlying critical information used by the parties to reach a settlement.we conclude that they had sufficient information to challenge the fairness of the settlement and will not reverse on this point.
overbroad settlement 
in addition to their jurisdiction argument,the daniels plaintiffs contend that the district court erred in approving the settlement because it dismissed claims that were not covered in the settlement procedure the daniels plaintiffs assert that their claim,based on a double billing of charges in the states of florida,illinois and massachusetts,was never considered in the settlement.the blando plaintiffs limited their complaint to allegations that nextel failed to disclose that the fpcr fee was not federally mandated and operated as a concealed rate increase.the thrust of the daniels plaintiffs argument is that nextel recovered once for fpcr from billing its customers and a second time from the three states.the district court concluded that the fees had nothing to do with the fpcr fee and,thus,such claims did not merit disapproval of the settlement.
the daniels plaintiffs seek to recover only a portion of the fpcr fee that they contend double dipped by charging it in conjunction with the fee.nextel explains that there are two phases of the charge,and that the fpcr charge only relates to phase ii of,which nextel never recovered independently from the states.the settlement in this case covered any and all future claims which relate in any way to the fpcr fees.the daniels plaintiffs assert a claim that is predicated on the billing of fpcr fees,the same factual predicate supporting the blando case.as such,the settlement necessarily includes the claims of
