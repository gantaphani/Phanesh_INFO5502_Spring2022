petitioner arizona electric power cooperative aepco seeks review of a decision of the surface transportation board stb or board dismissing aepco challenge to the joint rate charged by the burlington northern santa fe railroad bnsf and the union pacific railroad up collectively railroads to transport coal from mines in north tipple and lee ranch,new mexico new mexico mines,near defiance,new mexico,to aepco apache power plant in cochise,arizona.using the stb stand alone cost sac methodology,aepco hypothesized the costs an imaginary railroad sarr would incur in shipping the coal from the same origin point to the same destination as the railroads but using an alternative route.aepco hypothetical sarr cost was substantially lower than the railroads joint rate,in large part because it relied on the trackage rights bnsf held over a segment of track owned by up.the board rejected aepco sac analysis on the ground that a shipper hypothesizing costs in a joint rate case may not rely on the trackage rights that one defendant railroad here bnsf holds over track belonging to a second defendant railroad here up because the trackage rights fee does not fully reflect the joint costs of the two defendant railroads,including the costs of building and maintaining the track.because the board decision was not arbitrary or capricious,we deny the petition for review.
on december,aepco filed a complaint challenging as unreasonably high the joint rates the railroads charged aepco to transport coal from the new mexico mines to aepco cochise,arizona power plant.on march,aepco filed an amended complaint to challenge in addition the joint rates the railroads charged to transport coal from mines in the powder river basin prb of wyoming and montana and the rates up charged for transport from mines in colorado.to support its challenges aepco relied on a sac analysis.as we recently explained 
a sac analysis seeks to determine the lowest cost at which a hypothetical efficient carrier could provide service to the complaining shipper or a group of shippers that benefits from sharing joint and common costs.the board assumes away barriers to entry and exit so as to treat the otherwise railroad industry as a contestable market.under the sac constraint,then,the rate at issue can be no higher than what the hypothetical carrier would have to charge to provide the needed service while fully covering its costs,including a reasonable return on investment.

on february,the railroads filed a petition for an order requiring separate evidentiary submissions for each rate challenged by aepco,contending aepco was engaged in an effort to manipulate the board sac procedures by attempting to include in its railroad the vast revenues from powder river basis shipments that never touch the routes of the colorado and new mexico traffic.joint app.ja.in a decision served august,aepco i,wl,the stb offered its guidance on the permissible parameters of a sac presentation in these circumstances.aepco i at.the board advised that aepco could assume a different route for the new mexico mines from the one the railroads had been jointly using,id.at aepco could not propose joint service for the colorado shipping because the shipping was done under a single rate by up alone,aepco could not rely on traffic which would not produce revenues to up to reduce the cost of the up colorado transport,significant here where up has arrangements in place with bnsf for example,joint ownership of a or trackage rights arrangements as,the board noted,up enjoyed over three segments of the colorado route belonging to bnsf i n designing a sarr to replicate up service,aepco may assume these same economies,id.at.the board elaborated 
these guiding a sarr may replicate the existing arrangements but may not hypothesize revenue or with equal force to sarrs designed to test the joint rates from the prb and new mexico origins.thus,for each segment of a route used to test the respective joint rates,only the traffic and revenues of the carrier whose portion of the route is being replicated should be included in the sarr traffic group.but the sarr may be assumed to have the same arrangements as the defendant carriers have on each segment,so long as the terms of those arrangements including operational provisions and terms of compensation are the same as those applicable to the defendant carriers.
on february,aepco advised the stb that it had reached a settlement with up regarding the colorado and the prb rates,leaving in dispute only the shipping rates from the new mexico mines to the cochise,arizona power plant.aepco filed its opening evidence on these rates on february,hypothesizing a sarr the apache,cochise eastern railroad that used a than did the railroads.the railroads route ran east on bnsf track from defiance,new mexico to belen junction,new mexico,then south on bnsf track through rincon,new mexico to deming,new mexico,and finally west on up track to cochise,arizona aepco hypothetical route ran east on bnsf track from defiance,new mexico past belen junction,new mexico to vaughn,new mexico,then south on up track over which bnsf had trackage rights from vaughn,new mexico to el paso,texas,then west on up track running south of deming,new mexico to cochise,arizona.to establish its sarr shipping costs for the two segments,aepco submitted evidence of the actual costs of building and maintaining the segments for the segment from vaughn,new mexico to el paso texas,however,aepco assumed it would pay bnsf trackage rights fee over up track,which was mills per gross gtm.
on april,up filed a petition requesting the board alternatively either to require aepco to submit new evidence or to dismiss aepco complaint,specifically objecting to aepco reliance on bnsf trackage rights because payment of the trackage rights fee alone would not replicate the total costs of traffic which up and bnsf together incur.ja emphasis original.in rebuttal,aepco submitted,inter alia,evidence to support the gtm rate.
in a decision served november,aepco ii,wl,the stb rejected aepco trackage rights fee assumption,concluding that using or arrangements between defendants to avoid a significant portion of the capital costs of providing service would defeat the sac test assumption because the sac test could not serve its purpose if the sac analysis failed to take into account the full costs of providing and maintaining the physical plant needed to serve the which the defendants collectively must bear.aepco ii at.the board determined i t would not be appropriate,however,to dismiss aepco case on this ground,in view of the board statements in aepco i about taking into account arrangements such as trackage rights in calculating the costs of sarr routes from the new mexico origins,aepco i at the expectations that may have been created by the statements,aepco ii at.the board then advised aepco it w ould be allowed to rely on its rebuttal sac presentation as its,if it d id not wish to prepare a new.id.if aepco chose to rely on its rebuttal evidence,the board advised,the railroads w ould be entitled to demonstrate the inadequacy for purposes of the sac analysis of the usage fee reflected in the existing trackage rights agreement and to show the level at which a usage fee would need to be set to satisfy the objectives of the sac test.id.aepco would then have an opportunity to present rebuttal evidence on that issue.id.
in response to aepco ii,aepco informed the board on november,that it intended to rely on its evidence rather than submit a new.ja.on january,the railroads filed a supplemental evidentiary response,arguing,inter alia,that the trackage rights fee aepco use d in its evidence would be inadequate to cover the full costs of providing service between vaughn and el paso.ja.aepco responded on april,with supplemental rebuttal evidence,asserting that the gtm fee was appropriate because southern pacific transportation company up predecessor on the track segment had voluntarily agreed to the fee in when it dropped its opposition to the merger
