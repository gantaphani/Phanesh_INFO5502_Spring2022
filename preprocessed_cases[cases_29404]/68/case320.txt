petitioner board of water,light sinking fund commissioners of the city of dalton,georgia dalton challenges two orders by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc or the commission permitting the construction of a direct delivery connection between southern natural gas company southern natural gas pipeline and one of dalton current customers,the beaulieu plant beaulieu.the proposed connection will allow beaulieu to bypass dalton.dalton contends that ferc orders are unlawful for several reasons,including that they violate southern tariff and that they were impermissible under various sections of the natural gas act nga.dalton also challenges whether the commission had jurisdiction under the nga to issue the orders permitting the direct pipeline connection,arguing that by approving the bypass connection,the commission intruded into the state regulatory province over local distribution of natural gas.we conclude that the commission had jurisdiction to issue its orders,and that it did not act arbitrarily or capriciously in deciding that the requested bypass connection should be permitted.furthermore,we conclude that the commission did not abuse its discretion by denying the request for an evidentiary hearing.
factual and procedural background 
southern policy concerning direct delivery connections 
the issues involved in this case derive in part from a previous action in which an of natural gas,arcadian arcadian,sought to require southern to grant it a direct delivery connection to southern pipeline.on may,the commission approved a settlement in arcadian case,pursuant to which southern was required to construct a bypass connection for arcadian.furthermore,the settlement required southern to file proposed tariff provisions governing future requests by of natural gas seeking direct delivery pipeline connections.see arcadian southern natural gas,ferc,wl.the direct delivery provision eventually approved by ferc became of southern tariff.section,in relevant part,states 
direct delivery connections 
a as used herein,the term direct delivery connection shall refer to interconnection,measurement,and appurtenant facilities necessary to deliver gas directly to an.
b a shipper may request a new direct delivery connection by submitting to the attention of southern transportation services department,a written request to southern in the format set out in appendix a to these general terms and conditions.if shipper is currently receiving natural gas services from the local distributor servicing the area,or if the direct delivery connection is in the authorized service area of a local distribution company,shipper shall provide a copy of its request for a direct delivery connection to such local distribution company.shipper shall notify southern of the date shipper has complied with this notice requirement,and southern shall not make the filing required by section a of the commission regulations until thirty days after the date shipper notified such local distribution company of its request for a direct delivery connection.
c southern will add a new direct delivery connection if such direct delivery connection is operationally and economically feasible.
d a direct delivery connection is operationally feasible if,with such connection facilities,southern has the existing pipeline capacity to perform the requested service through the proposed direct delivery connection and such service will not impair southern ability to provide service to its existing firm customers.
e a direct delivery connection is economically feasible if the proposed transportation service to be provided through the direct delivery connection will produce a net revenue gain revenue positive,or is revenue neutral to southern.
to the extent that the new direct delivery connection serves an that has historically been served by a firm customer of southern,the proposed transportation service to be provided through the new direct delivery connection will be deemed revenue positive or revenue neutral if the costs set out in section f,and,as applicable,are paid or reimbursed in full by the shipper obtaining the direct delivery connection 
f the costs referenced in sections e and,as applicable are 
all costs,including overhead and taxes,associated with construction of the required direct delivery connection facilities and with any modifications to existing facilities required to maintain service to existing firm customers 
g after the shipper requesting the direct delivery connection executes an interconnection agreement agreeing to pay or reimburse southern in full for the costs set out in section f,and,as applicable,and southern has received all necessary regulatory authorizations to construct,install,and operate the direct delivery connection facilities,southern shall commence construction of the new direct delivery connection in accordance with the terms of such agreement and regulatory authorizations.
southern natural gas tariff,seventh revised.therefore,subject to regulatory authorization by ferc,section requires southern to provide a direct delivery connection to an when such a connection is requested by a shipper,if providing the connection will either result in a revenue gain,or will be revenue neutral,to the pipeline.furthermore,section indicates that a connection will be considered revenue neutral if the shipper agrees to pay or reimburse for all of the costs of the connection to southern.
b.the beaulieu plant and dalton 
beaulieu is a carpet manufacturer that became a natural gas customer of dalton in initially,dalton provided the beaulieu plant with firm gas service,meaning that beaulieu was guaranteed a certain amount of gas and in exchange had to pay reservation or demand charges to dalton,regardless of whether it actually used the gas.but in beaulieu switched to an interruptible arrangement under which it purchases gas from marketers,while retaining the option to purchase gas directly from dalton when its supply from marketers is inadequate.
in,beaulieu began purchasing its natural gas from interconn resources,interconn,a marketer.under its current arrangement,interconn purchases natural gas from third parties,and then transports the gas along southern pipeline.interconn retains title to the gas until it reaches dalton city gate station,at which point title is transferred to beaulieu.dalton then delivers the gas to beaulieu plant and charges a transportation fee to beaulieu.
the gas supplied to beaulieu in this manner accounts for approximately of the total volume of dalton throughput.according to dalton,it has always been able to meet beaulieu natural gas needs.
beaulieu request for a direct delivery connection 
on august,interconn advised dalton that it had been retained by beaulieu to act as its agent in obtaining a direct delivery connection to southern pipeline.interconn informed dalton that it had submitted a request form to southern concerning the necessary facilities.over a year later,on august,southern filed a notice pursuant to and with ferc,proposing to establish the new delivery point for beaulieu.
under the proposal filed with the commission,interconn would purchase natural gas for beaulieu out of state and then ship the gas along southern pipeline to the new facility,at which point title would pass to beaulieu southern would operate the meter station and related facilities,but beaulieu would reimburse southern for its expenses in doing so.in addition,interconn,acting as beaulieu agent,would construct and operate a long pipeline connecting beaulieu plant to the new connection facility.therefore,beaulieu,by itself or through its agent,would construct,own,operate,and pay for the new facilities.
after southern filed its notice concerning the direct connection facility for beaulieu,dalton filed a protest with the commission complaining that southern application violated ferc regulations concerning notice,that the proposed bypass connection did not comply with the applicable requirements from of southern tariff,that the proposed connection was not for the public convenience and necessity as required by of the nga,and that the proposed activities would constitute local distribution over which the commission had no jurisdiction.
treating southern proposal as an application for specific nga c authorization ferc issued an order on april,denying dalton protest and request for an evidentiary hearing,and granting southern authorization to construct the new connection.in particular,the commission found that the proposal was consistent with of southern tariff,that dalton had not shown that it or its customers would be unfairly or unreasonably harmed by the bypass,and that the proposal was justified by ferc policy of encouraging competition between pipelines and local distribution companies ldc.
dalton moved the commission for a rehearing based on the same objections previously asserted,and complained that ferc initial order was arbitrary and capricious,unjust and unreasonable,and unsupported by the record.subsequently,the commission issued additional data requests to southern and interconn,but,on november,it denied the request for rehearing.the commission again found that the proposal,and southern actions,were consistent with the intent behind of its tariff,and with ferc bypass policy.the commission rejected dalton arguments.
dalton filed a timely petition for review of both the april and november orders.southern,interconn,and beaulieu have not intervened or participated in the proceedings before this court.the authorized delivery point on southern pipeline has not yet been installed.
ii.discussion 
ferc jurisdiction over the direct delivery pipeline connection sought by beaulieu 
although dalton challenges the commission actions with respect to approving the bypass connection on numerous grounds,only one issue presented by dalton requires extended discussion.that is whether the commission had jurisdiction,pursuant to the nga,to approve the direct delivery connection facilities,or whether it intruded into areas reserved for state regulation by doing so.dalton notes that ferc jurisdiction is limited to the interstate transport of natural gas and to sales of natural gas to distributors for resale,but does not include regulation of direct sales to retail consumers.because title to the natural gas purchased by beaulieu is to pass from interconn to beaulieu at the site of the proposed new facility,and therefore the sale to beaulieu arguably occurs at that point,dalton contends that the direct delivery connection constitutes a form of local distribution within the jurisdiction of state regulators,rather than ferc.consistent with the other circuit courts that have considered this issue,we conclude that the commission was acting well within its jurisdictional mandate in approving the direct delivery connection for beaulieu.
we review the commission determination that construction of the facility is jurisdictional to ascertain whether the decision has an adequate basis in law.cascade natural gas ferc,cir citations,quotations and brackets omitted.as dalton correctly points out,ferc jurisdiction under the nga is limited,and,in drafting that act,congress intended to leave the states with authority to regulate certain aspects of the natural gas industry.the jurisdictional provision in the nga related to ferc authority to regulate natural gas states 
the provisions of this chapter shall apply to the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce,to the sale in interstate commerce of natural gas for resale for ultimate public consumption for domestic,commercial,industrial,or any other use,and to companies engaged in such transportation or sale,but shall not apply to any other transportation or sale of natural gas or to the local distribution of natural gas or to the facilities used for such distribution or to the production or gathering of natural gas.
b.therefore,congress began by granting ferc broad authority over the interstate transport and sale of natural gas,but then carved out an exclusion leaving states exclusive regulatory authority over intrastate transportation and sales,and in particular over the local distribution of natural gas to consumers.
accordingly,in panhandle eastern pipe line public serv.comm.of,the supreme court stated 
three things and three only congress drew within its own regulatory power,delegated by the act to its agent,the federal power commission ferc predecessor agency.these were the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce its sale in interstate commerce for resale and natural gas companies engaged in such transportation or sale.
the court continued by noting that t he act was drawn with meticulous regard for the continued exercise of state power,not to handicap or dilute it in any way.id.at.at.the nga left the states with authority to regulate retail sales of natural gas and local distribution.general motors tracy,d.the resulting regulatory system under the nga is,therefore,one of complementary federal regulation of the interstate market and congressionally approved state regulation of the intrastate gas trade.id.at.at.
in,the relationship between federal and state regulation of natural gas began to undergo some changes,however,as congress took a first step toward increasing competition in the natural gas market by enacting the natural gas policy act.id.at.at.prior to this shift in policy 
the market structure virtually precluded competition between ldc and other potential suppliers of natural gas for direct sales to consumers,including large industrial consumers.the simplicity of this dual system of federal and state regulation began to erode in,however,when congress first encouraged interstate pipelines to provide transportation services to end users wishing to ship gas,and thereby moved toward providing a real choice to those consumers who were able to buy gas on the open market and were willing to take it free of obligations to the buyer.the upshot of congressional and regulatory developments over the next years was increasing opportunity for a consumer in that class to choose between gas sold by marketers and gas bundled with rights and benefits mandated by state regulators as sold by ldc.but amidst such changes,two things remained the same throughout the period involved in this case.congress did nothing to limit the states traditional autonomy to authorize and regulate local gas franchises,and the local franchised utilities though no longer guaranteed monopolies as to all natural gas demand continued to provide bundled gas to the vast majority of consumers who had neither the capacity to buy on the interstate market nor the resilience to forgo the reliability and protection that state regulation provided.
id.at.at footnote omitted.therefore,the current regulatory framework still reserves for states the right to regulate local distribution,while permitting pipelines,pursuant to ferc jurisdiction,to engage in the interstate transport of natural gas purchased by from other sources in competition with ldcs.
it is against this backdrop that we are called on to decide whether the commission acted within its jurisdiction in approving the direct delivery connection sought by beaulieu.several other courts,and the commission,have addressed this question and have consistently found that the commission does not unlawfully impinge on states regulatory authority by authorizing direct delivery facilities permitting ldcs to be bypassed.see cascade natural gas ferc,cir holding that ferc had jurisdiction to approve bypass connection because arrangement involved interstate sale and transport michigan consolidated gas panhandle eastern pipe line,cir michigan consolidated gas ferc,midwestern gas transmission mccarty,cir noting in dicta that bypass facilities appeared to be within ferc jurisdiction given interstate transportation.
the tenth circuit in cascade engaged in an extensive analysis of whether ferc had jurisdiction to authorize bypass connections to.at.as discussed above,the nga reserves for states the authority to regulate local distribution of natural gas.the cascade court stated that local distribution,for purposes of the nga,is comprised of local retail sales to consumers,whether these sales were made by the local distributing companies or directly by the interstate pipelines.id.at emphasis deleted.the court noted that a review of the legislative history of the jurisdictional provisions of the nga confirmed its view that congress cleanly adopted the bright line between sales for resale and direct retail sales drawn by the earlier commerce clause cases.id.at.
next,the cascade court considered the nature of the bypass transactions involved in that case to determine whether ferc was intruding into local distribution.the court noted that the commission had approved construction to enable the pipeline to transport gas interstate for hire,pursuant to sales.id.at.noting that no sales were taking place by the pipeline at the location of the bypass connection,the court concluded that,q uite simply,the bypass transactions do not entail the realm of local retail sales that congress intended to reserve to the states because there is no evidence that congress intended to preserve state regulation over the interstate transportation for hire pursuant to an sale.id.the court also rejected the notion that ferc lacked jurisdiction because the bypass involves the functional equivalent of local distribution.id.at.
both the and the sixth circuits have reached the same on similar facts,holding that the commission operated within its jurisdiction over the interstate transportation of gas when it approved bypass arrangements.in michigan consolidated gas ferc,the circuit considered whether ferc had authority to approve a bypass arrangement even if the direct connection would have local effects on ldcs.the court stated that it had no difficulty in holding that ferc had jurisdiction over the bypass arrangement because t he arrangement in dispute involve d merely interstate transportation of natural gas,a subject matter clearly within the commission jurisdiction.id.at.the court concluded that t he present arrangement is the subject of federal regulation pursuant to the nga because the arrangement involves the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce,not a local sale and the pipeline role under the arrangement is simply to transport the gas from one state to another across several intervening states.id.the court further acknowledged that the sale of natural gas to the was retail rather than wholesale,but found that fact to be of no consequence to the jurisdictional issue before it because the bypass arrangement approved by ferc involved only the interstate transport of the gas purchased by the,rather than any approval of the retail sale.id.at.
the sixth circuit later adopted the circuit approach,and found that ferc acted within its jurisdiction in approving a bypass connection for an.see michigan consolidated gas panhandle eastern pipe line,cir.the court concluded that the arrangement involved interstate transport by the pipeline,and that if congress intended to exclude the functional equivalent of local distribution from ferc jurisdiction,it could have done so explicitly.id.at.
in light of this precedent,we now consider whether the commission had jurisdiction to approve the bypass for beaulieu.we agree with the approach taken by the sixth,tenth,and circuits,and would follow those courts without much discussion,except that this case has one factual distinction.in each of those cases,the purchased the natural gas out of the state,and sought a direct connection from the pipeline,with the natural gas being transported interstate over the pipeline to the at the new bypass tap facility.consequently,it was clear that none of those cases involved a local sale.in this case,however,it is interconn,rather than the beaulieu,who will purchase the natural gas out of state and have it transported by the pipeline to the direct delivery connection facility.the title to the natural gas will pass to beaulieu at the new facility,thereby arguably effecting a local sale.
despite this factual distinction,we readily conclude that the commission had jurisdiction to approve the bypass arrangement at issue in this case.as with the previous bypass cases,the only part of the arrangement approved by the commission is clearly related to the interstate transportation of natural gas.consequently,the approved facilities fall squarely within the commission jurisdiction.while the new facilities arguably facilitate a local retail sale from interconn to beaulieu,and that sale may or may not be subject to state regulation,the commission clearly did not pass on that sale like the circuit in michigan consolidated,we do not believe that the existence of local effects which may be subject to state regulation deprives the commission of authority to regulate the interstate transport of natural gas an issue squarely within ferc jurisdictional mandate.michigan consolidated,at.
further support for our determination comes from the supreme court recent decision in new york ferc,d,addressing ferc jurisdiction over the transmission and sale of electricity.although the jurisdictional provisions related to electricity are not the same as the ones governing natural gas,they are similar in that they provide ferc with regulatory authority over the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce and the sale of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce,while leaving to states the regulation of local distribution and local retail sales.id.at.furthermore,similar to the natural gas industry,the electric energy industry has undergone significant changes since the time that congress undertook to regulate it.the current system permits the functional unbundling of wholesale generation and transmission services,thereby permitting consumers to seek power generation,transmission,and ancillary services from multiple sources,rather than just from one utility company.id.at.therefore,a consumer now may purchase electricity from an wholesaler,and contract with a another utility to have the electricity transmitted to its location,while bypassing a local distributor.
at issue in new york was whether ferc properly asserted jurisdiction over the interstate transmission of electricity to such retail consumers.in answering this question,the supreme court concluded that the commission exercise of jurisdiction over the interstate transmission to an of electricity was proper in light of the clear and specific grant of jurisdiction to ferc over interstate transmissions,even though it facilitated a retail sale that would otherwise be outside of ferc jurisdiction.id.at quotations omitted.in reaching this conclusion,the supreme court stated 
this statutory text thus unambiguously authorizes ferc to assert jurisdiction over two separate and selling.it is true that ferc jurisdiction over the sale of power has been specifically confined to the wholesale market.however,ferc jurisdiction over electricity transmissions contains no such limitation.because the fpa authorizes ferc jurisdiction over interstate transmissions,without regard to whether the transmissions are sold to a reseller or directly to a consumer,ferc exercise of this power is valid.
furthermore,the court stated that the fact that retail sales are generally subject to state regulation does not deprive ferc of jurisdiction over interstate transmissions.id.at.the court found significant the fact that the commission had expressly declined to consider the retail sale portion of the arrangements,instead limiting its jurisdictional reach to issues related to the interstate transmission of electricity pursuant to an unbundled,retail sale.id.at.
we find the new york case instructive as to the supreme court method of determining the proper boundaries of ferc regulatory authority.this decision clearly reveals the significance of unambiguous statutory language.see also cbs,primetime joint venture,cir noting that plain meaning of statute controls its interpretation.
as was true in new york,the commission in this case acted within the letter of its statutory jurisdictional grant when it approved the facilities at issue because those facilities related to the interstate transport of natural gas.also similar to new york,it is of no consequence that the commission exercise of its jurisdiction facilitates a retail sale,because the commission did not
