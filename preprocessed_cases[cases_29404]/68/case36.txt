the state of new york and the public service commission of the state of new york collectively,new york petition this court for review of two final orders of the federal energy regulatory commission ferc,insofar as the orders adopt standards and procedures for determining which power distribution facilities are subject to the agency regulatory jurisdiction and which facilities fall within the statutory exception for local distribution of electric energy.see revisions to electric reliability organization definition of bulk electric system,order,ferc,clarified and reh g denied,order a,ferc.new york contends that the standards and procedures are an unreasonable interpretation of the agency statutory grant of jurisdiction.see chevron,natural res.def.council.it further challenges the standards and procedures as arbitrary and capricious under the administrative procedure act.see.we conclude that these arguments are without merit and,therefore,deny the petition for review.
background 
a.the governing statute and regulatory regime 
the federal power act,as amended in,see,tit.ii,stat,codified at et,grants the federal power commission,and now its successor agency ferc,regulatory authority over interstate aspects of the nation electric power system.see a.congress specifically excluded from this jurisdictional grant facilities used in local distribution or only for the transmission of electric energy in intrastate commerce.id.b.regulation of these exempted facilities is reserved to the states.see,new york ferc,connecticut light power fed.power comm n.the statute does not define facilities used in local distribution.thus,from until the time of the challenged orders,ferc employed a test set out in the to identify facilities falling within the statutory exemption from jurisdiction.see new york ferc,at.
for many years,ferc exercised its statutory jurisdiction essentially as an economic regulator,overseeing the market for the sale of electricity in interstate commerce.see see also connecticut light power fed.power comm n,at observing that purpose of federal power act was primarily to regulate the rates and charges of the interstate energy.after the northeast united states experienced a blackout in the summer of,however,congress expanded ferc regulatory authority by enacting the electricity modernization act of,tit.xii,stat.that act authorizes ferc to adopt and enforce mandatory technical reliability standards for facilities that make up the national energy grid.see authorizing ferc to impose reliability standards on facilities that comprise system,defined to include facilities and control systems necessary for operating an interconnected electric energy transmission network.the act does not require ferc to develop these standards for itself.rather,it directs ferc to certify an outside organization to develop such standards subject to agency approval.see c,d.to fill this role,ferc certified north american electric reliability corporation nerc,an organization that had previously developed a series of voluntary technical standards for the industry 
at the same time,however,the statute maintains the federal power act jurisdictional exception by specifying that the system does not include facilities used in the local distribution of electric energy.id.a.again,the statute neither defines facilities used in local distribution nor instructs as to how such facilities should be identified.
development of the challenged orders 
in,ferc adopted a number of reliability standards proposed by nerc.see mandatory reliability standards for the bulk power system,order,ferc.in so doing,however,ferc expressed concern that nerc proposed method for identifying facilities subject to the new standards which involved deferring to the determinations of various regional councils left gaps in coverage that would defeat the electricity modernization act goal of ensuring a stable and reliable nationwide power grid.see id,at.ferc therefore directed nerc to revise its proposed definition of the bulk electric to eliminate regional discretion and,instead,to establish a uniform set of rules that include an operating voltage threshold,specific facility configurations to be included or excluded from the bulk electric system notwithstanding their operating voltage,and a process for facilities to seek exemptions from the regulations.see revision to electric reliability organization definition of bulk electric system,order,ferc,at.various entities,including new york,argued that ferc directive would result in the agency exceeding its regulatory jurisdiction by presumptively subjecting local distribution facilities operating above a default voltage threshold to federal regulation.ferc rejected this argument and proceeded with its directive,clarifying that nerc would also develop criteria for determining which facilities operating above the default threshold might nevertheless qualify for the local distribution exclusion,and that ferc itself would conduct a factual inquiry on exemption where specified criteria failed to yield a determinative answer as to whether a facility was engaged in local distribution.see revision to electric reliability organization definition of bulk electric system,order a,ferc,at.
in early,nerc submitted its new proposed standards and procedures for identifying facilities within the bulk electric system,which ferc proceeded to publish for industry and public comment.see revision to electric reliability organization definition of bulk electric system and rules of procedure,notice of proposed rulemaking,ferc.approximately persons and entities commented,including new york,which again voiced objections.nevertheless,in december,ferc issued order,the first of the orders here at issue.that order essentially adopts nerc proposed standards and procedures for identifying power transmission facilities that are part of the bulk electric system subject to federal regulation.see order,ferc,at.these standards and procedures may be grouped into three categories.
first,any facility with an operating voltage at or exceeding kilovolts kv is presumed to be part of the nation bulk electric system,while any facility with a lower operating voltage is presumed to be engaged in local distribution.see id,at observing that this threshold will remove from the bulk electric system the vast majority of facilities that are used in local distribution,which tend to be operated at lower,sub kv voltages.
second,notwithstanding these presumptions,the order specifies five facility configurations that are to be included in the bulk electric system,and four configurations that are to be excluded therefrom,regardless of their operating voltages.see id.one exclusion in particular,identifies facilities that operate at over kv but,nevertheless,constitute a local network.the descriptions of the inclusions and exclusions,which are detailed and quite technical,are reproduced in the margin 
third,even if,at the first two steps of analysis,a facility appears to come within ferc regulatory jurisdiction,the order affords two avenues for individualized review.one permits a facility falling within federal jurisdiction to seek a technical exemption from the reliability requirements,a decision initially made by nerc but appealable on application to ferc.see id,at.separate and independent from that process,a facility that thinks it is engaged in local distribution,and that is not already excluded from ferc jurisdiction at the first two steps of analysis,can petition ferc for an individualized determination of jurisdiction.that determination is made by reference to all relevant factors,including those set forth in the earlier test.further,procedures are employed in making the decision,thereby allowing all interested parties to be heard.see id,at.
challenged order is subject to a grace period,affording parties time to plan for and implement the reliability requirements,to request technical exemptions therefrom,and to petition for individualized jurisdictional review.a subsequent order has extended that grace period to july.see revisions to electric reliability organization definition of bulk electric system and rules of procedure,ferc.
new york unsuccessfully sought rehearing on order,see order a,ferc,whereupon it timely filed the instant petition for review of both orders and 
ii.discussion 
new york petition for review asserts two claims.first,new york argues that the challenged orders unreasonably construe ferc statutory jurisdiction by a using an operating voltage threshold that sweeps into the national bulk electric system some exempt facilities engaged in local distribution and b employing impermissible procedures to identify exempt facilities only after already exercising jurisdiction,while then requiring facilities to shoulder the burden of demonstrating their exemption from ferc jurisdiction.see chevron,natural res.def.council.second,new york asserts that the challenged standards and procedures are arbitrary and capricious under the administrative procedure act.see.
a.the chevron challenge to ferc interpretation of its jurisdiction 
as new york recognizes,because it challenges ferc interpretation of jurisdiction conferred by statutes that the agency is charged with administering,our review properly follows the analysis outlined in chevron,natural resources defense council.see city of arlington,fcc,holding chevron analysis applicable to agency determination of its own statutory jurisdiction 
at step one,we look to whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue because,if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter.chevron,natural res.def.council,at accord united states home concrete supply,llc,holding that judicial identification of clear congressional intent in statutory text precludes agency from adopting different interpretation new york ex rel.state office of children family servs.dep t of health human,cir same.new york does not and can not contend that its challenge to ferc interpretation of its statutory jurisdiction can be resolved at this step of analysis.as already noted,the federal power act does not define facilities used in local distribution or only for the transmission of electric energy in intrastate commerce.b.nor does the electricity modernization act clearly identify transmission facilities used in the local distribution of electric energy.id.a.
where statutes are thus silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue in dispute,a court must proceed to step two of chevron analysis.chevron,natural res.def.council,at.at that step,we deem congress to have delegated the resolution of statutory ambiguity to the administering agency,so that our judicial task is simply to determine whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.accord city of arlington,fcc.at stating that question court faces when confronted with challenge to agency interpretation of a statute it administers is always,simply,whether the agency has stayed within the bounds of its statutory authority emphasis omitted torres holder,cir approving board of immigration appeals interpretation of immigration and nationality act.that inquiry is deferential,asking only whether the agency interpretation is reasonable,while respect ing legitimate policy choices made by the agency.chevron,natural res.def.council,at,accord national cable telecomms.ass brand x internet servs,describing chevron step two as asking whether agency construction is a reasonable policy choice internal quotation marks omitted mcnamee dep t of the treasury,cir same see also transmission access policy study grp.ferc,according chevron deference to ferc interpretation of federal power act exception for facilities used in local distribution,b,because phrase is undefined and ambiguous,aff sub nom.new york ferc.
the kv standard 
new york contends that adoption of a kv threshold to define the bulk electric system is an unreasonable construction of ferc statutory jurisdiction because the system,so defined,can include facilities engaged in local distribution,which are exempt from ferc jurisdiction.the argument might persuade if ferc treated operation at kv or greater as determinative of jurisdiction.in fact,it does not.
as an initial matter,ferc choice of the kv threshold is grounded in nerc findings that the vast majority of kv and above facilities operate in interconnected transmission networks within the national power grid.see order,ferc,at.new york does not challenge this factual finding.further,the kv threshold is used only to set a preliminary jurisdictional boundary,which is always subject to generally applicable adjustments and,upon request,to individualized ones.the nine generally applicable adjustments,see supra note,are based on inclusions and exclusions from the bulk electric system without regard to the operating voltage threshold.the two individualized adjustments afford facilities subject to federal jurisdiction technical exemption from reliability requirements,or more relevant here provide for ferc to conduct a holistic review of whether a particular facility is used in local distribution so as to fall outside federal jurisdiction.in sum,when the kv threshold is properly understood in this context as a preliminary,not determinative,factor it does not signal ferc unreasonable construction of its regulatory jurisdiction to extend to local distribution facilities operating above a kv threshold.
nor is a different conclusion warranted by new york assertion that ferc established the kv threshold more to further its policy interest in uniform reliability standards than accurately to delineate between facilities subject to and exempt from its regulatory jurisdiction.whatever policy interests may have animated ferc challenged orders,our singular concern on chevron review is whether ferc acted unreasonably in employing a kv threshold to clarify an otherwise ambiguous statutory distinction between power facilities over which it does and does not have regulatory jurisdiction.because there is record support for the selection of a kv threshold as an initial standard,and because that standard is not determinative but subject to general and individualized adjustments,we conclude that ferc did not act unreasonably in including such a threshold within a larger scheme of standards and procedures for clarifying its statutory jurisdiction.
procedural challenges 
new york argues that ferc unreasonable construction of its statutory jurisdiction is further evident in the defective procedures it proposes to use to distinguish facilities subject to and exempt from that jurisdiction.new york carries a heavy burden in making this argument because judicial review of the procedure an agency fashions to discharge its statutory duties is generally deferential.see vermont yankee nuclear power natural res.def.council,absent constitutional constraints or extremely compelling circumstances the administrative agencies should be free to fashion their own rules of procedure and to pursue methods of inquiry capable of permitting them to discharge their multitudinous duties.internal quotation marks omitted.
here,new york faults the challenged orders for not requiring an express factual finding that a given facility is not used in local distribution as a precondition to the exercise of federal jurisdiction.it contends that the orders also impermissibly require facilities to shoulder the burden of proving their exemption from federal regulatory jurisdiction.new york further complains that the orders provide for only facilities not state regulators to petition for individualized review of jurisdiction.intervenor national association of regulatory utility commissioners naruc adds that ferc unreasonably construes its jurisdiction in requiring a facility to apply to nerc for a technical exemption before petitioning ferc for an individualized assessment of jurisdiction.none of these arguments persuades.
before discussing each argument in turn,we note new york general reliance on two cases to challenge order procedural structure connecticut light power federal power commission,and federal power commission florida power light.connecticut light power emphasizes the need for explicit agency findings excluding the local distribution exception to federal regulatory jurisdiction so as to give assurance that the bounds of federal jurisdiction have been accurately understood and fully respected.at.not only had the agency in that case failed to make any such findings,but also,the supreme court doubt ed whether by application of the statute as herein construed it could have done so.id.
in florida power light,the supreme court held that regulatory jurisdiction under the federal power act can be exercised only if there is substantial evidentiary support for the commission conclusion that interstate transfer of electricity had occurred.at.the court ruled that persuasive expert opinion supported by empirical evidence,even if not rising to the level of certainty,can satisfy this requirement.see id.at.
these propositions that in the face of a statutory exception,ferc must support its exercise of jurisdiction by explicit findings,and that those findings must be based on substantial evidence undoubtedly control here.see b the commission shall not have jurisdiction over facilities used in local distribution id.b the finding of the commission as to the facts,if supported by substantial evidence,shall be conclusive.but new york errs in construing the challenged orders to allow ferc to exercise jurisdiction without complying with these mandates.
first,the orders do not provide for ferc to exercise regulatory jurisdiction before determining whether a facility falls within the statute local distribution exception.rather,the orders establish a procedure for the factfinding requisite to the exercise of such jurisdiction pursuant thereto,the threshold finding of kv operation is followed by further factfinding as to five specified inclusions and four exclusions.moreover,the factfinding process continues still further if a facility not found within the local distribution exception after operating voltage and configuration consideration petitions ferc for individualized review.only if this assessment,subject to the full process,reveals that the facility is part of the bulk electric system and not within the local distribution exception,will federal regulatory jurisdiction be exercised.
in sum,the challenged orders do not authorize ferc to regulate any facility in advance of a factually supported,explicit determination of jurisdiction 
second,contrary to new york assertion,the fact that a facility must petition for an individualized assessment of jurisdiction under the challenged orders does not mean that the facility bears the burden of proving that it falls within an exception to jurisdiction.certainly,no language in the orders imposes such a burden on facilities,and ferc disclaims it in its brief to this court.see resp t br.c ontrary to new york argument,the commission has not impermissibly shifted the burden of determining its jurisdiction.accordingly,we identify no unreasonable construction of ferc jurisdiction in the petitioning process 
third,new york complains that ferc permits only facility owners,not state regulators acting on behalf of a facility,to petition for an individualized assessment of jurisdiction.this particular argument is not properly before us because new york did not raise it before ferc.see b no objection to the order of the commission shall be considered by the court unless such objection shall have been urged before the commission in the application for rehearing unless there is reasonable ground for failure to do so.in its petition for rehearing of order,new york argued that ferc should not be excluding state regulators from the local distribution determination process.in denying rehearing,ferc clarified that the challenged orders effect no such exclusion.to the contrary,because a requested individualized assessment of jurisdiction is made via the process,all interested parties including state regulators are afforded the opportunity to be heard.see order a,ferc,at.new york never argued that ferc was obligated to allow state regulators to file petitions for individual jurisdictional determinations,rather than merely to allow them to participate in such proceedings once initiated by a facility,and offers no reasonable ground for its failure to do so.b.accordingly,the statutory exhaustion requirement precludes us from considering that argument for the first time here.
fourth,intervenor naruc procedural complaint that ferc requires facilities to apply to nerc for a technical exemption before they can petition ferc for an individualized determination of jurisdiction merits little discussion.as ferc clarified in denying rehearing of order,the filing of a jurisdictional petition is not conditioned on a prior filing for a technical exemption.rather,the two processes are independent avenues by which a facility may seek different forms of relief.nerc technical exemptions excuse certain facilities from compliance with reliability standards even though they fall within ferc regulatory jurisdiction.by contrast,a petition for an individualized jurisdictional determination ensures that local distribution facilities are properly excluded from ferc regulatory jurisdiction despite preliminary factfinding placing them within the bulk electric system.see order a,ferc,at.thus,the challenged orders do not impose unwarranted procedural obligations as preconditions to a facility petitioning for individualized review of jurisdiction.
accordingly,we identify no merit in new york and intervenor naruc arguments that procedures established by the challenged orders indicate ferc unreasonable construction of the scope of its regulatory jurisdiction over electric power distribution facilities.
arbitrary and capricious action 
independent of our chevron review of an agency interpretation of a statute it administers,the administrative procedure act requires us to set aside agency action that is arbitrary or capricious.a see green island power auth.ferc,cir reviewing ferc actions under a standard.the mere fact that an agency rescinds one rule and adopts another is not arbitrary or capricious where the new rule is supported by reasoned decisionmaking and there are no circumstances requiring further explanation,such as contradictory findings of fact or substantial reliance interests on the old rule.see fcc fox television stations,accord mei fun wong holder,cir.in making these determinations,we may not ourselves the evidence or substitute our policy judgment for that of the agency.see islander pipeline mccarthy,cir.indeed,ferc factfinding is conclusive if supported by substantial evidence.see b.
the supreme court has explained that s ubstantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla.it means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.universal camera nlrb,internal quotation marks omitted accord nlrb g t terminal packaging,cir see also dte energy ferc,citing universal camera standard in denying petition for review of ferc determination that facilities were subject to federal jurisdiction.in making such a determination,we review the record in its entirety,considering evidence opposing,as well as supporting,the agency challenged action.we recognize,however,that the agency is equipped or informed by experience to deal with a specialized field of knowledge here,the science and economics of transmitting electrical power and that its findings within that field carry the authority of an expertness which courts do not possess and therefore must respect.universal camera nlrb,at accord nlrb g t terminal packaging,at.thus,we may not displace an agency choice between two fairly conflicting views,even though we would justifiably have made a different choice had the matter been before us de novo.universal camera nlrb,u.at.rather,reversal based upon a factual question will only be warranted if,after looking at the record as a whole,we are left with the impression that no rational trier of fact could reach the conclusion drawn by the agency.nlrb katz delicatessen of houston,cir internal quotation marks omitted accord nlrb g t terminal packaging,at.that is not this case.
the record amply demonstrates the serious consideration ferc and its designated agent,nerc,gave over a period of several years to the standards and procedures that would allow it objectively and effectively to identify facilities within the nation system while respecting the jurisdictional exception created by congress for local distribution facilities.during that time,ferc amassed and considered an extensive array of factual material,as well as scores of comments submitted by interested parties in response to the agency published preliminary proposals.the agency provided reasoned explanations,spanning hundreds of pages,for adopting the standards and procedures here at issue in lieu of its former rule.see order,ferc order a,ferc.
thus,the factual record and the agency industry expertise permitted ferc to conclude that facilities operating above a kv threshold are generally part of the bulk system interconnected transmission networks and are critical in maintaining the reliable functionality of the system as a whole.see order a,ferc,at finding that failure of kv facilities has caused cascading outages that would have been minimized or prevented by compliance with proposed reliability standards.the same record and expertise supported ferc determination that a kv threshold,together with detailed predefined inclusions and exclusions,would effectively identify facilities comprising the bulk system while ensuring that most local distribution facilities were excluded from regulatory jurisdiction as statutorily prescribed.order,ferc,at.
in urging otherwise,new york argues that ferc prior use of a test concedes that local distribution determinations are fact sensitive and can not be made on the basis of categorical rules.the point merits little discussion because,as already observed,ferc did not abandon individualized factfinding in the challenged orders.rather,after determining that an operating voltage threshold together with five prescribed inclusions and four exclusions will accurately delineate its jurisdiction in most cases,it has adopted those criteria simply as default rules applicable unless a facility requests an individualized determination.in fact,the operating voltage threshold and prescribed inclusions and exclusions appear to consider many of the same factual circumstances as does the test,reduced voltage,radial configuration,and direction of power flow,although with more specificity.see supra notes.nevertheless,upon request for an individualized determination,ferc will employ the full process to consider not only the seven factors previously employed to determine local distribution,but any factor relevant to a jurisdictional determination.this hardly reflects arbitrary and capricious action.
iii.conclusion 
to summarize,we conclude that the standards and procedures established in challenged ferc orders and a both reasonably interpret the agency regulatory jurisdiction under the federal power act as amended by the electricity modernization act of and,thus,satisfy the standard of judicial review under chevron,natural resource defense council,and are not arbitrary and capricious but,rather,are supported by sufficient explanation and substantial evidence as required by the administrative procedure act.
we have considered new york remaining arguments and have found them to be without merit.accordingly,the petition for review of ferc orders and a is denied.
i concur in the judgment,but would deny the petition on a related ground.
if new york were challenging how ferc defines the statutory terms local distribution or system,i would agree with the majority that the challenged regulations must be upheld under chevron,natural resources defense council.new york is not advancing a definitional challenge,however.instead,it is making a procedural argument that ferc can not use a kv as a good but imperfect proxy for classifying local distribution facilities because ferc must conclusively resolve jurisdictional issues before exercising regulatory authority 
i would uphold the regulations on settled principles i an agency is entitled to great deference when formulating rules of procedure and methods of inquiry,vermont yankee nuclear power natural res.def.council,and ii that deference is not diminished simply because the agency procedures bear on issues of jurisdictional significance,city of arlington,fcc.
the majority resolves this case as a matter chiefly of statutory construction,but new york challenge is not that the kv threshold is a definition of local distribution.see.nowhere in its briefs does new york make a chevron argument the chevron argument is expressly disavowed thus,the problem is not whether ferc can lawfully interpret a term.petitioners reply br.
new york argument is surely procedural.the parties agree that the kv threshold filters out most but not all local distribution facilities,see oral arg.tr,the test either alone or in conjunction with additional considerations adequately identifies local distribution facilities,id,and local distribution facilities not filtered out by the kv threshold can request individualized adjudication applying the seven factors,id.
new york objection is to the timing of these steps,and runs as follows because the kv threshold is an imperfect filter,some local distribution facilities will become subject to ferc reliability regulations.and while those facilities may petition for individualized adjudication,some may choose not to.and as to that subset of facilities,ferc would be exercising its regulatory authority in excess of its jurisdiction.
that argument fails 
absent constitutional constraints or extremely compelling circumstances the administrative agencies should be free to fashion their own rules of procedure and to pursue methods of inquiry capable of permitting them to discharge their multitudinous duties.
vermont yankee,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.the kv threshold functions as a rule of procedure and a method of inquiry,filtering out facilities very likely to qualify as local distribution facilities,those below the threshold,and allowing ferc to concentrate its regulatory efforts on those facilities much less likely to qualify as local distribution facilities,those above the threshold.without some such sorting mechanism,ferc would have to determine the status of every facility individually,even those that fall clearly on one side or the other of the divide.
new york has identified no constitutional constraints or extremely compelling circumstances that would warrant imposing such a wasteful procedure.vermont yankee,at.an agency enjoys broad discretion in determining how best to handle related,yet discrete,issues in terms of procedures and priorities.mobil oil exploration producing se.united distribution,citations omitted.local distribution facilities that generate more than kv or fall within one of the inclusions may have an interest in avoiding regulation by ferc but such interest is adequately protected by the opportunity to seek individualized adjudication after the application of the kv threshold but before the imposition of any substantive regulations 
new york suggests that the deference owed to ferc procedures under vermont yankee is diminished because the challenged regulations bear on the exercise of ferc jurisdiction.see petitioners reply br.because jurisdictional facts determine ferc ability to exercise regulatory authority in the first place,new york argues,such facts must be adjudicated case by case.
as the supreme court explained in city of arlington,the seeming distinction between jurisdictional and nonjurisdictional challenges to agency action is a mirage.at.while a court power to decide a case is independent of whether its decision is correct,the same is not true for agencies.id.at emphasis added.for agencies,both the power to act and how they are to act is authoritatively prescribed by congress,so that when they act improperly,no less than when they act beyond their jurisdiction,what they do is ultra vires.id.emphases added.t he question in every case is,simply,whether the statutory text forecloses the agency assertion of authority,or not.id.at.
city of arlington was decided in the chevron context.but the lesson of city of arlington is that there is no subset of big,important jurisdictional questio
