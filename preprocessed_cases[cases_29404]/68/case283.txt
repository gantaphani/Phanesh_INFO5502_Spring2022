we must decide whether a california municipality and a california public utility which operates an auction for trading electricity are entitled to extraordinary relief from nonfinal orders of the federal energy regulatory commission addressing the crisis surrounding california restructuring of its electricity market.
in,the california legislature embarked upon a major restructuring of the california power industry with the passage of assembly bill ab or electricity restructuring act.act of september,cal.legis.serv.west.several features of this complex legislation and the decisions of the california public utilities commission cpuc implementing the restructuring are relevant to the petitions before us.
first,ab provided for the creation of the california power exchange calpx,a nonprofit entity that would provide an auction market for the trading of electricity.electricity restructuring act c.calpx commenced operations in march.initially,it operated only a auction for and electricity trading the calpx spot markets or the calpx core markets.calpx would determine,on an hourly basis,a single market clearing price which all electricity suppliers would be paid based on short term demand and supply bids submitted by calpx participants.in the summer of,calpx opened its calpx trading services cts division to operate a block forward market by matching supply and demand bids for long term electricity contracts cts forwards market.the calpx is deemed a public utility under the federal power act fpa hence,it is subject to the jurisdiction of the federal energy regulatory commission ferc and operates pursuant to a tariff and ferc wholesale rate schedules pacific gas electric,ferc,at,wl november,reh g denied,ferc,wl.
california restructuring plan called for the electricity generation assets of the state three main utilities ious,san diego gas and electric company sdg e,southern california edison sce,and pacific gas and electric company pg e,to undergo a process of market valuation,which resulted in the ious divestiture of a substantial portion of their electricity generation facilities.order instituting rulemaking on commission proposed policies governing restructuring california electric service industry and reforming regulation cal.pub.util.comm decision,wl,at et,cpuc dec.in turn,for a transition period,the ious were required to sell all of their remaining generation capacity into,and to purchase all of their required electricity supply from,the calpx spot markets,and such purchases were deemed to be prudent per se by the cpuc,wl,at pacific gas,ferc,at san diego gas,ferc,at,wl,reh g pending the december order.we henceforth refer to this obligation as the requirement.
in,the cpuc permitted the ious to purchase a limited percentage of their combined load in the cts forward contract market the balance of their load was to be purchased in the calpx spot market.but calpx was to continue to operate as the exclusive market for the ious electricity needs and its spot markets would continue to provide the benchmark for the cpuc prudence review.see act of july,cal.legis.serv.west,codified at cal.pub,repealed by act of february,cal.legis.serv.west opinion regarding bilateral contracts cal.pub.util.comm decision,wl,at.
ab also called for the creation of the california independent system operator,a nonprofit entity charged with managing the state electricity transmission grid.electricity restructuring act c.as manager of the grid,the also operates a real time imbalance energy market to ensure that electricity supply meets demand at the time of delivery.
finally,ab provided that the deregulation of the california power industry would proceed in several phases.the deregulation of the wholesale,more properly,the partial deregulation of the wholesale market,considering that the ious wholesale purchases were constrained by the requirement,the cpuc limitations on forward contracting,and the calpx the first phase of the scheme.deregulation of the retail market was to come later.ab provided for a ten percent retail rate reduction for certain customers and a retail rate cap through,or until the ious recovered their stranded costs,whichever came first.electricity restructuring act b,e.

a series of ferc proceedings followed,culminating in several orders directly relevant to the petitions before us.in its november order,ferc specifically found that,under certain conditions,wholesale power rates in the california market were unjust and unreasonable within the meaning of a of the fpa,a.ferc,at.while observing that certain external factors,such as an increase in natural gas costs and a general electricity supply shortage,contributed to the summer wholesale electricity price spikes,id.at,ferc concluded that the electricity market structure and market rules devised by california restructuring plan were seriously flawed and a significant cause of the unjust and unreasonable rates in california,id.at.further,ferc found clear evidence that california market rules and structures provided electricity wholesale sellers the opportunity to exercise market power during periods of tight supply,although there was insufficient evidence at the time for ferc to come to definitive conclusions concerning the actions of individual sellers.id.at.
the central structural flaw of the california restructuring plan,according to ferc,was its on the spot market.the cpuc mandatory requirement,which forced the ious to sell all of their generation capacity into,and to purchase all of their electricity supply needs from,calpx,coupled with the cpuc limitations on the ious forward contracting,exposed the ious to volatile spot market price spikes and prevented them from managing their risks more effectively through contracting.id.at.on the spot market also exposed the ious to the possible exercise of market power in the calpx by wholesale sellers during periods of short supply.finally,cpuc limitations on contracting in favor of the calpx and markets produced a chronic underscheduling of electricity supplies,turning the real time imbalance energy market,the market of last resort,into a significant market participant by forcing the to make last minute purchases for up to percent of total statewide electricity in excess of the maximum five percent total statewide load which the imbalance market was originally intended to handle.ferc,at.
in its december order,ferc adopted a number of remedies to address these flaws in the california electricity market rules and structures.first,and most importantly,it eliminated the calpx requirement.ferc stated that eliminating any mandated reliance on the spot market represents the single most important aspect of wholesale market reform and is one of the most critical components of all the immediate market reforms necessary to correct the problems in california electric markets and provide protection of customers.id.at.this measure,which took effect immediately,permitted the ious to manage their risks more effectively through forward contracting,decreasing their exposure to spot market price spikes.id.at.in addition,it further reduced the ious exposure to the spot market by returning to them megawatt hours mwh of their own generation capacity indeed,the december order actually precluded the ious from selling all but their surplus generation into the calpx or any other wholesale markets.id.at effective on the date of this order,the ious are no longer authorized to sell their resources into the px however,t o the extent the ious resources exceed their load at various times,they are free to sell any surplus at wholesale,pursuant to their rate schedules.
because the ious participate in both the california retail as well as interstate wholesale markets,however,they fall within the jurisdiction of both the cpuc as well as ferc.ferc noted that its proposal to eliminate the mandatory requirement had received overwhelming support from almost all interested parties except the cpuc.in fact,the cpuc specifically declared that ferc elimination of its buy requirement does not eliminate the california commission buy requirement,and emphasized that its buy requirement would remain in place until the cpuc itself removed it.id.at.
faced with the cpuc refusal to abandon its reliance on the spot,in the face of the cpuc explicit declaration that it would continue to require,whether directly or indirectly,that the ious continue to procure the bulk of their power needs through the calpx spot was forced to take the unusual step of terminating the calpx wholesale tariff and rate schedules,including its cts forwards market rate schedule,effective april.in this way,ferc eliminated calpx ability to operate as an exclusive mandatory exchange id.at.at the same time,ferc explicitly invited calpx to reconstitute itself as an independent exchange with no regulatory mandated products and offer the services needed by market participants.id.at.see also order clarifying order directing remedies for california wholesale electric markets,ferc,wl,explaining that t he px is free to revise its cts tariffs to remove the spot market components of its existing rate schedules,and to file them pursuant to fpa section and,if appropriate,to seek waiver of the notice period.
one other prospective structural remedy instituted by ferc in its december order is relevant to the petitions before us its imposition of a temporary mwh breakpoint in the calpx spot markets and the real time imbalance energy market through april.rejecting sdg e request for a mwh wholesale price cap,ferc instead imposed a soft cap in the calpx and markets as both a price mitigation measure and a market monitoring device.under the soft cap,any trades above will not set the single market clearing price for all buyers.the breakpoint thus represents a limitation on the single price auction format of the calpx spot markets.the soft cap does not,however,preclude individual suppliers and purchasers from entering into transactions in excess of,and sellers will continue to receive their amounts.ferc,at.at the same time,the december order subjects transactions in excess of to certain reporting and monitoring requirements to facilitate ferc investigation into exercises of market power by wholesale sellers.id.at.
in addition to its prospective structural remedies,ferc intimated in both its november and december orders that retroactive from wholesale sellers of electricity subject to ferc also be warranted.in its november order,ferc provisionally established october,as the refund effective date,the terminus post quem for the transactions subject to potential refund liability pursuant to the provisions of the fpa.ferc,at.further,ferc ruled that,henceforth,all sales of electricity into the california market through december would likewise be subject to potential refund liability.id.at.however,ferc declined to require immediate refunds in either order,finding that it could not yet reach definite conclusions about the actions of individual sellers and intimating that further would have to be undertaken before it could rule on the refund requests.id.at see also ferc,at observing that ferc had not yet made findings about whether particular rates charged by specific sellers were unjust and unreasonable.
on march,ferc issued its first order concerning refunds in the california wholesale power market.see order directing sellers to provide refunds of excess amounts charged,ferc,wl march,march order.this order was limited to the january period.relying largely on and calpx filings,ferc for the first time established a provisional formula governing refunds.the march order directs wholesale sellers of electricity into the california market to provide refunds or offsets or,alternatively,to justify their charges and costs,for transactions made during stage emergencies that were above a rate screen,which for the january period ferc calculated at ferc estimated that some million in january electricity sales would be subject to refunds and stated that it would use this same methodology to calculate potential refund obligations for the period from february to april at the same time,ferc again declined to rule on retroactive refund requests for the october,to december,period.
meanwhile,claiming that it could not comply with the mwh breakpoint or attendant reporting and monitoring requirements in a cost effective manner,calpx suspended operations in its spot markets at the end of january.in addition,facing the imminent termination of its cts forwards market rate schedule and unwilling to file new rate schedules which would allow it to operate a bilateral forwards market,calpx saw trading in its cts division come to a virtual halt since the december order.on march,calpx filed for protection under chapter of the bankruptcy act.
calpx petitions for a writ of mandamus staying three components of ferc december order the prohibition on the ious from selling power on a voluntary basis into the calpx markets the termination of its wholesale tariff and cts rate schedule,effective may,and the imposition of the interim breakpoint in its core markets.calpx does not,however,challenge ferc elimination of the mandatory requirement.
the gravamen of the city of san diego the city petition for mandamus,on the other hand,is that ferc has unreasonably delayed taking action on california wholesale power purchasers requests for refunds,particularly for the october,to december,period.
we consolidated these petitions because they each,at root,challenge ferc authority to address conditions creating unjust and unreasonable rates by altering market rules and structures.in essence,both calpx and the city seek to limit ferc to the traditional panoply of remedies appropriate for rate regimes.
judicial review over final orders of ferc is governed by section of the fpa,which provides 
any party to a proceeding under this chapter aggrieved by an order issued by the commission in such proceeding may obtain a review of such order in the united states court of appeals for any circuit wherein the licensee or public utility to which the order relates is located or has its principal place of business,or in the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia,by filing in such court,within sixty days after the order of the commission upon the application for rehearing,a written petition praying that the order of the commission be modified or set aside in whole or in part no objection to the order of the commission shall be considered by the court unless such objection shall have been urged before the commission in the application for rehearing 
b.thus,pursuant to b,a ferc order is not final for purposes of our review until ferc has ruled on an application for rehearing.see reynolds metals ferc,jurisdiction lacking in court of appeals until after ferc rules on application for rehearing.because applications to rehear the november and december orders are still pending before ferc,we do not yet have jurisdiction to review them pursuant to b.

we first address calpx petition for mandamus.
calpx asks us to stay ferc termination of its wholesale tariff and rate schedules,particularly its cts forwards market rate schedule.calpx argues that ferc may not simply eliminate existing tariffs and rate schedules found to be unjust and unreasonable,but must instead modify them so that they become just and reasonable rates under a of the fpa.section a provides,in pertinent part 
whenever the commission,after a hearing had upon its own motion or upon complaint,shall find that any rate,charge,or classification,demanded,observed,charged,or collected by any public utility for any transmission or sale subject to the jurisdiction of the commission,or that any rule,regulation,practice,or contract affecting such rate,charge,or classification is unjust,unreasonable,unduly discriminatory or preferential,the commission shall determine the just and reasonable rate,charge,classification,rule,regulation,practice,or contract to be thereafter observed and in force,and shall fix the same by order.
emphasis added.under calpx reading of the statute,if ferc terminates a tariff or rate schedule as unjust or unreasonable,as it did in its december order,it must then substitute a new tariff or schedule.calpx emphasizes the unprecedented nature of ferc termination of its tariff and rate schedules.the precedent to which calpx refers us,however,arose in the context of traditional regulatory regimes.
ferc authority under a to remedy rules and structures adversely affecting rate regimes can not be read so narrowly.indeed,as the supreme court has held in the context of the natural gas act,the counterpart to the fpa,agencies created to protect the public interest must be free,within the ambit of their statutory authority,to make the pragmatic adjustments which may be called for by particular circumstances surely the commission broad responsibilities therefore demand a generous construction of its statutory authority.fpc.power light,d internal quotations and citations omitted.
we are unconvinced that calpx has presented a clear and certain claim that ferc violated a by terminating its tariff and rate schedules.pursuant to a,ferc may eliminate rule s,regulation s,or practice s affecting rates,and then establish a new rule,regulation,or practice,a emphasis added,that will assure just and reasonable rates in the future.it is at the very least arguable that the language of a is sufficiently broad to permit ferc to eliminate a tariff or rate schedule entirely,particularly in the context of a rate regime,if it also establishes rules,regulations,or practices that will result in just and reasonable rates.ferc contends that it did just that with the entire range of remedies in its december order 
we agree that the remedial measures contained in the december order must be construed as a whole in assessing ferc compliance with a.as discussed above,according to ferc,on spot markets,the calpx core and the real time imbalance markets,lies at the very heart of the high prices in california.december order,ferc,at.the remedies crafted by ferc in its december order,taken together,eliminated a number of market rules and practices responsible for such undue reliance on volatile spot markets and replaced them with new rules and practices designed to mitigate price volatility risks through forward contracting.these remedies included eliminating the mandatory calpx requirement to permit risk management through forward contracting,instituting the mwh breakpoint to mitigate the potential of the single price auction format to magnify spiraling spot markets prices,returning mwh of their own generation to the ious to reduce further their exposure to spot market price volatility,and terminating calpx tariff and wholesale rate schedules to prevent it from continuing to operate as a mandatory exclusive exchange.ferc actions,taken together,appear to be fully consistent with a.
according to ferc,among the features of the california electricity restructuring plan responsible for unjust and unreasonable wholesale electricity rates were direct and indirect cpuc rules forcing the ious into the calpx spot markets.elimination of the mandatory requirement,which calpx does not challenge here,was not sufficient to redress the problem,however.indeed,the cpuc affirmatively represented to ferc that it would persist with its own buy requirement for the ious and would continue to look to the calpx spot markets as the benchmark against which to measure the prudence of the ious contracts.ferc,at.ferc reasonably concluded that termination of the calpx tariff and rate schedules was necessary to facilitate forward contracting by the ious free from the chilling effect produced by the cpuc continuing reliance on the calpx spot markets as the benchmark for prudence.id.at.
given that certain delivery,bid,and settlement provisions of the current cts rate schedule are dependent upon the calpx spot markets,termination of the cts rate schedule was the inevitable result of the termination of the calpx core market schedules.see order,ferc.indeed,calpx itself has emphasized the connection between the cts forwards market and the calpx and markets,stating that the efficacy of the cts depends on a robust forward market like the calpx market to serve as a benchmark for pricing the value of forward transactions at or near the time of physical delivery.we recognize the importance of properly functioning markets for valuing forward transactions.calpx,however,overlooks the fact that ferc specifically found that its markets were not functioning properly,but were instead vulnerable to the exercise of market power and,indeed,producing unjust and unreasonable rates under certain conditions calpx does not challenge the factual basis of this finding.the fact that the flawed calpx core markets continued to serve as benchmarks for forward contracts simply underscores the placed on spot markets by the california restructuring plan and the cpuc in particular.ferc has established a provisional benchmark for forward contracts based on rates and has invited calpx to file a new cts rate schedule that is not dependent upon spot markets.calpx so far has declined ferc invitation 
calpx complains that it has been essentially caught in the between the cpuc and ferc.we do not dispute this point.see,ferc,at.nevertheless,calpx is not thereby entitled to mandamus relief.in light of what it regarded as the recalcitrance of the cpuc,ferc concluded that termination of calpx tariff and rate schedules was necessary to address defective market rules and structures skewing the wholesale markets under ferc own jurisdiction.while ferc termination of calpx rate schedules was perhaps unprecedented,we are not convinced that ferc lacks authority under a of the fpa to address the structural flaws of a rate regime through the termination of a public utility wholesale tariff and rate schedules in circumstances such as these.
ferc december order not only eliminated the mandatory calpx requirement,it prohibited the ious from selling all but their surplus generation into wholesale markets.to the extent that ferc has thereby prohibited voluntary sales into the calpx markets,calpx challenges this provision as unduly discriminatory and arbitrary.
calpx suggests that ferc restriction on the ious wholesale sales of their own generation applies only to sales into calpx but not to sales into competing markets,such as intervenor automated power exchange.hence,according to calpx,ferc order is unlawful because it is unduly discriminatory within the meaning of a of the fpa.we find calpx reading of the december order untenable.the stated purpose of the restriction was to subject the ious approximately mwh of generation to the state retail ratemaking authority instead of the commission ratemaking authority thereby effectively this portion of the market.december order,ferc,at.cle
