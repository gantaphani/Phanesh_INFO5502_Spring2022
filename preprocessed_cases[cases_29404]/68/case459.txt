arkansas electric energy consumers and petition for review of opinion and of the federal energy regulatory commission.in those opinions the commission approved the merger of the entergy and gulf states systems under of the federal power act fpa,and an amendment to the entergy system agreement under fpa,to add gulf states as an entergy operating company upon approval and consummation of the merger.see entergy,opinion,ferc,wl opinion entergy,opinion,ferc,wl opinion.petitioners principally contend that opinion violates prohibition against undue discrimination because the system agreement treats gulf states,which has no history of with respect to the entergy system generating facilities,similarly to the four electric operating companies eocs arkansas power light company,louisiana power light company,mississippi power light company,and new orleans public service,have long histories.petitioners also contend that the commission erred in not holding an evidentiary hearing on wholesale electric competition before approving the merger.we deny the petition.

the fpa provides for rehearing of a commission order,provided the request is filed within days of the order.a.thereafter,a party or other person aggrieved has days from the denial of rehearing to seek judicial review.id.b.application for rehearing by the commission is a prerequisite to seeking judicial review.id.a.no objection to the commission order may be raised on appeal to the court unless it was urged before the commission on rehearing unless there is reasonable ground for failure to do so.id.b.see fpc colorado interstate gas.the commission contends that petitioners have waived their undue discrimination challenges to opinion by failing to raise them on reconsideration of the hearing order.upon review of the record of the proceedings,we conclude that,pursuant to b,petitioners preserved their contentions for judicial review.
in the order setting forth the issues to be addressed at an evidentiary hearing,the commission stated,in relevant part,that the inquiry would focus solely on whether the operating companies and their customers will be adversely affected by gulf states integration into the existing system agreement entergy,order on applications,ferc,wl hearing order.the order also stated that the effect of the merger on rates and costs would be taken into account.id.at this point,petitioners properly could rely on the commission adherence,following the evidentiary hearing,to the requirements of and in addressing the merits of the system agreement amendment.because a party may be adversely affected if it suffers undue discrimination and the term adversely affected has a rather indeterminate meaning in the abstract,it would be unreasonable to expect petitioners to have challenged the standard established in the hearing order before the standard had been applied.put otherwise,petitioners had reasonable ground s to refrain from raising their contentions regarding undue discrimination until a decision on the merits was rendered.b.
upon determining that,in petitioners view,the opinion of the administrative law judge alj following the evidentiary hearing,initial decision,ferc,wl initial decision,had blurred the distinction between and,and failed to protect them against undue discrimination in ratemaking,petitioners raised appropriate objections in an initial brief and in a brief on exceptions to the initial decision.similarly,petitioners raised these contentions in seeking rehearing by the commission of opinion.indeed,on rehearing the commission addressed petitioners undue discrimination contentions on the merits,never suggesting that petitioners had waived their contentions by failing to raise them in seeking rehearing of the hearing order.see,opinion,ferc at.
in now contending that petitioners are making an impermissible collateral attack on the adverse effects test established in the hearing order,the commission relies on bluestone energy design,ferc.the waiver issue in bluestone,however,was not decided under b the petitioner in that case conceded that judicial review was foreclosed under b for failure to file a timely petition for rehearing and sought review under d b,which provides for judicial review of commission orders assessing penalties.the court held that d b prohibited collateral attacks on findings in prior commission orders unless the petitioner had raised an appropriate challenge in a petition for rehearing.see bluestone,at.although the hearing order at issue here was a final order,unlike the liability determination in bluestone,it did not constitute a ruling on the merits as to the issues that petitioners pursued in their request for rehearing of opinion.similarly,the commission reliance on asarco,ferc,is misplaced,for the petitioner in that case failed to raise on rehearing the principal issue for which it sought judicial review and did not argue that it had reasonable grounds for failing to do so.see id.at.
because petitioners have argued throughout the proceedings before the commission,on the appropriate occasions,that its members will be adversely affected unless intrasystem adjustments are made,we hold that petitioners have preserved their and contentions for judicial review under b.
section a of the fpa provides that a ll rates and charges made,demanded,or received by any public utility for or in connection with the sale of electric energy subject to the jurisdiction of the commission shall be just and reasonable,and any such rate or charge that is not just or reasonable is hereby declared unlawful.a.section b provides that it shall be unlawful for a public utility,with respect to any transmission or sale subject to the jurisdiction of the commission,to make or grant any undue preference or advantage to any person or maintain any unreasonable difference in rates,charges,services,facilities,or in any other respect,either as between localities or as between classes of service.id.b.petitioners contend that in approving the addition of gulf states to the system agreement without modifying the agreement rate formulas to reflect gulf state lack of prior contribution to the costs of the entergy system,the commission acted unlawfully in violation of.petitioners point to opinion and where,they maintain,the commission set forth the principle that prevention of undue discrimination requires attention to historical patterns of on the entergy system.because the eocs share a common history of planning and for system generation facilities,petitioners maintain that to avoid undue discrimination gulf states should not be permitted to benefit from the advantageous rate schedules in the system agreement after most of the depreciation costs have been paid.specifically,petitioners proposed to the commission that gulf states be required to make payments to the long of approximately million while receiving fuel benefits from the eocs coal units of approximately million,and that the eocs,as to be given first priority to energy in the system pool.in sum,petitioners contend that in rejecting this proposal,the commission arbitrarily disregarded its precedent and the relevant historical setting.
in reviewing the commission decisions,the court role is limited to determining whether the commission complied with the relevant fpa standards and demonstrated that it has made a reasonable decision based on substantial evidence in the record.see power partners,lp ferc.section b prohibits only undue preferences and unreasonable differences in rates.b boroughs of chambersburg ferc.a rate i
