james lichoulas,petitions for review of federal energy regulatory commission ferc or commission orders that terminate his license to operate a hydropower project attached to a historic mill building in lowell,massachusetts.lichoulas argues that ferc use of the implied surrender doctrine to terminate his license was arbitrary and capricious.he also argues that ferc engaged in impermissible ex parte contacts and abused its discretion in denying him an evidentiary hearing.unpersuaded,we deny the petition.
in ferc issued lichoulas a license to construct,operate and maintain the appleton trust project project under part i of the federal power act fpa,a et.james lichoulas,order issuing license minor project,july.the project was designed to generate up to kilowatts of electricity when water from the hamilton canal passes through two on its way to the lower pawtucket canal.
in a letter to lichoulas dated march,ferc noted that the project had been inactive since january.it requested that he submit plans for future operation by may.in june,before lichoulas responded,a fire damaged the property on which the project is located.despite the damage,on september,lichoulas told ferc the project would be up and running near the end of march.letter from james lichoulas,appleton trust,to victoria kaye,ferc.in a march,letter to ferc,however,lichoulas pushed back the target date to summer.
ferc followed up on march,writing to lichoulas that he had failed to keep the commission updated and requesting that he do so before april.receiving no response,ferc sent lichoulas a letter on july,expressing uncertainty that he would ever resume operation.letter from hossein ildari,chief,engineering compliance branch,ferc,to james lichoulas at.it requested that lichoulas submit within days either a plan for resuming operation or a petition for the voluntary surrender of his license.id.days later,on september,lichoulas responded with an itemized repair plan and an estimated completion date of february or march.ferc approved his plan on october.
in october,approximately seven months after lichoulas estimated date of resumed operation,he arranged with the city of lowell city to demolish several buildings on or adjacent to the project property that posed a potential fire hazard.the demolition exposed asbestos,of which remediation began in august.
ferc staff visited the project on july,and saw its roof caved in and debris littering its works.they also learned that,while the project had recently generated power for a short time,it had to be shut down due to vibrations.letter from anton sidoti,regional engineer,ferc new york regional office,to james lichoulas,at july.in a letter dated july,ferc requested that lichoulas provide a repair schedule within ten days.lichoulas made a progress report days later,on september,stating that the project would be operable by march.but he soon revised his estimate to may.in a march,letter ferc responded,as you have been previously advised,failure to operate the project is a violation of the terms and conditions of your license.letter from anton sidoti,regional engineer,ferc new york regional office,to james lichoulas,appleton trust.it told him to resume operation by may,and provide a status report to ferc by june.
in a letter dated september,ferc told lichoulas he had failed to comply with its march mandates.it said he was in violation of section c of the fpa.see c licensee shall maintain the project works in a condition of repair adequate for the efficient operation of said works in the development and transmission of power.accordingly,it said,the commission may revoke your license or take other enforcement actions.letter from hossein ildari,division of hydropower administration and compliance,to james lichoulas,at.it told lichoulas he could stave off such action by filing a plan and schedule for the resumption of project operation within days.id.at.lichoulas responded approximately six months later,telling ferc staff by telephone that he would submit a plan to resume operation by march.but ferc received no such plan and its subsequent telephone calls went unanswered and unreturned.thus,on september,ferc told lichoulas 
since you have not made the necessary repairs to your project to resume operations and the project has not operated regularly since november,pursuant to standard article of your license and section of the commission regulations,we consider the project to be abandoned and that it is your intent to surrender your license.thus,the commission may terminate your license under an implied surrender proceeding.

lichoulas responded in a letter dated december.he apologized for the lack of proper response regarding the status of the project.letter from james lichoulas,to secretary,ferc.he said t he primary problem was that the project property ha d been undergoing a major selective demolition during that process,asbestos was discovered.the asbestos removal and clean up process went on and on for the last several years.id.he said it was his plan to understand sic and develop a full scope of work by early march.id.according to ferc,however,lichoulas never submitted this information.james lichoulas,order terminating license by implied surrender,termination order.
in july ferc received notice that in april the city had obtained the project property by eminent domain as part of an urban revitalization and development plan.see letter from stephen crane,urban renewal project manager,to magalie roman salas,secretary,ferc july.according to the city,at the time of the taking the project was not functioning in fact,it said,the entire property wa s in a significant state of disrepair.id.
on march,ferc issued lichoulas a notice of termination of license by implied surrender and soliciting comments,protests,and motions to intervene.docket no.lichoulas protested on april,arguing that the project dormancy did not reflect an intent to abandon or surrender it but instead resulted unavoidably from the demolition,the asbestos remediation and the city exercise of eminent domain.to establish his intent to restore the project to operation,lichoulas submitted a letter of intent between him and an engineering firm providing for the rehabilitation of the project if he retained his ferc license and regained the property from the city.he also represented that he had a bank line of credit ready to finance the rehabilitation.he asked ferc to hold an evidentiary hearing to explore these and other facts.
at the same time,lichoulas fought the city taking of the project property.in april he filed a lawsuit in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts alleging the taking violated the fpa because the property contained a hydropower project.lichoulas city of lowell,mem.of decision and order,at.the district court dismissed the claim without prejudice to plaintiff refiling th e action after the conclusion of the ferc proceedings.id.at capitalization omitted.the first circuit affirmed.lichoulas city of lowell,cir.lichoulas filed a similar suit,including a lis pendens motion,in massachusetts state court in march.lichoulas city of lowell,order den.pl.mot.for lis pendens and allowing def.mot.to dismiss,wl,at.land.june.land.order.the state court dismissed the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.id.at.
meanwhile,over the course of,while working through the implied surrender process,ferc received communications from the office of congresswoman niki tsongas,in whose district the project lies.tsongas sent letters in march and july requesting procedural updates,which ferc provided.also,on august,tsongas herself telephoned ferc acting director of external affairs.later on august,tsongas office sent the acting director an email with a memorandum attached.the memorandum was addressed to tsongas from one of her staff.it recommended that the congresswoman call ferc to put pressure on the commission to either a provide an update on the timetable for issuing the order which terminates lichoulas license,or b promptly issue an order which terminates the license.mem.from kate to nt at attached to email from brian martin,district director,office of congresswoman niki tsongas,to patricia schaub,ferc,tsongas memo.according to ferc,the email with attachment was placed in its record of this matter.james lichoulas,order den.reh g,order den.reh g.the office of external affairs received another email from tsongas office on august,which,according to ferc,merely ask ed about the status of the case and it responded accordingly.id.

lichoulas argues that we should vacate the termination order and the order denying rehearing because ferc implied surrender determination was arbitrary and capricious,ferc engaged in prohibited communications while adjudicating the matter and ferc abused its discretion by denying him an evidentiary hearing.ferc contests all three arguments and also maintains we are without jurisdiction to review its action because lichoulas lacks article iii standing.we address standing first and then reach,seriatim,lichoulas three arguments.
to have standing lichoulas must show injury in fact,causation and redressability.see lujan defenders of wildlife,ass of flight dep t of,sierra club epa.ferc argues lichoulas can not show redressability because he has already,separately,lost ownership of and access to the project.resp t br.it asserts that lichoulas has offered no reason to believe that reversal of the license termination would cause the city to return the project property to him or otherwise to allow him access to repair and operate the project.id.at.because the city obtained the project property by eminent domain,it argues,reversal of ferc orders will not yield the redress lichoulas seeks.
ferc argument fails because it addresses the wrong injury.the injury of which lichoulas complains here is the termination of his license to operate the project.ferc directly caused this injury and we can redress it by vacating its orders.lichoulas does not challenge his lost ownership of and access to the project here he challenged that injury in separate suits regarding the city exercise of eminent domain.see lichoulas city of lowell.lichoulas city of lowell.land.the crucial question here is whether granting his petition would redress the injury caused by,the termination of lichoulas license.plainly it would.indeed,if the complainant is an object of the action or foregone action at issue as is the case nearly always in review of an should be little question that the action or inaction has caused him injury,and that a judgment preventing or requiring the action will redress it.sierra club,at quoting defenders of wildlife,at.
moreover,that ferc license termination has caused lichoulas injury is clear because of its effect on his prospects for regaining ownership of and access to the project.a significant increase in the likelihood that the litigant would obtain relief that directly redresses the injury suffered will suffice for standing.parks conservation ass manson,quoting utah evans.in his eminent domain litigation,lichoulas argued the city taking violated the fpa because he holds a valid ferc license.see lichoulas,at.order at.land.order,wl,at.accordingly,both the federal and state courts in massachusetts have noted that the resolution of lichoulas petition to us will have a significant impact on his eminent domain challenges.order at t he validity of lichoulas license lies at the heart of this case.land.order,wl,at t he issue at the heart of this dispute is whether plaintiff ferc license was valid at the time of the taking if plaintiff is successful before the dc circuit,then his challenge to defendant taking will lie under the fpa.thus,should lichoulas succeed here,he will significantly increase the likelihood of prevailing in his eminent domain challenges and therefore make it more likely that he will regain ownership of and access to the property.this suffices for redressability and ultimately,because injury in fact and causation are not in question,for standing

ferc regulations and the standard articles of lichoulas license provide for implied surrender.specifically,provides that if a licensee 
shall cause or suffer essential project property to be removed or destroyed,or become unfit for use,without replacement,or shall abandon,or shall discontinue good faith operation of the project for a period of three years,the commission will deem it to be the intent of the licensee to surrender the license.
article of the license contains language virtually identical to section and,in addition,provides for implied surrender if the licensee shall refuse or neglect to comply with the terms of the license and the lawful orders of the commission.at see order issuing license,license subject to the articles set forth in form october except article.
ferc application of implied surrender has evolved over time.in it noted that it had only rarely had to resort to the procedure to address a licensee failure to live up to the obligations of its license.power.in a footnote,it elaborated that s uch cases have included situations where licensees had abandoned project operation a number of years earlier,had sold the project without prior commission approval and then been dissolved as a corporate entity,or had otherwise abandoned the project facilities and could not be located.id.at.those examples proved to be less than comprehensive,however,when in the commission applied the doctrine in fourth branch assocs.mechanicville niagara mohawk power,reh g denied,pet.for denied.in that case,two ferc licensees were at loggerheads after the collapse of several agreements regarding their joint hydropower project.id.at.niagara mohawk power corporation niagara mohawk wanted to transfer or surrender the license.id.fourth branch associates fourth branch wanted to continue as a licensee and restore the project to full operation.id.at.ferc found implied surrender.id.at.it first noted that t he doctrine has typically been invoked when the licensee,by action or inaction,has clearly indicated its intent to abandon the project,but has not filed a surrender petition.id.at.but it also made clear that the key element is the licensee failure to live up to the obligations of its license.id.at.it noted that fourth branch lacked financing,did not own the project property and had been evicted from the site.id.at.thus,ferc concluded that,because niagara mohawk d id not want to operate the project,and fourth branch desire to continue as a licensee wa s evidently not matched by an ability to carry out the license terms,implied surrender applied.id.at.ferc recently reaffirmed this expanded applic
