in pacific northwest generating coop.dep t of energy pngc,cir,amended on denial of reh g,wl cir,this court held invalid a central provision of a contract between the bonneville power administration bpa and the aluminum company alcoa,alcoa.less than a month after we issued the pngc opinion,bpa announced that it and alcoa had agreed to an amended version of the invalidated provision that would govern the period ending september,the original contract would have expired in september.petitioners pacific northwest generating cooperative pngc,public power council ppc,and industrial customers of northwest utilities icnu challenge bpa decision to execute the amended contract.
we agree with the petitioners challenge and therefore grant their petitions for review.although under no obligation to contract with alcoa,bpa agreed voluntarily to make a nearly million cash benefit payment to the aluminum company,so that the company could purchase power from one of bpa competitors.bpa justifications for this unusual transaction,under which the agency received nothing directly in exchange for its million,do not demonstrate that the transaction was consistent with sound business principles,as required by bpa governing statutes.we therefore hold that bpa exceeded its statutory authority when it agreed to the alcoa contract amendment.
background 
a.the pngc opinion 
in pngc,we invalidated a central provision of a contract the contract between the bonneville power administration and alcoa,one of bpa direct service industrial dsi customers.under the invalidated provision,bpa had agreed to sell power to alcoa at a mutually rate,below both the market rate and the statutorily authorized industrial firm power ip rate.see pngc,at.the provision at issue did not,however,require bpa to sell physical power to alcoa.rather,bpa had agreed to monetize the power sale by making cash benefit payments to alcoa in an amount approximately equal to the difference between the higher wholesale market rate for power and the lower contract rate multiplied by the amount of power consumed by alcoa each month see id.at.the idea was that alcoa could use the monetary benefit payments to subsidize its purchase of power on the wholesale market,such that the aluminum company net power costs would be approximately equal to the contract rate assuming that various caps on the monetary benefit were not triggered.see id.
we held this monetization provision invalid on the ground that t he decision to monetize embodied in the agreements violated bpa statutory obligation to provide the lowest possible rates to consumers consistent with sound business principles.id.at.we explained 
in essence,bpa has voluntarily agreed to forgo revenues by charging the dsis a rate below what is authorized by statute,the ip rate and below what is available on the open market.these foregone revenues result in higher rates for all other customers.this outcome is in apparent and direct conflict with bpa statutory mandate,see,and renders bpa decision to monetize the dsi contracts in an amount reflective of those underlying rate a capped suspect.
we then considered and rejected as flawed bpa three proffered justifications for this decision.id.at.in so doing,we noted that b y subsidizing the dsis smelter operations beyond what it is obligated to do,bpa is simply giving away money,id.at,and that such an act was not reflective of a philosophy,id.at quoting ass of pub.agency customers,bpa apac,cir.we also explained that bpa authority to sell power to the dsis does not mean that bpa may simply give money to the dsis by calling the agreement a power sale with monetized service benefits.pngc,at emphasis in original.
we concluded our discussion of the validity of the monetary benefit provision of the contract with the following summary 
in sum,bpa has not advanced a reasonable interpretation of its governing statutes that supports its actions.golden nw.aluminum bpa,cir.nor has the agency shown how offering the dsis rates below the market rate and below what it is statutorily authorized to offer further s bpa business interests consistent with its public mission.ass of pub.agency customers,at.we conclude that bpa decision to offer the subsidized rates to the dsis and then monetize those rates is inconsistent with bpa statutory authority under the nwpa,and therefore hold that the monetization provisions of the aluminum contracts are invalid.
the pngc opinion was filed on december.two weeks later,on december,bpa sent a letter to its regional customers and stakeholders,including petitioners.in the letter,bpa informed its customers that,in light of the pngc opinion,the agency would cease making monetary benefit payments to alcoa.
the agency also announced a proposed amendment to the contract so that service thereunder will conform to the pngc opinion.the critical change that bpa proposed was that the parties would begin using the ip rate as the basis for the monetary benefit calculation,rather than the previous contract rate which,as noted,was below the ip rate.bpa also informed its customers that the amendment would only govern sales to alcoa from january,through september.
bpa concluded its letter by providing a web address where interested parties could view the proposed amended contract.the agency also stated that it would accept public comments about the amendment until january,less than a week later.although it recognized that it was providing only a limited time to comment on the proposed amendment,the agency stated that it believe d that it is important to implement this amendment in a timely manner to avoid,if possible,any unnecessary interruption of smelter operations,especially given the difficult economic times and potential loss of additional jobs in the region.
b.the amended contract 
on january,bpa signed the amended contract.like the contract,the amended contract did not require bpa to deliver physical power to alcoa.instead,bpa once again agreed to provide a monetary benefit to alcoa,which alcoa could then use to offset the cost of purchasing physical power on the open market.
unlike under the previous contract,however,the monetary benefit in the amended contract is calculated using the ip rate as the base rate,rather than an rate lower than the ip rate.more specifically,bpa agreed in the amended contract to pay alcoa the difference between a forecasted market rate for power of mwh and the ip rate of is,every megawatt hour of power purchased by alcoa on the open market between january,and september,up to a total of million 
bpa announced the execution of the amended contract in a letter to its customers dated january.in the letter,bpa explained the reasons for its decision to enter into the amended agreement 
bpa decided it was necessary to move quickly to implement the amendment and avoid,if possible,any unnecessary interruption of smelter operations,especially given the difficult economic times and potential loss of additional jobs.alcoa announcement of substantial worldwide layoffs and columbia falls aluminum company announcement of a likely plant closure reinforced our view that it was important to act quickly.as a consequence,a limited amount of time was available for public comment.while we would have preferred to afford customers more time to comment on the proposed amendment,bpa believed it had to move quickly due to the circumstances.
this amendment is an interim action that applies to payments through fy only.we now have time to address the fy period under the block contract,and will use that time to more thoroughly engage with the public on the terms for any amendment or replacement agreement for the fy period.
bpa understands that it must address the issue associated with payments made under the block contract during the fy period,and intends to engage the region once we have an opportunity to consider all these arrangements more thoroughly.
two months later,on march,bpa announced that it had executed a nearly identical amendment to its contract with a second aluminum dsi,columbia falls aluminum company cfac.the validity of the amended cfac contract is not part of this appeal.the announcement of the cfac deal is relevant,however,because in that announcement,bpa provided more detailed explanations of its reasons for entering into the alcoa contract amendment.those reasons included the fact that dsi loads have historically benefitted bpa by taking power in relatively flat blocks that require little or no shaping they have taken power from bpa at light load hours,when power has historically been difficult to market and they have provided the administrator with additional power reserves.the agency also averred that changing technologies in the aluminum and power industries may permit dsi smelters to provide value to bpa in ways that have not yet been imagined.thus,the agency concluded,it would be unwise and imprudent to refuse to provide service to customers that may provide future value to bpa as they have done in the past.bpa also expressed concern about the impact of a refusal to execute the amended agreement,stating that the dsis currently have no viable alternative for its power needs and a decision not to sell power to dsis would almost surely have the immediate consequence of the plants shutting down and perhaps never resuming production.
finally,the agency acknowledged that the monetary benefits offered to alcoa and cfac would result in an increase in rates for its other customers.it nonetheless concluded that the contracts were reasonable because the agency did not believe that the proposed amendment,which covers only a nine month period at a relatively modest cost,causes unreasonable upward pressure on rates.
c.the current petitions 
petitioners pngc,ppc,and icnu filed petitions challenging the validity of the amended contracts on january,january,and april,respectively.the petitions were consolidated on april,and are the basis of the current appeal.
ii.standard of review 
we affirm bpa actions unless they are arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or in excess of statutory authority.pngc,at quoting aluminum of america bpa,cir.in determining whether bpa has acted in accordance with law,we defer to bpa reasonable interpretations of its governing statutes.golden nw.alum.bpa,cir see also pngc,at.
iii.analysis 
petitioners maintain that by entering into the amended alcoa contract,bpa acted in contravention of its statutory obligation to provide the lowest possible rates to consumers consistent with sound business principles.in essence,the petitioners argue that bpa decision to enter into a contract that required it to pay up to million to a customer the agency was not obligated to serve is not a transaction that a rational business would enter.the petitioners further assert that bpa proffered justifications for the decision once again fail to establish that the decision was reasonable.
bpa defends the validity of the amended contract on three grounds.first,the agency contends that it has no independent obligation under pngc to demonstrate that a sale of power or monetization of a sale of power to the dsis at the ip rate must also satisfy the sound business principles standard.emphasis in original.in bpa view,so long as it offers alcoa power or its monetary equivalent at the ip rate,it has acted within its statutory authority and complied with this court holding in pngc.second,bpa maintains that the sound business principles standard is so suffused with discretion that it can not supply a basis for a justiciable federal claim because it provides no law to apply.in other words,according to bpa,even if the agency has an independent statutory obligation to act in accordance with sound business principles,any decision it makes pursuant to that obligation is not reviewable.finally,bpa asserts that,assuming its decision to enter into the amended contract is reviewable under the sound business principles standard,the decision comports with such principles.we address each of these arguments in turn.
bpa has an independent obligation to act in a manner consistent with sound business principles.
bpa argument that it need not independently demonstrate that its decision to sell power to alcoa at the ip rate was consistent with sound business principles hinges on this panel repeated references in pngc to the agency improper decision to monetize the sale of power to the dsis at a rate below what is authorized by statute,the ip rate and below what is available on the open market.see pngc,at.bpa cites the following sentence as particularly clear evidence of this court narrow and straightforward holding 
because,by its own admission,bpa is not obligated to sell power to the dsis,its decision to sell power voluntarily at a rate below what it is statutorily required to offer,the ip rate and below what it could receive on the open market violates its statutory mandate to act in accordance with sound business principles.see.
id.at.according to bpa,this statement indicates that,had it used a rate that was equal to the ip rate or the market rate in the contract,it would,by definition,not have violated its statutory mandate to act in accordance with sound business principles.in short,bpa views its decision to premise its benefits to alcoa on the ip rate as a kind of safe harbor that insulates it from a challenge that its decision to enter into the amended contract was not consistent with sound business principles.
bpa interpretation of pngc ignores critical aspects of that opinion and is therefore incorrect.first,the panel in pngc agreed with bpa that it has no statutory obligation to sell power to alcoa.see id.at.second,the court in pngc concluded,and bpa in that case acknowledged,that the agency is subject to a statutory obligation to act in accordance with sound business principles.see id.at.other panels have similarly recognized that bpa is required by statute to operate with a philosophy and have reviewed bpa compliance with this standard.see,public power council,bpa,cir apac,at dep t of water power of the city of los angeles bpa,cir see also portland bpa,cir noting that bpa is charg ed to function as a business.
given that bpa is not obligated to sell to the dsis and that its actions are generally reviewable under the sound business principles standard,it follows that a decision by bpa to enter into a contract with a dsi,like other contractual decisions made by the agency,see apac,at,must also conform to the sound business principles standard.bpa would surely have to consider the fact that it must offer dsis the ip rate when deciding whether to execute a contract with the dsis.see pngc,at holding that if the agency chooses to offer firm power to the dsis,it must first offer them the ip rate.but the fact that the agency entered into a contract at the ip rate does not insulate from review its voluntary decision to enter into the contract in the first place.
to put it slightly differently,bpa is certainly authorized to sell power to the dsis at the ip rate.see pngc,at.but that authority,like its authority to enter into contracts generally,is cabined by its obligation to operate with a philosophy.apac,at reviewing bpa decision to enter into extension agreements with the dsis for the sale of unbundled transmission services see also pngc,at bpa authority to sell power to the dsis does not mean that bpa may simply give money to the dsis by calling the agreement a power sale with monetized service benefits.emphasis omitted.
intervenor cfac,another aluminum dsi,argues that this interpretation of bpa governing statutes would render the ip rate a nullity,because it would never make business sense for bpa to sell to the dsis at the ip rate when market rates exceed the ip rate,and dsis would never accept the ip rate when market rates fall below the ip rate.we disagree.
we can envision several situations in which bpa might reasonably conclude that a rate sale to the dsis is a sound business decision.first,as the court alluded to in pngc,bpa governing statutes likely require it to offer power within the pacific northwest at established rates before the agency may sell power outside the region.see pngc,at if so,bpa might reasonably enter into a contract with the dsis at the ip rate so as to free up power to sell outside the pacific northwest.id.
second,bpa has asserted that the physical sale of power to the dsis has indirect benefits that might offset a rate sale.for example,bpa noted in its letter explaining its justifications for the amended contract with cfac that dsi loads have historically benefitted bpa by taking power in relatively flat blocks that require little or no shaping they have taken power from bpa at light load hours,when power has historically been difficult to market and they have provided the administrator with additional power reserves.these and other benefits to bpa could very well justify a rate sale,but they have no direct application when,as here,bpa is not in fact physically selling power to the dsis.
third,a soundly run business might reasonably offer a large customer a discount with the expectation that the customer future business at higher prices will more than make up for the loss of revenue.similarly,a reasonable business might offer a discount to a customer in order to diversify its customer base or to offload unused capacity.
as these examples they are only examples,not meant to be decision by bpa to enter into a power sale contract with the dsis at the ip rate,even if the ip rate is below market rates,could under various circumstances be consistent with sound business principles as explained below,however,although we review such a decision by bpa with great deference,see apac,at,the decision must still be reasonable and have some support in the record before the agency at the time the decision is made.
in sum,we hold that bpa voluntary decision to contract with the dsis,like its other contractual choices,must conform to the congressionally imposed requirement that the agency act in a manner consistent with sound business principles.see a.the mere fact that bpa has chosen to contract with a dsi at the statutorily authorized ip rate does not insulate the decision to contract from review under the sound business principles standard 
b.the sound business principles standard provides adequate law to apply.
bpa next argues that even if its decision to contract with alcoa is subject to the sound business principles standard,that standard is so suffused with discretion that it provides no law to apply and can not form the basis of our review in forwarding this position,bpa relies on city of santa clara andrus,cir,and aluminum of america bpa alcoa,cir,cases that bpa claims definitively ruled that judicial review can not be premised on the sound business principles standard.
although we fully acknowledge that actions taken by bpa in furtherance of its business interests are entitled to particular deference,see pngc,at,we reject bpa argument that such decisions are unreviewable,for several reasons.
first,bpa contention that its business decisions are entirely unreviewable is directly at odds with this court precedent,as well as with a supreme court case,united states city of fulton,d.as already noted,we have,on multiple occasions,held that actions taken by bpa in furtherance of its business interests,while owed significant deference,are nonetheless reviewable.see pngc,at,apac,at public power council,at bell bpa,cir dep t of water power,at.
in apac,for example,bpa asserted that its decision to begin wheeling power was a valid exercise of its broad statutory authority to contract in its best business interests.apac,at.in evaluating this argument,the court noted that t he statutes governing bpa operations are permeated with references to the sound business principles congress desired the administrator to use in discharging his duties.id.at.in the court view,these references provided bpa with an unusually expansive mandate to operate with a philosophy.id.this unusually expansive mandate did not,however,preclude the court from reviewing the agency decision for reasonableness.see id.after performing this review,the court concluded that the bpa decision to begin wheeling power,a decision that was intended to increase bpa competitiveness in a recently deregulated market,appear ed reasonable and was therefore entitled to deference.see id.at.
in pngc,bpa likewise argued that its decision to provide cash payments to the dsis furthered its statutory mandate to operate in accordance with sound business principles.see pngc,at.as in apac,we noted that this court is particularly deferential to bpa when the agency acts in furtherance of its business interests.id.at.we nonetheless held that bpa conclusion that a specific action was consistent with sound business principles was reviewable for reasonableness.see id.
bpa assertion that the sound business principles standard is too vague to support review is also undermined by our decision in public power council.in that case,we expressly relied on the sound business principles standard to review a decision by bpa to revise upward its previously approved wholesale power rates.public power council,at.ultimately,we concluded that i n light of the eximious reasons for bpa acting in the way it did,we are not able to say that bpa failed to proceed in accordance with sound business principles.id.at.although we affirmed bpa actions in public power council,our holding clearly indicates that we did not find the sound business principles standard too indeterminate to support any review,however deferential.
finally,in bell,we reviewed bpa decision to buy out its contractual obligations to supply suddenly power to dsis at uneconomically low prices during a recent energy crisis.see bell,at.the court concluded that bpa decision to amend its contract obligations was eminently businesslike,given the probably devastating result of performing the original contract id.at.the court therefore refused to the wisdom of bpa winning business decision,especially when it was responding to unprecedented market changes.id.implicit in this holding,however,is an assumption that the court would an action by bpa that was not eminently.see also dep t of water,at citing a requirement that rates be designed consistent with sound business principles and holding that,as a result of this and other legislative requirements,a decision by bpa to implement a policy designed to mitigate revenue shortfalls was not only statutorily authorized but statutorily mandated.
as these cases demonstrate,the law of this circuit is clear when congress imposed a duty on bpa to operate in accordance with sound business principles,see apac,at,it imposed a requirement that was capable of supporting review.
our approach in all these cases,like our holding in this case,is consistent with the supreme court approach in city of fulton to review under a different statute containing sound business principles language.in city of fulton,the supreme court held that section of the flood control act imposed a statutory obligation on the secretary of energy to protect consumers by ensuring that power is sold at the lowest possible rates consistent with sound business principles.at.quoting united states cooperative,cir.the court then reviewed an action by the secretary for consistency with that standard,ultimately affirming the secretary action on the ground that the action was reasonable and well suited to meeting this obligation.see id.at.so,the supreme court,too,has recognized that consistent with sound business principles language provides a reviewable standard.
second,precedent aside,there is no basis for concluding that this is one of the rare instances where a statute is drawn in such broad terms that in a given case there is no law to apply.heckler chaney,d quoting citizens to preserve overton park volpe,d.the statutory requirement that bpa operate in a manner consistent with sound business principles is at least as specific as other statutory mandates held sufficient to permit judicial review.
for example,keating faa,cir,held that an faa administrator decision was reviewable where the relevant statute required that the decision be made in the public interest.see id.at.similarly,city of los angeles dep of commerce,cir,determined that a statute requiring the secretary of commerce to use statistical sampling if he considers it feasible provided a meaningful standard for the court to review the secretary decision not to use sampling.see id.at see also barber widnall,cir holding a decision of the secretary of the air force not to correct a military record reviewable where the governing statute allowed the secretary to make a correction when the secretary considers it necessary to correct an error or remove an injustice.and,of course,it is that courts may review ferc determination that a given electricity rate is just and reasonable.see morgan stanley capital group pub.util.dist.of snohomish county,d see also gallo winery encana,cir.if we may review whether a decision was in the public interest or whether a particular act was feasible or just and reasonable,we can certainly review whether an action is consistent with sound business principles.
moreover,courts routinely review the rationality of business decisions in other contexts.for example,under the common law business judgment rule,courts are required to defer to business decisions made by a corporation board of directors,unless the directors,among other things,act in a manner that can not be attributed to a rational business purpose.brehm eisner,see also navellier sletten,cir affirming district court formulation of the business judgment rule as requiring a director to r ationally believe that the director business judgment is in the best interest of the corporation.
even more relevantly,the sixth circuit,in interpreting a statutory directive very similar to the statutory requirements at issue here,concluded that there was sufficient law to apply.see mccarthy middle.membership,cir.in mccarthy,the sixth circuit held that an electric cooperative decision to incur expenses,if proven true,would clear ly violate the cooperative statutory duty under tennessee law to provide its members with electricity at the lowest cost consistent with sound business principles.id.at citing ann.
the statute at issue in rank nimmo,cir,which was found not to provide law to apply,provides a useful contrast to the statutes held to permit review in the cases just surveyed.in rank,the relevant statute provided that the administrator of the veterans administration may,at the administrator option,accept assignment of a veteran loan.see id.at.according to the court,congress use of the precatory may and of the phrase at the administrator option made clear that congress intended to vest the widest discretion possible in the administrator.id.the administrator decision to accept or reject assignment of a loan was therefore unreviewable.see id.
no such precatory language existed in the statutes in the cases we have reviewed,and none exists in the statutes governing bpa conduct in this case.section,for instance,states that bpa shall fix and establish rates in a manner consistent with sound business principles.see also a stating that rates shall be established in accordance with sound business principles emphasis added.moreover,unlike in rank,bpa governing statutes do not evince an intention on congress part to vest bpa with the widest discretion possible,by referring to bpa option or choice or similar language.to the contrary,by requiring bpa to act in a prescribed,in a manner that accord s with sound business principles congress clearly intended to limit bpa discretion to a degree.
finally,bpa is incorrect in maintaining that city of santa clara and alcoa held that the sound business principles standard is so vague that it provides no law to apply.those cases held instead that a congressional directive to sell power in such a way as to encourage the most widespread use thereof was too vague and general to provide applicable law.see city of santa clara,at alcoa,at.neither case directly precluded reviewability under the sound business principles standard at issue here,and neither can be fairly taken to have done so by in light of the already surveyed precedents to the contrary.
in city of santa clara,the petitioners argued that certain decisions made by the secretary of the interior violated section of the flood control act of.see city of santa clara,at.section requires the secretary to transmit and dispose of surplus energy from reservoir projects in such manner as to encourage the most widespread use thereof at the lowest possible rates to consumers consistent with sound business principles.we refused to review the decision,holding that the statute widespread use requirement was too vague to support judicial review.see city of santa clara,at.as we explained,
the flood control act directive to market power in such a way as to encourage the most widespread use thereof could be interpreted in many different ways,such as to require that power be sold to as many different preference entities as possible,thereby fostering the most widespread geographic use of the power,or to mandate sale of the power to those preference entities whose customers present the most diversified mix of agricultural,industrial or residential users,or to require sale of federal power to those preference entities which serve the largest number of ultimate consumers.
clearly,the most widespread use standard is susceptible of widely divergent interpretations.as we said of another law in strickland morton,supra,t he provisions of this statute breathe discretion at every pore.at.the statute permits the exercise of the widest administrative discretion by the secretary.it does not supply law to apply.
as the above quoted passage reveals,the court in city of santa clara considered only whether the widespread use clause provided law to apply it did not address the sound business principles clause.in this case,we are concerned solely with the sound business principles standard,a standard that permeate s bpa governing statutes.see apac,at citing,a see also b t he administrator shall take such steps as are necessary to assure the timely implementation of this chapter in a sound and businesslike manner.city of santa clara holding is therefore not applicable here 
for similar reasons,this court holding in alcoa is inapplicable.in alcoa,the petitioners asserted that bpa had violated section k of the regional act when it established certain rates for power.see alcoa,at.section k requires bpa to establish nonfirm energy rates in accordance with a number of statutory provisions,including.see k.reviewing the various statutory provisions,the court in alcoa concluded that section k require s that bpa rates for nonfirm energy be drawn 
having regard to the recovery of the cost of generation and transmission of such electric energy 
so as to encourage the most widespread use of bonneville power 
to provide the lowest possible rates to consumers consistent with sound business principles and 
in a manner that protects the interests of the united states in amortizing its investments in the projects within a reasonable period.
the court then addressed the question whether there is law to apply here to the four standards section k incorporates.id.at.citing city of santa clara,the court noted that the widespread use requirement provides bpa with so much discretion that there is no law to apply.id.the court nonetheless held that there was law to apply overall because the first and fourth standards limit ed bpa discretion to set nonfirm energy rates.id.it was careful to note that t his conclusion does not conflict with city of santa clara,because these two standards were not present in that case.id.although the court in alcoa did not apply the consistent with sound business principles standard,it did not state that the standard provided no law to apply.nor was there any need for the case to address that standard,as the court held that other standards set forth in section k provided adequate law 
in sum,neither city of santa clara nor alcoa addressed the reviewability of the standard at issue here.as a result,neither decision controls the outcome of this case.
for all the reasons noted above,we hold that the sound business principles standard incorporated in bpa governing statutes is sufficiently specific to support judicial review and does not indicate that congress committed to agency discretion decisions concerning compliance with that statutory requirement.
bpa decision to enter into the amended contract does not conform with sound business principles.
having determined that the consistent with sound business principles standard provides adequate law to apply,we next turn to the question whether bpa decision to enter into the amended contract conforms with that statutory mandate.for the reasons discussed below,we hold that it does not.
like its decision to enter into the initial contract,bpa agreement to the alcoa contract amendment is,on its face,a highly suspect one.see pngc,at.the amended contract requires bpa to pay alcoa up to almost million over a nine month period.bpa is to receive nothing in return.in essence,then,bpa has agreed to provide a gift of up to million.the agency concedes,as it did in pngc,that its decision to provide this voluntary gift will lead to higher rates for its other customers.see id.given that bpa was under no obligation to contract with alcoa,let alone to pay it over million in cash,and that the amended contract will inevitably lead to higher prices for all other customers,bpa decision raises serious questions concerning compliance with its statutory obligation to maintain the lowest possible rates to consumers consistent with sound business principles.see pngc,at see also mccarthy,at if the cooperatives failed to maintain records and spent their money on expenses,it is clear that they were not acting in accordance with their statutory purpose of providing their members with electricity at the lowest cost consistent with sound business principles.
moreover,the amended contract requires alcoa to use the million to purchase power from bpa competitors because bpa itself is not selling physical power to alcoa.in other words,bpa has effectively agreed to subsidize the operations of its competitors,competitors who,in the past,have not hesitated to take business away from bpa.in kaiser aluminum chem.bpa,cir,for instance,the court noted that,as the wholesale price for power in the northwest began to drop in the mid,competition for the dsis business increased substantially,and m any dsis were considering offers from alternative power suppliers at prices below bpa rates.id.at.in response,bpa was forced to amend its contracts with the dsis by adjusting rates downward.see id.
at the present time,wholesale market rates are substantially higher than both the pf rate and the ip rate.bpa competitors are therefore at a price disadvantage and can not put direct pressure on bpa to lower its prices.bpa decision,during a time of relative competitive advantage,to transfer million to these competitors would not appear to make sound business sense 
bpa nonetheless argues that the decision to execute the amendment advances its business interest in numerous respects.first,the agency maintains that the amendment was necessary to avoid any unnecessary interruption of smelter operations,especially given the difficult economic times and potential loss of additional jobs.this justification is essentially identical to one we rejected as invalid,while sympathizing with its humanitarian goals,in pngc.at.in pngc,bpa had attempted to justify the monetization provision of the contract,in part,on the ground that the monetary benefits were necessary to ensure the continued operation of the aluminum smelters and to protect dsi jobs.id.we held that this goal,while laudable,was simply not reflective of a philosophy.id.at.we also noted that bpa counsel had conceded at oral argument that i t not bonneville responsibility to ensure that the dsis exist.id.at alterations in original.for these same reasons,bpa first justification does not demonstrate that the agency decision to enter into the amended contract was a reasonable business decision.
second,bpa asserts that the monetary benefit payments were necessary to assure the continued existence of the dsi load,and that that was important because t he dsi load has provided enormous value to bpa in the past and it is reasonable to believe that it will do so again.as evidence of the past value that dsis have provided,bpa cites the fact that the dsis purchased relatively flat blocks of power,accepted power at light load hours,and provided bpa with additional power reserves.
there are several problems with this rationale.first,it comes fairly close to another justification that the panel rejected in pngc bpa historic relationship with the dsis and the important role the dsis played in the development of the federal power systems.pngc,at second alteration in original.
second,the primary examples of the dsis value to the agency that bpa cites result from the sale of physical power to the dsis.because bpa will not provide alcoa with physical power under the amended contract,bpa will not receive those benefits from alcoa,at least in the short term.the fact that the amended contract will not itself provide these benefits suggests that bpa does not value those benefits as highly as it professes.
bpa asserts that its decision to monetize the contract amendment was a sound business one because monetization has certain obvious risk management benefits.these risk management benefits include eliminating both the risks to bpa associated with making the relatively large wholesale market power purchases at fluctuating prices bpa would be required to undertake to serve alcoa current operating load and the risk that alcoa would be unable to pay for physical power that bpa delivered.
although we do not doubt that monetization provides these benefits,bpa decision to monetize can not,on its own,justify the alcoa contract amendment,for three reasons.first,monetizing a contract only makes sound business sense if the underlying contract is a sound one.for the reasons we discuss above,bpa could not reasonably have concluded that its decision to sell power to alcoa,and thereby incur a million loss,was consistent with sound business principles.if anything,the agency decision to monetize highlights the fact that the contract amendment amounts to no more than a million gift to alcoa.
second,bpa attempted to justify the contract amendment by citing to benefits that had previously accrued to the agency when it sold physical power to alcoa and the other dsis.by monetizing the contract,bpa undermined this justification.
third,the very reasons bpa provided for its decision to monetize the the significant risk of by alcoa and eliminating the market risks that bpa would face if it sold physical power to the unreasonableness of bpa belief that alcoa will provide future benefits to the agency that will offset the current million cash payment.the agency does not explain why,given that the risks of selling power to alcoa are currently so significant that the agency would rather give the company money to purchase power from a competitor than deliver power to the aluminum company itself,it reasonably believes that the risks will be less significant in the future or that alcoa financial situation will improve.
the fourth,and perhaps most important,problem with bpa contention that alcoa will provide future benefits to the agency that will offset the million that bpa voluntarily agreed to pay the aluminum company is that the agency assertion is without any analytic or evidentiary support.for example,bpa has not quantified the monetary value of the past benefits that the dsis provided.nor has the agency analyzed how likely it is that alcoa either directly or indirectly through its employees will be able to provide benefits in the future,when the aluminum company will provide these proposed benefits,and how much those benefits will be worth.perhaps voluntarily paying million to help ensure alcoa viability at the expense of other customers will lead to higher revenues or lower costs for bpa in the future.bpa,however,has not demonstrated that it has any basis for believing that it will.in short,neither the record in this case nor the record in pngc contains any financial or other business analysis or evidence to support the agency assertion that future benefits to the agency are a likely or b sufficiently large to make the decision to give million away a sound business decision.
moreover,the information that the administrative record d
