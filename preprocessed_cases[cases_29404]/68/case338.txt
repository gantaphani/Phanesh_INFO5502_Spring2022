aep texas aept,an electric utility company,uses railroads owned by bnsf railway company bnsf to transport coal from mines in wyoming to an electric generating station in texas.bnsf exerts market dominance over the route used for this coal transportation,which renders the rates charged subject to review by the surface transportation board the board.under this authority,the board has set a reasonable maximum rate for the transportation service since.see.util.burlington.in calculating a reasonable maximum rate,the board considers,among other variables,the cost of equity capital,approximating a reasonable rate of return for railroad investors.aept petitioned the board for a change in methodology in the calculation of the cost of equity capital.while the board entered some changes,it denied a portion of the petition requesting a recomputation of that variable for the years.aept now petitions for review of that decision of the board.we deny the petition with respect to the board decision not to recalculate that variable with respect to the years.however,as to the calculation,we hold that the board failed adequately to explain its decision.we therefore vacate the board decision with respect to the calculation and remand for further consideration.
background 
aept is an electric utility generating and transmitting electricity to consumers in central and west texas.to ship coal from wyoming mines to its electric generating station near vernon,texas,aept uses railways owned by bnsf.because there is an absence of effective competition from other rail carriers or modes of transportation for the transportation of coal on that route,bnsf is said to exert market dominance over aept shipments.see a.therefore,the rates bnsf charges on that route are subject to review by the surface transportation board under b,c.
if the board determines a railroad has market dominance,it can establish a reasonable maximum rate the railroad may charge for the transportation.c.the board calculates the reasonable maximum rate using a constrained market pricing methodology set forth in the coal rate guidelines.to evaluate the rate for a specific route under this methodology,the board posits a hypothetical railroad serving a subset of a real railroad network.the hypothetical railroad,called a stand alone railroad sarr,operates the route used by the relevant shipper and is presumed to operate at optimal efficiency.the board calculates the stand alone cost for the sarr,which represents the cost of running the hypothetical railroad and includes a reasonable rate of return on investment.the return on investment is the rate of return that shareholders require to compensate them for the use of their capital.methodology to be employed in determining the railroad industry cost of capital,stb ex parte,wl,at,methodology to be.this rate of return is referred to as the cost of equity capital,or the cost of equity.the sarr stand alone cost determines the maximum rate the railroad may charge all the shippers using the routes in the sarr.see bnsf ry.stb.this method ensures that no shipper subsidizes another though some bear a higher share of fixed costs than others,they still pay no more than what they would for a facility designed to serve only them.burlington icc.
the board annually recalculates the cost of capital.this cost of capital is used in various regulatory capacities,including calculating reasonable maximum rates for railroads with market dominance.the published cost of capital includes both the cost of equity capital and the cost of debt capital.because the interest rates on borrowed money are easily observable,the cost of debt capital rarely becomes the subject of debate.the cost of equity capital,however,is not directly observable,which forces the board to rely on complex finance models to estimate that component of the cost of capital.methodology to be,wl,at.
since,the board has used the stand alone cost method to set the rates bnsf may charge for use of the wyoming to texas railways.util.burlington,aff sub nom.burlington stb,f d.as dictated by the coal rate guidelines,the board determines the stand alone cost for the route aept uses by calculating,among other things,the cost of capital for the relevant sarr,called the texas northern railroad tnr.however,because sarrs are hypothetical,the board rarely has enough data to estimate an individualized cost of capital for a specific sarr each year.therefore,for most of its stand alone cost determinations,including the ones at issue in this case,the board uses the estimated cost of capital it publishes each year for the whole railroad industry.
obviously,the calculation of the cost of equity capital is a significant factor in the determination of reasonable rates,as the cost of equity is a large component of the overall cost of a railroad.see railroad cost of,stb ex parte sub,wl,at.but the cost of equity also has recursive implications.the board averages each year cost of equity into an historical cost of capital.the average historical cost then affects the board forecast of growth,which in turn affects the cost of equity in future years.
because the methodology employed to estimate the cost of equity can substantially affect the rates a railroad can charge,and because the cost of equity is difficult to estimate,the board choice of methodology has provoked controversy for over a decade.during the board proceedings for calculating cost of capital,a trade association of coal shippers called the western coal traffic league wctl argued that the board methodology for calculating the cost of equity capital overestimated actual costs.see railroad cost of,july.however,wctl did not present any alternative calculations of its own.therefore,the board decided to retain its existing methodology.that methodology was a discounted cash flow dcf model,which the board had been using since its first annual cost of capital calculation in.under the dcf method,the cost of equity is calculated as the discount rate that makes the present value of the expected returns on a stock,including dividends and price appreciation,equal to the current market value of the stock.see,railroad cost of,railroad cost of,stb ex parte sub,wl june.in short,the dcf model computes the cost of equity through a relatively straightforward manipulation of stock predictions.
in,wctl again complained about the dcf method in the proceedings,and proposed that the board use a capital asset pricing model capm instead.see railroad cost of,wl,at.under capm,the cost of equity is equal to the rate of return for example,the rate of return one could expect from a treasury bond plus a premium associated with a particular investment.that premium is derived through an ordinary regression calculation that takes into account the overall rate of return on the stock market,systematic and risk,and the historical rate of return for a class of stocks here,railroad stocks.methodology to be,wl,at.
citing a sparse record,the board decided not to change its cost of capital methodology for.see railroad cost of at.it did,however,start a separate rulemaking proceeding to determine,among other things,whether switching from dcf to a new method was warranted.methodology to be employed in determining the railroad industry cost of capital,wl,methodology to be.after a notice and comment period in which various interested parties including wctl,bnsf,and aept participated,the board adopted capm for calculating cost of equity capital for and.methodology to be,wl,at see also aep.bnsf ry,stb sub,wl,at aep texas and bnsf were among the interested parties that filed comments.for its calculation,the board decided to calculate the cost of equity by using both capm and an updated dcf model and averaging the outputs of the two methods.use of a discounted cash flow model in determining the railroad industry cost of capital,wl,at.
while the board proceeded with its rulemaking,wctl filed a petition to this court arguing the board use of the dcf model for its calculation was arbitrary and capricious under the administrative procedure act,a.just before oral argument,the board released its decision to use capm for,and in oral argument counsel for the board conceded that the dcf methodology was flawed.however,the board also argued that,because of its recent decision to change the methodology for future years,the proper way to resolve the issue of whether to use capm for prior years calculations would be through administrative proceedings reopening past years decisions.the administrative proceedings could either address the proceedings in and prior years,or deal with individual rate cases.if there was enough evidence to establish that using dcf in prior years was material error,the board would retroactively adjust the calculations.this court therefore denied the petition before it,stating that the cost of capital decision was now ripe for review pursuant to a petition to reopen under c.coal traffic league stb,app x.that provision allows any interested person to petition to reopen an stb decision where there is material error,new evidence,or substantially changed circumstances.c.however,neither wctl nor any other party petitioned to reopen the cost of capital decision.
while wctl was challenging the cost of capital calculations,aept was engaged for several years in its own rate case before the board,challenging the reasonableness of the rates set by the board for the tnr railroad.aept argued,among other things,that the cost of equity calculations were flawed,and particularly disputed the figure once the board published it.see aep.bnsf ry,stb docket,wl,at.in,the board held the proceeding in abeyance while it resolved the rulemaking.major issues in rail rate cases,stb ex parte sub,wl,at.in,the board decided,inter alia,that the cost of equity estimates were reasonable.aep.bnsf ry,stb docket,wl,at.

ii.standard of review 
aept brings its petition under a,which requires courts to set aside an agency decision if it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.this standard requires a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.motor vehicle mfrs.ass state farm mut.auto.ins,state farm quoting burlington truck lines,united states.this court must vacate the board denial of aept petition if the board made a clear error of judgment or if it entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem.id.quotation marks omitted.however,because the board acts at the zenith of its powers when it sets rail rates,burlington stb,quoting am.trucking ass ns united states,internal quotation mark omitted,we recognize that the board is entitled to particular deference.id.as long as the board has rationally set forth the grounds on which it acted,this court may not substitute its judgment for that of the agency.bnsf ry.stb,quoting mccarty farms stb.
in addition,the history of the cost of equity methodology debate presents a concern about what standard the board was required to apply in its decisionmaking process.because aept requests that the board recalculate past years rates with the methodology adopted in the proceedings in and,both the board and aept discuss the issue in terms of retroactive application of a new rule.see decision at.in its decision denying aept petition,the board therefore analyzed aept petition using a balancing test similar to one created by this court to evaluate whether a change in methodology can be given retroactive effect.citing williams natural gas ferc,the board decided to conduct the kind of balancing test described by the court in williams natural gas.decision at.
however,the board did not apply the actual analysis outlined by that case,which was a five factor test originally set forth in retail,wholesale department store union nlrb.see williams natural gas,at.instead,the board created its own two factor analysis,weighing the degree of reliance by the railroad industry on our prior findings,and whether the prior findings appear to be within the bounds of reasonable predictions for the industry cost of equity.decision at.
in its petition to this court,aept argues the board misapplied the retroactivity analysis.aept quotes consolidated edison.ferc,to posit that the board should have looked not at industry reliance on the dcf model and the reasonableness of said methodology,but only at whether the parties before the agency are given notice and an opportunity to offer evidence bearing on the new standard,and the affected parties have not detrimentally relied on the established legal regime.id.at.internal citation omitted.but in trying to cabin the board analysis within that case framework,aept overestimates the similarity between this case and consolidated edison.consolidated edison addressed whether any legal principle mandates retroactive application to pending cases of a new policy statement not given the force of law.at.in williams natural gas,we considered whether a rule announced in an agency adjudication may be given retroactive effect.at emphasis added.in this case,the board created a new rule through a full notice and comment legislative rulemaking under.as neither consolidated edison nor williams natural gas is on point,the board was certainly not bound to employ the factors outlined in either of the cases.
it is also worth noting that aept does not request a truly retroactive application of the new rule.the promulgated rule establishing capm for the and proceedings did not disturb the calculations for prior years,and in this case the board did not reopen those calculations.rather,the board revisited whether,in light of material error,new evidence,or substantially changed circumstances,c,the board should recalculate the maximum rate bnsf was allowed to charge aept from to.aept petition did not request a retroactive application of the new rule,but rather argued that the new rule revealed that using the old method was a mistake.
in sum,this court must simply determine whether the board evaluation withstands the arbitrary and capricious standard outlined by a.because this court precedents on retroactivity do not dictate the board approach,the use of the kind of balancing test described by the court in williams natural gas,decision at,neither forecloses nor guarantees that the board decision satisfies those requirements.
iii.analysis 
aept argues the board decision must be overturned because it is inconsistent with the board prior representations to this court about how the board would reassess the cost of equity estimates.while incompatibility of an agency action with the agency prior representation
