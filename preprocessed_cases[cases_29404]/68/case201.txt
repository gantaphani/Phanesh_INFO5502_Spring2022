the energy reorganization act era,b,includes an provision empowering whistleblowing employees working at nuclear energy sites to bring claims to federal court after one year of agency inaction.our case concerns the interpretation and application of that provision.in addition,we consider whether a whistleblower who sues an employer in a federal lawsuit under the era provision has a constitutional right to a jury trial.
background 
the hanford nuclear site is a former nuclear weapons production facility in washington state hanford reactors produced plutonium for the national defense for over forty years.the hanford site abuts a river and stores million gallons of hazardous,nuclear waste in underground tanks.there are estimates that one million gallons of nuclear waste have leaked from the storage tanks into the ground and that the groundwater beneath square miles of the site is polluted.
the department of energy doe leads the effort to clean up the pollution at hanford.the plan includes construction and management of a waste treatment plant wtp responsible for separating and vitrifying immobilizing in glass nuclear tank waste.vitrification involves mixing nuclear waste with materials at extremely high temperatures,then pouring the mixture into stainless steel containers to cool and solidify it.once immobilized in glass,the nuclear waste generally is considered stable and safe for storage.over hundreds of years,the waste will lose its radioactivity.
the building of the wtp is in process.when completed,the wtp will be the largest such facility in the world.the wtp is to have a design life of forty years,meaning that some of its parts are to operate without maintenance for four decades.the sound design of the wtp is important to protect against occurrence of a criticality accident a nuclear chain reaction inside plutonium or enriched uranium.such reactions release radiation,which,particularly in combination with hydrogen gas,could be catastrophic.
to assist in its effort at hanford,doe contracts with bechtel national,bechtel.bechtel subcontracts with urs energy construction,urs e c for work on the wtp.
in the wake of a report detailing problems with the hanford,appellant walter tamosaitis,an employee of urs e c,was appointed to lead a study reviewing technical challenges within the wtp project.the study identified technical issues,of which were closed,meaning resolved,by the planned date of october.the remaining issue,termed the mixing issue,required solving a design problem concerning the mixing of nuclear waste in certain of the wtp pretreatment tanks.
the mixing issue proved to be a lingering and complex challenge.tamosaitis wanted to extend the deadline for solving the issue to september,while bechtel wanted it resolved by june.failure to resolve the mixing issue by june would have jeopardized bechtel fee.
bechtel rejected tamosaitis advice and announced closure of the mixing issue by june.tamosaitis objected he brought a list of environmental and safety concerns to a meeting hosted by bechtel forwarded the same list to bill gay,a urs employee and wtp assistant project manager and reached out to several wtp consultants by email,hoping that they would oppose closure and publicize his concerns.
two days later,tamosaitis was fired from the wtp project.urs operations manager dennis hayes personally terminated tamosaitis.hayes directed tamosaitis to return his badge,cell phone,and blackberry,and leave the site immediately.tamosaitis was reassigned,in a nonsupervisory role,to a basement office in a urs facility off the hanford site.he was later offered other positions with urs,but they required relocation.
b.the era anti retaliation provision 
the or whistleblower protection provision of the era provides that 
no employer may discharge any employee or otherwise discriminate against any employee with respect to his compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment because the employee notified his employer of an alleged violation of this chapter development of energy sources or the atomic energy act of.
a a.this statute protect s workers from retaliation based on their concerns for safety and quality,mackowiak.nuclear,cir,and ensures that the government agencies charged with monitoring nuclear safety do not see their channels of information dried up by employer intimidation,deford sec y of labor,cir quoting nlrb scrivener.
the department of labor,occupational safety and health administration dol osha implements this antiretaliation provision.see.an employee seeking redress under section must file a complaint with dol osha and follow the statutorily designated administrative scheme,whereby 
any employee who believes that he has been discharged or otherwise discriminated against by any person in violation of subsection a of this section may,within days after such violation occurs,file or have any person file on his behalf a complaint with the secretary of labor in this section referred to as the secretary alleging such discharge or discrimination.upon receipt of such a complaint,the secretary shall notify the person named in the complaint of the filing of the complaint,the commission,and the department of energy.
in,congress bolstered this whistleblower protection by amending section to allow employees to take their retaliation cases to federal district court if,after one year,dol osha has not adjudicated their claim.energy policy act of,stat.the amendment adds the clause at issue here,which provides 
if the secretary has not issued a final decision within year after the filing of a complaint and there is no showing that such delay is due to the bad faith of the person seeking relief under this paragraph,such person may bring an action at law or equity for de novo review in the appropriate district court of the united states,which shall have jurisdiction over such an action without regard to the amount in controversy.
b.congress added the provision to the statutory scheme to address extensive delays that frustrated the purpose of the whistleblower statutes,at.
procedural background 
on july,tamosaitis filed a discrimination action with dol osha.he named his employer,urs,a contractor at the hanford nuclear site,as respondent,and asserted workplace discrimination on account of activities protected under the era.dol osha acknowledged receipt of the complaint on august,and said it was providing the named party with a copy of the complaint and information concerning osha responsibilities under the law.
urs corporation urs responded to tamosaitis osha complaint by filing a position statement with dol osha.on the second page of the document,urs stated that tamosaitis employer is urs energy construction,a subsidiary of urs corporation as urs energy construction,employs tamosaitis and is the party to the subcontract,references to urs in the remainder of this initial statement of position are to urs energy construction,and not urs corporation.the position statement went on to defend against tamosaitis claims on the merits.
tamosaitis amended the osha complaint twice on december,he added doe and bechtel as defendants,and on september,he deleted bechtel because he was pursuing bechtel in state court,and changed the employer defendant from urs,to urs and urs e c.that same day,tamosaitis gave notice that he intended to bring an action in federal court pursuant to the era provision.in response to tamosaitis notice of intent,dol osha dismissed the agency complaint.
tamosaitis filed his complaint in federal court on november,and his first amended complaint on december.the suit names urs,urs e c,and doe as defendants,and alleges violations of the era whistleblower protection provision.tamosaitis also requested a jury trial.
the district court granted doe motion to dismiss,ruling that tamosaitis did not wait a full year after naming doe in his agency complaint and so did not exhaust his administrative remedies against doe as to urs and urs e c,the district court granted summary judgment,also for lack of administrative exhaustion,reasoning that tamosaitis was required to wait one year after changing the named defendant from urs to urs and urs e c before filing suit in federal court.in addition,summary judgment was granted to urs on the alternative ground that tamosaitis offered no evidence tending to show that urs was anything but a parent corporation of tamosaitis employer,urs e c,and that this parentsubsidiary relationship was insufficient to establish liability under the era.in a separate order,the district court granted the urs defendants motion to strike tamosaitis jury demand,ruling that tamosaitis had no statutory or constitutional right to a trial by jury.
finally,with regard to urs e c,the district court held,alternatively,that there was no genuine issue of material fact as to whether urs e c took adverse action because of tamosaitis conduct.all the evidence,the district court ruled,showed that bechtel,not urs e c,was solely responsible for tamosaitis removal from the wtp project and is the entity which took adverse action against him.in addition,the court concluded that,although tamosaitis was taken off the wtp project at hanford,he was not fired from urs e c,and n othing in the record create d a genuine issue of material fact that urs e c has discriminated against him with respect to his compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment in violation of the era.
tamosaitis timely appealed the partial dismissal,the denial of jury trial,and the grant of summary judgment.
administrative exhaustion 
the district court ruled that the era provision requires employees to wait one full year after naming a particular respondent in a dol osha complaint before bringing a federal suit against that respondent.thus,concluded the court,because tamosaitis did not wait until december,to sue doe and until september,to sue urs and urs e c,he did not exhaust his administrative remedies against these defendants before filing suit and may not proceed in federal court 
we agree that,as a general rule,adding a new respondent to an administrative complaint restarts the exhaustion clock as to that person.as we later explain,that conclusion leads us to affirm the district court dismissal of two of the appellees in this case,doe and urs,but not the third,urs e 
first,the structure of section indicates that the administrative exhaustion period is linked to a particular respondent,not to the substance of the claim alone section provides that the secretary of labor is to notify the person named in the complaint of the filing of the complaint,b emphasis added investigate the violation alleged in the complaint,and notify the person alleged to have committed such violation of the results of the investigation,b a emphasis added and,where appropriate,enter a settlement with the person alleged to have committed the violation,id.emphasis added.knowing the identity of the respondent is thus a critical component of carrying out the prescribed procedure within the agency.
second,like the statute,dol osha regulations assume that every era whistleblower administrative complaint will name a particular respondent or respondents,and that the named individuals will have an opportunity to participate throughout the agency adjudicative process.the regulations provide that the assistant secretary will notify the respondent of the filing of the complaint,a that the respondent may submit to the assistant secretary a written statement and any affidavits or documents substantiating its position,b and that the agency will provide to the complainant a copy of all of respondent submissions to the agency,c.the agency regulations define respondent as the employer named in the complaint,who is alleged to have violated the statute.unless such a respondent is named in the complaint,that individual or entity may not have the benefit of notice or the opportunity to participate in the agency complaint review process,and the agency may not have occasion to consider that respondent submission of position.
third,although the provision speaks in general terms and makes no specific mention of respondents,defendants,or employers,that provision contemplates a basic level of similarity between an agency action and the corresponding federal suit.the clause provides that after one year of agency inaction the employee may bring an action for de novo review.b.d e novo review is a term of art that,in the administrative context,generally refers to a court nondeferential review of an administrative decision,usu ally through a review of the administrative record plus any additional evidence the parties present.black law dictionary ed.d e novo review of an agency action for which there is no final agency decision,as will inevitably be the case in actions under section b,differs in important ways from judicial review of a final agency decision.see stone instrumentation lab,cir.still,congress characterization of the action as review of the agency proceedings indicates that the district court litigation is tied to the case and the parties that were before the agency.
finally,allowing an employee to sue a defendant who was not a respondent in the administrative proceedings for a full year before the case was moved to federal court would severely undermine the efficacy of the administrative exhaustion scheme.
exhaustion is generally required as a matter of preventing premature interference with agency processes,so that the agency may function efficiently and so that it may have an opportunity to correct its own errors,to afford the parties and the courts the benefit of its experience and expertise,and to compile a record which is adequate for judicial review.
weinberger salfi.if there were no requirement of parity between the respondents in an agency action under the era and the defendants named in a corresponding era whistleblower federal lawsuit,an employee could file a dol osha complaint,add an entirely new respondent a year later,and even if neither the new respondent nor the agency had notice of the new respondent involvement in the retaliation proceed to federal court against the new respondent the very next day.by doing so,the employee would effectively make it impossible for the agency to investigate the allegations against the new respondent and create a record concerning that respondent 
a primary purpose of the provision is to encourage dol osha to resolve whistleblower claims promptly.we can not expect dol osha to resolve claims against unknown respondents who have no opportunity to participate in the administrative process.allowing the optout provision to become a mechanism for bypassing congress carefully constructed scheme would frustrate the congressional intent that whistleblower claims be resolved at the agency level,if possible 
accordingly,we hold that before an employee may opt out of the agency process and bring a retaliation suit against a respondent in federal court,that respondent must have had notice of,and an opportunity to participate in,the agency action for one year.the format and level of specificity required to name a respondent in an agency complaint is a separate question,which we address in due course as it applies to this case.
given our holding regarding the need to identify respondents,tamosaitis claim against doe fails for lack of administrative exhaustion.tamosaitis first agency complaint did not name doe as a respondent,did not indicate that tamosaitis intended to name doe as a respondent,did not attribute any adverse employment actions to doe,and did not allege that doe participated in any of the actions from which tamosaitis complaint arose.the only role attributed to doe in the original complaint is its status as manager of the hanford site.
not until the first amended osha complaint did tamosaitis allege doe possible involv e ment in retaliation,asserting that doe was upset about an email that tamosaitis sent out,and that he was removed at the direction of doe wtp federal project director dale knudson.but as these allegations against doe were not made one year before tamosaitis opted out of the administrative review process,dol osha did not have the statutorily required period to consider them.
because there was no administrative complaint pending against doe for one year before tamosaitis filed suit against doe in federal court,section b administrative exhaustion requirement was not satisfied as against doe.accordingly,we affirm the dismissal of doe from this litigation 
the district court ruled,and the urs entities maintain,that tamosaitis similarly failed to exhaust his administrative remedies against them.according to the district court,once tamosaitis changed respondent urs to urs and urs e c,tamosaitis had to wait another full year before bringing the suit to federal court against these defendants.we agree as to urs but not as to urs e 
the situation of urs e c differs from that of both doe and urs in a critical respect the original complaint adequately notified urs e c that it was the intended respondent.accordingly,urs e c position was fully presented to the agency.urs e c was therefore adequately named in the original complaint.
tamosaitis first agency complaint named urs as respondent,but made clear that the intended respondent was his employer and the principal subcontractor to bechtel in a government contract at the hanford nuclear site.urs and urs e c responded to tamosaitis administrative complaint in an position statement to dol osha.the statement acknowledges that tamosaitis could only be referring to urs e c,and explains the relationship between the urs entities,bechtel,and tamosaitis,as follows 
tamosaitis employer is urs energy construction,a subsidiary of urs corporation.urs energy construction,held the name washington group international,wg when it entered into the wtp contract with bni bechtel the subcontract.once urs acquired wg in november,wg began doing business as the washington division of urs.it continued to conduct business in this name until february when the wg name was formally changed to urs energy construction.
the position statement then goes on to acknowledge that urs e c employs tamosaitis and is the party to the subcontract.
the response addresses the merits of tamosaitis allegations in depth,attaching evidence in support of its position.at no point in the statement do the urs entities assert tamosaitis mistake in naming urs instead of urs e c as a defense to the agency complaint.
had urs e c argued before dol osha that it was not adequately named in tamosaitis complaint,the argument would not have had merit.administrative complaints are generally less formal than their judicial counterparts.a dministrative pleadings are liberally construed and easily amended.donovan royal logging,cir.
administrative complaints under the era antiretaliation provision fit this general mold.the whistleblower regulations make clear that n o particular form of complaint is required.c.b.complaints may be made orally and reduced to writing by the agency.id.osha whistleblower manual confirms that employees are generally free to amend their complaints throughout the agency investigation so long as the amendment falls within the scope of the original complaint.dep t of labor,osha instruction,whistleblower investigations manual.
further,under the era,dol osha complaints must be filed within days of the alleged retaliatory conduct.b.combined with the accepted informality and fluidity of agency pleadings,this brief window means that some employees will misstate the exact name of an intended respondent,as tamosaitis did with respect to urs e where,as here,neither the correct respondent nor dol osha had any difficulty identifying the proper respondent,a whistleblower technical mistake in providing the precise name of the proper respondent should not be dispositive.
in short,tamosaitis gave adequate notice to urs e c that it was the named respondent to his complaint,such that urs e c could be defended,and in fact was defended,against the original agency complaint.we conclude that the administrative exhaustion was sufficient as to urs e 
urs,however,was not adequately named in tamosaitis original administrative complaint.tamosaitis did not assert in the complaint that urs was either his employer or a subcontractor to bechtel at the hanford site,and in fact it was not.moreover,urs response to the original complaint noted as much,and stated that references to urs in the remainder of this initial statement of position are to urs energy construction,and not urs corporation.thus,urs affirmatively indicated that it was participating in the proceedings not as the alleged wrongdoer,but on behalf of urs e accordingly,we affirm the district court dismissal of urs for lack of administrative exhaustion.
liability of urs e c 
urs e c stipulated in the district court that tamosaitis engaged in protected activity and was retaliated against because of that conduct.the company moved for summary judgment only on the ground that it was not responsible for the retaliation.the district court agreed,holding that tamosaitis has not presented evidence raising a genuine issue of material fact that his employer,urs e c,took adverse action because of his conduct,and that bechtel was solely responsible for tamosaitis removal from the wtp project.we hold that tamosaitis introduced evidence sufficient to create a triable issue as to whether his whistleblowing activity was a contributing factor in the adverse employment action urs e c took against him.accordingly,we reverse the grant of summary judgment to urs e 
to establish a prima facie case of era retaliation,an employee must show he engaged in a protected activity the respondent knew or suspected that the employee engaged in the protected activity t he employee suffered an adverse action and t he circumstances were sufficient to raise the inference that the protected activity was a contributing factor in the adverse action.f coppinger martin solis,cir interpreting the similarly structured whistleblower protection provision of the sarbanes oxley act araujo transit rail operations,cir interpreting the federal railroad safety act whistleblower statute.under the era approach to retaliation claims,if an employee shows that his participation in protected activity was a contributing factor in the unfavorable personnel action alleged,the burden shifts to the employer.b c see also williams admin,cir.the employer may then rebut the employee prima facie case by introducing clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same unfavorable personnel action in the absence of the employee participation in such behavior.b d 
applying this statutory scheme to this case,we note,first,that there is plenty of evidence that bechtel encouraged urs e c to remove tamosaitis from the wtp site because of his whistleblowing,that urs e c knew that tamosaitis whistleblowing motivated bechtel,and that urs e c carried out the removal.frank russo,the project director for wtp and a bechtel employee,forwarded urs e c manager gay an email from doe personnel regarding tamosaitis email about the closure,which read if this shows up in the press we will be sticking to our previous comment.walt tamosaitis does not speak for doe please use this message as you see fit to accelerate staffing changes introducing this string of emails,russo wrote gay walt is killing us.get him in your corporate office today.gay replied dennis hayes has called.he will be gone tomorrow.the email is dated july,the day before hayes,a urs e c employee,removed tamosaitis from the hanford site.another email dated july from russo,introducing the same email chain but sent to a doe official,said that russo was livid about the string of emails walt has sent in the last days,and that t oday i told gay that walt will no longer be paid by wtp.
the thrust of the email chains are assuredly that bechtel,and doe,were extremely unhappy with tamosaitis participation in protected activity and wanted him off the project a reasonable factfinder could infer not only that the retaliatory motive of urs e c customer,bechtel,spurred urs e c actions against tamosaitis,but also that urs e c knowingly acquiesced in or ratified bechtel retaliation.a reasonable factfinder could also conclude that there is not clear and convincing evidence that urs e c would have taken the same action had tamosaitis not engaged in protected activity.
under the era whistleblower protection provision,such showings,if established at trial,are sufficient to make urs e c liable for retaliatory discrimination against tamosaitis.the era forbids an employer from discriminating against an employee based on the employee whistleblowing activities even if the adverse action is taken to maintain an advantageous business relationship.gerdom cont l airlines,cir fernandez wynn oil,cir.the purpose of the era provision is to root out retaliation against whistleblowers,for the benefit of both the public and the employee.it would be totally anomolous if we were to allow the preferences of a customer to determine whether the discrimination was valid.gerdom,at quoting diaz pan am.world airways,cir.we hold that where an employer takes an adverse employment action to satisfy a customer with a retaliatory motive of which the employer is aware,retaliation is a contributing factor,b c,in the employer decision to take that action.
under this framework,the presence of an employer subjective retaliatory animus is irrelevant.all a plaintiff must show is that his protected activity was a contributing factor in the adverse employment action.f.the relevant causal connection is not between retaliatory animus and personnel action,but rather between protected activity and personnel action.as a result,there is no meaningful distinction between an employer who takes action based on its own retaliatory animus and one that acts to placate the retaliatory animus of a customer.either way,the fact that the employee engaged in protected activity is the cause of the action taken against him.
in the analogous context of title vii actions,we have long held that a customer discriminatory preference does not justify an employer discriminatory practice unless for those protected categories for which the defense is available under title vii the discriminatory requirement amounts to a bona fide occupational qualification.see e gerdom,at fernandez,at.implicit in such holdings is the commonsense conclusion that when a known or attributed discriminatory customer preference motivates an adverse employment action,the discriminatory preference is a cause of the employment action.
since tamosaitis has shown that his protected activity was a contributing factor in the adverse employment action he suffered,he has met his burden for establishing a prima facie case of retaliation under the era.the era contains no bona fide occupational qualification defense.instead,where retaliation is a contributing factor to an employer adverse action,the statute requires that the employer demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the adverse action even if the employee had not participated in the protected activity.b d.
on the present record,urs e c has made no such showing.the only relevant argument urs e c makes is that it had no choice under its contract with bechtel to continue to employ someone on the hanford project if bechtel demanded that that person be removed,regardless of the reason for the request.but this suggestion is unavailing.
a trier of fact could conclude that urs e c contract with bechtel did not require urs e c to transfer an employee if requested to do so for a known retaliatory reason.the contract provides that,all work under this contract shall be performed in a skillful and workmanlike manner.the contracting officer may require,in writing,that the contractor remove from the work any employee the contracting officer deems incompetent,careless or otherwise objectionable.no one contends that tamosaitis was incompetent or careless.thus the question is whether the term otherwise objectionable is broad enough to encompass unlawful,retaliatory objections.as a general phrase at the end of a list is limited to the same type of things the generic category found in the specific list,antonin scalia bryan garner,reading law the interpretation of legal texts quoting william popkin,a dictionary of statutory interpretation,otherwise objectionable,read in light of the preceding criteria,best refers to concerns regarding an employee work quality and productivity,not to an employee protected airing of public safety concerns.see also los angeles news serv.cbs,cir.as amended by cir.for example,if bechtel viewed disabled or female employees as undesirable,the otherwise objectionable language would not confer the right to order such employees discharged without regard to their productivity,honesty,or other criteria related to their ability to perform their jobs.
supporting this reading of otherwise objectionable as not reaching retaliation or other proscribed reasons is the consideration that a contract requiring compliance with a transfer or discharge demand triggered by a known retaliatory reason could be void or unenforceable as against public policy.see restatement second of contracts grace local union,int l union of united rubber,cork,linoleum plastic workers of,a court may not enforce a discriminatory contract contrary to public policy.reading otherwise objectionable as not encompassing impermissible motivations avoids that possibility.restatement second of contracts ambiguous contracts are to be read consistently with the public interest.
moreover,an employer may be liable for the retaliatory conduct of another entity where the employer either ratifies or acquiesces in the retaliation by not taking immediate corrective actions when it knew or should have known of the conduct.folkerson circus circus,cir.viewing the record in the light most favorable to the,tamosaitis,as we must on summary judgment,nolan heald college,cir,it supports the reasonable inference that urs e c ratified bechtel retaliation by transferring tamosaitis,despite knowledge of bechtel retaliatory motive.equally supported is the reasonable inference that urs e c could have refused to carry out tamosaitis removal but failed to do so.
urs e c supervisor bill gay acknowledged that if bechtel ordered him to transfer a woman and he knew the request was motivated by sexual animus,he would not immediately cede to the request,and would instead take the issue to his corporate headquarters in protest.a jury could view this evidence as supporting the reasonable inference that urs e c retained some control over staffing decisions at the hanford site.see.b c protected activity need only be a contributing factor in unfavorable personnel action alleged.
as a separate ground for granting urs e c summary judgment on tamosaitis retaliation claim,the district court held that n othing in the record creates a genuine issue that urs e c has discriminated against tamosaitis with respect to his compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment in violation of the era.the district court cited the fact that tamosaitis continues to receive bonuses and has had other meaningful work assignments since the wtp.
by its terms,section a prohibits employers from discriminating in practically any fashion against an employee because the employee engaged in protected activity.deford,at.transfer to less desirable employment is discrimination under the era.mackowiak.nuclear,cir see deford,at.
tamosaitis attests that his current job duties vary dramatically from his previous position at hanford.at hanford he supervised a million dollar program involving employees.now,he does not supervise any programs,and no employees report to him.since january,he has not received an annual bonus as he did at hanford,thereby losing to in compensation each year.of the alternative employment opportunities urs e c offered tamosaitis,the primary one was in another country,a transfer undesirable for him because of his family ties in the united states.the evidence thus creates a genuine issue of fact as to whether tamosaitis compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment were affected by his transfer.
accordingly,we reverse the grant of summary judgment to urs e c for era whistleblower retaliation.
having determined that tamosaitis suit against urs e c may proceed to trial,we turn to whether tamosaitis has a right to trial by jury.the district court granted urs e c motion to strike tamosaitis jury demand,ruling that tamosaitis had neither a statutory nor a constitutional right to a jury trial for his claim under the provision of the era whistleblower protection provision.we hold that tamosaitis has a constitutional right to a jury trial for his claims seeking money damages against urs e c and so reverse the district court ruling.
statutory right to jury trial 
before reaching a constitutional question,a court must first ascertain whether a construction of the statute is fairly possible by which the constitutional question may be avoided.city of monterey del monte dunes at monterey,alteration in original quoting feltner columbia pictures television.accordingly,before proceeding to hold that there is a constitutional jury trial right in cases filed under,monterey determined that there was no statutory right to trial by jury under section.id.
the appellees in monterey maintained that the term,action at law,used in the statute was a term of art implying a right to a jury trial.id.at.the court disagreed that this was a necessary implication,and decline d to find a statutory jury right under based solely on the authorization of an action at law.id.at emphasis added.in doing so,monterey distinguished section from the age discrimination in employment act of adea at issue in lorillard pons,explaining that lorillard held that there was a statutory right to a jury trial in part because the adea authorized legal relief,and in part because of the adea explicit incorporation of the procedures of the fair labor standards act,which had been interpreted to guarantee trial by jury in private actions.id.first emphasis added citing lorillard,at.
like section,the era provides for an action at law or equity for de novo review,b,and makes no express reference to a jury trial.a c if a complaining party seeks compensatory or punitive damages under this section any party may demand a trial by jury a seaman injured in the course of employment may elect to bring a civil action at law,with the right of trial by jury.although the phrase action at law is consistent with a statutory right to jury trial,the phrase standing alone is under monterey insufficient to establish a statutory jury trial right for era whistleblower suits.see monterey,at.
constitutional right to jury trial 
given this statutory silence,we must answer the constitutional question presented.tull united states.the seventh amendment provides that i n suits at common law,where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars,the right of trial by jury shall be preserved const.amend.vii emphasis added.this constitutional guarantee appl ies to actions enforcing statutory rights,and requires a jury trial upon demand,if the statute creates legal rights and remedies,enforceable in an action for damages in the ordinary courts of law.curtis loether.
consistent with the textual mandate that the jury right be preserved,interpretation of the amendment has been guided by historical analysis.monterey,at.in applying that analysis,we examine both the nature of the statutory action and the remedy sought,feltner,at,to determine whether the claim at issue is a cause of action that either was tried at law at the time of the founding or is analogous to one that was,monterey,at quoting markman westview instruments.consideration of the remedy sought is the critical factor in this analysis.granfinanciera,nordberg,spinelli gaughan,cir.
monterey held that a section suit seeking legal relief is an action at law within the meaning of the seventh amendment even though there was no action equivalent to section at the time the seventh amendment was adopted.at.the constitutional right to a jury trial,monterey determined,extends to statutory claims unknown to the common law,so long as the claims can be said to soun d basically in tort,and seek legal relief.id.quoting curtis,at alteration in original.as the plaintiff in monterey sought compensatory damages,and because compensation is a purpose traditionally associated with legal relief,id.at quoting feltner,at,the court concluded the remedy sought was a legal one,id.at.
tamosaitis whistleblower suit also sounds in tort and seeks compensatory damages.his lawsuit is analogous to a wrongful discharge claim at common law,a tort so widely accepted in american jurisdictions today we are confident that it has become part of our evolving common law.spinelli,at.w herever the retaliatory discharge tort has been recognized,it has been treated as legal and not equitable.id.although tamosaitis is not alleging complete termination,his claim for wrongful transfer is for present purposes sufficiently analogous to wrongful discharge for us to conclude that the nature of the statutory right is legal.see monterey,at 
most critically,the era provision,section,expressly authorizes award of compensatory damages to a complainant.b b.as one commentator has noted it is established law that compensatory damages are available under the era whistleblower provision and other environmental whistleblower statutes and that compensatory damages under these statutes means damages,which include recovery for mental anguish,emotional distress,pain and suffering,humiliation,and loss of professional reputation.jarod gonzalez,sox,statutory interpretation,and the seventh amendment sarbanes oxley act whistleblower claims and jury trials.lab.emp,collecting cases.
although he also requests injunctive relief,back pay and lost benefits,tamosaitis seeks compensatory damages for loss of enjoyment of life,pain and suffering,mental anguish,emotional distress,injury to reputation,and humiliation.and there is overwhelming evidence that the consistent practice at common law was for juries to award damages.feltner,at.accordingly,both the nature of the claim wrongful transfer and,more importantly,the nature of the relief sought compensatory damages support a right to trial by jury.
urs e c argues that the monetary relief tamosaitis seeks is intertwined with and incidental to the injunction sought,so his overall suit sounds in equity but tamosaitis prayer for monetary relief extends beyond back pay,a form of monetary relief that,when restitutionary or incidental to injunctive relief,is fairly characterized as equitable.chauffeurs,teamsters and helpers,local terry,see lutz glendale union high,cir.he also requests reputational damages and mental and emotional damages.such damages are not merely incidental to the equitable relief of reinstatement.see tull,at curtis,at.and where a statute authorizes both equitable and legal relief,the plaintiff decision to join a legal claim with an equitable claim does not abridge the right to jury trial on the legal claim.curtis,at.it is irrelevant whether an action is properly characterized as one for damages and injunctive relief,or as one for damages alone,for purposes of analyzing the jury trial issue.id.
in denying tamosaitis a jury trial,the district court added a third factor to the constitutional inquiry whether the plaintiff suit vindicates a private or public right.the district court concluded that when congress may assign the adjudication of a statutory cause of action to a iii tribunal,as it undisputedly respect to era retaliation claims,the seventh amendment poses no independent bar to the adjudication of that action by a nonjury factfinder.in the district court view,because the whistleblower provision vindicates a public right over which congress has conferred adjudicatory power to dolosha,the seventh amendment does not require a jury trial when,under the era provision,the claim is heard instead in federal court.
this analysis mistakenly conflates two separate issues when congress may assign claims involving public rights to iii adjudicatory bodies,and whether,when such claims are assigned to federal courts for adjudication,there is a constitutional jury trial right.granfinanciera concerned the first issue,holding that congress can give iii courts the power to make findings of fact as to claims involving public rights.at.
in so holding,granfinanciera made its narrow scope clear congress may devise novel claims of action involving public rights free from the strictures of the seventh amendment if it assigns their adjudication to tribunals without st
