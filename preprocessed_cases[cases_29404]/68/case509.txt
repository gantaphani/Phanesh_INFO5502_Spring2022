tuthill ranch,tuthill appeals the summary judgment granted by the united states court of federal claims court of federal claims in favor of the united states government.tuthill claimed that the government had physically occupied tuthill property,thereby effecting a compensable physical taking.the court of federal claims found that,based upon undisputed facts,the government had not physically occupied tuthill property,and was therefore not liable for a physical taking.based upon this finding,the court of federal claims denied tuthill motion for summary judgment and granted the government motion for summary judgment.tuthill united states.because the court of federal claims correctly determined that no disputed material facts could establish a physical taking,we affirm.
background 
the bonneville power administration bpa,an agency of the federal government,transmits electrical power along approximately miles of power lines in oregon,washington,idaho,and montana.one of these power lines crosses tuthill property in washington.in,tuthill sold the bpa a perpetual easement and right to enter and erect,operate,maintain,repair,rebuild,and patrol one or more electrical power transmission lines and appurtenant signal lines,poles,towers,wires,cables,and appliances necessary in connection therewith.
the bpa then built both power lines and accompanying communication,or signal lines in accordance with the terms of its easement.beginning in the,the bpa upgraded its signal line technology on a number of occasions.in the most recent of these technological upgrades,the bpa decided to convert all of its signal lines to fiber optic cables.
the upgrade to fiber optics began in.according to the government,bpa devised its upgrade plan based upon planned load growth and wholesale transmission transactions between now and.in most places,the bpa standardized its cables to either the or the size to accommodate a claimed projected need of sixteen fibers by,by,and by.it is therefore undisputed that the bpa installed more capacity than it requires for its current needs but that the bpa may need this capacity to meet its projected future needs.it is also undisputed that the bpa now leases some of this excess capacity to unrelated third parties.the bpa currently needs only a fraction of the fibers crossing tuthill property to maintain the power lines.it leases the remainder to a telecommunications company.
tuthill alleges that the creation of a fiber optic communication system many times greater than is needed by the agency to serve its energy control needs,coupled with the government leasing and other contractual agreements with communications companies,is use outside of the scope of the easement that the government relies on to burden tuthill real property.given this alleged breach of the easement explicit terms,tuthill further asserts that the government misuse of these easements,and or the government allowing of others to misuse these easements,amounts to a physical occupation of tuthill real property which is a per se taking without just compensation prohibited by the fifth amendment to the constitution.finally,tuthill claims that the government owes it just compensation for the permanent physical taking of its in the alternative,if the government chooses to cease the occupation,just compensation for the temporary physical taking of its property.tuthill has not brought any other causes of action or theories upon which the government allegedly caused compensable damage to tuthill property.tuthill entire case therefore rests upon whether or not the government actions constituted a per se physical taking.
the government contends that the bpa designed this natural upgrade to its infrastructure to accommodate growth projected through.those projections determined the number of fibers,and thus the size of the cables,laid as necessary signal lines per the easement terms.once the bpa laid those cables,leasing unused fibers to third parties did not constitute a physical invasion,and did not increase the burden on the servient estate in any way.therefore,according to the government,tuthill property has not been burdened in any way for which it has not been compensated already,that is in.
tuthill and the government filed cross motions for summary judgment.based upon undisputed facts,the court of federal claims explained that 
t he scope of the easement is not relevant in this court because it can not give rise to a physical taking.moreover,tuthill has not identified a property interest that could have been taken.tuthill may have avenues of relief in federal court,but not on a takings theory.for example,misuse of an easement may be a trespass to real property.
the government overbuilt the communication network to accommodate future growth.what is excess capacity today may or may not be excess in the future.the easement allows appurtenant signal lines necessary and in connection therewith physical presence of the fiber optic cable over the easement is not a taking.no additional physical intrusion to tuthill land has resulted from the lease to the third parties.
tuthill,slip op.at.the court of federal claims therefore denied tuthill motion and granted summary judgment in favor of the government.tuthill timely appealed.
discussion 
we have jurisdiction to hear this appeal under a.we review the court of federal claims grant of summary judgment without deference.christopher,united states,agwiak united states,scott timber united states.summary judgment is appropriate when there are no disputed issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.anderson liberty lobby,d.
this case involves fifth amendment takings jurisprudence.the fifth amendment does not proscribe the taking of property it proscribes taking without just compensation.brown legal found.of,d.tuthill asserts that the federal government,acting through the bpa,physically occupied its property without just compensation.
the supreme court has recognized that the government may take private property by either physical occupation or regulation,and that these two categories of takings are subject to different analyses.see lucas coastal council,d.
the text of the fifth amendment itself provides a basis for drawing a distinction between physical takings and regulatory takings.its plain language requires the payment of compensation whenever the government acquires private property for a public purpose,whether the acquisition is the result of a condemnation proceeding or a physical appropriation when the government physically takes possession of an interest in property for some public purpose,it has a categorical duty to compensate the former owner,regardless of whether the interest that is taken constitutes an entire parcel or merely a part thereof.thus,compensation is mandated when a leasehold is taken and the government occupies the property for its own purposes,even though that use is temporary.similarly,when the government appropriates part of a rooftop in order to provide cable tv access for apartment tenants,or when its planes use private airspace to approach a government airport,it is required to pay for that share no matter how small.
council,tahoe reg l planning agency,d citations omitted emphasis added.
we must therefore begin our analysis,as did the court of federal claims,by considering whether or not the government took physical possession of tuthill property.if we find a physical taking,we must vacate the summary judgment and remand the matter to the court of federal claims to construe the easement and to determine damages.if we do not find a physical taking,we must join the court of federal claims in concluding that the scope of the easement is not relevant,tuthill,slip.op.at,and affirm the summary judgment.
the essence of tuthill argument on appeal is that the bpa,by deliberately engaging in the overbuilding of its fiber optic system for the purpose of entering communication leases,and by entering those communication leases,has exceeded the scope of its easement rights.according to tuthill characterization of the law,a physical invasion can occur when conditional permissive use of another property exceeds the conditions under which permission to use was obtained.tuthill describes this sort of invasion as a physical taking,and premises its entire argument on the government permanent physical occupation of its property.
tuthill correctly points to loretto teleprompter manhattan catv,d,to guide our analysis of physical takings law.in loretto,the supreme court held that a minor but permanent physical occupation of an owner property authorized by government constitutes a taking of property for which just compensation is due under the fifth and fourteenth amendments of the constitution.id.at.beyond this basic holding,however,the supreme court also provided a detailed review of the history of physical takings.this historical review is critical to resolving the present dispute,because the question here is not whether tuthill is due compensation for the government physical taking,but rather whether the government actions constitute a physical taking at all.
in loretto,a new york state law permitted the defendant cable company to install cables and a cable box on loretto apartment building.though the physical dimensions of the occupation were small,they were also definite cables and cable boxes occupy physical space.the supreme court ruled that no de minimis exception could apply to the constitutional takings doctrine,and that a small physical occupation was nevertheless a physical occupation.id.because the state had facilitated the occupation through its own laws,the state was liable for a taking albeit under the fourteenth amendment,rather than the fifth,and loretto was due just compensation.id.at.
in concluding that a permanent physical occupation authorized by government is a taking without regard to the public interests that it may serve,id.at,the supreme court compared the facts that loretto presented to those that arose in several earlier takings cases.the court first differentiated regulatory takings,of the type detailed in penn central transportation new york city,d,from physical takings,of the type that loretto that tuthill claims to be present here.see loretto,at.the penn central factors critical to determining which regulatory actions constitute regulatory takings are simply inapplicable when analyzing a physical taking the sole question governing physical takings is whether or not the government has physically occupied the plaintiff property.id.at.
the loretto court began its historical review of physical takings cases with pumpelly green bay,wall,and northern transportation chicago.these two cases established the importance of physical occupations and practical ousters to takings law.both cases involved the government construction of only one constituted a taking.in pumpelly,the dam caused permanent flooding of the plaintiff effecting a taking.pumpelly,wall.at.in northern transportation,a temporary dam built pending the completion of a tunnel that was also under construction denied the plaintiffs access to their property and consequently impaired their use of that property.northern transportation,at.the absence of even a minor physical occupation led the court to rule that no taking had occurred.id.numerous flooding cases followed,and the court uniformly distinguished between those involving a permanent physical occupation,on the one hand,and those involving a more temporary invasion,or a government action outside the owner property that causes consequential damages within,on the other.see loretto,at.citing united states lynah.bedford united states.united states cress.sanguinetti united states.united states kansas city life ins.
the supreme court development of its physical takings doctrine applied a similar set of rules to cases involving telephone and telegraph wires.see loretto,at.in louis western union telegraph,the court held that the city of louis could exact reasonable compensation for a telegraph company placement of telegraph poles on the city public streets.in western union telegraph pennsylvania railroad.the court assumed that when a telegraph company,acting pursuant to a federal law,constructed and operated telegraph lines over a railroad right of way the occupation by those telephone lines would be a compensable taking.
later cases,relying on the character of a physical occupation,clearly establish that permanent occupations of land by such installations as telegraph and telephone lines,rails,and underground pipes or wires are takings even if they occupy only relatively insubstantial amounts of space and do not seriously interfere with the landowner use of the rest of his land.
loretto,at.more recent cases confirm the distinction between a permanent physical occupation,a physical invasion short of an occupation,and a regulation that merely restricts the use of property.id.only the first permanent physical as a physical taking of the sort that tuthill alleges here.see id.at.physical invasions short of an occupation and regulations that merely restrict the use of property may qualify as regulatory takings,but not as physical takings.see id.the court described its recent cases as having emphasized the central role that an actual physical occupation plays in determining whether or not a physical taking had occurred.id.at.
perhaps the case whose facts come closest to the type of taking that tuthill alleges is kaiser aetna united states,d,where the government imposition of a navigational servitude requiring public access to a pond was a taking because the servitude took the pond owner right to exclude the public.id.at.the court was careful to explain,however,that the government imposition of this servitude would allow members of the public to invade and to occupy the effecting the requisite physical occupation.and even if the government physically invades only an easement in property,it must nonetheless pay just compensation.id.at.emphasis added.
of particular relevance to tuthill claim that the bpa actions constituted a per se physical taking,the loretto court explained that a lthough the easement of passage,not being a permanent occupation of land,was not considered a taking per se,kaiser aetna reemphasizes that a physical invasion is a government intrusion of an unusually serious character.loretto,at.
our own explanation of loretto and the scope of permissible takings claims is similarly relevant to determining the viability of tuthill claims.
the holding of loretto is quite narrow.it applies only to permanent physical occupations either by the government or by a third party acting under government authority.a physical occupation,as defined by the court,is a permanent and exclusive occupation by the government that destroys the owners right to possession,use,and disposal of the property.the court defined the destruction of these interests as follows possession,the owner has no right to possess the occupied space himself,and also has no power to exclude the occupier from possession and use of the space use,the permanent physical occupation of property forever denies the owner any power to control the use of the property he not only can not exclude others,but can make no nonpossessory use of the property and disposal,even though the owner may retain the bare legal right to dispose of the occupied space,the permanent occupation of that space will ordinarily empty the right of any value,since the purchaser will also be unable to make any use of the property.
boise cascade united states.
taken together,loretto characterization of kaiser aetna as failing to identify a per se taking,and our interpretation that loretto itself applies only in the presence of an actual physical occupation,point to the fatal flaw in tuthill claim.in answering the government interrogatories,tuthill conceded that there would be no taking if either the bpa were using all of the fibers that it laid or the bpa laid fibers only for its own use and did not lease unused fibers to third parties.in other words,tuthill concedes that the cable itself,which occupies physical space,is not the source of its complaint.tuthill alleges that the government use of the fibers within that cable constitutes a per se physical occupation of its prop
