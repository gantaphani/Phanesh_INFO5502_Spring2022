plaintiffs are the heirs of carlos rivera olvera decedent who,while trimming a redwood tree on september,was electrocuted by a high voltage power line of defendant pacific gas and electric company pg e.defendant the davey tree expert company is a vegetation contractor that contracted with pg e to perform inspections to ensure that proper clearances were maintained between pg e power lines and surrounding vegetation.plaintiffs complaint alleged several causes of action against pg e and the davey tree expert company and other defendants,many of which have been resolved by summary adjudication or settlement.
what remains and is now before us is the trial court order dismissing causes of action against both defendants for negligence and against pg e for premises liability,which claims are based on the allegation that defendants negligently,carelessly,recklessly,or in some other actionable manner,failed to inspect the power lines and trees in the vicinity of the power lines,and failed to maintain an adequate clearance of the power lines,so that the branches of the trees on the premises had grown above and around the volt line.said defendants knew,or in the exercise of reasonable care should have known,that the conditions constituted a dangerous condition and unreasonable risk of harm to those who would foreseeably be on the premises and in the vicinity of the trees and power lines,and that the danger would not be apparent to people such as the decedent.the trial court granted the defendants motion to dismiss because this court lacks subject matter jurisdiction under public utilities code section.plaintiffs have timely appealed 
background 
although plaintiffs complaint alleges that the power line in question did not comply with the minimum vegetation clearance requirements established by the california public utilities commission puc or commission,summary adjudication previously was granted against plaintiffs on their cause of action for negligence per se,based on undisputed evidence that the clearance did comply with the puc general order.plaintiffs opposition to the motion to dismiss and its appeal do not question this premise.however,plaintiffs contend that the puc minimum clearance requirements do not relieve the utility or its contractor from the duty to exercise reasonable care to maintain the power lines in a safe condition if compliance with the minimum requirements is not sufficient to do so,and that the superior court retains jurisdiction to remedy breaches of that duty.that was the view of a different trial judge who denied defendants earlier motion for summary judgment assuming defendants undisputed evidence demonstrates compliance with the statutory and regulatory clearance requirements for major wood stems found in puc general order,that fact does not establish,as a matter of law,that defendants did not breach their duty of due care to maintain the power lines in a safe condition at all times and places and under the changing circumstances of the particular case.citations.compliance with the general orders of the puc does not establish as a matter of law due care by the power company,but merely relieves it of the charge of negligence per se.it does not affect the question of negligence due to the acts or omissions of the company as related to the particular circumstances of the case.citation.nevis cal d.safety regulations prescribe only the minimum care required,and it is usually a matter for the jury to determine whether something more than the minimum was required under the evidence in the case.citations.pennington southern pacific d.
the judge hearing defendants subsequent motion to dismiss reached a different conclusion.this judge concluded that under the test established by the supreme court in san diego gas electric superior court cal th,covalt,and applied in what the court regarded as an analogous case,sarale pacific gas electric th sarale,plaintiffs claim falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the puc.
although the court in sarale was divided as to the outcome in that case,there was no disagreement as to the legal framework within which the issues must be analyzed.sarale,supra,th.we adopt that court summary of the governing law

employing its plenary power,the legislature enacted the public utilities act et,which vests the commission with broad authority to supervise and regulate every public utility in the state.covalt,supra,cal th at this broad authority authorizes the commission to do all things,whether specifically designated in the public utilities act or in addition thereto,which are necessary and convenient in the exercise of its jurisdiction over public utilities,italics omitted.the commission authority has been liberally construed citation,and includes not only administrative but also legislative and judicial powers.ibid.
commission action is subject to judicial review,the manner and scope of which is established by the legislature.cal,art.xii.pursuant to this constitutional provision,the legislature enacted article of chapter of the public utilities act,entitled judicial review et,which prescribes a method of judicial review that is narrow in both manner and scope.covalt,supra,cal th at among the provisions of that article is subdivision a of section,which provides that n o court of this state,except the supreme court and the court of appeal,to the extent specified in this article,shall have jurisdiction to review,reverse,correct,or annul any order or decision of the commission or to suspend or delay the execution or operation thereof,or to enjoin,restrain,or interfere with the commission in the performance of its official duties,as provided by law and the rules of court.
despite this limitation on the jurisdiction of trial courts to review commission rules and decisions,the legislature has provided for a private right of action against utilities for unlawful activities and conduct.specifically,section provides for an action to recover for loss,damage,or injury in any court of competent jurisdiction by any corporation or person against a ny public utility which does,causes to be done,or permits any act,matter,or thing prohibited or declared unlawful,or which omits to do any act,matter,or thing required to be done,either by the constitution,any law of this state,or any order or decision of the commission.
