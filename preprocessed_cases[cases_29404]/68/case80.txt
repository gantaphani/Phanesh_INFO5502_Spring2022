this case is before us on the petition of west penn power company and the potomac edison company allegheny power,allegheny energy supply company,llc,and their agent allegheny energy service corporation together,allegheny power or the company to review an order of the national labor relations board nlrb or the board.the board has filed a for enforcement of its order.the utility workers union of america,system local,the union has intervened on behalf of the board.the board determined that allegheny power violated section a and of the national labor relations act the nlra or the act,a and,by failing to provide the union with information about the company use of outside contractors for bargaining unit work.we conclude that the board is correct in its decision to order the company to produce requested information on incidents of contracting also referred to as subcontracting,including the use of a contractor for a special meter installation project.further consideration by the board is warranted,however,with respect to the union request for contractor cost data,and we remand for this limited purpose.we therefore enforce the board order except to the extent that it requires the production of cost data.
allegheny power generates electricity and distributes it to customers in parts of several states,including pennsylvania,maryland,west virginia,and virginia.since the late the company has had collective bargaining agreements with the union,which represents a unit of approximately employees.the union employees work at two dozen service centers,several power stations,and two general shops run by the company in the four states mentioned above.the company use of contractors for regular work has been a subject of bargaining for many years.in a november memorandum of agreement side agreement the company agreed to amplify the information provided to the union in the company quarterly contract work report.the side agreement obligates the company to furnish the union with the names of all contractors performing ordinary maintenance and repair work together with a description of the work and its location.though not mentioned in the side agreement,the start and finish dates of the work were included in the disclosures.for many years,or until about,the company provided the union with contractor work information on a quarterly basis at the level of detail just described.
by the allegheny power was interested in reducing costs associated with the use of outside contractors for regular maintenance and repair work.the union,on the other hand,was concerned that the company increasing use of contractors would lead to job losses for its membership.the union concern was heightened in when the company proposed to lay off bargaining unit employees at locations in pennsylvania.when the parties negotiated a new labor agreement in effective may,to may,they included two provisions to address these concerns.first,a contract work provision allowed the company to continue using outside contractors,but obligated the company to maintain a basic operating and maintenance force of sufficient size to take care of the expected regular work.second,a resource sharing provision permitted the company to temporarily reassign regular employees to any company location where their services were needed.the company was required to follow a particular order of preference in making reassignments local employees were used first,employees in contiguous locations were used next,and those in locations were used last.contractors were employed only if none of the regular employee groups just listed was sufficient to meet the demands of a job.together,these provisions were intended to maintain stable employment for bargaining unit employees,minimize costs for the company,and reduce the use of outside contractors.in october the parties agreed to extend their may labor contract through april.
in the the trend toward deregulation prompted allegheny power to alter its corporate structure.previously,allegheny power was made up of one parent company with three operating utility companies,each engaged in the generation and distribution of electricity.the restructuring consolidated operations into two business units,one for generation and one for distribution a separate service corporation performs administrative functions for the operational units.according to the company,the corporate reorganization led to changes in its hiring and record keeping practices with respect to contractors.instead of hiring contractors on a time and material basis,the company began hiring them on a project basis,paying a flat sum for each job.at the same time,the company began keeping records on contracting at a corporate center rather than at individual service centers or facilities.finally,in about allegheny power changed the format and substance of the contractor reports provided to the union,making less information available.
the first information request at issue stems from allegheny power switch to the new contractor report format in.the new report form had spaces for listing the name of the contractor,the type of work,its location,and the number of workers.in practice,however,the company noted only a broad description of the type of work,and it usually wrote down as needed in the column calling for the number of workers.moreover,the new form had no space for reporting a project start and end dates.union president william sterner believed that the new reports were deplorably inadequate,and he telephoned his complaints to the company director of employee relations,robert kemerer,on three or four occasions in.sterner pointed out to kemerer that the reports were incomplete and lacking in detail.sterner also emphasized to kemerer that in order to enforce the contract,the union needed to know what was going on out there as far as contracting was concerned.after sterner telephone requests yielded no information,the union made seven written requests to the company between september and january,pointing out that information on contracting was incomplete,inadequate,untimely,or missing altogether.
the union first wrote allegheny power about the contractor report problem on september.the letter noted that the second quarter reports were incomplete and that reports were missing for many seventeen out of of the service centers.the union requested complete information,stating that it was necessary for the union to protect the interests of its members.when the company failed to respond,the union wrote again on november,requesting a complete set of contractor reports for the first three quarters of.finally,on january,debra west,who had replaced kemerer as employee relations director,supplied the union with contractor reports for the third quarter of,showing contract work at a few locations.west asserted that the company had supplied the most complete data it had and that it had satisfied its reporting obligations under the side agreement.
in a march,letter to the company,the union complained again that the contractor reports had routinely been many months late.the union pointed out that the side agreement did not limit the union contractual and statutory rights to request information about contracting.the union noted that there were no third quarter contractor reports for some seventeen locations,and it asked the company to clarify whether the failure to supply a contractor report for a particular location meant there was no contract work being done there.
the company continued to provide the union with contractor information in the same incomplete fashion,submitting certain fourth quarter data on march,and first quarter data on may.the company failed to answer the union question about whether the absence of reports for specific locations meant there was no contracting.the union continued to press for information,reminding the company in a may,letter that i mportant information about subcontracting has continually been withheld from us.the union needed the information on contracting,it said,in order to enforce the labor contract,including the provisions on resource sharing,and to respond to constant questions from members about contracting.union counsel also weighed in,writing company counsel on july,to request data on actual outside contractor usage,at each facility,by dates,job locations,contractor and specific types of work.emphasis in original.the union needed the data,its counsel explained,to determine trends in contractor usage and investigate whether bargaining unit jobs or work tasks are being diverted to other locations.
on july,the company responded to the union may letter,stating that the company had provided readily available contractor information.the company claimed that it had timely provided such information as it was legally and contractually obligated to supply.the company acknowledged,however,that it was considering the feasibility of refining the form and substance of the new contractor reports.next,on august,the company provided the union with certain second quarter reports,but reports on more than twenty locations were not included.
the huge gaps in contractor information for many locations and months were highlighted by the union in a letter to the company dated august.the union complained that the as needed language routinely inserted in the number of workers column in contractor reports was so general as to be meaningless.because of the company inadequate responses,the union concluded that it would become harder to piece together complete information as time went on.id.as a result,in its letter of august,the union requested data processing information from january,onward for contractor costs incurred by the company.the union explained that this information would reveal trends before and after the effective date of the collective bargaining agreement,in which the company committed to reduce the use of outside contractors.the union sought contractor cost data for each accounting period by location,vendor,and type of work,excluding localities not serviced by union members and types of work not performed by them in the past.id.
the company continued to send the union some quarterly contractor reports,but the problems with gaps,abridged information,and tardiness remained.the union made its final request on january,advising the company that it had not timely or fully responded to the union ongoing requests for contractor information.the letter noted that some of the reports were as much as seven months to two years late.the union again requested information showing the trends and amounts paid to outside contractors and the work units performed by them.the information was necessary,the union said,for it to investigate whether any particular incidents of contracting violated the labor agreement resource sharing provisions and whether general patterns of contracting violated the company commitment to allow unit employees to perform regular maintenance and repair work.according to the union,the information would also be important for upcoming contract negotiations.
the company failure to respond to the union requests for contractor information,made over a period from to,may be summed up as follows.first,the contractor report forms did not adequately describe the type of work performed or indicate the start and end dates for contract jobs.although the form had a column for providing the number of workers used on a particular job,the company usually inserted as needed rather than a number.and the company did not respond to the union objection that this practice was not informative.finally,at the hearing before the alj,the company employee relations director conceded that as needed could only be relied on as an indication that a contractor had been retained.she admitted that the term could mean the job might not have been started,might be ongoing,or might be completed and that the company made no effort to ascertain the status of the contract work listed or the number of workers involved.second,some of the contractor information was provided as much as two years late.third,for a majority of locations over twenty no information was provided at all for many calendar quarters,and the union was never told whether the failure to provide information for a particular location meant that no contractors were being used.fourth,no data processing information on contractor costs was provided in response to the union requests,and the employee relations director admitted that she made no effort to ascertain what sort of data processing records might be available.
the second information request at issue deals with allegheny power electric load research initiative elri,an experimental project.the elri project involved the use of new meters designed to measure customer electric usage and transmit the data on a basis over telephone lines to a data processing center.the company contracted with itron,to install the new meters in a service area in the union jurisdiction,and the union first learned about the project when a union member happened to see information about it in a company newsletter to customers.thereafter,a bargaining unit meter technician complained to the union that he had seen a employee,who was not observing proper safety precautions,doing meter installation work in his service area.
on november,the union wrote the company and asked for a copy of the itron contract and the meter installation schedule.the union said it needed the information to fully represent the interests of its members.four months later,on march,the company furnished the contract and schedule,which indicated that the work had already begun.the company explained in a subsequent,may,letter to the union that it contracted out the installation work on the elri project due to the existing workload of the union meter technicians and the large amount of work to be completed in a short time.
in an effort to evaluate the company claim,the union requested additional information in june,including whether any unit employees were out of the meter installation location around the time the work was performed whether any unit employees were out of other locations during the same time period and the staffing levels on the project compared with those specified in the labor contract during any period in which employees were being into the meter installation location.the company responded by providing resource sharing information concerning only unit meter technicians.it claimed that because meter technicians alone would be qualified to work on the installation project,only data about those workers were relevant to the union concern.additionally,with respect to category,the company replied that there were no labor contract provisions specifying staffing levels in the relevant location.the union countered on august,that other unit employees such as servicemen and substation electricians could have performed the meter installation work.the union thus renewed its request for information on any employees who were during the project it also renewed its request for staffing level data,pointing out that a side agreement specified staffing levels for the location in question.the company,however,failed to provide any of this information.
dissatisfied with allegheny power responses to these and other requests for information,the union filed unfair labor practice charges with the board.thereafter,the board regional director,on behalf of the general counsel,issued a complaint against the company alleging that it had violated section a and of the nlra by either failing to provide information to the union or failing to provide it in a timely manner.the complaint dealt with information on six subjects,including the company use of outside contractors to perform unit work and the elri meter installation project.the case proceeded to a hearing before an administrative law judge who issued a decision finding that the company violated the act by failing to produce information on two subjects,outside contracting and the meter installation project.the alj ordered the company to provide any unfurnished information on the meter installation project.with respect to information on contracting,the alj ordered the parties to bargain in good faith to reach an accommodation over the level of detail and time period of data to be provided.
the board affirmed the alj determination that allegheny had not provided adequate and timely responses to the union requests for information on the two subjects mentioned.the board altered the alj choice of remedy on contractor information,ordering the company to produce the information instead of bargaining over the extent of production.the company should have bargained with the union over production of information at the time it was requested,the board said.moreover,the board noted that a ny issues regarding the burdensomeness of producing the information are appropriately handled at the compliance stage of the proceeding.id.allegheny energy now petitions for review of the board order,and the board for enforcement.
allegheny power makes several arguments in urging us to set aside the board order requiring the company to provide the union with the requested information on contracting and the elri meter installation project.with respect to the information on contracting,the company argues that the union failed to establish that the information was relevant and necessary,the company provided the most complete information available to it,and production of the information would have subjected the company to an undue burden.the company further argues that even if it violated the act in failing to produce contractor information,the proper remedy is to require the parties to bargain over the extent of the information to be provided.with respect to the information on the elri project,the company contends that it was not relevant and that the company made timely and adequate responses in any event.finally,as an overriding proposition,the company argues that the union demands were made in bad faith,thus excusing the company for inadequate or late responses.for the reasons that follow,we reject the company arguments,except that we remand for further consideration on the limited issue of whether contractor cost data must be provided.
an employer obligation to furnish information needed by the bargaining representative of its employees is rooted in the nlra.it is an unfair labor practice for an employer to interfere with,restrain,or coerce employees in the exercise of their organizational and bargaining rights guaranteed by the act or to refuse to bargain collectively with the representatives of its employees.a.this,among other things,imposes the general obligation on an employer to provide information that is needed by the bargaining representative for the proper performance of its duties.nlrb acme indus,d.and the duty to provide information extends beyond the period of contract negotiations and applies to relations during the term of an agreement.id.at.a union right to information depends upon the probability that the desired information i s relevant,and that it would be of use to the union in carrying out its statutory duties and responsibilities.id.at.this is a liberal,standard,id.and id,which means that information is relevant if it is germane and has any bearing on the subject matter of the case,walter yoder sons,nlrb,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.

allegheny power and the dissent contend that the union failed to establish the relevance of the requested contractor information or the union need for it.the company divides the contractor information requests into two categories information about the incidents of and information about the costs of contracting.
we consider first whether the union established the relevance of,and need for,information concerning the extent of the company use of contractors.the board found that the requested information about contracting was relevant and necessary for the union to police two provisions in its contract,the contract work provision and the resource sharing provision.substantial evidence supports this finding.first,the contract work provision allows the company to contract out maintenance and repair work if it maintains a workforce of sufficient size to take care of its expected regular work.this provision protects union members from the diversion of bargaining unit work to contractors.the union interest in policing this provision is underscored by the fact that the number of unit employees in pennsylvania alone shrunk from to between and.second,the resource sharing provision permits the company to reassign employees temporarily to perform necessary work.the company must assign this temporary work under an order of preference established in the contract available employees closest to the location needing workers are reassigned first,and contractors are used only as a last resort.resource sharing is intended to benefit the company by reducing costs and to benefit the union by reducing the use of contractors.the union can police the company compliance with the order of preference provision only if the company provides it with information about the extent of contractor use.finally,the union received occasional word from members that they had seen contractors doing unit work at locations not listed on reports provided by the company.in sum,the requested information about the extent of contracting is relevant to the union duty to administer or police the collective bargaining agreement.
the company and the dissent contend that the union failed in its burden to inform the company of why the contractor information was relevant when it was requested.see abell,at.the union burden to state relevancy is excused if the relevance of the information is apparent from the face of the request.id.at.the record establishes that the union informed the company on a number of occasions why the contractor information was relevant and needed.to begin with,in,before any written requests were made,the union president called the company three or four times to complain that the contractor information was incomplete and inadequate and that the union needed to know where contractors were working and what they were doing in order to enforce the contract.when these oral requests yielded nothing,the union followed up with letters.most of the letters explained why the information was needed to protect the interests of union members september,to investigate the problems that is,claims that the company was violating resource sharing and staffing level provisions in the contract or to respond to constant questions from members may,to ascertain trends in contractor hours and to investigate whether bargaining unit jobs or work tasks are being diverted from certain locations july,to investigate trends in contracting before and after the company made contract commitments in to use resource sharing to reduce outside contracting august,to investigate whether patterns of contracting have created across the board unfairness and whether any particular subcontracting episodes violated contractual provisions on resource sharing july.
moreover,as the alj found and the board noted,the union motives in for obtaining the contractor data were crystal clear to the company in view of the parties discussion on this subject,since at least.see.thus,even if the union had not fully stated in its written requests the relevance of information about the use of contractors,relevance was apparent from the face of the requests in sum,to the extent the union was requesting information on the incidents of contracting,relevance and need were established.
allegheny power contends that the board failed to apply the proper standard for requiring it to provide contractor cost data.in concluding that the union was entitled to all of the information on contracting it had requested,the board did not distinguish between information on the incidents of contracting and cost data.the cost data is relevant here because it could show the extent of the company use of outside contractors.nevertheless,to obtain profit data or other aspects of an employer financial condition,the union must show a specific need for the information in each particular case.acl,see also united furniture workers of america nlrb,cir.of course,when an employer asserts cost as the reason for its inability to meet the union demands,that may provide the union with justification for requiring financial data.united furniture workers of america,at.in any event,the board did not determine whether the union had demonstrated a specific need for the cost data in this case.
the company maintains that it has never claimed that costs played any role in its decision to subcontract.br.of petitioner at.this position,the board maintains,is contradicted by the resource sharing provision in the labor contract,which states the intent of resource sharing is to reduce costs and reduce the need for contracting out work.emphasis added.the board also points out in its brief that the union only requested the cost data toward the end of its efforts,when it became concerned that the company was making it increasingly more difficult to piece together information about contractor usage.we decline to settle this argument because the board should determine in the first instance whether the union has shown a specific need for the contractor cost data.we will order a limited remand for that purpose.
allegheny power argues that it complied with the act because it provided the union with the most complete information it had available on the incidents of contracting.the dissent agrees with the company,noting that once the company switched to hiring contractors for a flat fee on a project basis,the contractors,not the company,determined the number and type of laborers used,and the company did not collect such data from contractors.post at.this does not excuse the company.it had the affirmative obligation to make reasonable efforts to obtain from its contractors relevant information,that is,information needed by the union to police the collective bargaining agreement.pub.serv.of,see also int l protective,wl,a n employer has a duty to supply to the union relevant requested information which may not be in its possession,but where the information likely can be obtained from a third party with whom the employer had a business relationship.congreso de uniones industriales de puerto rico nlrb,cir a n employer,confronted with a union information request,must make reasonable efforts to obtain the relevant information from another corporation,such as a parent company.in this case,the company does not even claim that it asked its contractors for the information,so it did not meet its obligation of making reasonable efforts to obtain it.
the dissent cites korn,nlrb,cir,to assert that allegheny power is not obligated to provide the union with information that it does not have.post at.korn does not let an employer off the hook that easily rather,korn held that the employer is not required to furnish information which is not available to it.at emphasis added.here,we do not know whether information about the incidents of the company use of contractors would have been made available if the company had simply asked its contractors for it.again,a reasonable effort by the company to obtain and turn over the contractor information is key for without this information,the union can not know whether the company contracted out unit work in violation of the labor contract.
allegheny power argues that it was not required to produce the contractor information because production would have subjected the company to an undue burden.the dissent adds that the board failed to give due attention to this defense.post at.the union requests for contractor data were unduly burdensome,the dissent claims,because of the ir number,repetitiveness,and overlapping nature,id.at,and because compliance would require the company to implement new procedures to gather and disseminate the data,id.as we will explain,the company failed to establish undue burden at the request and hearing stages.nevertheless,the board will allow any issues of undue burden to be revisited and handled at the compliance stage.
the union made seven written requests for contractor information over a period.to the extent these requests were repetitive or overlapping,it was largely the company fault.for example,on november,the union reminded the company that it had not received contractor reports requested on september,on august,the union requested centralized data processing information on contractor costs because the information produced so far ha d been so incomplete and because data from the field would be harder to piece together as time goes on,on january,the union repeated its request for the contractor information it had been asking for,orally and in writing,over the last two years,and on january,the union reminded the company that it had never answered its questions as to whether a missing report for a location meant there were no contractors,id.emphasis in original.
the company has not made a case that producing the contractor information would be an undue burden.to do so,the company would have to it has not it made a reasonable effort to obtain the information from its contractors.in addition,the company failed to make reasonable efforts to determine what information was available within the company.specifically,when the director of employee relations learned for the first time in late that the company maintained data processing records on contract jobs,she made no effort whatsoever to investigate and determine what information might be available for production to the union.finally,any burden on the company to produce the information may be of its own doing.as the union warned in its request of august,as more months go by,managers will probably say it gets harder and harder to recreate what subcontracting occurred.
the board considered the company defense of undue burden,but determined that the company was obligated to produce the information requested about contracting.however,in the remedial portion of its order the board made clear that a ny issues regarding the burdensomeness of producing the information can be appropriately handled in the compliance stage of the proceeding.this arrangement is consistent with the board broad discretion to fashion appropriate remedies.see.power nlrb.safeway stores,nlrb,cir.
allegheny power next argues that the board erred in determining that it violated the act by delaying the turnover of certain information and by failing to provide other information on the elri project on meter installation.the union requested the itron contract and resource sharing and data pertinent to the elri project.the company contends that the union did not establish the relevance of this information or make its relevance known to the company.the board determined that the information requested on this project was relevant to the union major and ongoing concern with contracting,and the record supports this determination.further,as we have already discussed,see supra part,the company was fully aware that the union was requesting this type of information for the legitimate purpose of policing the collective bargaining agreement.
the company argues that the board erred in finding that the company was tardy in supplying the union with a copy of the itron contract and the meter installation schedule.again,we disagree.the company entered into its contract with itron on october,and the union asked for a copy of the contract and installation schedule on november.the company did not supply the union with this information until march,almost four months after it was requested.work on the project was under way by this time,and the board found that the company delay in providing the contract and installation schedule prevented the union from taking any action before the contract work began.substantial evidence supports this finding,and the board did not err in determining that the company unlawfully delayed in producing the information.
finally,allegheny power contends that it provided all of the information needed by the union with respect to resource sharing and staffing levels insofar as these subjects relate to the elri meter installation project.the company,however,limited the information it provided on resource sharing to information about meter technicians,even though the union contended that other unit employees could also do the installation work.in addition,requested information was not provided.the board determined that the union demonstrated a need for the information it was necessary for the union to police contractual provisions on resource sharing and staffing levels,provisions that are relevant to the union legitimate concern about the company use of outside contractors.the record supports this conclusion.in sum,the union was entitled to the resource sharing and data that was relevant to the elri meter installation project.
allegheny power argues that the union acted in bad faith by flooding it with information requests,thus excusing the company for inadequate or tardy responses.see nlrb wachter,cir when the predominate purpose of the party making the request is one of bad faith,the other party has no duty to respond.the alj,after noting that he would evaluate the case with the issue of bad faith in mind,made no finding of improper motive or bad faith on the union part.nor would the record support such a finding.
the dissent contends that the union bad faith is evidenced by the fact that it submitted to the company over a period in and separate requests for information concerning different subjects.post at.a review of the list of the requests reveals that they sought information on a broad range of legitimate subjects implicating the union duty to represent its members.specifically,the union requested information on subjects including pension coverage,safety issues and accidents,employee evaluations,disciplinary issues,underground training,workers compensation procedures,clothing issues,safety equipment costs,tool repair,and vacation and sick pay.when considered in context,the number of requests over the particular time span is hardly surprising.the union represented members at over thirty locations in four states.moreover,the requests came during times that were and are challenging for both labor and management.as the company emphasizes,since the,the electric utility industry has been in a state of flux due to significant government deregulation.br.of petitioner at.
the company and the dissent point to one of the union later requests for expanded information as a specific example of the union bad faith.this is the union august,request for data processing information on contractor costs from forward.for no good reason,the company says,the union suddenly changed its demand from seeking information regarding contractors from and to seeking detailed cost information from as far back as.id.at emphasis in original.although we are remanding for the board to give further consideration to whether the cost data should be produced,there is no evidence that the union sought this information in bad faith.the union was frustrated because it had not received timely and complete information on contracting after asking for it repeatedly.because of the passage of time,the union was legitimately concerned that information would be hard to piece together in the field.this led the union to conclude that central data processing information showing trends in contracting might be the only means to evaluate the company commitment to reduce its reliance on outside contractors.the union thinking,which it revealed to the company,reflects no dishonesty of purpose.
the company makes the broad assertion that it responded in good faith to the union requests.picking up on this,the dissent says that h ad the record been taken as a whole,the board could not have reasonably concluded that allegheny power failed to meet its statutory obligation to bargain in good faith.post at citing nlrb truitt.internal quotation marks omitted.the dissent appears to suggest that the company responses to the contractor information requests do not amount to a violation because the available personnel were forced to respond simultaneously to other topical requests made by the union.id.there is no rule that excuses an employer from complying with requests for relevant information on some subjects simply because it has complied with requests on other,unrelated subjects.
in any event,we have reviewed the record as a whole,see f,and several significant factors are present to defeat the company good faith argument.first,the company did not make any effort,let alone a reasonable one,to obtain the requested information from its contractors.second,the company never answered the union question of whether the failure to provide reports for seventeen of the two dozen service centers meant there was no contracting in those areas.third,the company did not respond to the union early objection about the vagueness of the as needed language inserted in the number of workers column on most of the new contractor report forms.fourth,the employee relations director did not make any investigation into what the company data processing records might show with respect to the incidents of contracting.finally,when the company did provide information,it was often many months late.simply put,the company fell short in meeting its obligations under the nlra.
in sum,an objective reading of the record reveals that the board did not err in concluding that allegheny power violated section a and of the nlra by its failure to respond adequately to the union requests for information about contracting and the elri project and by its delay in furnishing information.therefore,with one limited exception,we deny the company petition for review.the petition is granted to allow a remand to the board for further consideration of the union request for contractor cost data.we grant the board for enforcement of its order except as it relates to cost data.
petition for review denied in part and granted in part,and partial remand ordered for enforcement granted in part and denied in part 
over a period,local of the utility workers union of america the union presented allegheny power with separate requests for information regarding distinct issues.during this period,no collective bargaining or arbitration was taking place or was imminent.nonetheless,allegheny power responded to every inadequately from the union devoted hundreds of employee hours to doing so.dissatisfied with the responses,the union filed complaints alleging that allegheny power violated a and a of the national labor relations act by failing to provide information relevant and necessary to the union role as the employees exclusive bargaining representative.
the national labor relations board nlrb or board found two violations,holding that allegheny power failed to make an adequate response to the requested information on of the issues by not providing all the information requested or failing to provide it timely.accordingly,the board concluded that allegheny power did not act in good faith in discharging its responsibilities under the national labor relations act.from the nlrb order,allegheny power filed this petition for review,and the nlrb filed a for enforcement of its order.
because the board failed to consider the record as a whole failed to require the union,as a condition to obtaining information,to demonstrate the legal relevancy and need for the information requested and failed altogether to address allegheny power claimed,of documents requested,and union bad one of which would have provided allegheny power with a complete defense,the board order can not be enforced.had the board imposed the legal requirement on the union of demonstrating the legal relevancy and need for the information or had the board considered the context of allegheny power conduct,it would have had to conclude,on the basis of binding precedent,that allegheny power did not fail in its statutory obligation to bargain in good faith.nlrb truitt.
for these reasons,i would grant allegheny power petition for review and deny the board for enforcement of its order.
the national labor relations act provides that employers engage in unfair labor practices when they interfere with,restrain,or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed by the act or when they refuse to bargain collectively with the representatives of their employees.a.as part of these statutory obligations,employers have a general obligation to provide information that is needed by the bargaining representative for the proper performance of its duties.nlrb acme indus,d.thus,a union right to obtain relevant information is statutory and not contractual.nlrb am.can,cir.
because the duty to provide information is inherent in the requirements imposed by the act,this duty is highly dependent upon context.the supreme court has instructed that t he duty to supply information under a turns upon the circumstances of the particular case,and much the same may be said for the type of disclosure that will satisfy that duty.detroit edison nlrb,d citation omitted.indeed,an employer is not automatically obligated to produce available information merely because a union demands it,nor to produce information in a manner the union requests.see id.at.rather,the relevant inquiry must always be whether or not under the circumstances of the particular case the statutory obligation to bargain in good faith has been met.truitt,at.see also local,detroit newspaper printing graphic communications union nlrb,clarifying that the requirement applies both to employer and union.we therefore examine the nature of the union requests for information,the statutory context in which the requests were made,and the nature of the employer response when determining whether an nlrb ruling is appropriate in the circumstances of the particular case.
accordingly,to obtain information under a,a union must demonstrate,as a condition to obtaining the information,that the information is relevant and necessary to its performance of collective bargaining responsibilities.see nlrb abell,cir.while information pertaining to union employees is presumptively relevant,other information is not entitled to such a presumption.id.thus,when a union demands information other than information pertaining to union employees,the union bears the burden of establishing its relevancy.see walter yoder sons,nlrb,cir abell,at.to demonstrate relevancy,a union must 
make a formal request based on a reasonable belief that the information is necessary and show that it is relevant in order to trigger the employer obligation to give the information 
i nformation is relevant if it is germane and has any bearing on the subject matter of the case.
the practical burden upon the union then is to show that the information will aid investigation of contract violations where the union has established a reasonable basis to suspect such violations have occurred.actual violations need not be established in order to show relevancy.

when a union has carried its burden of demonstrating relevancy and necessity,the burden of production shifts to the employer.even so,the employer need not produce information that it does not have,nor need it conduct studies for the purpose of supplying the union with the information requested.see howe sipes,a n employer can be expected to supply only that information which it actually possesses or it can reasonably acquire.there is no requirement that,in response to a request for information,an employer conduct independent cost studies or analysis see also korn,nlrb,cir.the employer also need not honor the union request when the employer can demonstrate that the union request was made in bad faith.see nlrb wachter,cir.finally,an employer can not be compelled to provide information if doing so would cause undue burden.see westinghouse,t he obligation of an employer to bargain in good faith does not require him to comply with a union request for information if compliance is unduly burdensome see also wachter,at safeway stores,nlrb,cir.
with these principles in hand,we review the nlrb rulings for compliance with them.and with respect to findings,we determine whether they are supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole.f.
the employer in this case,west penn power and the potomac edison allegheny power and allegheny energy supply allegheny power,engages in the generation and distribution of electricity and operates power stations in maryland,pennsylvania,virginia,and west virginia.allegheny power maintains collective bargaining agreements with four different unions,including the union in this case,the utility workers union of america the union,with the earliest agreement reached in the late.the relevant collective bargaining agreement between allegheny power and the union became effective may,to expire april.but by an agreement reached in october,the collective bargaining agreement was extended through april.
over the years,allegheny power had long provided relevant information requested by the union so that the union could perform its duties as the collective bargaining representative.in addition,in,allegheny power entered into an agreement agreement to provide the union with copies of quarterly contractor work reports regarding contractors under hire by the company.under this arrangement,allegheny power provided the names of contractors that performed ordinary maintenance and repair work for the company,the specific work performed,and the location of such work.the agreement also permitted the union to submit specific requests for contractor data and required the company,in response,to furnish similar information and disclosure within its possession on contractors or subcontractors whenever the union believe d,in good faith,it ha d a specific dispute or grievance on a specific use of contractors.this agreement,however,contained no requirements regarding the exact format of the contractor reports,and no such requirements were ever added by the parties.
during the,government deregulation and increasing utility competition created significant challenges for,and required commensurate adjustments by,the electric utility industry.in response to the challenges,allegheny power changed from an model to a model,which involved the consolidation of three previously separate operating companies into a single entity.among the changes that resulted from this consolidation was a shift from hiring contractors on a time and material basis to hiring them on a project basis.after that change,allegheny power provided job specifications to the contractors for each project,and the contractors,in turn,charged a flat rate,allocating such workers and resources as they deemed necessary to complete the project.
in the years before,allegheny power received very few requests for information from local,the pennsylvania chapter of the union.but all of that changed in may.
beginning with a request on may,and continuing for some months thereafter,the volume of information requests submitted by local increased dramatically and expanded well beyond the traditional information requests relating to arbitration or contract negotiations.indeed,there was no arbitration or contract negotiation ongoing or anticipated in the expiration date of the collective bargaining agreement had been extended to through an october agreement.yet the record shows that local submitted,over the next months,separate requests for information concerning different subjects,ranging over a wide gamut from matters regarding individual union members,to clothing concerns,underground training,and tool repair.moreover,these requests were made in addition to ongoing meetings between company officials and their union counterparts to talk about general company issues and to talk and resolve issues such as fire resistant clothing,resource sharing and grievances.these requests were also in addition to regular telephone conversations between the company and local.despite the open avenues for oral communication,however,the number of the union formal information requests continued to swell.
faced with this significant increase in information requests,allegheny power response the alj found in this effort of five fulltime employees devoting hundred s of hours.the president of local later agreed that the union had asked for voluminous information,and got voluminous information,although not always everything it wanted.and the alj found that allegheny power responded in some fashion to all of the requests.a summary of the requests and responses,as contained in the record at,follows 
apparently dissatisfied with allegheny power responses,the union filed complaints with the nlrb,alleging that allegheny power failed to provide timely and sufficient information on of the topics requested by local,namely requests with respect to quarterly contractor work reports,the electric load research initiative project,foreign electric utilities,data at the oakland and cumberland service centers,local member phil cosner,and vacations.on numbers and,the nlrb found violations.
with respect to number,the quarterly contractor work reports,local complained that changes to the format of allegheny power reports reduced the flow of information to the union and thus constituted an unfair labor practice.prior to,each service center and power station in the allegheny power network compiled numerical totals of the workers contracted to perform specified tasks and then provided these data to the union.in,following allegheny power reorganization,the company centralized its data collection efforts and began to hire outside contractors on a project basis.as a result of these changes,the information provided to local in the quarterly contractor work reports became more general than had previously been the case.instead of providing numerical data and descriptions of the employees staffing a project,allegheny power listed the number to be as needed by the contractor because the contractor,not allegheny,determined the number and kinds of workers to staff the project,billing allegheny power only on a project basis,not on a basis.this generalization in reporting,the union contended,constituted an unfair labor practice.
with respect to number,the electric load research initiative project the elri project,local complained that allegheny power provided inadequate information on an untimely basis.in october,allegheny power entered into a contract with itron,to install hardware and provide data collection services for the elri project,a pilot program designed to ascertain whether data from customers meters could be transmitted to the utility by telephone,in real time,without the use of meter readers.after a union worker noticed activity in at a frederick,maryland facility,the union contacted allegheny power in november and requested a copy of the company contract with itron,along with a time schedule for installation of the elri meters.allegheny power provided this information in march.the union then made two further requests in april for a significant amount of additional information on numerous topics.for example,the union sought whatever documents describe or refer to the company elri work and the activities of itron,including but not limited to advisories and newsletters descriptions of training and safety procedures relating to the elri project use of identification by itron workers and detailed information on each individual who has been involved with the project.despite the magnitude of this request,allegheny power responded within one month with a lengthy,response.this response was,in turn,met by another broad inquiry the following month,and,after first informing the union that the breadth of the inquiry was causing delay in the company response,allegheny power then provided another lengthy reply.later,apparently on its own initiative,allegheny power provided local with copies of its elri project newsletter along with an accounting of subcontractor hours devoted to the project,broken down by location.nevertheless,in its complaint to the nlrb,the union contended that allegheny power responses were untimely and inadequate and thus constituted an unfair labor practice.
in finding that allegheny power committed unfair labor practices in failing to provide adequate information on a timely basis,the board found that the parties agreement on the quarterly contractor work reports did not limit the union right to make information requests pursuant to a.it concluded that the union sought such information to police its agreement and that the timing of the requests,as related to the upcoming contract negotiations,strongly supports the union need for the information.similarly,the board found that allegheny power violated a by failing adequately to provide the union with data from the elri project.the board also found that a delay by allegheny power in responding to one of the union four written requests on the elri project also violated a,as did the company failure to provide information beyond meter technicians.as a remedy for these purported violations,the nlrb entered an order,dated july,requiring allegheny power to provide the data sought by the union.
from the board order,allegheny power filed this petition for review,and the board filed a for enforcement of its order.
in addressing the two issues on which the nlrb found violations,the board measured only a handful of allegheny power responses in isolation,without considering the context in which the company had responded to the union numerous information requests.in doing so,the board failed to address the issues on the record considered as a whole,as required by statute.f.for the same reason,it also failed to take into account,again as required by law,the circumstances of the particular case.see truitt,at.emphasis added.when the record as a whole is considered,the evidence does not support a finding that allegheny power failed in its statutory obligation to bargain in good faith.id.at.
the union submitted requests for information,and the alj found as facts that no request by the union went unanswered and that allegheny power committed the resources of five employees to provide responses to these requests.even on the two issues as to which the board found violations,the union had made multiple and various requests,and allegheny power was required to make numerous responses,providing the union with a large volume of material.taken in this context,allegheny power responses do not justify the board finding that the company failed to bargain in good faith.
the union chose to litigate the responses on subjects,but these inquiries represented only a small portion of the subjects on which the union demanded information.also,there were repeated and various inquiries on many subjects,so that the different topics became the subject of separate inquiries presented over the space of months.in addition,the board failed to consider that the volume of information that the union requested was far greater than the number of requests that had theretofore been made by local,or,for that matter,by any other union.it also failed to take accurate notice of the extent to which the requests were proximate to other relevant events,such as arbitration cases or contract negotiations.the failure to take these contextual elements into account fatally undermined the nlrb findings.
in his findings of fact,the alj found 
from may to december,the union requested information from allegheny power regarding subject areas,which was a substantial increase over previous years.the company responded in some fashion to all requests,taking five fulltime employees hundred s of hours to do so.
moreover,the alj acknowledged that in the midst of this deluge,the staffperson employed by allegheny power to manage such requests was replaced.finally,the alj noted that t he most recent agreement ran from may,to may,but the parties extended it until april,a fact apparently overlooked by the board.
to appreciate these statistical data in the record,the board would have had to have recognized that beginning on may,and continuing through december,the union issued on average one request every seven days,and that additional requests were submitted even before responses had been received from allegheny power on earlier requests.yet allegheny power responded to every request.of the submitted,it responded to or within a period or within days and or within days.moreover,the various topics of inquiry were not submitted chronologically or in discrete time periods.to the contrary,the union submitted information requests in a haphazard fashion.for example,on september,the union submitted its first request regarding the quarterly contractor work reports.while allegheny power was preparing its response to that request,the union submitted nine additional requests for information concerning seven other topics.nonetheless,the company responded to all of these other inquiries,taking an average of days per inquiry to submit its responses.this example demonstrates how a narrow view of the only the response to the one request on quarterly contractor work a distortion of the facts.yet this was the approach followed by the board.
in addition,the union information requests were complex in nature and required aggregations of many different types of data.the record before us on appeal contains only a limited snapshot of the total information requests,but even this small portion of the picture is dramatic.for example,the union wrote on april,to request information about the elri project,and it asked for nine different categories of information,ranging from details about allegheny power contract with itron,to information on each person involved in the elri project,to descriptions of the skills related to the elri project,to training programs implemented by allegheny power to develop such skills.to answer these inquiries required allegheny power to devote significant amounts of time and human resources,particularly considering that the limited number of the company personnel was also forced to respond simultaneously to other topical requests made by the union.
the inclusion of these contextual elements,which the board failed to consider,provides a totally different picture from that presented by the board and by the majority.had the record been taken as a whole,the board could not have reasonably concluded that allegheny power failed to meet its statutory obligation to bargain in good faith.see truitt,at.
in considering out of context the two topics on which the board found quarterly contractor work reports and the elri board also failed to enforce upon the union its established legal duty to demonstrate factually,as a condition to receiving information,that the information is relevant and necessary.the board accepted implicitly the union highly generalized statement,made without any factual support,that the information was needed in order for the union to protect the interests of its members.in challenging the adequacy of this explanation as a justification for the information,allegheny power contends that,because the information did not relate to union members,the union was required to demonstrate the relevance of the information and the union need for it,particularly when no arbitration or collective bargaining negotiations were ongoing or pending.allegheny power position is indisputably supported by applicable law.
when information requested does not pertain to union is the case for the two issues before is not presumptively relevant.see wachter,at abell,at united furniture workers nlrb,cir finding that cost,profit,and other financial information are not presumptively relevant.in order to obtain information that is not presumptively relevant,the union must 
make a formal request based on a reasonable belief that the information is necessary and show that it is relevant in order to trigger the employer obligation to give the information 
the practical burden upon the union then is to show that the information will aid investigation of contract violations where the union has established a reasonable basis to suspect such violations have occurred.
walter yoder sons,at emphasis added internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
in addition,for financial data,the union had to show a specific need in each particular case or had to establish that the company,by way of justification for subcontracting work,claimed a present financial inability to meet the union demands.united furniture workers,at see also equitable gas nlrb,cir d ata regarding subcontracting costs where bargaining is not required,is relevant only when lower costs are urged by the employer as a motivating factor behind the subcontracting decision.
finally,regardless of the subject matter of a request,the union in every case is obligated to establish its claim to the information,see rice growers ass n,at,and the justification must be presented to the employer contemporaneously,not merely as a later rationalization made during administrative hearings,abell,at.
the union justifications for the information in this case met none of the criteria established by law.rather,the union simply relied on the conclusory,statement that the union needed the information to protect the interests of its members.the requests allege no contract violations,negotiations,or arbitrations,and they contain no facts supporting the union claim that the information was necessary to protect the interests of union members.subsequent requests repeated and expanded the union demands but continued to lack explanations.such boilerplate justifications do not meet the requirements of law.wachter,at internal quotation marks omitted.moreover,approving the use of boilerplate rationales would wreak havoc on a negotiating process.id.at.further,with respect to the union demands for financial data,the union never contended that allegheny power asserted that lower costs had been a motivating factor in its subcontracting decisions.
in its findings,the alj acknowledged that the union used no magic words to state specifically why it wanted more and better subcontracting information.but the alj stated that he believe d that the union motives in for obtaining this data were crystal clear,and he wrote that data on subcontracting will no doubt be useful to the union in negotiating the successor agreement in.
although it is true that the law does not require a union to provide magic words,it does require a union to provide a reason for its request and,if necessary,to support its reason with facts.see abell,at,rice growers ass n,at.by stating that the reason that the union required the data was crystal clear,the alj evidently felt that the rationale was apparent from the face of the requests.see abell,at suggesting that a rationale can be accepted if it is apparent from the face of the request.this,however,is not supported by the record.the first two requests made by the union september,and november,are so threadbare that allegheny power would have been forced to guess at their rationale.indeed,quite logically,the company regarded the information requested in to be governed by the agreement,and that agreement required the union to tie its demands to a specific dispute or grievance on a specific use of contractors.recognizing that these contractual obligations were not met,the board relied only on the statutory duty,which allows other justifications of relevancy.because the record supported no other justifications,the board relied on two rationalizations,which were not even made by the union until months after its initial inquiry.
according to the board,the union re
