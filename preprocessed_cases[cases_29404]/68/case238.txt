public power council,and others collectively ppc petition for a review of the decision of the bonneville power administration bpa to trigger the cost recovery adjustment clause sn crac portion of its general rate schedule provisions grsps,as a result of which a rate setting proceeding took place.canby utility board also petitions for a review on the basis that because it had a special contract with bpa,its rates could not be changed in any event.we deny the petitions.
background 
bpa is a power marketing agency,which markets wholesale electricity from federal hydroelectric plants and several other power plants in the pacific northwest.aluminum of am.bonneville power,cir.it owns and operates approximately eighty percent of the pacific northwest transmission system and markets approximately forty percent of the electric power consumed in the pacific northwest.indus.customers of utils.bonneville power,cir.bpa customers include federal agencies,public bodies including public utilities,private utilities,and direct service industrial customers.kaiser aluminum chem.bonneville power,cir.
essentially,bpa is governed by four organic statutes the bonneville project act of,project act the pacific northwest consumer power preference act of,preference act the pacific northwest federal transmission system act of,transmission act and the pacific northwest electric power planning and conservation act of,northwest power act.kaiser aluminum chem,at.it is authorized to issue and sell bonds to the united states treasury to assist in financing the construction,acquisition,and replacement of the transmission system.a.however,it must repay a projected amount of those bonds each fiscal year if it fails to do so,the treasury,with some exceptions,may increase the applicable interest rate for that year outstanding bonds.id.
since,bpa electricity sales have been its source of revenue.see indus.customers,at.thus,the northwest power act requires bpa to establish rates that will produce sufficient revenues to ensure bpa fiscal independence and repay the treasury for the federal funds that were borrowed to build the projects in the federal columbia river power system.cal.energy comm bonneville power,cir.at the same time,t he statute also requires that rates be as low as possible consistent with sound business principles.cent.lincoln peoples util.dist.johnson,cir.
in order to fulfill its mission,bpa must periodically revise its rates.see indus.customers,at.it does so pursuant to of the northwest power act.its power rates,other charges,cost adjustments and rate methodology are then defined in its wholesale power rate schedules.the rate schedules contain grsps,which set out the provisions that govern the various rates in question.see indus.customers,at.
in august of,bpa proposed to revise its wholesale power rates for the five year period between october,and september,the rates bpa conducted hearings in accordance with i of the northwest power act i.those are hereafter referred to as the rate proceeding.on may,bpa completed the final record of decision for the proposed rates may rod.on july,bpa filed its proposed rates with the federal energy regulatory commission ferc for approval.
during the summer of,however,wholesale power rates rose precipitously.as a result,bpa proposed rates became far more attractive to prospective customers.its preference customers thus sought to purchase much more power for the period than bpa had anticipated.supplying that would require bpa to make up any shortfall in its production capacity by purchasing power on the open market.it,therefore,became concerned that the rates established in the may rod would not be sufficient to cover its costs.consequently,on august,bpa filed a motion with ferc to stay review of bpa rates.see bpa proposed cost recovery adjustment clause adjustment to wholesale power rates.
on september,bpa notified ferc that it would pursue modifications to the rates.in october,after a public comment period,it notified ferc and parties to the rate proceeding that it was initiating a limited i i hearing,in which it would revise the rates in order to address its increased load obligations and high market prices.it matched its actions to its words,and on december,it proposed amendments to the proposed rates.bpa proposed amendments to wholesale power rate adjustment proposal,see also indus.customers,at.once again,however,bpa announcement of proposed rates was followed by a downturn in its financial outlook.its forecast for cash reserves dropped substantially,while market prices rose significantly more than expected.those developments induced bpa to make various additional changes to its proposed amendments to the rates.see indus.customers,at.that process led to the filing of the supplemental proposal june rod and to the ultimate adoption of three cost recovery adjustment clauses cracs as a part of the grsps.those were 
the load based crac lb crac,which triggers if bpa augmentation cost cost of purchasing power on the open market exceeds the forecasted amount.essentially,the lb crac is a formula for increasing base rates by a certain percentage,depending on what bpa pays to acquire excess power.
the financial based crac fb crac,which triggers if bpa accumulated net revenues fall below a certain threshold.like the lb crac,the triggering of the fb crac results in a percentage increase to bpa base power rates.
finally,the sn crac,which triggers if,after implementation of the fb crac,bpa has missed,or reasonably expects to miss,a payment to the united states treasury or another creditor.the disputes here revolve around the sn crac.as we have indicated previously 
under the grsp,the crac would be available if the administrator determined that,after implementation of the crac and any adjustments,either of the following conditions existed 
the bpa forecasts a fifty percent or greater probability that it will nonetheless miss its next payment to treasury or other creditor,or 
the bpa has missed a payment to the department of the treasury or has satisfied its obligation to the department of the treasury but has missed a payment to any other creditor.
id.as is apparent,unlike the lb crac and the fb crac,the sn crac is not a precise formula it does not,by itself,revise bpa rates.rather,if triggered,the sn crac allows bpa to revise the fb crac parameters in order to achieve a high probability that the remainder of treasury payments during the rate period will be made in full.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
after the adoption and ferc interim approval of the new cracs,bpa financial condition began to deteriorate further.by january of,an updated financial forecast showed that its net revenue gap for the period had increased to.bpa analyzed its treasury payment probability tpp to determine whether to trigger the sn crac.the results of that analysis indicated a percent tpp.bpa administrator thus determined that the sn crac trigger requirements had been had less than a fifty percent chance of making its next treasury payment,which was due in september of.thus,on february,bpa notified its customers and interested parties that bpa was triggering the sn crac.
pursuant to the grsps,bpa held workshops and published notice in the federal register.bpa proposed cost recovery adjustment clause adjustment to wholesale power rates.bpa then held a formal expedited hearing under i i to establish changes in the amount,duration,and timing parameters of the fb crac on june,after the conclusion of the sn crac hearing,bpa issued its final crac rod with an accompanying appendix,and ferc granted final confirmation and approval.order confirming and approving rates on a final basis,ferc may.these petitions followed.
jurisdiction and standards of review 
we have jurisdiction to review final actions of bpa.e see also indus.customers,at.
section e of the northwest power act e provides that the administrative procedure act apa,governs the scope of judicial review of bpa final actions.under the apa,we must uphold bpa actions unless they are arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.in other words,we may not substitute our own
