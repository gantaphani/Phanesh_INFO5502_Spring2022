muskegon county,michigan,operates a sewage treatment system under permits issued pursuant to of the federal water pollution control act.the case at bar originated as a federal enforcement proceeding in which the united states sought to rectify alleged violations of the permits,the act,and certain administrative compliance orders issued by the united states environmental protection agency.
the appellant,warren company,is an industrial concern that discharges wastewater into the system.the company helped finance the construction and subsequent upgrading of the system,and for many years warren and other industrial users were beneficiaries of service purportedly that the intent and purpose of the system is to provide the maximum possible service to each contractee 
prior to the commencement of the present enforcement action,warren and other private users of the system sued the county in a michigan circuit court on a claim that the maximum possible service provision would be violated by enforcement of a county regulatory ordinance that allegedly had the effect of mothballing a significant portion of the system capacity.the claim was decided in favor of the companies,and the county was enjoined from enforcing the ordinance.
the present federal action was commenced a year later,while an appeal of the state court judgment was pending.warren and other industrial concerns intervened herein as defendants.the state of michigan,joined initially as a defendant,was realigned as a plaintiff.municipalities within the the city of muskegon,home of an manufacturing also become plaintiffs in the federal case.
during the course of the proceedings below,the county gave notice that the service agreements would be terminated.after the notice was given,but before the stated effective date,the district court entered two consent decrees.the first disposed of the municipalities claims against the county on a basis that incorporated another regulatory ordinance,enacted four years after the one that had been enjoined,with terms substantially identical to those of its predecessor.the second consent decree,which disposed of the federal government claims against the county and state,also incorporated the most recent ordinance.
warren has appealed the consent decrees and a decision in which the district court rejected certain of the companies defenses and denied a defense motion for partial summary judgment contending that the district court abused its discretion in finding the consent decrees fair and reasonable,the company submits that the arrangements sanctioned by the district court unconstitutionally impair and breach the service agreement with the county.given the history of the proceedings in state court,the company contends that the new arrangements contravene principles of comity as well.narrowing the focus of the latter contention at one point,the company brief also suggests that,in light of the state court decision,we could dispose of this case on the theory that the federal courts lack jurisdiction.
we conclude that federal jurisdiction is not lacking here.we further conclude that the district court did not err in holding,as it did,that the service agreement on which the company relies was lawfully terminated.the termination having been proper,and there having been no proof that any damages accrued as a result of the imposition of the new regulatory scheme prior to the effective date of the termination notice,the district court did not err in finding that there had been neither a redressable breach of contract rights nor an unconstitutional impairment of contractual obligations.accordingly,and because we are not persuaded that the court committed reversible error in its resolution of any other substantive issue,the challenged orders will be affirmed.
in the late,according to undisputed representations made in a brief that the companies filed below,
the municipalities and certain large industries within the county decided to construct a sewer system.the purpose of the system was to accommodate both residential sewage needs and the needs of the established industrial base within the county.the parties decided to finance construction of the system through mixed funding.specifically,million of the million initial construction cost was financed through federal and state grants.the remaining million was to be raised by issuance of bonds facilitated by formation of a county department of public works board under the county board and department of public works act dpw act mcl et.the dpw act authorized duly formed county dpw boards to issue bonds for the acquisition or construction of sewer systems by counties and then secure their bond obligations by contracting with municipalities within the county to back the county bonds with their full faith and credit.mcl.the dpw act did not,however,authorize counties to contract directly with private parties to guarantee bond payments.id.the parties understood,however,that the financial participation of these large industries in servicing the bond debt was and is critical to keeping residential sewer rates low and,therefore,making the project feasible.accordingly,the parties forged agreements that were consistent with the dpw act,but that incorporated these industries into the funding structure.
among the agreements forged by the parties prior to construction of the sewer system was a contract dated may,between the city of muskegon and scott paper company.under the name warren company,which denoted what was then an unincorporated division of scott,that company owned and operated a pulp and paper manufacturing plant in the city of muskegon.the contract authorized the city to enter into an access rights agreement with the county regarding the planned sewage disposal system.
in explaining this authorization,the contract stated that the access rights agreement delineat ed in detail the procedures for the issuance of bonds by the county to finance the initial construction of the system and the apportionment of the obligations to be assumed by the municipalities to the county for the payment of the debt service requirements including interest and principal for said bonds the contract went on to obligate scott to pay the city a share of the latter debt service commitment,the company obligation being secured through the creation of a special assessment district the boundaries of which were identical to those of the acre tract on which the pulp and paper plant was located.the contract further provided that t he amount of the special assessments to be levied annually in said special assessment district shall be scott share of the cost of the initial construction of the system as determined by the formulae set forth in the access rights agreement.
the access rights agreement was entered into between muskegon county and a number of municipalities,including the city of muskegon,as of december.the agreement formulae for determining the allocation of the debt service burden were based in part on the number of acres each municipality had within the sewage system service area,with the acreages of certain industries including warren broken out separately.another element in the formulae consisted of a figure equal to the higher of the actual daily volume of waste materials delivered to the system and a guaranteed minimum volume.the city of muskegon acres had a guaranteed minimum volume of million gallons per day.warren acres had an initial guaranteed minimum volume of million gallons per day,with a reduction to million gallons per day after.
in addition to contracting with the city to underwrite part of the initial cost of constructing the system,warren contracted to pay the county a share of the operating costs in exchange for the county providing sewage treatment service.although not made part of the record,the company contract with the county took substantially the same form as that of a service agreement entered into as of october,between the county and genesco,another industrial user.a partially executed copy of the genesco service agreement is included in the record.similar service agreements were also entered into between the county and the municipalities.
paragraph of the service agreement provided for establishment of a uniform service charge,with sewer service being furnished to all contractees at the uniform rate.paragraph of the service agreement incorporated as exhibit d a set of county regulations governing discharges into the system.the same exhibit d also formed part of the access rights agreement between the county and the municipalities.
paragraph of the service agreement further provided as follows 
in accordance with the procedures set forth therein,the county may amend or repeal any such regulations,or promulgate new regulations if reasonably required for the proper functioning of the system to achieve equity among users thereof and,provided,however,that any such regulations or amendments thereto shall not be more stringent than those required by state and federal agencies 
although the service agreement had no fixed term,paragraph provided for termination upon months notice 
the term of this agreement shall commence on the date hereof,and may be terminated upon months prior written notice given by one party to the other,but such termination shall not become effective prior to the date upon which all bonds issued to finance the initial construction of the system shall have been paid in full provided,however,that the county may not so terminate this agreement unless it at the same time terminates its like agreements with all other contractees.
section of the exhibit d regulations contained the maximum possible service language that lies at the heart of warren case.captioned purpose of system,exceptions and surcharges,section read,in its entirety,as follows 
it is the intent and purpose of the system to provide the maximum possible service to each contractee and person served by the system,consistent with the preservation of public health and safety,the fulfillment of obligations under state and federal law,the successful functioning of the system and fairness to all parties.
to this end and subject to the foregoing principles the county may establish a surcharge pursuant to sec.v and x hereof,and the director shall have the discretion to permit a contractee or party served by a contractee to discharge into the system waste fluids and solids whose constituent or parameter levels do not meet those prescribed in sec.hereof,as they may from time to time be amended.such exceptions may contain such conditions and be issued for such period of time as the director may deem necessary or advisable.
the amount of any surcharge shall be limited to an amount reasonably estimated to cover the incremental costs incurred by the system in handling such materials.
with the network of contractual undertakings as a backdrop,the county created a board that issued bonds to finance a portion of the initial cost of building a sewage treatment system.the system which had two separate treatment plants was completed and began operation,under united states environmental protection agency permits,in.we presume that warren regularly paid annual special assessments to the city and monthly service charges to the county while discharging wastewater from the pulp and paper plant into the system in accordance with the exhibit d regulations.
on april,the county amended the exhibit d regulations to relax certain discharge limits.the original regulations had imposed specific numeric limits on pollutant concentrations,subject to discretionary waiver by the county.the amended regulations did away with this uniform concentration level system and replaced it with one allowing any discharge of pollutants that did not exceed prescribed criteria by an amount which may cause or does cause interference with the system.interference was defined as any discharge that causes or significantly contributes to a violation of any requirement of the relevant epa permits.
in the county bound itself by a contract with the municipalities to increase the capacity of the treatment system through the construction of improvements estimated to cost more than million.part of this cost was to be funded through a million bond issue,the debt service on which was to be covered by payments from the municipalities.
in,according to the complaint filed by the municipalities that have intervened in this lawsuit,the county purportedly entered into a capacity allocation contract with the municipalities and the industrial concerns that were parties to service agreements with the county.the capacity allocation contract,an unsigned and undated copy of which was annexed to the intervening municipalities complaint,approved the construction of the improvements and specified how the hydraulic capacity of the improved system was to be apportioned.a volume of million gallons per day out of a total of million gallons per day was allocated to warren.the contract further provided that a service agreement industry,shall pay debt service attributable to its allocated capacity to,or on behalf of,its municipality.the improvements in question are said to have been substantially completed in.
it is clear that the bonds issued to finance the initial construction of the system have been paid in full it is less clear whether and to what extent warren is currently liable to pay debt service on bonds floated to help fund the improvements.we asked about this at oral argument,and warren lawyer was unable to enlighten us.we shall nonetheless assume,for purposes of this opinion,that warren does have some residual debt service obligation under the capacity allocation contract.
the series of administrative steps that ultimately led to the filing of the present enforcement proceeding began in november of,when staff members of the michigan department of natural resources conducted an audit of the county pretreatment program.the ensuing audit report,issued in may of,identified several alleged violations of federal pretreatment regulations and permit requirements.cited as one of the violations was the absence of specifically quantified limitations on discharges of pollutants into the system.
in july of the united states epa issued an order in which it found among other things that the county had failed to submit a proper industrial pretreatment program.the epa ordered the county to bring itself into compliance.
the county eventually responded by adopting an ordinance that returned to the original system of specific numeric limitations,subject to waiver,on discharges of pollutants into the system.the ordinance,which was enacted in june of,purported to supersede the version of the exhibit d regulations.the industrial users complained that the new limits on pollutant concentrations were set so low that the effect of the ordinance was to mothball much of the system capacity.this,the companies said,violated their contract right to receive the maximum possible service.
in june of warren and other industrial users filed suit against the county and the michigan department of natural resources in a michigan circuit court.none of the municipalities was joined as a party.the gravamen of the complaint was that the rights enjoyed by the plaintiffs under their service agreements had been unconstitutionally impaired.
in june of the michigan circuit court issued a decision in favor of the plaintiff companies.the court held that the service agreements including the exhibit d regulations incorporated therein were valid contracts that the companies enjoyed constitutionally protected rights flowing directly from the contracts or bestowed on the companies as third party beneficiaries and that in view of the maximum possible service provision of the exhibit d regulations,the ordinance unconstitutionally impaired the obligations of the companies contracts.permanently enjoined from enforcing the ordinance against the companies,the county and the state appealed to a michigan appellate court.
in june of,while that appeal was pending,the united states commenced the present enforcement action against the county and the state in the united states district court for the western district of michigan.the complaint alleged,among other things,that the epa issuance of permits for the operation of the sewer system meant that the county was required to have a proper industrial pretreatment program in place under part that the county had failed to implement and enforce such a program that the county had likewise failed to comply with various epa orders and that the system was being operated in violation of of the federal water pollution control act.the complaint sought an order directing compliance,assessing civil penalties against the county,awarding relief against the state pursuant to e,and allowing the united states its costs and disbursements.
a motion for intervention as parties plaintiff was filed by certain of the municipalities,including the city of muskegon,in september of.the municipalities alleged,among other things,that the service agreements between the county and the industrial users had resulted in violations of the epa permits,various epa compliance orders,and the terms of monetary grants received by the county.the municipalities sought injunctive relief and a declaration that the service agreements were void.other municipalities were subsequently joined as parties defendant,but,like the state,were realigned as plaintiffs.
warren and other industrial users likewise moved to intervene,tendering an answer to the complaint in october of.the answer set forth various affirmative defenses,the third of which read as follows 
the relief plaintiff seeks may breach and unconstitutionally impair preexisting contractual obligations of the county to industrial and municipal users of the muskegon county wastewater management system.to the extent plaintiff complaint raises claims or issues related to intervener defendants contracts with the defendant county,such claims are also barred by the doctrines of res judicata,collateral estoppel and abstention.
all of the motions for intervention were granted,and the tendered pleadings were accepted for filing.
in december of,acting at the request of the municipalities,the county gave notice of the termination of all service those with the industrial companies and those with the january.the companies promptly moved to dismiss the municipalities claims on abstention grounds and on the ground that the termination of the service agreements rendered the claims.the court denied the motion.
during the first part of the county negotiated an amended service agreement with the municipalities.the amended,by its terms,was to supercede all prior service agreements incorporated discharge regulations prescribed by a ordinance that was substantially identical to the ordinance enforcement of which had been enjoined in the state court litigation.
on july,the county and municipalities filed a joint motion for entry of a consent judgment the local consent decree settling the municipalities claims against the county.the proposed judgment incorporated the amended service agreement including the ordinance and stated that the agreement was to have immediate and superseding force and effect over all previously executed service agreements,whether between the county and local units,or between the county and service agreement industries.
on the day after the filing of the motion for entry of the local consent decree,the michigan appellate court issued an unpublished opinion affirming the injunction against enforcement of the ordinance.in december of,however,the district court issued an opinion and order granting the motion for entry of the local consent decree.
the companies then moved for partial summary judgment on their third affirmative defense.in that defense,the attentive reader will recall,the companies pleaded among other things that the relief sought by the united states may breach and unconstitutionally impair preexisting contractual obligations of the county 
the district court heard oral argument on the motion,and in the course of the argument the united states moved for judgment in its favor on the contract issue.the district court subsequently entered an opinion and order granting the government motion and denying the motion filed by the companies.
in the fullness of time the united states lodged with the court a proposed consent decree the federal consent decree resolving the federal government claims against the state and county on the basis of a payment of civil penalties in the amount of and implementation of certain remedial actions.after publication of the proposed decree in the federal register,the united states moved to have the decree entered.for reasons stated orally on the record,the district court granted the motion.a timely notice of appeal followed.
in compliance with rule a and,fed,the opening brief filed in this court by the appellant companies sets forth,under appropriate headings,a jurisdictional statement and a statement of the issues presented for review.neither statement raises any question as to the district court jurisdiction.in its description of the course of proceedings below,however,the companies appellate brief includes a paragraph reading as follows 
shortly after intervening in the action,the companies moved to dismiss the claims of the municipalities from the litigation based on the abstention doctrine in order to avoid investing duplicative and unnecessary judicial resources to evaluate contract claims already decided by the state courts.see colorado river water conservation dist.united states,d.in its sic abstention argument,the companies also directed the district court attention to the doctrine as an alternative basis to dismiss the municipalities contract claims from the action based on jurisdictional grounds.this doctrine,set forth in the supreme court decision in rooker fidelity trust,and dist.of columbia court of appeals feldman,d,establishes that district courts have no jurisdiction to perform,in effect,appellate review of state court decisions.the court denied the companies colorado abstention argument.the companies have not appealed the abstention ruling.the district court did not address the jurisdictional issue raised in the companies abstention motion.record citations omitted.
the sentence last quoted from the brief on appeal is followed by a footnote that we quote substantially in full 
this court has wrestled with application of abstention principles and the jurisdictional doctrine to claims like those presented by the municipalities,who,although not parties to the state court action,collaterally attack the state court judgment in federal district court by raising issues inextricably intertwined with the issues previously litigated in state court.see gottfried medical planning services,cir.generally,courts have not applied the doctrine to bar claims by parties that were not parties to the prior state court proceedings.see,united states owens,cir.however,the courts do not agree on this approach.see,brophy,cir.indeed,a district court in this circuit has ruled that the doctrine may apply to a party who,though not a party to the prior state court litigation,had an opportunity to litigate in the state court.hart comerica bank.since the doctrine is intended to prevent federal courts from,in effect,reviewing state court judgments,the doctrine can and should be applied to parties who are attacking state court rulings in federal courts,even if they were not parties to the state court when they had an opportunity to participate in the state court litigation.see sherry,judicial federalism in the trenches,the rooker feldman doctrine in action,notre dame,may therefore,this court may have a jurisdictional basis to dismiss the municipalities service claims against the county,and the county affirmative defenses based on the service agreements,since they are inextricably intertwined with the prior state court rulings.
if warren had intended seriously to urge that we are required to apply the doctrine here,we presume that the company would have presented its argument in rather less muted form.the suggestion that we may have a jurisdictional basis to dismiss is hardly a ringing assertion of a jurisdictional defect.jurisdictional defects are not subject to waiver,however,so we are constrained to consider whether,under,the district court lacked jurisdiction to approve the consent decrees and reject the companies third affirmative defense.we are satisfied that jurisdiction was not lacking.
as the companies properly acknowledge,this court has a decision,we would emphasize,that remains binding upon subsequent t he doctrine does not apply to bar a suit in federal court brought by a party that was not a party in the preceding action in state court.united states owens,cir citation omitted.in the present situation,the united states was not a party in the state court action.neither was any of the municipalities.owens therefore compels the conclusion that the doctrine does not bar federal jurisdiction here.
aside,an argument can be made that although jurisdiction attached,the district court should have stayed the present proceeding until such time as the municipalities and the county might ask the state circuit court to modify its injunction.see gottfried medical planning services,cir we hold that a federal court should abstain when a nonparty to a state court injunction brings a first amendment challenge to the injunction in federal court before requesting relief from the state court.
the case at bar,of course,is about as far removed from a first amendment case as one can imagine unlike gottfried,which involved a citizen right to picket an abortion clinic,the instant action involves claims by the united states,the state of michigan and the city of muskegon that there have been ongoing violations of the rules and regulations governing the operation of the county sewage treatment plants.more significantly,however,the plaintiffs in the case at bar have not brought a direct challenge to the state court injunction on any ground,first amendment or otherwise.
the injunction,it is important to remember,barred enforcement of a ordinance adopted before notice had been given of the termination of the service agreements.it is not the ordinance that is now at issue the ordinance at issue here is one adopted in,after the termination notice had been given.the provisions of the two ordinances are essentially the same,to be sure,but the circumstance that made the ordinance existence of service agreements that appeared to be at odds with the changed rather dramatically in after entry of the state court injunction,to repeat,and prior to passage of the ordinance by issuance of a notice terminating the agreements.we do not read gottfried as compelling us to hold that the district court should have stayed the present litigation pending a decision by the state court on the effectiveness of a termination notice that was not issued until more than months after entry of the state court injunction and that has not to this day been challenged in the state court.the gottfried decision rested,after all,on considerations of equity,comity,and our federalist judicial system,see at these considerations hardly compel the conclusion that the federal district court abused its discretion by adjudicating questions which the state court has never had occasion to consider and could not possibly have considered prior to issuance of its injunction.
in their briefs on appeal,the united states and the other appellees raise a jurisdictional issue of their own they contend that the county termination of the service agreements rendered this appeal moot.we find the appellees jurisdictional arguments no more persuasive than the jurisdictional argument raised sort of by the appellant.
for one thing,warren maintains that the validity of the purported termination is the company argues that only the state court can decide whether the termination was effective.the company argument may have a faintly hollow ring but surely we have jurisdiction whether to decide the argument is correct.
for another thing,the local consent decree was entered on december.as we have seen,the decree incorporated both the regulatory ordinance and the amended service agreement between the county and the municipalities.that agreement,as the decree stated,is to have immediate and superseding force and effect over all previously executed service agreements,whether between the county and local units,or between the county and service agreement industries.but for the district court approval of the county new agreement with the municipalities,the service agreement between the county and warren would arguably have remained in effect until at least january,the date given in the termination notice itself.and surely we have jurisdiction to decide whether the district court erred in its handling of the problem created by the superseding of the service agreement and the replacement of the exhibit d regulations by the regulatory ordinance more than a year before the service agreement was ostensibly scheduled to expire.
there are additional reasons for thinking that the issuance of the termination notice did not render this case moot,but we shall forego the temptation to explore them.our jurisdiction is reasonably clear,we believe,and even the most patient of readers would doubtless welcome our foregoing further preliminaries so we can now turn,at last,to the merits of the company appeal.
in deciding whether to approve the proposed consent decrees,the district court was required to determine whether they were fair,adequate,and reasonable,as well as consistent with the public interest.united states jones laughlin steel,cir.the district court held that the decrees passed this test warren contends that the court abused its discretion in so holding.
the local consent decree was not a fair or reasonable settlement of the claims between the municipalities and the county,warren argues,due to its impact and purportedly binding effect on the companies,who did not consent to the judgment.further,says warren,
the consent judgment also allowed the county to frustrate the prior state court judgment and injunction,further rendering the consent judgment an unreasonable means to resolve the municipalities claims against the county.finally,the companies contend that the district court also erred in approving the consent judgment between the united states,the state and the county since it incorporates the ordinance as the basis for settling the united states and state industrial pretreatment program claims against the county.
although it is true that the companies did not consent to either decree,both of which purported to force the ordinance down the companies throats,we are not persuaded that it was an abuse of discretion for the district court to find the decrees fair and reasonable.we have already explained that the decrees did not frustrate the prior state court judgment.and the of the companies is immaterial,in our view,given the critically important fact that long before the decrees were entered,the municipalities had availed themselves of the local political process see note,supra to have the county to issue a notice terminating all service agreements in accordance with paragraph thereof.
paragraph,it will be recalled,says that subject to certain conditions,this agreement may be terminated the consent decrees might have been unfair and unreasonable if warren service agreement had said that the agreement may not be terminated,but it said just the opposite.
one of the conditions prescribed by paragraph for the termination becoming effective,we should probably mention,was that all bonds issued to finance the initial construction of the system shall have been paid in full that condition is not an issue.in december of,as we have seen,the county and the municipalities were in agreement that the original bond issue had been fully repaid.see note,supra.warren has never contended that the agreement was in error and that there were original bonds which remained unpaid.
warren does suggest on appeal that the county failed to satisfy the final proviso of paragraph,a proviso stating that the county may not so terminate this agreement unless it at the same time terminates its like agreements with all other contractees.the suggestion comes too late to be taken seriously.
no such claim was made in the district court.there it was suggested that although the issue was not before the court,the termination clause had been exercised in bad f
