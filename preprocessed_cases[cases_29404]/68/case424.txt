section d of the administrative procedure act apa,enacted as part of the government in the sunshine act,pub,a,stat,the sunshine act,prohibits ex parte communication s relevant to the merits of a prescribed proceeding between an interested person outside the agency and an agency decision maker.d a,b.the regulations of the federal energy regulatory commission the commission or ferc implementing d are found at rule.in this petition for review,the electric power supply association epsa,a national trade association representing participants in the competitive power industry,challenges two ferc orders purporting to amend rule to exempt communications between private market monitors and ferc decisional employees from the sunshine act ban on ex parte communications.communications with market monitors,wl,initial order,reh g denied,wl,rehearing order.epsa charges that ferc proposed exemption,on its face,violates d.
the commission argues that epsa lacks standing to bring this challenge and,also,that epsa facial challenge is unripe for judicial review.on the merits,the commission argues that the proposed exemption does not violate the sunshine act,because it effects a reasonable balance between the need for enhanced monitoring of national energy markets through timely reporting of market information with the need for fairness and openness in commission proceedings.we reject all of ferc arguments and grant epsa petition for review.
we hold,first,that epsa has standing to challenge the commission market monitor orders and that the challenge is ripe for review.we also hold that ferc orders violate the clear mandate of the sunshine act.an agency may lawfully adopt regulations that faithfully implement the requirements of d.but no federal agency that is subject to the sunshine act is authorized to modify,abrogate,or otherwise violate the statutory ban on ex parte communications.therefore,ferc claim that it has an interest in receiving ex parte communications does not empower it to alter congress explicit proscription against such communications.because ferc market monitor exemption is plainly at odds with d,we grant epsa petition for review and vacate the commission orders.
background 
statutory and regulatory background 
the government in the sunshine act,d,applies when a hearing is required to be conducted in accordance with section of the apa.id.a.with certain limited exceptions not applicable here,sets forth the procedures to be used in cases in which proceedings are required by statute to be determined on the record after opportunity for an agency hearing.id.a,a,c.when such a hearing is required,the government in the sunshine act provides 
n o interested person outside the agency shall make or knowingly cause to be made to any member of the body comprising the agency,administrative law judge,or other employee who is or may reasonably be expected to be involved in the decisional process of the proceeding,an ex parte communication relevant to the merits of the proceeding.
id.d a.an ex parte communication is defined as an oral or written communication not on the public record with respect to which reasonable prior notice to all parties is not given,but it shall not include requests for status reports on any matter or proceeding covered by this subchapter.id.when an ex parte communication occurs,the sunshine act requires disclosure of the communication and an opportunity for parties to file a response.id.d c.there are no exceptions to the disclosure requirement.
the controlling provisions of the sunshine act were fully explored over two decades ago in professional air traffic controllers organization flra,patco.patco makes it clear that the sweep of the sunshine act is broad and that the statutory proscriptions are inviolate.although the act prohibition applies only to communications to or from an interested person outside the agency,congress did not intend that the prohibition on ex parte communications would therefore have only a limited application.id.at.rather,
t he term interested person is intended to be a wide,inclusive term covering any individual or other person with an interest in the agency proceeding that is greater than the general interest the public as a whole may have.the interest need not be monetary,nor need a person to sic be a party to,or intervenor in,the agency proceeding to come under this section.the term includes,but is not limited to,parties,competitors,public officials,and nonprofit or public interest organizations and associations with a special interest in the matter regulated.the term does not include a member of the public at large who makes a casual or general expression of opinion about a pending proceeding.
id.at citations omitted.
patco also indicates that,while the communications subject to the act are limited to those relevant to the merits of the proceeding,the congressional reports underlying the sunshine act make it clear that the phrase should be construed broadly and include more than the phrase fact in issue currently used in d of the administrative procedure act.id.at citations omitted.
finally,patco cautions that requests for status reports,which are explicitly exempted from the definition of ex parte communications,see,should not automatically be exempted from the sunshine act prohibition.see patco,at.the same is true with respect to communications characterized as background information.the key to exclusion under the sunshine act is not the label given the communication,but rather whether there is a possibility that the communication could affect the agency decision in a contested proceeding.see id.this is clear from the legislative history underlying the act 
the phrase relevant to the merits of the proceeding excludes procedural inquiries,such as requests for status reports,which will not have any effect on the way the case is decided.it excludes general background discussions about an entire industry which do not directly relate to specific agency adjudication involving a member of that industry,or to formal rulemaking involving the industry as a whole.it is not the intent of this provision to cut an agency off from access to general information about an industry that an agency needs to exercise its regulatory responsibilities.so long as the communication containing such data does not directly discuss the merits of a pending adjudication it is not prohibited by this section.
however,a request for a status report or background discussion may in effect amount to an indirect or subtle effort to influence the substantive outcome of the proceedings.the judgment will have to be made whether a particular communication could affect the agency decision on the merits.in doubtful cases the agency official should treat the communication as ex parte so as to protect the integrity of the decision making process.
pt,at,reprinted in,accord,at.
in sum,patco plainly highlights the two distinct interests served by the sunshine act.first,the decision makes it clear that d isclosure is important in its own right to prevent the appearance of impropriety from secret communications in a proceeding that is required to be decided on the record.patco,at.second,d isclosure is also important as an instrument of fair decisionmaking only if a party knows the arguments presented to a decisionmaker can the party respond effectively and ensure that its position is fairly considered.id.these interests are not subject to compromise in agency regulations,orders,or proceedings.
ferc regulations 
ferc regulations implementing d are found at.the most recent version of these regulations,known as order,was adopted in.regulations governing communications,stats,regs.preambles,order on reh g,stats,regs.preambles.in january,the commission,by order,amended its ex parte regulations,purporting to exempt from the sunshine act communications between market monitors and commission decisional staff in those situations in which a market monitor is not a party to and does not appear on behalf of a party to the proceeding to which the ex parte communication relates.initial order at.under this purported exemption,an ex parte communication will only be memorialized and included in the official record of the relevant proceeding if the commission determines that it relied on the ex parte communication in reaching a decision in an proceeding.rehearing order at.the commission explicitly acknowledged that exempted communications could involve matters that are at issue in ongoing proceedings,initial order at,and that market monitors are persons outside the agency,id.at.
market monitor functions were endorsed by the commission as part of its order initiative.in order,ferc directed all transmission owning utilities to participate in a regional transmission organization rto.regional transmission organizations,stats,regs.preambles order,order on reh g,order,stats,regs.preambles,dismissed sub nom.pub.utility dist.ferc.rtos,in turn,were ordered to perform a market monitoring function to ensur e that markets within the region covered by an rto do not result in wholesale transactions or operations that are unduly discriminatory or preferential or provide opportunity for the exercise of market power.br.for respondent at quoting order,stats,regs.preambles at.rtos can choose to perform the monitoring function themselves or use an independent contractor.br.for respondent at citing order,stats,regs.preambles at.
m arket monitors must report to the commission objective information about rto markets,evaluate the behavior of market participants,and recommend how markets can operate more competitively and efficiently.br.for respondent at citing order,stats,regs.preambles at.it is undisputed,however,that market monitors are private parties who work outside the agency.they are not hired,paid,or directly managed by ferc in their work.
procedural background 
epsa is a national trade association representing the competitive power industry.its board includes member companies.eleven of the top sellers of electricity nationwide are epsa members.epsa also includes numerous associate and supporting members,as well as state and regional entities representing the competitive power industry.epsa members own generating facilities and market electricity in wholesale markets administered by rtos and individual system operators isos.on behalf of its members,epsa advocates policies relating to the restructuring of the nation electricity markets.as part of that effort,epsa and its members regularly participate in contested ferc proceedings which affect wholesale markets administered by rtos and isos.in,epsa participated in such proceedings.in,it participated in.given the significant investment of its members in electric generation and electricity markets,it is undisputed that epsa is actively engaged in and will continue to be actively engaged in such contested ferc proceedings.affidavit of julie simon,vice of policy,epsa,may,submitted as an addendum to br.for petitioner.
following the commission issuance of the initial order purporting to amend its ex parte regulations,petitioner epsa sought rehearing,asserting,inter alia,that the market monitor exemption was contrary to d.in an order issued in may,the commission rejected this argument.the commission conceded that a market monitor may have an interest in the outcome of a particular proceeding to which his or her communication may be relevant,but contended that such an interest does not make him or her an interested person as that term is used in apa d.rehearing order at.the commission also noted that market monitors may not be commission employees,but argued that they serve as the functional equivalent of such employees and,thus,may be properly exempted from the requirements of d just as commission staff are exempt.id.according to the commission,c ommunications with market monitors are similar to communications between commission staff,which give no appearance of impropriety,nor lead to biased.id.
following issuance of the order denying its petition for rehearing,epsa filed a petition for review before this court.the commission responded with a motion to dismiss,arguing that epsa lacked standing and that the case was,in any event,not ripe for review.epsa,representing itself and the three intervenors in this suit,argues that the market monitor exemption,on its face,violates the government in the sunshine act.as it did below,epsa also agues that the purported exemption violates the due process clause of the united states constitution and that ferc enactment of the modification by order,rather than rulemaking,violated of the apa.because we conclude that the market monitor exemption plainly violates the sunshine act,we need not reach epsa due process or arguments.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
ferc delegated authority does not include administration of the sunshine act.the sunshine act is a statute of general applicability governing ferc and all other federal agencies within its compass.ferc has no authority whatsoever to change the terms of the act rather,ferc must conform its regulatory activities to comply with the overriding terms of the sunshine act.thus,we review de novo the legality of the commission modification of its ex parte regulations purporting to exempt market monitor communications from the requirements of the sunshine act.see.rivers alliance ferc,see also a the reviewing court shall hold unlawful and set aside agency action found to be not in accordance with law.
standing and ripeness 
the commission standing challenge is quite narrow and easily dismissed.no one,including ferc,doubts that epsa and its members have a right to participate in contested ferc hearings when their financial interests are at stake.moreover,ferc does not contest epsa assertion that epsa and its members,on the basis of their financial interests,routinely appear before ferc in contested hearings in which market monitors have an interest.finally,ferc acknowledges that in challenging the market monitor exemption,epsa is asserting the violation of certain procedural rights.br.for respondent at.nevertheless,ferc maintains that epsa does not have standing,because it can not demonstrate concrete and particularized harm to show that it is currently aggrieved by the challenged orders.br.for respondent at.specifically,ferc argues that the market monitor exemption can not cause current or future injury to the financial interests of epsa or its members,because it is designed to enhance the competitiveness and efficiency of regulated markets.br.for respondent at.ferc argument is entirely off the mark.
as regular participants in contested ferc hearings,epsa and its members have a right,protected by the sunshine act proscription against ex parte communications,to fair decisionmaking by the commission.see patco,at disclosure is also important as an instrument of fair decisionmaking only if a party knows the arguments presented to a decisionmaker can the party respond effectively and ensure that its position is fairly considered.this,not the financial interests of epsa and its members,is the right directly protected by d and impaired by the market monitor exemption.in complaining that the market monitor exemption violates the sunshine act,epsa is seeking to enforce procedural requirements designed to protect epsa concrete interest in the outcome of hearings to which epsa is a party.that being the case,epsa standing is not defeated by the fact that it can not show,with any certainty,that its or its members financial interests will be damaged by the operation of the market monitor exemption.
i n cases involving alleged procedural errors,the plaintiff must show that the government act performed without the procedure in question will cause a distinct risk to a particularized interest of the plaintiff.wyoming outdoor council forest,quoting florida audubon soc y bentsen,see also lujan defenders of wildlife,d the person who has been accorded a procedural right to protect his concrete interests can assert that right without meeting all the normal standards for redressability and immediacy.epsa has done this.if the commission,following the market monitor exemption,were to engage in undisclosed ex parte communications with market monitors about matters relevant to a pending hearing to which epsa or its members were par
