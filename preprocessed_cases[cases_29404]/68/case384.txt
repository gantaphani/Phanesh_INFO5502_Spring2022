this dispute involves agreements over the wholesale price of electricity in situations where local transmission shortages obstructed competitive market pricing in the new england power market.petitioner nstar electric gas corporation seeks review of three orders of the federal energy regulatory commission mirant americas energy marketing,ferc rehearing order mirant americas energy marketing,ferc compliance order and mirant americas energy marketing,ferc remand order.
nstar challenges the commission orders on what amount to four grounds first,that the commission erred in waiving a statutory notice requirement for changes to filed rates second,that the commission orders violated the filed rate doctrine and its cousin,the rule against retroactive ratemaking,by allowing certain negotiated rate agreements to govern rates charged prior to their being filed with the agency third,that the commission did not satisfy its obligation under a to determine whether the filed rates were just and reasonable and fourth,that the commission refusal to order refunds for purchasers who were charged the negotiated rates was an abuse of discretion.
we find no merit in petitioners first two claims.but we do not find in the record a clear basis for the commission finding that the rates were just and reasonable this leaves open the possibility of a refund for unjust or unreasonable rates charged.we therefore remand the case for further consideration by the commission.
the new england power pool the power pool is a voluntary trade association of participants in the new england electric power business.in the power pool proposed,and ferc ultimately approved,comprehensive market reforms including a shift of the new england wholesale power market from regulated prices to market pricing,and the creation of england,a private,entity to administer new england energy markets and operate the region bulk power transmission system.see new england power pool,ferc nepool i,ferc nepool ii,reh g denied ferc approving reforms.
prices in the restructured market are governed by rules developed by the power pool the market rules and filed with the commission under of the federal power act,d.see also nepool ii,ferc at.during normal system operation,uses an incremental pricing scheme it sets a price by working up the range of generators bids to find the lowest bid available to supply an increment of power beyond the load demanded for the period in question.id.at.all suppliers receive the same price.under this system generators are employed in order of economic merit,beginning with units.
during periods of transmission constraint,however,when the constraint makes it impossible to deliver enough conventionally priced energy to a load pocket,generators whose bids exceed the price are called into service to ensure system reliability.see nepool ii,ferc at rehearing order,ferc at p noting voltage collapse and other system instabilities.under market rule in effect during the period in mitigation procedures have now been amended,bids offered by these reliability must run units did not affect the price paid to generators,and any excess over market was charged to transmission customers as a congestion uplift charge.nepool ii,ferc at see also rehearing order,ferc at p.
initially,ferc anticipated that these uplift charges would be small and predictable.nepool i,ferc at.but it later acknowledged that congestion costs had become substantial and rapidly increasing,totaling by one measure some million in march alone.iso new england,ferc at.
generators called on to operate in constrained conditions will commonly have localized market power the transmission constraint both justifies use of an resource and accounts for the resource market power.accordingly,market rule contained procedures for monitoring and mitigating,capping such bids either according to a predetermined formula or at a higher alternative price agreed on by and the resource owner.nepool ii,ferc at.absent an agreement between the generator and the iso,bids from resources that regularly compete in the unconstrained market were capped at a weighted average of that generator prior bids.where a generator seldom ran in merit order and thus did not have a history of competitive bids,its bids were capped at a default price that could range from to of the market clearing price.nstar electric gas,ferc at p.but market rule b explicitly allowed prices above these caps,saying 
the iso may enter into negotiation with a resource owner for any reasonable payment terms if the iso reasonably expects the markets will function more reliably,competitively,or efficiently as a result.
market rule b,joint appendix see also compliance order,ferc at p quoting rule b.in the remand order,ferc paraphrased the above formula about the iso expectations in terms of ensur ing that the generator remains available during transmission constraints.ferc at p.
rule sets out the rationale and expected operation of the scheme as applied to generators,especially in reference to the parties incentives 
the price screen for resources that seldom run in economic merit order is designed to create a powerful incentive for such generators to come forward and negotiate an appropriate contract with the iso.the price screen itself is a default case designed to ensure that the iso has sufficient bargaining leverage in such negotiations.until the resource owner and the iso reach agreement,the default price screen will enable the resource to be paid for running in the short term,while providing a strong incentive to negotiate an appropriate arrangement with the iso as the screen price rapidly and progressively drops to just above the higher of the clearing price or applicable reference clearing price in the unconstrained market.
market rule b.
in earlier proceedings ferc granted power customers request for a ruling that the mitigation agreements negotiated under market rules b and b were subject to filing requirement.mirant americas energy marketing,ferc at.at the same time,however,the commission exercised its authority under to grant a waiver of that section requirement of days notice prior to the effective dates of the agreements.id.
on appeal,we granted review of the mirant orders and remanded for additional explanation of ferc waiver of the notice requirement.nstar electric gas ferc.unpublished decision.on remand,ferc conceded that its precedents contemplated waiver of the notice requirement only in extraordinary circumstances,but held that such circumstances existed the agreements were necessary to ensure the continued availability of generators critical to system stability while mitigating those units potential exercise of market power and,because such generators were typically called into service on short notice,the agreements by their very nature could not be negotiated and filed days in advance.remand order,ferc at pp.
in a separate set of orders,ferc approved filing of the mitigation agreements and concluded that the agreements provisions were just and reasonable as required by a,a.see mirant americas energy marketing,ferc at p compliance order,ferc at p.
on requests for rehearing of the remand and compliance orders,ferc affirmed its waiver of the statutory notice requirement,denial of refunds to purchasers charged the mitigation rates,and determination that the agreements provisions were just and reasonable.rehearing order,ferc at incorporating by reference reasonableness analysis from iso new england,ferc at pp.ferc also rejected the contention,raised on rehearing,that the commission had exceeded its statutory authority in allowing the rates to become effective prior to their filing date.rehearing order,ferc at p.nstar filed a timely petition for review.
section d requires a utility to file a notice days prior to a rate taking effect,but expressly provides for waiver of the requirement 
unless the commission otherwise orders,no change shall be made by any public utility in any such rate,charge,classification,or service,or in any rule,regulation,or contract relating thereto,except after sixty days notice to the commission and to the public.but t he commission,for good cause shown,may allow changes to take effect without requiring the sixty days notice herein provided for by an order specifying the changes so to be made and the time when they shall take effect and the manner in which they shall be filed and published.
nstar contends that the commission waiver of the notice rule was arbitrary and capricious and contrary to such agency precedents as central hudson gas electric,ferc central hudson i,reh g denied,ferc central hudson ii.our review of the commission waiver rulings is quite limited,as congress,through,has clearly delegated waiver discretion to the commission and not to the courts.city of girard,ferc,see also san diego gas electric ferc.and we defer to the commission interpretations of its own precedents.columbia gas transmission ferc.
in central hudson i,the commission stated that a bsent extraordinary circumstances,we will not grant waiver of notice when an agreement for new service is filed on or after the day service has commenced.ferc at.where a rate agreement was filed a week after taking effect,the utility could not simply state only that the agreement could not be negotiated and prepared for filing days prior to the commencement of service.id.t he press of other business,the commission held,would not constitute good cause for waiver.id.
here,ferc relied on a number of factors in finding extraordinary circumstances.most critically,it argued that the mitigation agreements by their very nature do not always lend themselves to being filed days before service commences,as generators were often called into service only on very short notice.remand order,ferc at p see also rehearing order,ferc at p.moreover,refusing waiver here would wrongly penalize the generators for good faith,albeit erroneous determination that the agreements did need to be filed.rehearing order,ferc at p.
nstar claims that ferc improperly ignored the rule of central hudson i that the press of other business does constitute good cause.but ferc point here was that the delay in filing the mitigation agreements resulted from the need to provide generation at short notice in response to market constraints.nstar says the record does not support the proposition that agreements needed to be negotiated at short notice.but market rule anticipated that some agreements would be negotiated retroactively normally such arrangements will be negotiated prospectively.market rule b,emphasis added.and a filing by indicated that the time consumed in identifying the constrained units and applying the price screens had precluded prospective negotiations.compliance order,ferc at p.nstar further objects to ferc reliance on good faith conclusion that the agreements need not be filed.but central hudson ii explicitly contemplated that the commission would balance deterrence of violations of the filing requirement against the inappropriateness of making rates confiscatory,ferc at the commission consideration of an actor good faith seems quite compatible with that balance.
nstar also argues that waiver was arbitrary because of purported deficiencies in the negotiation of the agreements,such as that they ratified prior courses of conduct,reflected oral understandings,or were communicated by email.but petitioners do not explain why the commission should regard such circumstances as undermining the ultimate agreements validity.nstar also appears to complain that the filed agreements did not cover all time periods relevant to this dispute.but this argument is found in a single footnote in nstar opening brief,and such a reference is not enough to raise an issue for our review.see covad communications fcc,see also sugar cane growers.of florida veneman,on appeal,appellants failed to raise their footnote at the end of their opening brief does not suffice.
finally,nstar assertion that ferc granted waiver before having seen the agreements is without merit,as the orders on review supersede the order to which nstar presumably refers.compare mirant americas energy marketing,ferc at,with compliance filing,and rehearing order,ferc at.
we next turn to nstar assertion that the filed rate doctrine and the rule against retroactive ratemaking precluded ferc from giving effect to the mitigation agreements.we review this claim under the arbitrary and capricious standard of a,and will affirm where the commission has articulated a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made,llc ferc,applying arbitrary and capricious review to ferc conclusion that utility did not violate filed rate doctrine.
the filed rate doctrine arises out of filing requirements in of the federal power act and parallel sections of other statutes.originating in the supreme court cases interpreting the interstate commerce act and subsequently extended across the spectrum of regulated utilities,the doctrine forbids a regulated entity to charge rates for its services other than those properly filed with the appropriate federal regulatory authority.arkansas louisiana gas hall,d.a corollary is the rule against retroactive ratemaking,which the supreme court has described in the context of the natural gas act as prevent ing the commission itself from imposing a rate increase for gas already sold.arkansas louisiana,at.we follow here the familiar practice of applying interchangeably judicial interpretations of provisions from the natural gas act to their substantially identical counterparts in the federal power act.see arkansas louisiana,at.quoting fpc sierra pacific power.consolidated edison of new york ferc.we explained the rules as serving the dual purposes of ensur ing rate predictability for purchasers of regulated electricity and promoting equity among customers by preventing discriminatory pricing.consolidated edison,at.
although these doctrines and the notice requirement jointly arise out of,a rate change that qualifies for waiver of the requirement does necessarily survive scrutiny under the filed rate and retroactive ratemaking doctrines.see consolidated edison,at see also columbia gas transmission ferc,columbia gas holding that analogous waiver provision in natural gas act did not grant the commission authority to waive the filed rate doctrine.thus our decision upholding the commission waiver ruling leaves these issues entirely open.
but the filed rate doctrine and bar on retroactive ratemaking are satisfied,in keeping with their functions,when parties have notice that a rate is tentative and may be later adjusted with retroactive effect,or where they have agreed to make a rate effective retroactively.consolidated edison,at.notice to affected parties,we have explained,changes what would be purely retroactive ratemaking into a functionally prospective process by placing the relevant audience on notice at the outset that the rates being promulgated are provisional only and subject to later revision.columbia gas,at.see also exxon,usa ferc.one very practical application of this principle is the acceptability of tariffs with a rate formula,under which rates may constantly change as long as they do so consistently with the formula without prior notice to the commission or the public,and are thus not precisely knowable at the time of sale.pub.utilities comm ferc.
in its rehearing order,ferc relied on these well established principles market rule allowed to negotiate the agreements,and was the subject of commission proceedings and commission approval.thus authority to negotiate mitigation agreements was part of a filed and accepted tariff,and market participants were on notice of its provisions.rehearing order,ferc at p.
despite nstar objections,we find nothing arbitrary in the commission conclusion that market rule provided adequate notice to market participants that the default prices listed in the market rules were,in the language of columbia gas,provisional only and subject to later revision.both the text and structure of rule put transmission customers on notice that the default rates would apply only absent a separate negotiated agreement.the rule provides in place of its bid price,each resource will receive a the applicable screen price from table or table or b a price negotiated with the iso.mark
