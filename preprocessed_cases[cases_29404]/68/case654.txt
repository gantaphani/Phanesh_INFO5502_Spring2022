in,scott edgar murrison placed rocks and gravel across big creek in trinity county to divert most of its flow into a ditch for use on big creek ranch.he failed to give notice to the department of fish and game dfg as required by fish and game code section.murrison appeals the judgment enjoining him from diverting the creek without complying with fish and game code section.
murrison asserts the amount diverted under his claimed appropriative water right in the waters of big creek can not be limited by the application of the fish and game code provisions.he also claims dfg can not regulate his right to take water from big creek unless it pays him for his water rights.murrison further claims the injunction is too broad.finally,murrison argues the trial court erred in assessing civil penalties.
like owners of all property,murrison rights,if any,to the waters of big creek are subject to reasonable regulation by the state of california,in this case to protect its fish and wildlife.that right does not allow him to substantially alter big creek free of regulation.
murrison,however,protests too much too soon.at this point he has failed to provide notice to dfg.dfg has not taken action which affects his water right.we reject murrison takings claim for this reason and also because he failed to raise this challenge in the trial court and because he failed to establish the existence of his claimed water right.
the trial court injunction and imposition of civil penalties was within its discretion.we shall affirm.
factual and procedural background 
to irrigate its pastures and raise cattle,the big creek ranch has historically used water taken through a diversion ditch located on big creek downstream from the big creek diversion ditch is a to foot tall concrete dam and fish ladder.
the murrison family purchased the ranch in.murrison traced big creek ranch genesis back to a homestead in.murrison also traced the ranch water rights to the flows of big creek to deeds dated between and.murrison,however,did not quantify the amount of water the ranch has taken or how that water has been used.
darrell yount is a retired dfg warden with almost years of experience.yount met murrison father,edgar murrison,for the first time in the early.since his father death in,murrison has operated big creek ranch.
every year yount has been a game warden,the murrisons have done work near the big creek diversion ditch and diverted water into their ditch.during some years,they have had to work in the stream for this purpose dfg entered into two streambed alteration agreements with murrison in and one in.the agreement required murrison to maintain at least one and inches of water flow over the downstream fish ladder.
in april,the people filed a complaint against murrison alleging two causes of action one for violation of fish and game code section and one for violation of business and professions code section.the complaint alleged that during the prior summer,murrison placed rocks and gravel in the streambed of big creek to divert water into the big creek diversion ditch.the people sought injunctive relief and civil penalties.fish,bus.
we now turn to the events that precipitated this lawsuit.on july,yount visited big creek and noticed equipment had been used to level a road to the creek near big creek diversion ditch.two or three scoops of gravel had been removed from the bed of the stream by mechanical means and deposited on the bank.the gravel had been taken from the stream since yount prior visit to the site in june.
yount returned to this site on july.this time,yount saw rocks and gravel had been placed across the stream to make a dam.
lieutenant bob taylor is a dfg patrol lieutenant.on august,he visited the site and took photographs of the rock and gravel diversion dam.percent of the stream flow was being diverted from big creek down the big creek diversion ditch.
yount returned to the site on september.at that time,the rock and gravel dam extended across the entire width of the stream.further,more gravel had been placed in the holes between the rocks.there was a six and wide notch in the rock and gravel dam that allowed some water to bypass the dam and continue downstream to the concrete dam and fish ladder.the rock and gravel dam,however,diverted most of the water of big creek into the big creek diversion ditch.
murrison did not notify dfg of his intent to alter the stream at any time in,nor did he enter into a streambed alteration agreement with dfg.
dave hoopaugh is a dfg biologist.hoopaugh took stream flow measurements on big creek in and.he took those measurements to evaluate the big creek diversion ditch and develop recommendations to prevent or mitigate any adverse impacts on the fishery resources in big creek.hoopaugh primary emphasis was protecting steelhead trout 
in,hoopaugh recommended the big creek ranch allow between and cubic feet per second flow past its diversion.in,hoopaugh recommended one cubic foot per second as a minimum flow requirement.this was the absolute minimum that hoopaugh thought would keep the fish in the creek alive.equating this to the amount of water flowing over the fish ladder,hoopaugh testified that one cubic foot per second would result in a depth of more than one and inches of water,but he could not state how much more with any degree of accuracy.
hoopaugh concluded that there was a potential substantial adverse impact in the stream resources of big creek from the big creek diversion ditch he observed in and.the and diversions were substantially similar to the diversion.thus,hoopaugh concluded the big creek diversion ditch of created the potential for substantial adverse impact to the fishing resources of big creek.hoopaugh further testified he believed one and inches of depth over the fish ladder was insufficient to provide healthy fish habitat.bernard aguilar,a second dfg biologist,also testified the big creek diversion ditch did have or may have a substantial adverse effect on fish resources.
at trial,murrison argued his water rights were not subject to fish and game code section.further,murrison argued his rock and gravel dam did not constitute a substantial alteration of the creek.murrison asserted he was maintaining his waterworks and thus,his work fell within the exemption for maintenance contained in fish and game code section,subdivision e.
on his own behalf,murrison testified big creek typically dries up during the summer months,which coincides with prime irrigation months for the ranch.murrison also testified over the years there always had been some type of diversion structure in big creek.prior to,the structure was simply gravel.since,it has consisted of large boulders with gravel and rocks between the boulders.the boulders were placed in the streambed with the permission of dfg.the boulders were then removed by trinity county waterworks in and later replaced by murrison.
murrison performed yearly maintenance on the big creek diversion ditch.the maintenance included shoveling gravel,cleaning out gravel from the stream in front of the headgate,and cleaning the ditch.murrison admitted he cleaned out the gravel in front of his headgate in.murrison also admitted he placed all of the rocks that made up the diversion dam.murrison asserted he always tried to keep an inch and of water flowing over the fish ladder in compliance with the dfg streambed alteration agreement.
murrison claimed he did not request a permit under fish and game code section because he believed he was not doing anything substantial,but only performing basic maintenance on his irrigation system.murrison testified that the big creek diversion ditch is approximately one inch lower in elevation than the height of the fish ladder.as a result,he must constantly adjust the rock and gravel diversion structure to ensure enough water goes through the diversion to maintain the flow on the fish ladder.
murrison also presented the testimony of a fish and aquatic biologist,keith marine.marine challenged the methodology of the dfg biologists in reaching their expert conclusions.marine claimed murrison had not created an appreciable alteration of the natural stream bed by virtue of his rock and gravel dam.
the trial court found murrison had substantially altered or obstructed big creek without complying with the provisions of fish and game code section.the court concluded the and streambed agreements did not authorize murrison to conduct the same or similar work in.the court further rejected murrison reliance on the maintenance exemption contained in section,subdivision e of the fish and game code.the court rejected murrison argument he was exempt from the fish and game code section process because the big creek diversion ditch was based on claimed water rights.
the court enjoined murrison from working in big creek and operating his headgate.the court also imposed civil penalties of under fish and game code section and under business and professions code section.in a posttrial motion,the court later modified the injunction to allow murrison to operate his headgate,as long as murrison moved no rocks or gravel,and performed no work in big creek.murrison appeals.
discussion 
application of section to water right holders 
citing the california constitution and the water code,murrison argues his water rights are not subject to regulation under fish and game code section.while his challenge is much broader,murrison claim even extends to the initial notice requirement further,he contends the dfg can not appropriate water under the authority of fish and game code section.we reject these arguments.
in relevant part,fish and game code section,subdivision a,provides it is unlawful for any person to substantially divert or obstruct the natural flow or substantially change the bed,channel,or bank of any river,stream,or lake designated by the department,or use any material from the streambeds,without first notifying the department of that activity,except when the department has been notified pursuant to section.
we begin with a brief description of water rights under california law.california operates under a dual system of water rights that recognizes both the appropriation and riparian doctrines.see people shirokow cal d,shirokow.the riparian doctrine confers upon the owner of land contiguous to a watercourse the right to the reasonable and beneficial use of water on his land.the appropriation doctrine contemplates the diversion of water and applies to any taking of water for other than riparian or overlying uses.citation.both riparian and appropriative rights are usufructuary only and confer no right of private ownership in the watercourse.ibid.
common law appropriation originated in the gold rush days when miners diverted water necessary to work their placer mining claims.the miners adopted among themselves the priority rule of first in time,first in right,and california courts looked to principles of equity and of real property law to adjudicate conflicting claims.citations.thus it was initially the law in this state that a person could appropriate water merely by diverting it and putting it to use.shirokow,supra,cal d at.
the first appropriation statute was enacted in and provided for initiation of the appropriative right by the posting and recordation of notice.citation.the nonstatutory method retained its vitality and appropriative rights were acquired by following either procedure.shirokow,supra,cal d at.
both methods were superseded by the enactment of the water commission act,which created a water commission and provided a procedure for the appropriation of water for useful and beneficial purposes.the main purpose of the act was to provide an orderly method for the appropriation of unappropriated waters.citations.by amendment in,the statutory procedure became the exclusive means of acquiring appropriative rights.shirokow,supra,cal d at.
unlike real property rights,usufructuary water rights are limited and uncertain.the available supply of water is largely determined by natural forces.united states state water resources control bd.d.i n times of water shortage,all riparians must curtail their usage in order that they share the available water.ibid.further,appropriators are limited by priorities in time their rights are subordinate to the rights of preexisting holders,riparians and senior appropriators.id.at.
a the constitutional argument 
all water rights are also limited by the provisions of article x,section of the california constitution which proscribes the waste or unreasonable use or unreasonable method of use or unreasonable method of diversion of water.city of barstow mojave water agency cal th,d.
to argue that fish and game code section does not apply to his stream alteration and,hence to his water rights,murrison draws on one provision of article x,section which provides,in part nothing herein contained shall be construed as depriving any appropriator of water to which the appropriator is lawfully entitled.murrison properly concedes this provision prohibits him from exercising his water right in a wasteful and unreasonable manner.see united states state water resources control,supra,d at.murrison argues,however,the language demonstrates that the ban on unreasonable and wasteful use is the only permissible restriction on his right to take water from big creek.that is not the law.ibid.
legislation with respect to water affects the public welfare and the right to legislate in regard to its use and conservation is referable to the police power of the state.baldwin county of tehama th,d.w ater rights have been the subject of pervasive regulation in california.people weaver,d supp.the state of california has a substantial public interest in protecting its fields,streams,and wildlife.national audubon society superior court cal d.the state owns the fish in its streams in trust for the public.california trout,state water resources control bd.d.s ection of the fish and game code expressly indicates that the legislature intent in enacting section was to provide for the protection and conservation of fish and wildlife resources,a goal that the legislature declared to be of the utmost public interest.people ramsey th,d.
the requirement in fish and game code section that murrison notify dfg of his intent to substantially alter or divert big creek furthers the state substantial interest in the protection of the state fish and wildlife.this statutory requirement is inherent in the state sovereign power to protect its wildlife and murrison water rights are subject to these powers.a water right,whether it predates or postdates is not exempt from reasonable regulation.just as a real property owner does not have an unfettered right to develop property in any manner he or she sees fit see rutherford state of california d,an owner of a water right may be similarly restricted.
b the water code section argument 
murrison also cites water code section.that section provides all water flowing in any natural channel,excepting so far as it has been or is being applied to useful and beneficial purposes upon,or in so far as it is or may be reasonably needed for useful and beneficial purposes upon lands riparian thereto,or otherwise appropriated,is hereby declared to be public water of the state and subject to appropriation in accordance with the provisions of this code.according to murrison,because the board does not allocate or otherwise distribute water rights that were obtained before,fish and game code section does not apply to those rights.murrison conclusion does not follow from his premise.
as we have already noted,appropriative water rights were first available by simply diverting water and putting it to use.shirokow,supra,cal d at.in,the legislature codified the process for appropriation of water and created an orderly regulatory scheme to establish those rights.ibid.the only substantive difference between appropriative water rights obtained prior to and those obtained after is that rights must go through the administrative process before the board.fullerton state water resources control bd.d.the courts have consistently held that the statutory scheme was only a regulation of the existing privilege to appropriate water.this is precisely the purpose of water code section.the change in administration of these rights does no
