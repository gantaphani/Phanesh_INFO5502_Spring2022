in this case,we must decide whether an easement that permits its holder to use private property for the purpose of constructing and maintaining an electric transmission or distribution line or system allows the easement to be used for lines.we hold that it does not.we further hold that section of the texas utilities code,which grants cable companies the right to install lines on a utility easement,does not apply to private easements like the one at issue here.accordingly,we affirm the court of appeals judgment reversing summary judgment in the cable company favor.
background 
this case centers around the scope of a property interest granted over sixty years ago.in,alan and myrna krohn predecessors in interest granted to the hill county electric cooperative an easement that allows the cooperative to use their property for the purpose of constructing and maintaining an electric transmission or distribution line or system.the easement further granted the right to remove trees and vegetation to the extent necessary to keep them clear of said electric line or system.
in,hill county electric entered into a joint use agreement with a provider,which later assigned its rights under the agreement to marcus cable associates,under the agreement,marcus cable obtained permission from hill county electric to attach its cable lines to the cooperative poles.the agreement permitted marcus cable to furnish television antenna service to area residents,and allowed the cable wires to be attached only to the extent the cooperative may lawfully do so.the agreement further provided that the electric cooperative did not warrant or assure any privileges or easements,and that marcus cable shall be responsible for obtaining its own easements and.
seven years later,the krohns sued marcus cable,alleging that the company did not have a valid easement and had placed its wires over their property without their knowledge or consent.the krohns asserted a trespass claim,and alleged that marcus cable was negligent in failing to obtain their consent before installing the cable lines.the krohns sought an injunction ordering the cable wires removal,as well as actual and exemplary damages.in defense,marcus cable asserted a right to use hill county electric poles under the cooperative easement and under texas statutory law.
both parties filed motions for summary judgment.the krohns moved for partial summary judgment,arguing that marcus cable wires constituted a trespass.the krohns requested the court to order the wires removal and to set for trial the determination of damages.marcus cable filed a response and its own motion,arguing that both the hill county electric easement and section of the texas utilities code gave it the legal right to place its wires on the krohns property.
the trial court granted summary judgment in marcus cable favor.the court of appeals reversed and remanded,holding that neither section nor the easement allowed marcus cable use.at.we granted review to consider whether the cooperative easement or section permit marcus cable to attach lines to hill county electric utility poles without the krohns consent.
ii.common law 
a property owner right to exclude others from his or her property is recognized as one of the most essential sticks in the bundle of rights that are commonly characterized as property.dolan city of tigard,d quoting loretto teleprompter manhattan catv,d quoting kaiser aetna united states,d see also ii blackstone,blackstone commentaries tucker ed.a landowner may choose to relinquish a portion of the right to exclude by granting an easement,but such a relinquishment is limited in nature.san jacinto sand southwestern bell,dist,writ ref see generally ii george thompson,thompson on property,at.unlike a possessory interest in land,an easement is a nonpossessory interest that authorizes its holder to use the property for only particular purposes.see restatement third of property servitudes cmt.
marcus cable claims rights under hill county electric express easement,that is,an easement conveyed by an express grant.see dewitt county,parks.while the common law recognizes that certain easements may be assigned or apportioned to a third party,the third party use can not exceed the rights expressly conveyed to the original easement holder.see cantu cent.power light,antonio,writ ref keokuk junction ry.ies,iowa buhl sprint communications,carrithers terramar beach cmty.improvement,a n easement may not create a right or interest in a grantee favor which the grantor himself did not possess.marcus cable rights,therefore,turn on whether the cooperative easement permits the krohns property to be used for the purpose of installing lines.
marcus cable raises three arguments to support its contention that the original easement encompasses use.first,it argues that easements must be interpreted to anticipate and encompass future technological developments that may not have existed when the easement was originally granted.second,marcus cable contends that courts should give strong deference to the public policy behind expanding the provision of services.third,marcus cable argues that its use is permitted because adding wires does not increase the burden on the servient estate.these arguments,however,ignore fundamental principles that govern interpreting easements conveyed by express grant.those principles lead us to conclude that the original easement does not encompass marcus cable use.
express easements 
we apply basic principles of contract construction and interpretation when considering an express easement terms.dewitt county,at armstrong skelly oil,writ ref.the contracting parties intentions,as expressed in the grant,determine the scope of the conveyed interest.see dewitt county,at stating that the scope of the easement holder rights must be determined by the terms of the grant see also houston pipe line dwyer,holding that parties intentions are determined by interpreting the grant language garrett dils,same city of dallas etheridge,same restatement third of property servitudes providing that an easement should be interpreted to give effect to the intention of the parties ascertained from the language used in the instrument,or the circumstances surrounding the creation of the servitude,and to carry out the purpose for which it was created.
when the grant terms are not specifically defined,they should be given their plain,ordinary,and generally accepted meaning.dewitt,at see also restatement third of property servitudes cmt.d easement language should be interpreted to accord with the meaning an ordinary purchaser would ascribe to it restatement second of contracts a unless a different intention is manifested,where language has a generally prevailing meaning,it is interpreted in accordance with that meaning.an easement express terms,interpreted according to their generally accepted meaning,therefore delineate the purposes for which the easement holder may use the property.see dewitt,at,see also coleman forister,vahlsing harrell,cir applying texas law.nothing passes by implication except what is reasonably necessary to fairly enjoy the rights expressly granted.coleman,at bland lake fishing hunting club fisher,no writ.thus,if a particular purpose is not provided for in the grant,a use pursuing that purpose is not allowed.see coleman,at kearney son fancher,worth,writ ref bickler bickler.if the rule were otherwise,
then the typical power line or pipeline easement,granted for the purpose of constructing and maintaining a power line or pipeline across specified property,could be used for any other purpose,unless the grantor by specific language negated all other purposes.
kearney son,at citing lange,texas practice,land titles,at see also city of pasadena land water,cal d,it is not necessary for the easement grantor to make any reservation to protect his interests in the land,for what he does not convey,he still retains.
the common law does allow some flexibility in determining an easement holder rights.in particular,the manner,frequency,and intensity of an easement use may change over time to accommodate technological development.restatement third of property servitudes.but such changes must fall within the purposes for which the easement was created,as determined by the grant terms.see id.cmt.d the holder of the easement is entitled to make only the uses reasonably necessary for the specified purpose.cmt.a noting that manner,frequency,and intensity of easement may change to take advantage of technological advances,but only for purposes for which easement was created see,edgcomb lower valley power light,holding that,under easement granted for an electric or telephone line,the easement holder could increase the capacity and replace the line with line as a matter of normal development of the respective rights and use city pub.serv.bd.of san antonio karp,antonio,no writ holding that a transformer easement permitted its holder to replace a malfunctioning underground transformer with an aboveground one as a matter of normal development lower.river auth.ashby,writ ref holding that,under the easement at issue,the easement holder could replace wooden towers with new steel towers and could increase the capacity restatement third of property servitudes illus.stating that,under a telephone easement,easement holder could mount transmitters on its poles for transmissions unless doing so would unreasonably interfere with enjoyment of the servient estate.thus,contrary to marcus cable argument,an express easement encompasses only those technological developments that further the particular purpose for which the easement was granted.see restatement third of property servitudes cmt,cmt.a,cmt.otherwise,easements would effectively become possessory,rather than nonpossessory,land interests.see id.cmt.d distinguishing between an easement that permits its owner to use land for only specified purposes,and a possessory land interest that permits its owner to make any use of the property.
the emphasis our law places upon an easement express terms serves important public policies by promoting certainty in land transactions.in order to evaluate the burdens placed upon real property,a potential purchaser must be able to safely rely upon granting language.see restatement third of property servitudes cmt.similarly,those who grant easements should be assured that their conveyances will not be construed to undermine the rights to exclude others or to obtain a profit any more than what was intended in the grant.see loretto,at.
marcus cable suggests that we should give greater weight to the public benefit that results from the wide distribution of services,arguing that technological advancement in texas will be substantially impeded if the cooperative easement is not read to encompass use but even if that were so,we may not circumvent the contracting parties intent by disregarding the easement express terms and the specific purpose for which it was granted.see restatement third of property servitudes cmt.d indicating that a court may not adopt an easement interpretation based on public policy unless that interpretation is supported by the grant terms.adhering to basic easement principles,we must decide not what is most convenient to the public or profitable to marcus cable,but what purpose the contracting parties intended the easement to serve.see dauenhauer devine.hill county electric could only permit marcus cable to use its easement so long as that use is devoted exclusively to the purposes of the grant.cantu,at.
finally,marcus cable contends that its use should be allowed because attaching wires to hill county electric utility poles does not materially increase the burden to the servient estate.but again,if a use does not serve the easement express purpose,it becomes an unauthorized presence on the land whether or not it results in any noticeable burden to the servient estate.see mcdaniel wilson,writ ref e very unauthorized entry upon land of another is a trespass even if no damage is done or the injury is slight see also rio costilla.livestock ass ranch,beckwith rossi,me.thus,the threshold inquiry is not whether the proposed use results in a material burden,but whether the grant terms authorize the proposed use.with these principles in mind,we turn to the easement at issue in this case.
hill county electric easement 
both parties urge us to determine marcus cable easement rights as a matter of law.when an easement is susceptible to only one reasonable,definite interpretation after applying established rules of contract construction,we are obligated to construe it as a matter of law even if the parties offer different interpretations of the easement terms.dewitt,at.because the easement here can be given a definite meaning,we interpret it as a matter of law.
the easement granted hill county electric the right to use the krohns property for the purpose of constructing and maintaining an electric transmission or distribution line or system.the terms electric transmission and electric distribution are commonly and ordinarily associated with power companies conveying electricity to the public.see,texas power light cole,resendez lyntegar,no writ coop.state,writ dism using terms electric transmission distribution to describe equipment used by power companies to convey electricity see also restatement third of property servitudes illus.using lines to designate lines operated by power companies.a,d providing that public utility commission shall regulate abuses in the sale of electricity by utilities providing electric transmission or distribution services.texas cases decided around the time the cooperative easement was granted strongly suggest that this was the commonly understood meaning of those terms.see,city of bryan v.a m consol.indep.sch,aff,mexico utils.city of teague,worth,writ ref arcola sugar mills houston lighting power,writ ref mcculloch county,hall,writ dism willacy county central power light,antonio,writ dism using term electric transmission to describe equipment used by power companies to convey electricity.accordingly,we construe the easement terms to allow use of the property for facilities to transmit electricity.
marcus cable does not argue that the generally prevailing meaning of the easement grant encompasses services.instead,it claims that,for reasons of public policy,we should construe the easement to embrace modern developments,without regard to the easement language.in support of that position,marcus cable cites a number of decisions in other jurisdictions that have allowed the use of easements predating cable technology to allow installation of cable transmission lines.
the cases marcus cable cites,however,involve different granting language and do not support the proposition that we may disregard the parties expressed intentions or expand the purposes for which an easement may be used.to the contrary,those cases involve easements containing much broader granting language than the easement before us.most of them involved easements granted for communications media,such as telegraph and telephone,in addition to electric utility easements.in concluding that the easements were broad enough to encompass cable,the reviewing courts examined the purpose for which the easement was granted and essentially concluded that the questioned use was a more technologically advanced means of accomplishing the same communicative purpose.
for example,in salvaty falcon cable television,the easement permitted its holder to maintain both electric wires and telephone wires.d.the court held that lines were within the easement scope,observing that cable television is part of the natural evolution of communications technology.id.at emphasis added accord witteman jack barry cable tv,same.similarly,the fourth circuit held that an easement allowing its holder to use the land for the purpose of maintaining pole lines for electrical and telephone service was sufficiently broad to encompass lines.tv,shannondale,cir applying west virginia law.in reaching its conclusion,the court relied on the similar communicative aspects of both telephone services and services.id.at.other cases marcus cable cites also involved easements granted for purposes.see,cousins alabama power,so d,involving for the purpose of maintaining electric transmission lines and all telegraph and telephone lines that the landowners conceded included the right to maintain telecommunications lines jolliff hardin cable television,ohio,concluding that wires were a burden contemplated at the time of the grants to the power company,as evidenced by the specific reference to telegraph and telephone wires in the easement am.of mcdonald,concluding that easement granted for the purpose of maintaining lines of telephone and telegraph could be apportioned by the easement holder to a telephone company seeking to install a telephone cable,and that n othing granted to the company enables it to do anything which the original grantee could not have done henley continental cablevision of louis county,concluding that cable television fell within the easement grantors expressed intention to provide electric power and telephonic communications to subdivision residents hoffman capitol cablevision,involving easements for the distribution of electricity and messages,and concluding that wires were no greater burden than that contemplated by the original easements.
we express no opinion about whether the cases marcus cable relies upon were correctly decided.but,unlike the cases marcus cable cites,hill county electric easement does not convey the right to use the property for purposes of transmitting communications.while cable television may utilize electrical impulses to transmit communications,as marcus cable claims television transmission is not a more technologically advanced method of delivering electricity.thus,the cases do not support marcus cable argument that the easement here encompasses the additional purpose of transmitting television content to the public.
marcus cable cites only two cases involving easements whose grants did not include telephone or telegraph services,and neither supports its position.in centel cable television,cook,the court interpreted easement language that permitted its holder to maintain a line for the transmission distribution of electric energy thereover,for any and all purposes for which electric energy is now,or may hereafter be used.ohio,emphasis added.observing that broadcasting utilize s electric energy,the court concluded that the grant language was broad enough to encompass cable television.id.emphasis added.and hise barc electric cooperative,involved a easement by prescription that had been used for lines during the prescriptive period and that was later widened through eminent domain.it did not involve a,express easement.see,nishanian sirohi,the use of an express easement must be restricted to the terms and purposes on which the grant was based.citing robertson bertha mineral.the easements in marcus cable cited cases are simply not comparable to the more limited,express easement presented here.
finally,marcus cable cites san antonio aransas pass railway southwestern telegraph telephone,for the proposition that an easement must be interpreted to embrace technological change.but that case does not support the idea that a court may ignore the contracting parties intent as reflected in their written language.there,we were called upon to determine whether a statute granting condemnation power to telegraph companies applied equally to telephone companies.id.relying upon later statutory enactments that reflected the legislature intent to treat both the same,and recognizing that telegraph and telephone are two different means of accomplishing the same communicative purpose,we held that the statute at issue applied to telephone companies.id.at.
the dissenting justice would hold that the easement could properly be read to encompass cable because electricity is used in the transmission of cable television signals.under such a reading,however,the easement could also be used for telegraph or telephone lines.obviously,the krohns predecessors could have granted an easement for those purposes.but the easement specific terms can not be read so broadly.
in sum,the easement language here,properly construed,does not permit lines to be strung across the krohns land without their consent.however laudable the goal of extending cable service might be,we can not disregard the easement express terms to enlarge its purposes beyond those intended by the contracting parties.to the extent the trial court granted marcus cable summary judgment on this basis,it erred,and the court of appeals correctly reversed.
iii.section 
marcus cable contends that,even if hill county electric easement does not permit it to string wires across the krohns property,section of the texas utilities code does.that section,which allows service providers to utilize certain properties,provides 
a in an unincorporated area,a person in the business of providing community antenna or cable television service to the public may install and maintain equipment through,under,along,across,or over a utility easement,a public road,an alley,or a body of public water in accordance with this subchapter.
b the installation and maintenance of the equipment must be done in a way that does not unduly inconvenience the public using the affected property.
marcus cable argues that the statute plain language encompasses private easements like the one at issue here.specifically,marcus cable contends that the term utility easement is not qualified by the term public,as are other properties listed in the statute,and therefore the legislature must have intended to cover grants to utility companies.the krohns,on the other hand,argue that the statute language,purpose,and legislative history support a distinction between,easements and limited grants.we agree with the krohns.
our purpose in construing a statute is to determine the legislature intent.see helena chem.wilkins.as a starting point,we construe statutes as written and,if possible,ascertain intent from the statutory language.id.citing morrison chan.we may also consider other factors,including the object the statute seeks to obtain,legislative history,and the consequences of a particular construction.see also.gov t code.moreover,we must always consider a statute as a whole and attempt to harmonize its various provisions.helena,at see also.gov t code.we must also,if possible,construe statutes to avoid constitutional infirmities.in re bay area citizens against lawsuit abuse,nootsie,williamson county appraisal,see also.gov t code.
applying these principles,we hold that section does not encompass private easements granted to utilities.the term utility easement appears in a list of roads,alleys,and public are generally dedicated to public use.subsection b goes on to prohibit cable companies from unduly inconvenienc ing the public using the affected property,indicating that the legislature presumed public access to the property interests listed in subsection a.b emphasis added.thus,consistent with the nature of the other specified properties,and harmonizing the statute subsections,utility easement can reasonably be read to cover only public easements,that is,those easements dedicated to the public use.see,clark el paso cablevision,paso,no writ.
the limited legislative history that is available supports this interpretation.statements were repeatedly made in hearings indicating that section was intended to encompass only public easements.hearings on before the house comm.on urban affairs,april.finally,construing the statute to cover only public easements avoids constitutional infirmities.in loretto,the united states supreme court analyzed a new york statute that granted companies the right to place their equipment on apartment buildings,and held that applying the statute to private property would effect a taking in violation of the fifth amendment.loretto,at.the court reasoned that a permanent physical occupation authorized by government is a taking without regard to the public interests that it may serve,and that permanent occupations of land by such installations as telegraph and telephone lines or wires are takings even if they occupy only relatively insubstantial amounts of space and do not seriously interfere with the landowner use of the rest of his land.id.at.we also note that a number of federal courts,construing the cable communications policy act,have recognized the constitutional concerns that would arise from requiring private parties to grant property access to uninvited cable companies whenever a private easement has been granted to other specific service providers.see,cable.coxcom,cir tci of,schriock holding,cir cable holdings of,mcneil real estate fund vi,cir,cert.denied,d cable,woolley,cir.thus,construing section to cover private property could have significant constitutional implications.
in sum,we hold that section does not cover grants,like the one at issue here,that are negotiated between owners of private property and individual utility companies 
iv.conclusion 
we hold that hill county electric easement does not convey the right to string wires over the krohns private property.nor does section confer such a right upon marcus cable,because the statute covers only utility easements that are dedicated to public use.accordingly,we affirm the court of appeals judgment reversing and remanding this case to the trial court for further proceedings.
the electric television not its predecessor was conceived in by philo farnsworth,who made a working model in twelve years before rca national broadcasting company first began regular telecasts from the world fair in new york city,and and ruth curtis granted hill county electric cooperative an easement on their land north of sardis,texas,to place,construct,operate,repair,maintain,relocate and replace an electric transmission and distribution line or system.after,television took off.cable television is said to have originated in when john walson of mahanoy city,pennsylvania,used a wire to transmit an electric signal from a remote antenna to his store to demonstrate to his customers how reception could be improved and thereby increase his sales of the newfangled television sets the curtises no doubt intended that by granting the an easement,wires strung on poles erected on their property would be used to transmit electric current to power lights and appliances.they probably did not envision that one such appliance in the sardis area would be a television set.and they could not possibly have imagined that televisions powered by the electric current carried by lines over their easement would have better reception if supplied with an electric signal transmitted over another line hung on the same poles,even if the curtises had been as precocious as philo farnsworth himself.
so if the question is,what were the curtises thinking in when they gave the an easement for an electric transmission and distribution line or system,the answer is easy they were thinking about electric power,not an electric cable television signal,even though both are electric.but that not the question because,as the court correctly holds,the scope of an easement is measured by the parties intent as expressed in the words used broadened by changes in the manner,frequency,and intensity of the intended use that are due to technological advances and do not unreasonably burden the servient estate an easement need not accommodate unintended uses merely because they present no additional burden,nor can an easement be enlarged merely because additional uses would benefit the public.but a use that is within the language of an easement as it has come to be understood with changes in technology is not prohibited simply because it was not part of the parties original thinking.so the question in this case is whether a cable carrying an electric television signal to various users is an electric transmission and distribution line or system as we have come to understand more of what those words entail.
now if one were to stick just to the words,the answer would clearly be yes.a television cable is a line.a television signal is electric,assuming,as the court does,that the cable is not fiber optic although even if the cable were fiber optic,the signal would still start out electric at the transmitter and end up electric at the receiver sending the signal is an electric transmission.transmitting it among a number of users is an electric distribution.thus,a television cable is an electric transmission and distribution line.looking at a pole carrying lines transmitting electric power and a line transmitting television signals,a person unfamiliar with differences in the physics of the transmissions could not tell which was which.
but the court answers the question no.here is its analysis 
the terms electric transmission and electric distribution are commonly and ordinarily associated with power companies conveying electricity to the public.
texas cases decided around the time the cooperative easement was granted strongly suggest that this was the commonly understood meaning of those terms.
while cable television may utilize electrical impulses to transmit communications,as marcus cable claims,television is not a more technologically advanced method of delivering electricity.
although easements for electric transmission have been held to include cable television signal transmission in all seven cases that have considered the matter in other jurisdictions the language of the easements in all those cases was broader 
while each of these elements in the court reasoning is irrefutable,they prove nothing.the fact that the words electric transmission and distribution are often used in reference to electric power does not mean that they therefore can not be used in reference to any other electric transmission,like a cable television signal.in fact,the words have a broader reference.for example,a statute regulating telecommunications refers to any type of system in which electric signals are used to transmit information,including a system transmitting information by wire or cable in other words,an electric transmission system for information by line or cable.of course,the words could not have referred to a cable television signal in,but only because no such thing existed,not because of the caselaw of the era.our understanding of what electric means has changed immensely over time.before michael faraday,benjamin franklin,and others discovered electric currents,electric referred to the static,magnetic condition of certain materials,like amber rubbed with a cloth indeed,the word electric derives from the latin,electrum,meaning amber.the meaning of electric,as we have come to understand better the phenomenon to which it refers,can no more be confined to electric current than it could to static electricity or amber.caselaw reflecting the understanding of electric in does not dictate all that the word means.
as the court says,television is certainly not a more technologically advanced method of delivering electric current,but that simplistic observation begs the issue.are the technological changes relevant to understanding the scope of the easement those in electric transmission and distribution of whatever nature,or only those in the transmission and distribution of electric current the answer is the former,if we are to be faithful to the language of the easement.is transmission of a cable television signal a more technologically advanced electric transmission clearly,yes.
the court is correct that in six of the seven cases from other jurisdictions that have considered whether an easement for electric transmission can be shared by cable television,the easements expressly permitted telephone lines because the telephone is used for communication,the court reasons,the easements in those cases were broader and could court will not say could properly television.since the easement in the present case does not expressly allow for telephone lines,the court concludes that it does not permit any use for purposes of communication.but electric power is used for communication in the very important sense that neither a television nor a telephone will operate without it.indeed,a television without a cable signal still has limited reception,while a television without electric power is nothing but a big doorstop,whether it is hooked up to cable or not.it is just not true that an easement for telephone wires contemplates the use of communication devices and an easement for electric current does n
