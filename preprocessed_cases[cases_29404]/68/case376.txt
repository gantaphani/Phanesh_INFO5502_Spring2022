in petition for review,customers of a public utility challenge a decision of the federal energy regulatory commission ferc or the commission that approved new charges for electricity service.petitioners argue that the commission decision to approve the charges was arbitrary and capricious because the services for which the charges were assessed are already covered in existing contracts that shield them from new charges unless they are for new services.petitioners further argue that the commission did not engage in reasoned decisionmaking because its conclusion is inconsistent with previous determinations it has made with regard to the same charges.ferc responds that the services for which new charges are assessed are new services,and distinguishes its conclusions in previous proceedings by arguing that the utility owners intervenors in support of ferc had failed to demonstrate that the services were not already covered by existing rates.
under our particularly deferential standard of review for the commission decisionmaking,we conclude that ferc considered substantial evidence that the proposed tariff was assessed to collect charges associated with new services and that its decision to approve that tariff was rational.we also find that ferc conclusion was not inconsistent with its prior determinations because,as the commission has explained,new evidence was before it.we therefore deny the petition.
in,ferc introduced electric utility companies operating under its authority to a brave new regulatory world with its vanguard order,whose aspirational title made up in optimism what it lacked in literary flair.see promoting wholesale competition through open access transmission services by public utilities,ferc stats.regs.order.promulgated in response to the effects of vertical integration and,in particular,the unlawful practice of some electric utilities to provide wholesalers of electric power inferior access or no access at all to their transmission networks,see order at,this remedial order required the functional unbundling of wholesale generation and transmission services.id.at.if vertical integration the predecessor to functional unbundling offered a prix fixe menu of utility services,functional unbundling required the a la carte alternative under the new system,previously integrated utilities were now required to maintain a wholesale marketing function separate from their transmission functions.both would deal with one another at arm length.utilities were required to state separate rates for their generation,transmission,and ancillary services and,when providing any of those services for themselves or their affiliates,do so under the same terms and with the same priority as those available to other market participants.the purpose was to prevent a utility from gaining special access to service or special price deals by virtue of its integration of functions.
in addition to the unbundling requirements that it imposed,order encouraged,but did not demand,the formation of regional transmission organizations rtos entities that could manage all transmission services for a particular region.by consolidating control but not ownership of the now unbundled transmission services,ferc hoped to preserve the efficiencies produced by vertical integration while forestalling its effects.wholesale competition would be encouraged over broad geographic areas,order at,isee also public util.dist.of snohomish county ferc,while operational redundancies would be reduced or eliminated.regional transmission reliability would also be enhanced.see order at.
familiar with the influence on utilities of the powerful incentives to avoid regulations that limit monopolistic advantages,ferc suggested a further improvement to the novel system it envisioned.the rto would cede operational control of its collectively run transmission facilities to an independent system operator iso,which would have no financial interest in generation services and therefore no incentive to thwart ferc goals of efficiency,competition,and improved reliability.see id.at,announcing certain principles to guide further consideration of iso proposals.
predictably,not all shared ferc vision of how energy markets should function.most utilities declined the commission invitation to voluntarily embrace a future of robust competition in the wholesale electricity market.and because ferc had required only unbundling,and not the formation of rtos,utility companies were free to sit out that particular dance.ferc,anxious to see greater participation than had been achieved through mere suggestion,issued another order,directing utilities either to participate in an rto or to explain their refusal to do so.see regional transmission,order,ferc stats.regs.order see also pub.util.dist,at.and while participation was still voluntary ferc apparently favored gradual steps in advancing its goals,see id.at,electric utilities took the commission cue and began to form rtos and transfer operational control of their transmission facilities to isos.
one such iso created in the wake of order and was the midwest iso miso,approved by ferc in to organize as a,corporation.see midwest indep.transmission.operator,ferc,at.the utilities that organized the miso retained ownership and the physical operation and maintenance of their own transmission facilities,but the miso was responsible for functional control over the transmission system,which included managing transmission availability and capacity,requests for transmission service,available ancillary services,and security.ferc conditionally approved a transmission tariff that provided a universal rate for all customers receiving these services from the miso system.that tariff would be paid immediately by customers of all new wholesale and existing unbundled retail transmission service,id.at,and even though customers of existing wholesale services would now receive them through the miso,they were afforded the benefit of their rates under existing agreements grandfathered agreements and exempted from the miso transmission tariff for six years.id.the question before us is whether petitioners,who are customers of these grandfathered agreements and do not yet pay miso service rates the transmission tariff,must nonetheless pay the administrative costs associated with managing the miso an administrative tariff,from which they receive their transmission service.
this is not our first review of a dispute involving miso tariffs and parties to agreements grandfathered into the miso system.in midwest iso transmission owners ferc,we were asked to determine whether ferc may require the transmission owners to pay the miso administrative costs the same costs at the center of the petition now before us for service provided to customers of grandfathered agreements.id.at.the transmission owners argued that ferc violated the principle of cost causation,which we had described as requir ing that all approved rates reflect to some degree the costs actually caused by the customer who must pay them.id.at quoting kn energy,ferc.the transmission owners argued that the costs imposed upon them for miso service offered to customers of grandfathered agreements outweighed the benefits to those customers who,while receiving service under the miso system,did not pay the miso universal transmission rate for the transition period and therefore,according to the transmission owners argument,did not use the iso.see id.at.noting that the administrative charges in dispute covered the costs of having an iso,and that the transmission owners benefit from having an iso,id.at,this court concluded that ferc correctly determined that they should share the cost of having an iso,even for bundled and grandfathered loads that deliver the same benefits afforded customers who are actually using an iso,receiving electric service under a universal transmission rate,see id.the transmission owners were thus responsible for paying the administrative costs now in dispute before us on behalf of all of their customers,including those customers who do not use,do not pay the universal transmission rate for service under the iso.
faced with this court decision,and having thus exhausted their attempts to avoid paying the disputed charges altogether,the transmission owners proposed to pass the bill on to their customers by assessing additional charges under schedule to collect the miso administrative costs they now owed on grandfathered loads.ferc order conditionally accepting the owners proposal to collect those costs from customers is the subject of the petition for review currently before us.
the transmission owners attempt to pass the miso administrative costs to customers of grandfathered agreements is not their first.they had previously proposed the imposition of two sets of administrative charges schedule charges,which recover the costs of running the miso itself,and schedule charges,which recover the costs of developing and running the miso energy markets.but this prior attempt failed when ferc ruled that the transmission owners had not demonstrated that the existing rates paid by customers taking service under the grandfathered agreements did not already include schedule charges,see midwest indep.transmission.operator,ferc,at midwest indep.transmission.operator,ferc,at,and schedule charges,see midwest indep.transmission.operator,ferc,at.the commission did note,however,that the transmission owners could ultimately pass through these costs as new services,if they could demonstrate that the services were indeed new.
the transmission owners took the hint.they proposed charges for new services and ferc,in its march,order now under review before us,conditionally allowed the owners to impose schedule charges,which recover both schedule and schedule charges.transmission owners of the midwest indep.transmission.operator,ferc initial order.the commission reasoning resembled our own in midwest iso transmission owners ferc,the schedule and schedule charges to be collected under schedule would recover the costs associated with benefits including regional transmission pricing,regional transmission system planning,and improved grid reliability and efficiency provided to all customers receiving service under the miso,including customers of grandfathered agreements.see initial order at.in response to arguments that the benefits identified by the commission in its proposal are not enjoyed by customers to grandfathered agreements because those customers do not use miso energy markets or because the grandfathered agreements already provide such benefits,the commission concluded that the miso provides fundamentally new services and benefits that are different than those provided under the grandfathered agreements.see id at.
in response to parties assertions that the commission had already denied recovery of schedule and charges from customers to grandfathered contracts in its previous orders,the commission noted that earlier proposals to collect those charges failed to demonstrate that the grandfathered contracts did not already include a mechanism for assessing the administrative charges in dispute.id.in reviewing the transmission owners latest proposal,however,the commission found that the deficiencies in earlier proposals had been addressed and corrected.the transmission owners had,according to ferc,ultimately demonstrated by argument and evidence what they had previously failed to demonstrate the grandfathered agreements did not,in fact,provide a mechanism for the recovery of charges associated with the administration of the miso,which provided new benefits even to customers receiving service governed by grandfathered agreements.the commission further concluded that,because the administration of the miso provided new benefits to these customers,the transmission owners would not run afoul of the federal power act fpa by charging their customers an administrative schedule cost adder this court previously required the owners to pay on their customers behalf.
ferc denied requests to rehear the initial order,reiterating its conclusion that the benefits provided by the miso could not have been provided by the miso transmission owners to the customers of grandfathered agreements prior to the advent of the miso,and,therefore,the costs of providing those benefits,collected under schedule,are separate and distinct from the costs that the transmission owners recover under current provisions of grandfathered agreements.transmission owners of the midwest indep.transmission.operator,ferc,at rehearing order.
we begin our analysis by addressing a jurisdictional challenge asserted by intervenors in support of petitioners.they do not dispute that we have jurisdiction over this matter,but instead argue that ferc lacked jurisdiction to approve schedule,the proposed tariff,because it assesses the miso costs on municipal and cooperative entities not subject to ferc jurisdiction.intervenors br.at.petitioners do not raise this argument.and as we have previously noted,absent extraordinary circumstances,intervenors may join only on a matter that has been brought before the court by a petitioner.cal.dep t of water res.ferc,quoting.mun.distrib.group ferc.although we must address intervenors claim when the issue they raise was preserved in their requests for commission rehearing,see id.at,neither of these intervenors before us filed a petition for review within sixty days after the order of the commission upon the application for rehearing,as required by section b of the fpa,b,and thus have failed to satisfy a statutory requirement to guarantee judicial review of their claim,see cal.dep t of water,at.we may,nevertheless,exercise our discretion to consider intervenors claims,even absent extraordinary circumstances.synovus fin.bd.of governors of fed.res,permitting reviewing court to consider intervenor challenge to agency authority consistent with this court traditionally flexible approach toward appellate procedure.because we believe that intervenors challenge an essential predicate to the issue on review,see id.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted,we consider their jurisdictional argument,but conclude that it is without merit.
as ferc has argued,see respondent br.at,section b of the fpa,b,grants ferc jurisdiction over all rates,terms and conditions of electric transmission service provided by public utilities in interstate commerce,as well as over the sale of electric energy at wholesale.me.pub.util.comm ferc,citations and internal quotation marks omitted.although the fpa exempts certain governmental and entities from ferc regulation,see f as amended by the energy policy act of,c,stat,that exemption applies only to the provision of transmission services by the exempted entity,not to their receipt of services from regulated entities.see initial order at rehearing order at.ferc jurisdiction over services provided by the miso,a public utility providing interstate electric transmission service,does not depend on the identity of the miso customers.as our sister circuit has held,
it would be inconsistent with the policy of the fpa,as well as with certain of its provisions to hold that exempted entities are excluded from the benefits of the regulation of the utilities from which they buy.the entire thrust of part ii of the fpa is toward the seller at wholesale,not the buyer.
