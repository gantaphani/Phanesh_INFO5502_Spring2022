transcontinental gas pipe line transco petitioned the federal energy regulatory commission ferc for approval to transfer some of its pipeline facilities to its affiliate,williams gas processing gulf coast wgp,and to certify that the facilities serve gathering rather than transmission functions.ferc approved the applications in part and denied them in part,and transco and wgp now challenge the portions of the orders that denied the requests,contending that ferc assertion of jurisdiction is contrary to precedent regarding the exemption of gathering facilities under the natural gas act nga,b.a coalition of natural gas producers the producers also petitions the court for review,objecting to those portions of ferc orders that granted the abandonment and reclassification of facilities as gathering for lack of a reasoned determination and as contrary to the public interest.our review of these petitions is instructed by exxonmobil gas marketing ferc,where the court stated that it will defer to ferc reasonable determinations regarding gathering status under nga section b,b.we hold that petitioners fail to demonstrate that ferc choices are unreasonable and its chosen line s of demarcation are not within a zone of reasonableness as distinct from the question of whether the line s are precisely right.exxonmobil,at see conoco ferc.accordingly,we deny the petitions inasmuch as ferc considered the appropriate factors under the primary function test and sufficiently explained its reasoning.
section b of the nga distinguishes between facilities that are used for the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce,which are subject to ferc jurisdiction,and those used for gathering,which are not.b.gathering is generally defined as the process of taking natural gas from the wells and moving it to a collection point for further movement through a pipeline principal transmission system.conoco,at citing northwest pipeline ferc,cir.although t he line between jurisdictional transportation and nonjurisdictional gathering is not always clear,conoco,at,it is central to this case.
since,ferc has used a primary function test to determine whether a facility is devoted to the collection of gas from wells gathering or to the further downstream movement of gas after it has been collected interstate transportation.conoco,at citing farmland,at,wl amerada hess,at,wl.under the primary function test,ferc considers six physical criteria the pipelines length and diameter the central point in the field the facility geographic configuration or pattern the location of compressors and processing plants,particularly where the pipelines are located behind the plant the location of wells along all or part of the facilities and the line operating pressure.exxonmobil,at citing lomak petroleum,ferc.ferc also accounts for certain nonphysical factors,including the facility purpose,location,and operation the pipeline owner general business activity the objectives of the nga and other pertinent legislation and the changing technical and geographic nature of exploration and production activities.exxonmobil,at.no single criterion is dispositive,and not all of the factors apply in all situations.id.citing williams field servs.group,ferc,conoco,at.
ferc initially developed the primary function test for classifying onshore facilities,and it later modified the test in considering the increasing number of pipelines that were being constructed offshore on the gulf of mexico outer continental shelf ocs,where gathering and distribution patterns are somewhat different.exxonmobil,at citing ep operating ferc,cir.because offshore pipelines often must transport raw gas over longer distances,ferc adopted a sliding scale approach that permitted gathering pipelines of greater length and diameter in correlation with distance from shore and water depth.exxonmobil,at citing amerada hess,at.when ferc applied this modified approach in determining that the sea robin pipeline company pipelines were jurisdictional transmission facilities,the fifth circuit reversed,questioning ferc heavy emphasis on the facilities size and on nonphysical factors and inviting ferc to reformulate its primary function test in light of the physical,geographical and operational characteristics of pipelines in the ocs.sea robin pipeline ferc,cir.on remand,ferc determined that the test is not determinative of the gathering question offshore,and that instead it would look at the offshore system configuration to locate a central point where gas is aggregated for transportation onshore.sea robin pipeline,at,wl sea robin ii.ferc explained that this central aggregation point is analogous to the criterion for onshore systems and should be given weight in identifying the demarcation point between gathering and transportation on ocs pipeline systems.id.at.ferc also emphasized that it would focus primarily on physical factors,according only secondary importance to nonphysical factors.sea robin pipeline,at,wl.this court subsequently held that ferc reasonably applied its reformulated primary function test to the sea robin system.exxonmobil,at.
it was against the backdrop of the evolving primary function test and the distinction between jurisdictional transmission and exempt gathering facilities that transco and wgp filed the applications at issue.in the parlance of the oil and gas industry,a spindown occurs when a natural gas transporter transfers operation of its facilities to a gathering affiliate.see conoco,at.in,transco sought ferc authorization,pursuant to nga section b,b,to spin down a number of its facilities to wgp as part of a comprehensive corporate restructuring plan.transco application covered a large number of its facilities on seven different pipeline systems in texas and louisiana and offshore on the ocs.on the same day,wgp petitioned ferc for an order declaring that the facilities it intended to acquire from transco most of which ferc had previously certificated as transmission facilities under section c of the nga were gathering facilities exempt from its jurisdiction under section b.
ferc dismissed the comprehensive application without prejudice.transcon.gas pipe line,at,wl comprehensive order.ferc observed that t he physical parameters of the subject facilities are massive and complex,involving over miles of pipeline,and that the number of facilities included in transco application is without precedent in prior cases.id.footnote omitted.explaining that important differences existed among the many pipelines that transco included in its application,and that,a t the very minimum,large portions of the facilities are clearly properly classified as jurisdictional transmission facilities,id.at,ferc also noted that a decision to grant the requested abandonment in this case could set a precedent for ending nga jurisdiction on the ocs,as it is likely that virtually every similar interstate pipeline on the ocs then would file a similar application.id.at.because n either transco nor wgp included in its pleadings an alternative request that ferc find specific parts of the facilities to be nonjurisdictional,ferc dismissed the comprehensive application while stating that transco and wgp could still file another proposal requesting that ferc consider discrete portions of the facilities to be gathering.id.at.ferc denied the request for rehearing,noting that the parties did not seek to parse the transco facilities rather,they continue d to insist that ferc should find all the facilities at issue to be gathering.transcon.gas pipe line,at,wl comprehensive rehearing order.

transco and wgp contend that ferc erred in rejecting their initial comprehensive application and improperly determined in the proposals that portions of the facilities were transmission rather than gathering.in considering these objections,the court will sustain ferc factual findings if they are supported by substantial evidence,b louisiana ass of indep.producers royalty owners ferc,per curiam,and will set aside ferc actions if they are arbitrary and capricious,motor vehicle mfrs.ass state farm mut.auto.ins,d.the court also applies chevron familiar framework to ferc interpretation of section b of the nga.exxonmobil,at citing chevron,natural res.def.council,d.moreover,the court is mindful that in evaluating and balancing the several factors under the primary function test,ferc brings to bear its considerable expertise about the natural gas industry.conoco,at citations omitted.consequently,t he burden is on the petitioners to show that ferc choices are unreasonable and its chosen line of demarcation is not within a zone of reasonableness as distinct from the question of whether the line drawn by ferc is precisely right.exxonmobil,at citations omitted.
according to transco and wgp,ferc misconstrued the comprehensive application as an all or nothing request in other words,ferc misunderstood transco and wgp as requesting that ferc allow them to abandon and reclassify all of their facilities or none at all.transco and wgp maintain that their filings contained no such contingency.because transco and wgp failed to object to ferc characterization in seeking rehearing,they are precluded from raising this argument here.section b of the nga,b,bars the court from considering on review any objection that was not raised on rehearing,without good cause shown.fed.power comm colorado interstate gas.asarco ferc.transco and wgp sought rehearing,challenging ferc denial of the comprehensive application on a number of grounds,but,despite ferc invitation to clarify that they were making an alternative request that ferc find that some parts of the facilities perform a gathering function,transco and wgp nowhere requested that ferc sever the comprehensive application.having filed a rehearing request that implicitly accepted the comprehensive order understanding,and not having shown good cause for failing to raise their severance argument before the agency,transco and wgp are barred from challenging that understanding before the court.see asarco,at.
ferc therefore was forced either to declare that all of the facilities at issue performed a gathering function or to deny the comprehensive application altogether.in this posture,jurisdiction and merits overlap,for the court must consider the merits of ferc decision that at least one of the facilities performed a transmission function,thereby precluding approval of the petition.ferc decision in the comprehensive order was driven by the primary function analysis ferc considered the relevant factors including pipeline size and length,volume of gas,and water depth and relied on no irrelevant factors.comprehensive order,at nn.transco and wgp contend that ferc was preoccupied with size,without regard to the sliding scale analysis required by ep operating,at.on the contrary,ferc orders demonstrate that ferc was concerned with the transmission function of the pipelines located closest to shore,in the shallowest waters,id.at precisely the type of analysis contemplated by the sliding scale approach,exxonmobil,at citing amerada hess,at.specifically,ferc found that transco and wgp had not adequately explained how existing interstate pipeline facilities that are not located in deep ocs waters,waters in excess of meters,can properly be reclassified as gathering lines under the primary function test.comprehensive order,at.in light of this analysis,it was reasonable for ferc to conclude that,a t the very minimum,large portions of the facilities are clearly properly classified as jurisdictional transmission facilities.id.
regarding two of the three proposals,transco and wgp contend that ferc erred by failing to recognize the physical realities of gathering exhibited by all of the pipelines addressed in the central louisiana order and the north high cameron order,and thus failed properly to apply the modified primary function test for offshore gathering systems.see ep operating,at amerada hess,wl.
transco and wgp contend that the central louisiana order was in error for two primary reasons.first,they claim that ferc neglected to apply amerada hess slidingscale approach,which was designed to allow the use of gathering pipelines of increasing lengths and diameters in correlation to the distance from shore and the water depth of the offshore production area.amerada hess,at.transco and wgp maintain that ferc failed to recognize that the central louisiana system configuration is characteristic of a gathering function,regardless of whether the system is on or offshore,and that the offshore pipelines are longer and larger only because of the distances involved,not because their function is different.second,transco and wgp contend that in concluding that vermilion block marks the central aggregation point at which the offshore lines convert from gathering to transmission,ferc ignored the fact that the offshore pipelines are part of the gathering system,and that the cow island junction is the proper point of central aggregation.
because i t is for ferc,in the first instance,to determine the patterns of gathering and transportation in the offshore context,the court is generally unwilling to review performed by ferc unless a petitioner can demonstrate that lines drawn are patently unreasonable,having no relationship to the underlying regulatory problem.exxonmobil,at quoting cassell fcc.the central louisiana order makes clear that ferc properly considered the facilities diameter sixteen and twenty inches,length miles,and the source of the pipelines pressure from the wellhead,as well as the absence of processing plants which,ferc explained,means little offshore.at.transco and wgp have not carried their burden of showing that ferc determination falls outside of a zone of reasonableness.exxonmobil,at.the court in exxonmobil affirmed ferc use of the test for offshore systems,id.at,and a map of the central louisiana system shows that ferc reasonably concluded that the entire system features two aggregation points one at vermilion block and the other at cow island junction.given the system configuration a system in which many smaller pipelines branch off of a central spine it was permissible for the commission to find that some of the pipelines assume a transmission function when they converge at vermilion block,while others serve a gathering purpose until they reach cow island.at.reasonable people may disagree as to where gathering ends and transportation begins,and this court will not substitute its judgment for a ferc determination that is not patently unreasonable.exxonmobil,at see also conoco,at.
the same deference principles apply to ferc findings in the north high cameron order.this system is shaped like an inverted y with two legs the north high island pipelines to the west and the west cameron pipelines to the east that converge onshore at the station meadows complex.ferc determined that on
