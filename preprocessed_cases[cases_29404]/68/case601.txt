introduction 
after an investigation,a evidentiary hearing before an administrative law judge,and a review by the full california public utilities commission of the state of california the commission,the commission imposed a multimillion dollar fine against pacific bell wireless,llc,doing business as cingular wireless cingular for two interrelated violations of law.first,the commission found cingular policy of charging its customers an early termination fee to cancel a wireless telephone service contract without permitting any type of grace period was an unjust and unreasonable practice,particularly when cingular admitted the best way for customers to decide whether cingular service would work for them was to try the service for some period of time.second,the commission found that cingular failed to disclose to its customers known network problems and misled its customers regarding the wireless network coverage and service,which were also unjust and unreasonable practices.cingular challenges the commission decision and its later order modifying the decision and denying rehearing.
the issues raised by cingular are whether the commission acted without or in excess of its jurisdiction,and whether the commission decisions violate cingular constitutional right to due process.as detailed post,we conclude the commission did not exceed its jurisdiction and did not violate cingular due process rights.therefore,we deny the petition for a writ of review for the following reasons 
cingular first argues the commission decisions are preempted by federal law.we disagree.while the commission is preempted from regulating either rates or the entry of a wireless provider into the market,it is not preempted from regulating other terms and conditions of wireless telephone service.we conclude the imposition of fines and the requirement that cingular refund early termination fees paid by its customers were neither regulation of rates nor regulation of market entry.the principal purposes of the penalties imposed by the commission were to compensate cingular customers and to prevent further misrepresentations by cingular.the effect of the penalties on cingular rates is indirect and incidental.
cingular next argues the commission lacks jurisdiction to directly impose penalties,and was required to institute a lawsuit against cingular in superior court if the commission intended to seek penalties against cingular.again,we disagree.california law permits the commission to levy fines,but denies it the right to independently collect the fines it levies.
cingular also argues the commission could not impose a penalty for failure to disclose under public utilities code section,subdivision a.all further statutory references are to the public utilities code,unless otherwise noted.specifically,cingular argues it is being punished for failing to disclose information already known to its customers,it is being selectively punished,and noncompliance with section can not by itself justify imposition of a penalty.we reject each of these contentions,as detailed post.
cingular argues the imposition of a multimillion dollar fine violates due process,because it could not have known the commission would find cingular actions violated certain statutes and an earlier order of the commission.while the statutes and order are broadly worded,we find no constitutional violation.
finally,cingular argues the commission order that cingular refund early termination fees to its customers is overbroad.in light of the record as a whole,we must reject this argument.
statement of 
cingular sells wireless communication services,handsets,and accessories.pacific bell wireless llc dba cingular wireless,wl,cal.lexis,cingular i.cingular sells its communication services to individual and business customers under a variety of service plans.ibid.
between and,cingular experienced significant growth,both in the number of customers and in the customers use of cingular network as calculated by minutes of use per month.cingular i,supra,wl,cal.lexis at pp.during most of,cingular service suffered in three ways service denied or blocked calls lost or dropped calls and switch congestion.ibid.cingular admitted its growth during this period led to network problems.cingular therefore expended significant sums on network upgrades to increase performance and coverage areas,wl,cal.lexis at.at the same time,however,cingular engineering department was expressing its concerns that the network would be unable to perform adequately,particularly when cingular was in the midst of a marketing campaign to increase the number of subscribers and the usage by those subscribers,wl,cal.lexis at pp.
cingular also admitted it had coverage holes,as do all wireless providers.there was evidence of four types of coverage holes suffered by cingular no signal,coverage is unavailable or service is denied inadequate signal,where the signal is too weak to permit service voice channel,where the number of channels is less than required to handle peak traffic and interference,where one or more signals from other cell cites or users interrupt or degrade a user conversation.cingular i,supra,wl,fn,cal.lexis at,fn.
cingular sales agents at both and stores provided customers and potential customers with inaccurate,incomplete and misleading information regarding cingular service.customers were told cingular provided service in locations where service was not,in fact,available.cingular i,supra,wl,fn,cal.lexis at,fn.customers requesting information regarding coverage areas were provided with rate area maps,wl,cal.lexis at pp.advertisements for cingular service gave the impression that coverage was available in all areas at all times,when it was not,wl,cal.lexis at pp.cingular advertisements also provided misleading information regarding cingular early termination fees discussed more fully post.ibid.
over time,cingular changed its policies regarding the imposition of termination fees and the grace periods included in its service contracts.from january,until may,cingular one and service contracts included an early termination fee etf.cingular i,supra,wl.lexis at.to cancel service contracts before the expiration date,customers were required to pay cingular a etf,and in some cases to pay cingular agents an additional etf of up to,wl.lexis at.during this time,cingular did not provide a grace period during which a customer could cancel a service contract without incurring the etf.ibid.in may,cingular modified its etf to add a formal grace period.ibid.in december,as required by a general order of the commission,cingular extended the grace period to days,wl.lexis at.cingular claims its customers could avoid the etf altogether during any time period either by opting for a option or by purchasing prepaid services.however,cingular first made this argument after the close of the evidentiary record,during oral argument before the commission the appellate record provides no evidentiary support for this argument,wl.lexis at.
both cingular of marketing for the western region and its of external affairs testified the best way for customers to determine whether cingular service would work for them is to try out the phone for a period of time.but a tryout period for a customer was effectively impossible without the customer incurring a penalty until may,because cingular its agents charged an etf from the initial activation date.cingular i,supra,wl.lexis at.although cingular provided evidence that it waived the etf for customers who complained they did not receive the service they expected and had little phone usage,cingular admitted its independent agents might not have waived their separate etf not all customers were made aware that cingular would waive the etf under certain circumstances and there was no way to know how many customers did not try to terminate their service because they were aware of the etf,wl.lexis at.
procedural history 
on september,the commission consumer protection and safety division cpsd sent cingular a letter.the letter directed cingular to immediately stop the practices of misleading consumers as to the availability of service and failing to disclose the existence of the etf.
on june,the commission filed an order instituting investigation oii into whether cingular violated sections,and by failing to provide just and reasonable service,by marketing its products in an unjust and unreasonable manner,or by failing to provide customers with sufficient information on which to make informed choices regarding wireless phone services.the oii summary reads,in relevant part cingular sells mobile telephones bundled with wireless and telephone services.in so doing,cingular makes the implied promise that adequate system coverage and capacity will exist in the subscriber area of use.this promise is then taken some of cingular marketing a disclaimer of warranty.the limitations of cingular system often defeat the customer reasonable expectations of coverage and capacity.the customer,however,may be prevented from canceling cingular service and returning the phones by virtue of a or higher early termination fee etf and other fees which make cancellation more costly than continuing to use the inadequate service.the commission will investigate whether cingular sale of cellular telephone service and equipment,and its collection of the etf and other penalties from consumers,violate the laws of this state or the orders and regulations of this commission.
the oii specifies that among other remedies,the commission would consider whether cingular should be ordered to pay reparations pursuant to public utilities code,refund the etf,plus interest,to all customers who paid such fee upon terminating their service after discovering that the service was inadequate and whether cingular should be fined pursuant to public utilities code and for the violations of the public utilit ies code and related orders,decisions,rules,directions,demands and requirements of the commission.on july,ucan moved to intervene in the proceedings.at the prehearing conference,the administrative law judge alj assigned to the proceeding granted the motion to intervene.
a evidentiary,adjudicatory hearing was conducted in april on september,the alj,acting as the presiding officer,issued a decision ordering cingular to pay penalties and reparations for violating sections,and,and the commission decision re regulation of cellular radiotelephone utilities d,wl.the total penalty assessed against cingular was cingular was also ordered to reimburse customers who had paid all or part of an etf between january,and april.cingular appealed the alj decision to the commission.
on september,the commission issued its decision in cingular i,substantially adopting the alj decision.the commission found cingular had committed two violations of law from january,to april,cingular official no policy constituted an unfair rule resulting in a corporate pattern and practice that failed to provide adequate,just,and reasonable service to customers,in violation of and decision no.and in,cingular failure to disclose to its customers known network problems resulted in a failure to provide adequate,just,and reasonable service,in violation of,and and decision no.cingular i,supra,wl.lexis at.the commission imposed a penalty of per day for the first violation of law,for a total penalty of million,and a penalty of per day for the second violation of law,for a total penalty of million,wl.lexis at pp.the commission also ordered cingular to reimburse the etf charged to its customers between january,and april,and to reimburse the etf charged after april,during the first days of the service contract,wl.lexis at.
on october,cingular applied to the commission for rehearing.on december,the commission issued decision,in which it denied the request for rehearing in most substantial respects.order modifying and denying rehearing of decision,wl.lexis.
discussion 
of appellate review of the commission decisions.
a ny aggrieved party to a decision of the commission may petition for a writ of review in the court of appeal,subd.a.as here,when writ review is the exclusive means of appellate review of a final order or judgment,an appellate court may not deny an apparently meritorious writ petition,timely presented in a formally and procedurally sufficient manner,merely because,for example,the petition presents no important issue of law or because the court considers the case less worthy of its attention than other matters.powers city of richmond cal th,d,fn.omitted.we are not,however,compelled to issue the writ if the commission did not err pacific bell public utilities com.th,d,fn.omitted.
in reviewing the commission decisions,our standard of review is contained in section,subdivisions a and b a no new or additional evidence shall be introduced upon review by the court.in a complaint or enforcement proceeding,or in a ratemaking or licensing decision of specific application that is addressed to particular parties,the review by the court shall not extend further than to determine,on the basis of the entire record which shall be certified by the commission,whether any of the following occurred the commission acted without,or in excess of,its powers or jurisdiction.the order or decision of the commission violates any right of the petitioner under the constitution of the united states or the california constitution.b nothing in this section shall be construed to permit the court to hold a trial de novo,to take evidence other than as specified by the california rules of court,or to exercise its independent judgment on the evidence.at oral argument on appeal,counsel for cingular argued the commission decisions were not supported by the findings,subd.a.that argument was not raised in cingular petition,and we will not address it.
generally,we give presumptive value to a public agency interpretation of a statute within its administrative jurisdiction because the agency may have special familiarity with satellite legal and regulatory issues,leading to expertise expressed in its interpretation of the statute.yamaha of america state bd.of equalization cal th,d.therefore,the puc interpretation of the public utilities code should not be disturbed unless it fails to bear a reasonable relation to statutory purposes and language citation.however,the general rule of deference to interpretations of statutes subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of agencies does not apply when the issue is the scope of the agency jurisdiction.citation.even in cases not questioning the jurisdiction of an agency,the interpretation of statutes is a question of law subject to independent judicial review.citation.pg e public utilities,supra,th,d,fn.omitted.
so,applying these legal principles,these are the questions to be resolved and our answers to them 
were the commission decisions directly or impliedly preempted by federal law no.
does the commission have jurisdiction to impose fines on public utilities under section yes.
can the commission impose a penalty on a public utility for nondisclosure under section,subdivision a yes.
did the imposition of a fine under the circumstances of this case violate cingular due process rights no.
is the existing reparations order overbroad no.
we address each of these issues fully in turn.
the commission decisions are not preempted by title united states code section c a.
cingular argues the commission decisions are preempted by federal law.the party claiming federal preemption bears the burden of establishing it.washington mutual bank superior court th,d.
the federal communications act of,as amended by the omnibus budget reconciliation act of,provides,no state or local government shall have any authority to regulate the entry of or the rates charged by any commercial mobile service or any private mobile service,except that this paragraph shall not prohibit a state from regulating the other terms and conditions of commercial mobile services.c a.cingular claims the commission order that cingular refund the etf to its customers constitutes a regulation of rates.cingular also argues the commission imposed service quality and network performance standards,thus impermissibly regulating the entry of mobile services into the market and regulating rates.three significant cases bear on our determination whether the commission decisions are preempted.
in bastien v.at t wireless services,cir,which cingular contends is directly on point,the plaintiff alleged at t wireless signed up wireless telephone subscribers without first building the cellular towers and other infrastructure necessary to provide reliable cellular connections as a result,many attempts to place calls on at t wireless system were unsuccessful.the plaintiff also alleged at t wireless nevertheless continued marketing its telephones and services in so doing,at t wireless violated its contracts,the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing,and the illinois consumer fraud act.ibid.the court concluded the plaintiff complaint would directly alter the federal regulation of tower construction,location and coverage,quality of service and hence rates for service.id.at.these claims tread directly on the very areas reserved to the fcc federal communications commission the modes and conditions under which at t wireless may begin offering service in the chicago market.the statute makes the fcc responsible for determining the number,placement and operation of the cellular towers and other infrastructure,as well as the rates and conditions that can be offered for the new service.should the state court vindicate the plaintiff claim,the relief granted would necessarily force at t wireless to do more than required by the fcc to provide more towers,clearer signals or lower rates.the statute specifically insulates these fcc decisions from state court review.ibid.the seventh circuit court of appeals concluded the plaintiff claim was preempted by united states code section c a.bastien v.at t wireless services,supra,at.
in contrast,the relief granted by the commission in this case does not require cingular to provide any particular infrastructure or charge any particular rate.it requires cingular to provide full and fair disclosure of its service,and prohibits misrepresentations regarding service.the court in bastien v.at t wireless services,noted the complete absence of any details in the pleading regarding the particular promises or representations made by at t wireless.bastien v.at t wireless services,supra,at.the same can not be said about the commission decisions here,which detail the representations made by cingular and why those representations were false or misleading.
in in re wireless consumers alliance,wl,paragraph,the federal communications commission fcc concluded that united states code section c a does not generally preempt the award of monetary damages by state courts based on state consumer protection,tort,or contract claims.we note,however,that whether a specific damage calculation is prohibited by section will depend on the specific details of the award and the facts and circumstances of a particular case.billing information,practices,and disputes all fall within the other terms and conditions clause of united states code section c a and can be regulated by the commission.in re wireless consumers alliance,supra,at.we find there are several arguments which support our decision that awarding monetary damages is not necessarily equivalent to rate regulation.first,we agree with commenters that there is no necessary correspondence between the indirect effect that monetary liability may have on a company behavior and the direct effect that a statute or regulatory rate requirement will have on that behavior.for example,if a company is found monetarily liable for false advertising,it will presumably alter its advertising.the impact on its prices and other behavior,however,is uncertain.the indirect and uncertain effects of monetary damage awards based on tort and contract law do not correspond to the mandatory corporate actions that are required as a result of legislative or administrative rate regulation activities.id.at,fns.omitted.
the fcc rejected the argument that any determination of monetary liability is equivalent to a finding that the service was inadequate for the price charged and therefore necessarily constitutes a finding that the rates originally charged were unreasonable.in re wireless consumers alliance,supra,at.the fcc also rejected the argument that and consumer fraud claims are in fact disguised attacks on the reasonableness of the rate charged for the service.a carrier may charge whatever price it wishes and provide the level of service it wishes,as long as it does not misrepresent either the price or the quality of service.conversely,a carrier that is charging a reasonable rate for its services may still be subject to damages for a or false advertising claim under applicable state law if it misrepresents what those rates are or how they will apply,or if it fails to inform consumers of other material terms,conditions,or limitations on the service it is providing.we thus do not agree with those commenters who allege that,for consumer protection claims,any damage award or damage calculation,including any refund or rebate,is necessarily a ruling on the reasonableness of the price or the functional equivalent of a retroactive rate adjustment.id.at,fns.omitted.
the fcc concluded that the incidental effect on prices resulting from imposition of a damage award did not constitute regulation of rates,citing nader allegheny airlines,d.in the matter of wireless consumers alliance,supra,at see also cellular telecommunications industry fcc.the fcc noted that a court would overstep its authority in determining damages under united states code section c a if it purports to determine the reasonableness of a prior rate or it sets a prospective charge for services.in re wireless consumers alliance,supra,at.
finally,the fcc distinguished bastien v.at t wireless services,supra,which had been decided five months earlier.the fcc concluded the court in bastien had not decided the question whether an award of monetary damages is equivalent to impermissible ratemaking under united states code section c a,and stood only for the general propositions that state law claims may or may not be preempted by united states code section c a and that it is the substance,not the form,of the claim that determines whether it is preempted.in re wireless consumers alliance,supra,at.
in spielholz superior court th,d,the petitioner sued her wireless telephone provider for false advertising,alleging that the wireless company advertised a seamless calling area throughout southern california,but failed to disclose gaps or dead zones where users were unable to connect calls.the trial court struck all allegations for monetary relief,concluding that for the court to award damages or restitution based on false advertising it must determine the value of the services provided,and that that determination would constitute rate regulation within the meaning of united states code section c a and therefore is expressly preempted.id.at,d.the court of appeal stayed the proceedings on the petition for writ of mandate pending the fcc declaratory ruling in in the matter of wireless consumers alliance,supra.spielholz superior court,supra,th at,d.
the spielholz court summarized the law on preemption under united states code section c a following in re wireless consumers alliance,supra,a judicial act constitutes rate regulation only if its principal purpose and direct effect are to control rates.for example,an injunction that prevents a wireless telephone service provider from charging specified rates would directly regulate rates.citations.similarly,if a cause of action directly challenges a rate as unreasonable,an award of damages or restitution to compensate a customer for the difference between the rate paid and what the court determines to be a reasonable rate would directly regulate rates.citations.in general,a claim that directly challenges a rate and seeks a remedy to limit or control the rate prospectively or retrospectively is an attempt to regulate rates and therefore is preempted under united states code section c a a claim that directly challenges some other activity,such as false advertising,and requires a determination of the value of services provided in order to award monetary relief is not rate regulation.spielholz superior court,supra,th at,d.
the spielholz court then concluded,a claim that does not directly challenge the rate but directly challenges some other activity,such as false advertising,and seeks a remedy to limit or control that activity or seeks damages arising from the activity is not an attempt to regulate rates and is not expressly preempted under united states code section c a.if the principal purpose and direct effect of a remedy are to prevent false advertising and compensate an aggrieved customer,any prospective or retrospective effect on rates is merely incidental.this is true even if the court determines the value of services provided in awarding damages or restitution.citation.contrary to at t argument,an award of damages or restitution for false advertising that requires the court to determine the value of services provided is not rate regulation.citation.spielholz superior court,supra,th at,d.the court disagreed with the holding in bastien v.at t wireless services,supra,that a challenge to service quality necessarily attacks the reasonableness of rates approved by the fcc.spielholz superior court,supra,at,d.
we conclude the commission decisions in this case were not preempted by united states code section c a.the commission decisions do not directly challenge cingular rates,nor do they require cingular to make any specific changes to its infrastructure.as in spielholz superior court,the commission challenge to the etf and to cingular policy of permitting no grace period,combined with the misrepresentations regarding service,is not a preempted regulation of rates or of market entry.the principal purpose and direct effect of the penalties imposed by the commission are to prevent misrepresentations by cingular and to compensate the wireless customers who paid etf.the effect of these penalties on cingular rates is incidental,and the commission decisions are therefore not preempted by united states code section c a 
cingular also argues the commission decisions are impliedly preempted because they are an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress hines davidowitz.in spielholz superior court,supra,th at pages,d,the appellate court concluded the availability of state law remedies for false advertising was consistent with congress objective to achieve maximum benefits for wireless consumers,citing in re wireless consumers alliance,supra,paragraphs and.here,too,the penalties and disgorgement ordered by the commission were consistent with congress intent to maximize benefits to consumers.we conclude the doctrine of implied preemption is inapplicable in this case.
the commission has jurisdiction under section to impose penalties on public utilities.
cingular argues the commission lacks jurisdiction to impose a penalty and was required to commence the action in the superior court,pursuant to sections and 
no published california case has addressed this issue.the courts of this state have held that the powers of the commission within its province are broad.as our supreme court has explained the commission is a state agency of constitutional origin with duties,functions and powers.citation.the constitution confers broad authority on the commission to regulate utilities,including the power to fix rates,establish rules,hold various types of hearings,award reparation,and establish its own procedures.citation.the commission powers,however,are not restricted to those expressly mentioned in the constitution the legislature has plenary power,unlimited by the other provisions of this constitution but consistent with this article,art.xii to confer additional authority and jurisdiction upon the commission citation.pursuant to this grant of power the legislature enacted public utilities code section,conferring on the commission expansive authority to do all things,whether specifically designated in the public utilities act or addition thereto,which are necessary and convenient in the supervision and regulation of every public utility in california the commission authority has been liberally construed.citations.additional powers and jurisdiction that the commission exercises,however,must be cognate and germane to the regulation of public utilities citations.consumers lobby against monopolies public utilities com.cal d.
the commission itself has consistently determined that it has the authority to directly impose fines on public utilities,and that it is required to commence an action in superior court only to collect unpaid fines.see.order denying rehearing of decision.lexis,re communications telesystems international d,fn,wl toward utility rate normalization turn pacific bell d,wl.the commission interpretation of its own statutory authority should not be disturbed unless it fails to bear a reasonable relation to statutory purposes and language citation.pg e public utilities,supra,th at,d.
the legislative histories of sections and support the commission interpretation of its authority to directly impose penalties on the public utilities within its jurisdiction.when section was amended in to increase the maximum level of fines,the report of the assembly committee on utilities and commerce included the following comments the california public utilities commission cpuc is responsible for regulating the rates and services of public utilities and related businesses the cpuc has broad authority to levy appropriate fines in the course of its business pu code section.that broad authority is supplemented by additional specific fine authority of up to for each violation or compliance failure by any public utility,corporation,or person with cpuc regulations and orders.this bill raises the maximum fine from to.the cpuc must go to the superior court to collect any fines which are levied.such fines are paid into the general fund.assem.com.on utilities and commerce,on bill reg.sess.june.quite clearly,the legislature believed the commission had the authority to levy fines,but not the authority to collect those fines without court intervention if they were not paid voluntarily.
when section was amended later the same year,specifically to encourage greater compliance with the commission by cellular telephone companies,the analysis of the assembly committee included the following comments the cpuc already has broad authority to levy fines and penalties on public utilities.specifically,section of the public utilities code provides for fines of up to for each violation of any provision of any order,decision,rule,or requirement of the cpuc.assem.com.on utilities and commerce,analysis of bill reg.sess.july.
we believe the commission interpretation of sections and,giving it authority to directly impose fines on public utilities,is the correct one.an action to recover penalties under section presupposes a penalty has been levied or imposed.the only reasonable interpretation of the statute is that it requires the commission to go to court to collect the fines it has imposed if those fines are not paid voluntarily.requiring the commission to commence an action in superior court every time it believed a fine against a public utility might be warranted is inconsistent with the statutes and would impose undue burdens on the commission and the judicial system,supra.lexis at pp.therefore,we conclude the commission had jurisdiction to impose a penalty on cingular.
the commission did not err by relying,in part,on section to punish cingular for its nondisclosures and misleading statements.
cingular contends section can not serve as the basis for the nondisclosure penalty because cingular is being punished for failing to disclose what its customers already knew,namely,that cell phones do not work everywhere and that wireless networks can not always connect calls cingular should not have been selectively punished under a statute applicable to all telecommunications companies and section alone can not be the basis for imposition of a penalty.
section,subdivision a,provides the commission shall require telephone corporations to provide customer service to telecommunication customers that includes,but is not limited to,all the following a sufficient information upon which to make informed choices among telecommunications services and providers.this includes,but is not limited to,information regarding the provider identity,service options,pricing,and terms and conditions of service.a provider need only provide information to its customers on the services which it offers.
in cingular i,the commission concluded were cingular disclosure practices a violation of law weighing evidence on the recognized imperfections in wireless systems generally against evidence of the scope of cingular known network problems in,including its inability to meet its own internal measurement standards at times,we find that cingular coverage disclosures were insufficient to permit customers to make informed choices about whether to contract for its services.this failure does not meet the just and reasonable service mandate of,and can not meet an objective interpretation of the duty owed to customers under subdivision a.cingular i,supra,wl.lexis at,fn.omitted.
the commission decisions address a failure to provide information of far greater significance than that cell phones do not work everywhere and that all calls are not connected on the first try.cingular provided prospective customers with rate area maps,not coverage maps,and its agents provided customers with misleading information regarding coverage.cingular i,supra,wl.lexis at pp.the public general knowledge about the limitations of wireless telephone service can not make up for cingular misleading information,about which the record contains substantial supporting evidence.and,contrary to cingular assumption that the limitations of wireless telephone service are well known to cell phone users,robert zicker,the telecommunications expert for cpsd and ucan,testified i participated in a number of focus groups and in those focus groups the people that i monitored and spoke with expected their wireless phone to work wherever they were,whenever they wanted it to.that is their expectation.it may be unrealistic to you,but to them it was.so i believe it is what the public is believing should and could be available to them.
cingular also argues,i mposing a special disclosure obligation upon cingular and only cingular for unspecified network problems that may or may not be any different than those of any other provider can not possibly provide a consumer with useful knowledge so as to distinguish cingular services from anyone else.this argument is easily resolved.whether other wireless companies suffered from the same network problems as cingular in does not negate cingular obligation to provide accurate,meaningful information to its customers and potential customers.had cingular informed its customers and potential customers about its network problems,those customers and potential customers might have chosen to obtain wireless service from another provider,or might have chosen not to obtain any service at all.but that is pure speculation.the commission has discretion to establish enforcement priorities.see generally people cimarusti d.pursuing an investigation and imposing penalties against one company but not others for the same act are not constitutional violations unless it can be shown the investigating agency purposefully and intentionally singled out the one company for disparate treatment on an invidiously discriminatory basis.murgia municipal court cal d,in re ratti d,wl.that has not been shown here.
we need not address cingular argument that section alone can not be the basis for the imposition of a penalty,because the commission imposed the penalties it did based on cingular violation of section as well as section.
cingular argument that imposition of a penalty under section violated due process is subsumed in the discussion,post.
the commission decisions do not violate cingular constitutional right to due process.
cingular contends it was denied due process because it was punished for actions it could not have known were unjust and unreasonable.cingular argues the statutes and the commission order it is charged with violating are so broad that cingular could not anticipate that its actions were unjust and unreasonable.in analyzing cingular argument,we must focus on its conduct of charging and permitting its agents to charge an etf with no grace period failing to disclose known,significant network problems and providing misleading and inaccurate information regarding its coverage and service to its customers.we conclude that given this conduct,cingular could be charged with knowledge that its actions were unjust and unreasonable under the relevant statutes and the commission order.even in the absence of a specific statute,rule,or order barring the imposition of an etf without a grace period,or barring the specific nondisclosures identified by the commission in this case,cingular can be charged with knowing its actions violated section requirement that it provide adequate,efficient,just,and reasonable service to its customers.
to accept cingular argument would require us to conclude that it is just and reasonable for a wireless provider to charge its customers an etf to cancel a wireless service contract immediately after activation of the wireless telephone,when the customer has been misled as to the coverage area and level of service,and when the wireless provider admits the best way for the customer to determine whether the service is adequate for his or her needs is to try out the phone for a period of time.this conclusion would be unreasonable.
fair notice is an essential requirement of any statutory scheme.it is a basic principle of due process that an enactment is void for vagueness if its prohibitions are not clearly defined.vague laws offend several important values.first,because we assume that man is free to steer between lawful and unlawful conduct,we insist that laws give the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited,so that he may act accordingly.vague laws may trap the innocent by not providing fair warning.grayned city of rockford,d,fn.omitted.cingular contends it was not on notice that its etf policy was unjust or unreasonable,or its network service performance required disclosure to its customers and potential customers,or that its failure to make such disclosures could result in the imposition of significant fines by the commission.
the statutes and the commission order that cingular was found to have violated are broadly written the commission interpretation of the reach of sections,and,as well as of its own earlier order,must be given presumptive value.yamaha of america state bd.of equalization,supra,cal th at,d.
if no statute or order of the commission specifically prohibits the conduct for which cingular was fined,how could it have notice that this conduct would violate section first,cingular could reasonably discern from the commission interpretations of section that its conduct in this instance would also violate that statute.see,higginbotham pacific bell telephone company,wl substituting less accurate and less convenient means of obtaining local toll pricing information without a compelling reason is unreasonable and violates section case originally filed while cingular provided misleading information regarding service,and provided no grace period for etf office of ratepayer advocates pacific bell telephone company.two violations of section increase in average time to restore dial tone service,and failure to notify customers of the availability of a appointment window when calling repair service case filed in utility consumers action network pacific bell,wl misleading or potentially misleading marketing tactics violate section,particularly sales tactics regarding caller id plans,inside wire maintenance plans,and marketing service plans by offering them in descending price order without fully disclosing all available options in the plans case filed in first financial network pacific bell d,public utility violates section by providing customer with far more than necessary in equipment and service corona city council southern california gas company d,wl public utility violated section by closing branch offices with inadequate notice and without reasonable alternative services available.proposed decision of alj meaney.employee discount that is part of public utility tariffs may nevertheless violate section if it is excessive national communications center pt t d section requires telephone utility to provide all available and accurate information as those customers may require to make an intelligent choice between similar services where such a choice exists hidden valley west sdg e,wl failure to return money paid for estimated projects in excess of actual cost violates section.these cases deal with a variety of different acts and omissions by many types of public utilities.from a reading of these cases as well as many others not cited here and their rationale,cingular was on notice that the commission would determine cingular actions here violated sections,and.
the marketplace also informed cingular the totality of its acts and omissions was not just and reasonable,and it was not providing sufficient information to its customers.the record in this case is replete with complaints from cingular customers,including complaints specific to the failure of cingular service to perform as promised.indeed,the record shows the purpose of the imposition of the etf was to prevent churn having customers cancel their service and obtain service from a competitor.while some churn experienced by cingular like that of its competitors was due to better deals or offers by other wireless providers,the record reflects that some churn was due to the failure of cingular wireless service to perform as promised.and while it is undisputed that all wireless providers suffer some system failures and can not guarantee coverage at all times in all locations,the record shows cingular california region was the only major wireless provider in the california market and the only cingular region to impose an etf without a grace period.
finally,we find no appreciable difference between the application of sections,and in this case,and the application of civil code sections and in what we may refer to as a garden variety fraud case.the civil code does not define what conduct is deceitful,or what types of misrepresentations or omissions are material.those decisions are left to the trier of fact,based on the facts of the particular case.a defendant can be found to have committed fraud based on misrepresentations or omissions that are not specified in any statute,and can be ordered to pay significant sums in compensatory and punitive damages as a result.
cingular contends that section can only be used to impose a retroactive fine in conjunction with another more specific source of law while in most of the cases which the parties have cited on appeal,there was another violation of law,we do not infer from this that there must be another statute or rule or order of the commission that has been violated for the commission to determine there has been a punishable violation of section in at least one case,carey pacific gas and electric company,supra,d,the commission fined the public utility for violating section without finding a violation of any other specific statute by failing to furnish and maintain such adequate,efficient,just and reasonable service,instrumentalities,equipment and facilities when the utility permitted fumigators to turn off gas service to buildings before tenting them.
cingular also argues section prohibits imposition of fines on a retroactive basis.section,which requires the commission to determine just and reasonable rates when it finds that the rates charged were unreasonable,does not apply here.as noted ante,this is not a case.even by analogy,section does not apply because while requiring prospective action,it does not prohibit retroactive punishment for imposition of unreasonable rates.
cingular is in essence arguing it had no way of knowing it was neither just nor reasonable to charge an etf of and permit its agents to charge an additional etf of up to,from the first day after initiating a customer service,when it admitted the best way for the customer to determine whether cingular service would work for him or her was to try the phone out or fail to disclose to its customers and potential customers that its network was straining under the weight of new customers and increased usage,and incorrectly identify rate area maps as coverage maps.we find no error in the commission conclusion that cingular knew or reasonably should have known those actions on its part were neither just nor reasonable.a company action can be unjust or unreasonable without a specific rule or statute prohibiting it.as the commission stated in cingular i,n o utility,whether one operating in a more traditional,tariffed environment,or one operating in a partially deregulated environment,should expect to be insulated from the obligation to treat its customers fairly.cingular i,supra,wl.lexis at pp.as the united states supreme court has held,o bjections to vagueness under the due process clause rest on the lack of notice,and hence may be overcome in any specific case where reasonable persons would know that their conduct is at risk.maynard cartwright,d.
we also reject cingular argument that the commission did not give it sufficient notice of the possibility a fine would be imposed against it.cingular raised the same argument before the commission.the commission made the following findings and conclusions regarding this argument in cingular i cingular also contends that neither the september,cease and desist letter nor the june,oii provide actual notice that cingular etf policy might be held unreasonable for lack of a trial or grace period.we disagree.both documents clearly constitute notice that the commission was receiving consumer complaints about cingular imposition of an etf,and that the complaints put at issue the legality of the practice.as cingular admits,the etf was imposed without any grace period until may,when cingular revised its corporate policy to permit a trial during which service could be cancelled and a phone could be returned without incurring an etf.thus until cingular changed its etf policy in,cingular imposition of an etf necessarily meant imposition of an etf without a trial.cingular i,supra,wl.lexis at.we conclude this interpretation of the letter and the oii is correct.
the reparations order is neither overbroad nor in conflict with the findings of fact and conclusions of law.
in addition to the fines imposed,the commission ordered cingular to refund the etf paid by its customers between january,and april.cingular i includes the following conclusion of law in order to avoid unjust enrichment to cingular and provide reasonable reparation to as many deserving customers as possible,cingular should be required to reimburse,with interest,those customers who paid cingular or its agents partial or full etfs for early cancellations of contracts entered into between january,and april.cingular also should be required to reimburse,with interest,any customers who paid cingular or its agents partial or full etfs after april,for early contract cancellations that occurred between day and day of the contract period.cingular should prepare and file a refund plan in conformance with today decision.cingular i,supra,wl.lexis at.the commission later modified the reparations order to provide,cingular need not pay reparations to customers for whom the etf was waived or who have already received etf refunds from cingular or its agents.order modifying and denying rehearing of decision,supra,wl.lexis at.
cingular argues that despite the modification,the reparations order is still overbroad in two respects.first,cingular contends that,during the period from january,through april,it should only have to refund etf to those customers who cancelled their contracts within the first days.this argument presupposes that because the reparations period selected by the commission ended on the day cingular formally instituted a grace period,the commission has permitted cingular to charge an etf after the day from initiation of service.the commission did not make such a finding i
