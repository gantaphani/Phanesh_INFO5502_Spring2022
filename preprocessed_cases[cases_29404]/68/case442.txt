this case involves a recurring issue under the open access policies of order of the federal energy regulatory commission ferc regarding the extent to which utilities should receive compensation for the use of their transmission facilities for services provided in concert with other transmission providers.see transmission access policy study group ferc taps,aff sub nom.new york ferc,d.east texas electric cooperative,and two of its member utilities together,east texas petition for review of orders accepting southwest power pool spp procedure for allocating network transmission revenue among its member utilities.southwest power pool,wl initial order order on rehearing,southwest power pool,wl rehearing order.east texas challenges ferc conclusion that the allocation procedure is fair and just,claiming that it is unduly discriminatory to require a showing of integration only by small transmission owners such as east texas in order to receive revenue allocations for the use of its facilities by spp.east texas also contends that ferc finding that east texas is a customer,and thus not integrated with spp transmission system,is unsupported by substantial evidence in the record.we deny the petition with regard to the integration standard but grant the petition because of a lack of any valid finding that east texas facilities are not integrated with spp transmission system.
east texas is a generation and transmission electric cooperative located in texas with three members,two of which,northeast texas electric cooperative and electric cooperative of texas,are also petitioners.spp is a power pool that provides electric transmission services on behalf of its members pursuant to its regional tariff.the spp came into existence as a regional reliability council.spp,at,wl.according to ferc,east texas was a participant in spp prior to spp proposed amendments to the regional tariff.east texas seeks to recover the costs of its transmission facilities from spp network customers should it participate in spp regional tariff.
in order,ferc required all jurisdictional utilities to offer network services to any customers which agreed to pay set tariffs under its open access tariff policy.promoting wholesale competition through open access nondiscriminatory transmission servs.by pub,order,ferc stats.regs,at,fed.reg.order,on reh g,order,ferc stats.regs.at order,clarified,on reh g,order,wl,fed.reg,on reh g,order,wl,aff sub nom.taps.in doing so,ferc addressed whether those customers would be entitled to credits from the utility based on any benefits that the utility might receive from the customer transmission facilities.order,at.while ferc committed itself to a determination,it warned that mere interconnection between a customer facilities and the transmission provider facilities will not be sufficient to warrant a cost credit.taps,at.ferc thus required the customer to demonstrate that its transmission facilities are integrated with the transmission system of the transmission provider and provide additional benefits to the transmission grid in terms of capability and reliability,and are relied upon for coordinated operation of the grid.id.at quoting order,at alteration in original.
it was in this context that spp took a further step toward compliance with order and its progeny when,on september,it filed an amendment to its open access transmission tariff,its regional tariff to add network integration service.previously,spp offered only transmission service,service that extends between specified points of receipt of electricity onto the transmission grid and specified points of delivery of the electricity from the grid.see taps,at spp,at.under that service,thirteen spp members had agreed to participate in the regional tariff and,thus,to pool their resources,average their costs,and share revenues with members participating in the particular transaction.at.by contrast,under network service all of the electricity demand or load needed by a particular customer will be met by the transmission provider from available generators or other power sources on the grid as needed.taps,at.as part of the amendment to its regional tariff,spp included a new membership agreement to administer network transmission service and to act as an agent for the participating transmission owners.initial order,at.spp proposed to use each member utility annual transmission revenue requirement as the basis for zonal network rates,id.at,and that revenues for all network service would generally be allocated to the host zone where the load is located.id.at.under spp proposal,all network revenues would therefore be allocated among transmission owners designated in certain schedules of the regional tariff as the hosts of pricing zones.payments by a customer would be transferred to the utility or utilities whose host zone contains the location where the load is allocated,the location where the customer receives the electricity.
east texas filed a protest that included a challenge to spp procedure for allocating network revenues from customers who took network service from spp.it argued that spp procedure was unfair because transmission facilities that east texas owned that were located in spp service area could not receive any revenues for network services provided by spp even if east texas signed the membership agreement and allowed spp to use its facilities,it would not necessarily be listed as a pricing host zone.according to east texas,this unfairly discriminated against it,and undermined the incentive for small transmission owners to join regional transmission groups such as spp,contrary to ferc policy of encouraging the creation of regional groups that contain all transmission systems within a geographic area.see reg l transmission,order,ferc stats.regs.at,fed.reg,on reh g,order,ferc stats.regs,fed.reg.codified at order.spp and two of spp responded that east texas facilities are not integrated into the spp system and do not provide any benefit to the spp system by increasing the reliability or effectiveness of the system.further,they maintained,east texas could obtain compensation for any use of its transmission systems by filing for customer credits pursuant to section of the regional tariff.section provides that network customers owning facilities that are integrated with spp system may be eligible to receive consideration either through a billing credit or some other mechanism.under section integrated means integrated into the plans or operations of a transmission owner to serve the owner customers.
in the initial order,ferc stated that 
east texas cooperatives opposition is limited to the fact that as owners of transmission facilities,they should be treated comparably to other transmission owners that make up the pricing zones.their argument that it is discriminatory to only require small transmission owners to make a showing under section of the tariff ignores that fact that the large transmission owners currently provide grid transmission service.the issue of whether and to what extent east texas cooperatives transmission facilities are integrated with csw a spp member is currently being litigated in duquesne light,docket,wl ferc.consequently,acceptance here of the east texas cooperatives position would prejudice the outcome of that hearing.therefore,we will accept for filing spp treatment of revenues,subject to the outcome of the ongoing litigation.
id.at.in seeking rehearing,east texas argued that section was inapplicable and docket,in which the factual question of integration sufficient for a customer credit was being litigated,involved different parties and different issues.
in the rehearing order ferc reaffirmed its approval of spp revenue allocation procedure,but revised its reasoning.at.ferc stated that in the initial order it had generally agreed with spp and its responding members,again noting that east texas opposition was limited to wanting to be treated the same as the large transmission owners that spp has designated as pricing zones.id.at.at this point,referring to its initial order,ferc stated that
