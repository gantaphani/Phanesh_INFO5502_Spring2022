edison electric institute eei petitions for review of a compliance directive issued by the occupational safety and health administration in.we conclude that because the directive did not promulgate a new occupational safety or health standard under the occupational safety and health act,but rather merely reiterated a preexisting standard,this court lacks jurisdiction over eei petition for review.
the occupational safety and health act of osh act authorizes the secretary of labor,through the occupational safety and health administration osha,to ensure safe and healthful working conditions by creating and enforcing mandatory occupational safety and health standards.b,b.in,osha promulgated a general industry standard for control of hazardous energy.see uaw osha.osha exempted electric utilities from the general standard,promising to propose in the near future a standard to meet the special safety needs of that industry.fulfilling that promise in,osha promulgated the electric power generation,transmission,and distribution standard,power generation standard or standard,specifically to protect maintenance workers in electric power generation plants from being injured or killed by the accidental activation of equipment while they are servicing it.
the power generation standard requires electric power plants to establish hazardous energy control protocols known as procedures.under these procedures,a worker must shut down the equipment and place a lock or tag on the energy isolating device or control switch before commencing repairs.d iv.a lock is a mechanical device that keeps the equipment from being energized until the lock is removed.a tag is a warning placed to caution others not to operate the device.after the maintenance is completed,the worker removes the lock or tag and reenergizes the equipment.id.d iv.
this case primarily concerns two further elements of the power generation standard the group servicing provision,d ii,and the system operator exception,id d v.the group servicing provision applies when servicing or maintenance is performed by a group of workers.id.d ii.it requires each employee in the group to affix a personal lockout or tagout device to a group lockout device or comparable mechanism when he or she begins work,and to remove those devices when he or she stops working.id.d ii d.the system operator exception to the general requirements of the power generation that when energy isolating devices are installed in a central location and are under the exclusive control of a system operator,the system operator may place and remove lockout and tagout devices in place of the employee doing the repair work.id.d v.
eei is a national association of electric utility companies.many of eei members generate,transmit,and distribute electricity,and are therefore subject to the power generation standard.soon after osha promulgated that standard in,eei filed a petition for review in the eleventh circuit.eei was particularly concerned that the standard limits the system operator exception to situations where energy isolat ing devices are installed in a central location and are under the exclusive control of a system operator.pet r br.at quoting d v.eei eventually withdrew its petition for review,however,see edison inst.osha,cir,dismissing petition for review,and entered into negotiations with osha over the terms of a forthcoming osha compliance directive concerning the power generation standard,pet r br.at.
in,osha issued that directive,osha directive cpl a,directive.in its discussion of the group servicing provision,the directive refers to an earlier osha directive that offers examples of group procedures that would comply with the general industry energy control standard.according to the directive,those sample procedures can be used to comply with the group servicing provision of the power generation standard as well.directive at.the earlier directive provides several alternatives for having employees affix personal devices in a group setting,including procedures involving master lockboxes and master tags.osha directive std,at to.the directive states that those sample procedures are intended as examples only,and that o ther means of meeting the standard may also be used.directive at.
on several occasions after the publication of the directive,eei and its members urged osha to interpret the power generation standard to permit supervisors,rather than individual maintenance workers,to control locks and tags during group servicing.in a june letter to osha,eei stated its understanding that individual worker control of locks and tags is not required by the standard group servicing provision,and that supervisor control is adequate as long as the supervisor accounts for each crew member and notifies each member before reenergizing the equipment.letter from charles kelly,eei,to richard fairfax,osha june.osha responded in an october letter that eei understanding was wrong,and that each employee in the group needs to be able to affix personal device as part of the group lockout.letter from fairfax to kelly at,quoting.v erbal accountability steps,osha said,are not equivalent to each employee placing a personal device on a group mechanism.id.eei filed a petition for review of that letter in this court,asserting that the letter amended the standard in the same way that it asserts the directive at issue in this case does.once again,however,eei withdrew its petition.see edison inst.dol,dismissing petition for review.
in,osha issued a citation to exelon generating,an eei member,for violating the power generation standard by permitting a supervisor to verbally notify individual crew members of the application and removal of devices from a master tag,rather than requiring each employee to affix and remove a personal lock or tag from the master tag.exelon defended on the ground that its method complied with the standard,as the eei letter had asserted.an administrative law judge alj rejected that argument.exelon generating,oshrc docket,cch.at the time of eei petition to this court,exelon petition for review was pending before the occupational safety and health review commission oshrc 
despite osha continued refusal to adopt eei interpretation of the power generation standard,eei persisted.in february,eei wrote osha two more letters,again arguing that supervisor control of locks and tags during group servicing complies with the power generation standard.in addition,eei contended that the system operator exception applies regardless of whether the system operator has exclusive physical control over the energy isolating device,so long as the system operator is the only person authorized to use the device.letter from kelly to charles jeffress,osha,letter from kelly to fairfax.osha november,reply again disagreed with both points.in response to the latter contention,osha noted that the exception permitting a system operator to place and remove lockout and tagout devices applies only when the energy isolating devices are in a central location under the exclusive control of the system operator,and that central location means a location to which access is physically limited to one or more persons acting as a system operator during the servicing operation.letter from jeffress to kelly at.
on june,osha issued the compliance directive at issue in this case.the directive expressly rejects eei views of the power generation standard group servicing provision.it states 
group procedures must assure that each individual is the only person who can release his or her personal lockout device,personal tagout device,or equivalent means of controlling hazardous energy sources.procedures that rely solely on visual or audible means of accounting for employees are not acceptable.
osha directive cpl,at june,directive.the directive also rejects eei understanding of the system operator exception,expressly defining the term central control location under the exclusive control of a system operator as 
an area to which access by employees,other than the system operator,to energy isolating devices is physically limited to a person s acting as a system operator during the maintenance or servicing operation.the system operator has complete control over the hazardous energy sources because no other employees have access to the area and its energy control devices.
id.at.finally,the directive defines the term personal tagout devices as 
prominent warning devices,secured to energy isolating devices in accordance with an established procedure that uniquely identify each employee performing the activity and that indicate that the energy isolating device s,and the machines or equipment being controlled,can not be operated until the personal tagout device is removed.
on september,eei filed a petition for review in this court.eei challenges the directive on the following grounds,among others that osha issued it without following the requirements applicable to occupational safety standards under the osh act,see b that the directive is unsupported by substantial evidence in the record,see id.f and that the directive is arbitrary and capricious,see.before we may consider the merits of eei challenges,however,we must first determine whether we have jurisdiction to entertain its petition for review.
the osh act provides that any person adversely affected by an occupational safety or health standard,b,may,at any time prior to the sixtieth day after such standard is promulgated,file a petition challenging the validity of the standard in an appropriate court of appeals,id.f.the osh act defines an occupational safety and health standard as a standard which requires conditions,or the adoption or use of one or more practices reasonably necessary or appropriate to provide safe places of employment.id.if an osha rule does not amount to an occupational safety or health standard,this court does not have jurisdiction to review it.see chamber of commerce united states dep t of labor,distinguishing between a standard and a regulation for purposes of jurisdiction under the osh act workplace health safety council reich,same.challenges to rules that are not occupational safety and health standards must be filed in federal district court pursuant to the administrative procedure act,see reich,at,although other considerations may preclude immediate review in that court as well,see sturm,ruger chao.
in addition,we have indicated that we lack jurisdiction to review an osha rule unless it is a new standard.chamber of commerce,at.the jurisdictional requirement that the standard be not simply the reiteration of an existing supported by a number of rationales.textually,it would be a stretch to say that a rule that merely restates an existing standard requires conditions,or the adoption or use of one or more practices,as the definition of standard provides.emphasis added.in such a circumstance,it is the existing standard,not the reiteration,that compels employer practices.and it would be an even greater textual stretch to say that an osha rule that merely restates an earlier standard promulgate s that standard,as required by the jurisdictional language of f.independent equip.dealers ass epa,holding that,because the epa letter does not reflect any change in epa regulations or its interpretation of those regulations,it is difficult to see how that letter promulgat ed or revis ed any regulation alterations in original.again,the better reading is that a standard is promulgated only when it is originally issued.
moreover,to permit review whenever osha reiterates the requirements of a is what osha contends it did in the directive as well as in the directive and in the correspondence with eei would circumvent f requirement that any petition for review be filed prior to the sixtieth day after such standard is promulgated.if the directive is no different from the power generation standard,then eei should have petitioned for review in.indeed,eei did file a petition for review that year,but voluntarily withdrew it.if osha is correct that it has not changed its position since it promulgated the power generation standard,then to permit review now would allow eei to avoid the consequences of its failure to adhere to the congressionally prescribed jurisdictional window of f.see independent equip.dealers,at just as it would be folly to allow parties to challenge a regulation anew each year upon the annual of the code of federal regulations,so too it is silly to permit parties to challenge an established regulatory interpretation each time it is repeated.see also general motors epa,holding that a challenge to agency letters reiterating the agency consistently held position was untimely molycorp,epa,same.
the parties do not dispute that our jurisdiction depends upon whether the directive establishes new obligations beyond those imposed by the power generation standard.see oral arg.tape at.as might be expected,however,each has a different view as to the directive novelty.osha contends that the directive does not impose any new or independent obligations,resp.br.at,and that it is a mere restatement of osha position on the energy control provisions of the power generation standard,id.at.eei,by contrast,insists that the directive states new and revised mandatory and enforceable requirements,pet r br.at,and thereby substantively amends the standard,id.at.
in the following part we consider whether the directive is as osha contends merely old wine in a new bottle,or as eei insists a new vintage altogether.
the heart of eei argument is that the directive alters the power generation standard group servicing provision by requiring each employee to take a physical step,such as personally affixing and removing a lock,or signing on to and off of a than permitting the group supervisor to accomplish for the entire group following,for example,oral communication with the employees.there is no question that the directive does require personal control of locks and tags.the directive mandates that group procedures must ensur e that each individual is uniquely accounted for and that each individual is the only person who can release his or her personal lockout device or personal tagout device.directive at.and it further states that p rocedures that rely solely on visual or audible means of accounting for employees are not acceptable.id.accordingly,the question is whether these statements deviate from the original standard,or merely reiterate it albeit in somewhat clearer language.we consider eei five arguments in favor of the former proposition in turn.
eei first contention is that the directive constitutes a change from the power generation standard because neither the text of the standard,nor that of the preamble accompanying it,requires that maintenance employees working in a group exercise personal accountability by affixing personal locks or tags or their equivalent to energy control devices.pet r br.at.but this contention is simply incorrect.the standard expressly states that,w hen servicing or maintenance is performed by a group,e ach authorized employee shall affix a personal lockout or tagout device,or comparable mechanism,when he or she begins work and shall remove those devices when he or she stops working.d ii d emphasis added.that provision reflects osha view,as stated in the preamble,that the only way to ensure that the employee is aware of whether or not the lockout or tagout device is in place is to permit only that employee to remove the device himself or herself.at see id.at e ach employee in the group needs to be able to affix personal lockout or tagout system device as part of the group lockout.quoting.indeed,in announcing the standard,osha expressly rejected eei argu ment that the person removing a lockout or tagout device need not be the same as the person who placed it,and instead adopted the position that each employee must have the assurance that the device is in his or her control,and that it will not be removed by anyone else except in an emergency situation.id.at see also id.at the authorized employee in charge of the group lockout or tagout can not reenergize the equipment until each employee in the group has removed personal device.quoting.at 
eei second argument is that the directive changes the power generation standard by adding,for the first time,a definition of the term c
