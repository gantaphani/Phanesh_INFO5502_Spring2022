in the bad old days,utilities were vertically integrated monopolies electricity generation,transmission,and distribution for a particular geographic area were generally provided by and under the control of a single regulated utility.sales of those services were bundled,meaning consumers paid a single price for generation,transmission,and distribution.as the supreme court observed,with blithe understatement,c ompetition among utilities was not prevalent.new york ferc,d.
in its pathmarking order,ferc required utilities that owned transmission facilities to guarantee all market participants access to those facilities.see promoting wholesale competition through open access transmission services by public utilities,ferc stats.regs,order.that is,ferc required all utilities to provide transmission service for electricity generated by others on the same basis that they provided transmission service for the electricity they themselves generated.to effectuate this introduction of competition,ferc required public utilities to functionally unbundle their wholesale generation and transmission services by stating separate rates for each service in a single tariff and offering transmission service under that tariff on an,basis.see new york,at.at see generally california indep.operator ferc.
as the next step toward the goal of a more competitive electricity marketplace,order encouraged but did not require the development of regional transmission organizations rtos.the concern was that the segmentation of the transmission grid among different utilities,even if each had functionally unbundled transmission,contributed to inefficiencies that impeded free competition in the market for electric power.combining the different segments and placing control of the grid in one entity an rto was expected to overcome these inefficiencies and promote competition.order at see also public util.dist.of snohomish county ferc.better still if the rto were run by an independent system operator an iso.as envisioned by ferc,an iso would assume operational control but not ownership of the transmission facilities owned by its member utilities,thereby separat ing operation of the transmission grid and access to it from economic interests in generation.order at see also id.at.the iso would then provide open access to the regional transmission system to all electricity generators at rates established in a single,unbundled,tariff that applies to all eligible users in a manner.id.at see also california indep.operator,at.ferc called this type of separation of generation and transmission operational unbundling,a step beyond functional unbundling.order at.although several parties to the rulemaking had requested that ferc require operational unbundling or even divestiture of transmission assets,it was ferc considered judgment that the less intrusive functional unbundling approach is all that we must require at this time.id.at.
by,ferc had come to a less sanguine view of the curative powers of functional unbundling.in ferc view,inefficiencies in the transmission grid and lingering opportunities for transmission owners to discriminate in their own favor remained obstacles to robust competition in the wholesale electricity market.ferc concluded that these problems could be remedied through the establishment of rtos,explaining that better regional coordination in areas such as maintenance of transmission and generation systems and transmission planning and operation was necessary to address regional reliability concerns and to foster regional competition.see regional transmission organizations,order,ferc stats.regs,order codified at citing staff report to ferc on the causes of wholesale electric pricing abnormalities in the midwest during june,at.ferc concluded that rtos would improve efficiencies in transmission grid management impose grid reliability remove remaining opportunities for discriminatory transmission practices improve market performance and facilitate lighter handed regulation.order at public util.dist,at.to further encourage rto development,ferc directed utilities either to participate in an rto or to explain their refusal to do so.public util.dist,at.importantly,though,order still did not require utilities to join rtos participation remained voluntary.see id.at.
for those utilities opting to join an rto,order retained a flexible approach,allowing the rtos to employ a variety of ownership and operational structures,so long as the rto established that it had certain required characteristics and functional capabilities.id.at.ferc required,inter alia,that an rto be regional in scope,j have operational authority for all transmission facilities under its control,id.j be the only provider of transmission service over the facilities under its control,id.k i and have the sole authority to receive,evaluate,and approve or deny all requests for transmission service,id.thus,whatever its structure,once a utility made the decision to surrender operational control of its transmission facilities to an rto,any transmissions across those facilities were subject to the control of that rto.
in january more than a year before order,several utilities in the midwest sought ferc approval for the transfer of operational control of their transmission facilities to an iso known as midwest iso miso,which would be organized as a,corporation.see midwest indep.transmission.operator,ferc,wl miso initial approval.miso would link up the transmission lines of the member utilities miso owners into a single interconnected grid stretching across the northern border of the from michigan to eastern montana,and reaching as far south as kansas city,missouri and louisville,kentucky.under the miso proposal,the miso owners would retain ownership of and physically operate and maintain their transmission facilities,subject to miso instructions.miso would have functional control of the transmission system,with responsibility for calculating available transmission capability receiving,approving,and scheduling transmission service requests and providing or arranging for ancillary services under the tariff.miso would also serve as the system security coordinator for the miso owners.
the miso owners concurrently applied for approval of miso open access transmission tariff.see id.at.under the tariff,all customers would pay a single rate to use the entire miso transmission system,based on the volume of power the customer carried on the system.the miso owners did not,however,propose to bring all of their own transmission loads immediately under that new open access tariff.several of the miso owners were required to provide bundled retail service generation and transmission to consumers at rates frozen by state legislation,state regulatory agencies,or legal settlements.the miso owners proposed that such bundled retail loads be brought under the miso tariff at the end of a transition period,unless the state regulatory authorities unbundled those loads sooner.see id.at.also,some miso owners had bilateral agreements with other utilities to provide wholesale transmission service at fixed rates.the miso owners proposed that loads under such grandfathered agreements also remain outside of the tariff until the end of the transition period.thus,only new wholesale and unbundled retail transmission loads would be immediately subject to the miso tariff.
the miso tariff included several mechanisms to recover the costs associated with running miso.relevant to this proceeding are schedule and schedule.under schedule of the tariff,miso customers paid a charge for scheduling,system control and dispatch service.miso open access transmission tariff,original sheet.this charge covers miso primary service management of the transmission grid.this scheduling,system control and dispatch service charge,though,was to be paid by the transmission customer directly to the miso owner providing transmission service at least at first,it was not to be paid to miso.id.
schedule of the miso tariff,the iso cost adder,was designed to recover miso administrative costs the costs associated with running the iso that are not recovered under schedule.miso open access transmission tariff,original sheet.those costs included costs associated with the security center,including capital costs and expenses,and administering the tariff.id.the cost adder was to be levied on a per megawatt basis and was calculated monthly by dividing miso eligible budgeted costs by the expected eligible transmission load.so,for example,if miso expected eligible costs for june were,and miso anticipated one million megawatts of eligible load for that same month,under schedule,miso would levy a cost adder of cents per megawatt on the eligible transmission load.the cost adder,though,was capped at cents per megawatt with any unrecovered costs to be financed by miso and deferred to the end of the transition period,when the debt would be repaid on a amortization schedule through a surcharge to all miso customers.id.sheet.
critically,the miso tariff provided that only those transmission loads subject to the tariff rates would pay the iso cost adder.transmissions under bundled retail plans and grandfathered agreements thus were not subject to the cost adder only new wholesale loads and unbundled retail loads would pay the cost adder.
the commission conditionally approved the establishment of miso and conditionally accepted the proposed miso tariff for filing.but having found that f or the most part,these rate terms have not been shown to be just and reasonable and may be unjust,unreasonable,or unduly discriminatory,ferc suspended the miso tariff,and set it for a hearing.see miso initial approval,ferc at.among the issues set for a hearing was the iso cost adder.id.at.
following a public hearing,the alj determined that the proposed iso cost adder was not just and reasonable because,inter alia,it did not apply to bundled retail loads or grandfathered loads during the transition period.see midwest indep.transmission.operator,ferc.the alj concluded 
all of the midwest iso participants transmission customers will benefit from midwest iso operational and planning responsibilities for the midwest iso transmission system,as well as increased grid reliability of the transmission system.therefore,to ensure that retail load will properly bear a fair share of the midwest iso costs,all firm,bundled retail,and grandfathered load should be included in the divisor in developing the cost adder.
several utilities filed exceptions to the alj decision,arguing that the cost adder should not apply to bundled loads because such loads were not obtaining benefits commensurate with the costs imposed by the cost adder and applying the cost adder to bundled and grandfathered loads would unlawfully trap costs with transmission owners.ferc affirmed the alj findings and conclusions concerning the cost adder,agreeing with the alj that all users of the grid operated by the midwest iso will benefit from the midwest iso operational and planning responsibilities for the midwest iso transmission system,as well as increased grid reliability of the transmission system.midwest indep.transmission.operator,ferc.the commission concluded that it was appropriate for the bundled and grandfathered loads to pay the cost adder to ensure that loads will properly bear a fair share of the midwest iso costs.id.the commission denied rehearing,rejecting the miso owners claim and explaining that any trapping of costs at the retail level should be taken up with the appropriate state commissions.midwest indep.transmission.operator,ferc,miso ii.
the miso owners then sought judicial review in this court.ferc moved for a voluntary remand,which we granted.in its order on remand,ferc adhered to its prior ruling that the bundled retail and grandfathered loads must pay the cost adder on the same basis as new wholesale and unbundled retail loads.see midwest indep.transmission.operator,ferc,miso iii.after the commission denied rehearing from its order on remand,see midwest indep.transmission.operator,ferc miso iv,the miso owners again sought review in this court.
as a court of limited jurisdiction,we take seriously any suggestion that we lack the authority to act.consumer elecs.ass fcc.that does not mean,however,that all such suggestions are serious.ferc devotes pages of its brief to arguing that the miso owners lack standing to challenge the ferc orders compelling them to pay the iso cost adder,because the miso owners have not shown that they will not be able to recoup the cost adder charges at some point down the road.see ferc br.
ferc argument is tantamount to contending that a homeowner whose house is destroyed by arson has not been injured by the arsonist,if the house was adequately insured.the challenged orders impose tangible costs on the miso owners,who accordingly have standing to seek judicial review.
ferc also raises a related ripeness challenge,contending that t he availability of untested cost recovery mechanisms makes this case unripe for judicial review at this juncture.id.at.again,the fact that the miso owners might be able to recoup the increased charges does not make the challenge to their assessment unripe 
the jurisdictional speed bumps thus cleared,we can reach the merits of ferc orders,which we review under the familiar arbitrary and capricious standard.see a entergy,ferc.we abide by the commission factual findings if they are supported by substantial evidence,see b,and we will affirm the commission orders so long as ferc examine d the relevant data and articulate d a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.motor vehicle mfrs.ass state farm mut.auto.ins,d see also public serv.comm of new york ferc.when ferc orders concern ratemaking,we are particularly deferential to the commission expertise.association of oil pipe lines ferc.here we conclude that ferc order that all miso transmission loads must share in the iso cost adder comports with reasoned decisionmaking and therefore deny the petitions for review.
as a threshold matter,the miso owners argue that ferc has switched course in these proceedings ferc originally approved miso with bundled retail and grandfathered loads excluded from the miso tariff,but now has ruled that these loads must share in the iso cost adder.the miso owners phrase this switch as a failure to comply with section of the federal power act.that provision permits the commission to initiate changes to existing utility rates and practices.atlantic city ferc.under section,however,ferc must first prove that the existing rates are unjust,unreasonable,unduly discriminatory or preferential.id.quoting a.that,the owners contend,ferc has failed to do.
section,however,is not implicated here because the cost adder was never unconditionally accepted.in its decision that conditionally established miso and conditionally accepted the miso tariff for filing,the commission specifically set the issue of the iso cost adder for a hearing pursuant to its authority under section of the federal power act,e.see miso initial approval,ferc at.in considering the iso cost adder,ferc was not addressing an existing rate or practice,and so did not have to make the findings required under section.
we can thus turn to the miso owners primary contention that ferc order does not comport with the cost causation principle.we have described this principle as requir ing that all approved rates reflect to some degree the costs actually caused by the customer who must pay them.kn energy,ferc,transmission access policy study group ferc,pacific gas ferc.july.not surprisingly,we evaluate compliance with this unremarkable principle by comparing the costs assessed against a party to the burdens imposed or benefits drawn by that party.kn energy,at citing alabama,ferc.also not surprisingly,we have never required a ratemaking agency to allocate costs with exacting precision.see power partners,ferc,ferc is not bound to reject any rate mechanism that tracks the principle less than perfectly.it is enough,given the standard of review under the apa,that the cost allocation mechanism not be arbitrary or capricious in light of the burdens imposed or benefits received.
we begin by recognizing that miso is,of its owners own volition,a,order rto.see generally midwest indep.transmission.operator,ferc
