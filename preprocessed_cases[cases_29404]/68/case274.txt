the transmission agency of northern california tanc is a joint exercise of powers agency composed of over a dozen northern and central california municipalities.it brought suit against the bonneville power administration bpa,a federal power marketing agency of the united states department of energy and the defendant regional utility companies.tanc asserted claims for equitable relief and damages allegedly incurred as a result of the bpa and the other defendants constructing,and interconnecting with,an electricity intertie known as the alturas intertie.
the district court did not reach the merits of tanc claims.it dismissed the claims against the bpa for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,concluding that those claims challenged final agency action by the bpa and fell within the ninth circuit court of appeals exclusive original jurisdiction.see e.it also dismissed,as preempted under the federal power act,tanc claims against the defendant utility companies.tanc appeals.we have jurisdiction under,and we affirm.
facts and proceedings 
because this case comes before us on appeal from a dismissal under federal rule of civil procedure b,all facts alleged in tanc complaint are taken as true and construed in the light most favorable to it.epstein.energy,cir.
tanc alleged that in it entered into an interim interconnection agreement and schedule and coordination agreement collectively the agreements with the defendants bpa,portland general electric,and pacificorp collectively the northwest parties to jointly construct and operate an interconnection of two electricity interties.under the agreements,the northwest parties agreed to upgrade from mw to mw an existing intertie that they own in oregon,known as the northwest ac intertie.tanc,in turn,agreed to construct a new mw line known as the transmission project.tanc also agreed to connect the transmission project to an already existing intertie in california,the mw pacific ac intertie to form the mw intertie.finally,tanc and the northwest parties agreed to join the intertie with the northwest ac intertie,creating a transfer capability of mw at the border between the two interties.the parties performed under the agreements,and the federal energy regulatory commission ferc allocated to tanc transmission project of the transfer capability.
in,the bpa announced its decision to join the northwest ac intertie with the new mw alturas intertie,which was to be constructed by defendant sierra pacific.see decision to interconnect with sierra pacific power company alturas transmission line project,fed.reg.sierra pacific completed construction of the alturas intertie in late.
the alturas intertie stretches from nevada through northern california and into oregon,where it connects with the northwest ac intertie.when operational,the alturas intertie causes a reduction in the ability of the northwest ac intertie to deliver power to the intertie.as a result,if the alturas intertie is operating at its maximum mw capacity,then the intertie has mw of excess capacity.
prior to the alturas intertie commencing operations,tanc and other companies and instrumentalities not parties to this litigation filed an unsuccessful protest with ferc,alleging that the alturas intertie would create a reduction in the capacity of the intertie.in that proceeding,tanc requested that ferc ensure that procedures were put in place to protect the contractual relationships,including the intertie alleged access to mw of transfer capability under the agreements.alternatively,tanc asked ferc to delay operation of the alturas intertie until either congress approved the intertie,or the northwest ac intertie capacity was increased to mw.ferc denied these requests and,on november,it approved operation of the alturas intertie.see in re sierra pacific power,wl.
in february,however,after operation of the alturas intertie had commenced,ferc initiated a hearing into the connection agreement creating the alturas intertie.ferc considered the hearing necessary to address allegations regarding the reduction in the california oregon intertie capacity,the inconsistency between the alturas scheduling agreement and the intertie scheduling needs,and related issues.
before the ferc case was resolved tanc filed the present lawsuit in december in california superior court against the bpa,sierra pacific,portland general electric,and pacificorp.as amended,tanc complaint alleged breach of contract,tort,and property claims and requested legal and equitable relief.specifically,tanc alleged that the reduction in capacity of transfers from the northwest ac intertie to the intertie breached the agreements and caused damage to the transmission project.tanc also asserted a fraud claim,alleging that sierra pacific had made misrepresentations before unspecified governmental agencies to obtain approval for the alturas intertie.
the bpa,a federal agency,exercised its right to remove the action to federal court,see a,a,and the remaining defendants followed suit,asserting federal question and diversity jurisdiction.see.once in federal court,the defendants moved to dismiss under federal rules of civil procedure b,b,and b.tanc then voluntarily dismissed its tort claims against the bpa and its claims for equitable relief.the district court dismissed the remainder of tanc claims under rules b and b.the court held that the claims against the bpa were subject to the exclusive original jurisdiction of this court under e,and that tanc claims against sierra pacific,pacificorp,and portland general electric were preempted by the federal power act.this appeal followed.
claims against bpa 
tanc raises two challenges to the district court dismissal of its claims against the bpa.tanc contends that the district court erred in holding that its claims were challenges to final agency action by the bpa and thus within the exclusive original jurisdiction of the ninth circuit court of appeals,and even if the district court was correct that it lacked jurisdiction,instead of dismissing the claims,it should have transferred them under from the district court to this court or,alternatively,to the court of federal claims.we are unpersuaded by tanc arguments,and affirm the decision of the district court.
the district court ruled that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over tanc claims against the bpa because those claims were challenges to final agency action by the bpa over which this court has exclusive original jurisdiction under section e of the northwest power planning act,codified at e.we review de novo the district court conclusion that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction.wilson belo,cir.
section e of the northwest power planning act provides 
suits to challenge final actions and decisions taken pursuant to this act by the bonneville power administrator or the council,or the implementation of such final actions,whether brought pursuant to this act or the bonneville project act shall be filed in the united states court of appeals for the region.once the time for such challenges has passed,t he plan and program,as finally adopted or portions thereof,or amendments thereto,shall not thereafter be reviewable as a part of any other action under this act or any other law.suits challenging any other actions under this act shall be filed in the appropriate court.
tanc remaining claims against the bpa are for breach of contract and inverse condemnation.tanc argues that these claims do not fall within this court exclusive original jurisdiction because the claims are not challenges to any final administrative argument made with particular reference to the district court decision that the claims against the bpa were ultimately challenges to the bpa decision to join in the construction and operation of the alturas intertie.rather,tanc argues,its claims fall under the final sentence of section e quoted above,establishing jurisdiction over any other claims in the appropriate court.we disagree.
we have consistently interpreted the section e judicial review provision with a broad view of this court jurisdiction and a narrow definition of district court jurisdiction.cent.power,adm r,cir quoting pacific power and light bonneville power,cir.in evaluating whether jurisdiction exists under section e,tanc particular legal theories of breach of contract and inverse condemnation are not controlling.it matters not that the plaintiffs attempt to base their theory of recovery in part outside of the northwest power planning act.in examining the nature of the agency action being challenged,our focus is on the agency being attacked and whether the factual basis for the attack is an agency action authorized by the act.cent.power,at quoting pacific power,at accord forelaws on bd.johnson,cir.
in pacific power,we held that we had exclusive jurisdiction where declaratory relief against proposed agency was sought,even though the plaintiffs argued that they sought to challenge only the fact that the bpa new rates breached prior contractual commitments.pacific power.at.we explained that a lthough the utilities action is based upon their contracts with bpa,the effect of their action would be to challenge bpa ratemaking proceedings and the agency obligation to undertake ratemaking in a manner consistent with its contractual commitments.id.at.
similarly,in central montana electric power,we rejected the argument of the plaintiff electrical cooperatives that we lacked exclusive original jurisdiction over a claim to a share of electric power because a portion of that claim rested on law and facts outside of the northwest power planning act.we explained that ultimately,t he nature of the agency action being challenged by the cooperatives was the administrator final action as to the marketing and allocation of electric power,a function that is governed extensively by the northwest power planning act accordingly,the action is subject to our exclusive jurisdiction cent.power,at citations omitted.
tanc basic argument is that it is only challenging the bpa failure to maintain mw of transfer capability between the northwest ac intertie and the intertie.tanc contends this deprived it of electricity capacity for the transmission and violated the agreements.tanc argues that it is irrelevant whether construction of the alturas intertie contributed to the deprivation and breach,because the bpa could have chosen to increase the overall capacity of the northwest ac intertie to mw and did not.
tanc relies upon public utility district number johnson,cir.there,the petitioner challenged several bpa actions,but it also alleged a breach of contract claim based upon an oral contract it entered into with the bpa.we held that we lacked original jurisdiction over the breach of contract claim because claims involving alleged contractual breaches by the agency and based on allegations of facts outside an administrative record must be heard in the claims court id.at.we distinguished previous breach of contract cases that reached a contrary result because in those cases the claims ultimately challenged final agency action by the bpa pursuant to its statutory authority.id.at distinguishing pacific power.at.we explained in this case,however,the principal conduct of the agency on which petitioner claim is based is not final action taken pursuant to statutory authority it is alleged contractual commitments made outside the scope of any administrative record,and which petitioners contend have been breached.public utility district number,at emphasis added.original jurisdiction over that case,therefore,lay in the claims court.id.at.
unlike the petitioner claim in public utility district number,tanc inverse condemnation and breach of contract claims can not be separated out from the bpa final administrative decision in deciding to join the northwest ac intertie with the alturas intertie without also making provision to increase the capacity of the northwest ac intertie,the bpa plainly decided to take an action that would deprive tanc of transmission capacity and that was inconsistent with the bpa alleged contractual commitments to tanc.at that time,tanc could have filed a petition in this court under section e to challenge the bpa decision on these grounds.tanc did not file such a petition.it can not raise the issue at this late date by clothing its challenge in state law claims.the root cause of the alleged inverse condemnation and breach of contract was the bpa decision to join the northwest ac intertie to the alturas intertie,a final decision under section e of the northwest power planning act.we alone have original jurisdiction over a challenge to that decision.pacific power,at.
tanc requests that if we hold that the district court lacked jurisdiction over its claims against the bpa,we transfer those claims to this court.under,a federal court may transfer an action over which it lacks jurisdiction to another court that has jurisdiction.the district court denied this request,and so do we.
a transfer under is inappropriate if the action would have been untimely had it been filed in the appropriate court.abbott united states,cir.section e of the northwest power planning act requires that suits challenging a final bpa action,or its implementation,be filed within ninety days of the bpa giving notice of the action in the federal register or of the action becoming final.e.here,the bpa announced its decision to interconnect the northwest ac intertie to the alturas intertie in february.tanc complaint was not filed until december.therefore,tanc action challenging the bpa final decision is untimely and transfer to this court is precluded.the district court correctly dismissed tanc claims against the bpa for lack of subject matter jurisdiction 
claims against the utility company defendants 
tanc also appeals the district court dismissal,under federal rule of civil procedure b,of tanc claims against the utility company defendants,sierra pacific,pacificorp,and portland general electric.the district court held that these claims were preempted by the federal power act.we review de novo both a dismissal for failure to state a claim under rule b and the district court decision regarding preemption.nathan kimmel,dowelanco,cir citing williamson dynamics,cir,cert.denied,d.
federal preemption of state law is rooted in the supremacy clause,article vi,clause,of the united states constitution.preemption of state law is compelled whether congress command is explicitly stated in the statute language or implicitly contained in its structure and purpose.jones rath packing,d,quoted in branco cal.employers joint pension plan,cir.
tanc asserts three categories of state law claims against the utility company defendants tort and property claims for inverse condemnation,nuisance,trespass,and conversion claims for breach of contract,intentional interference with a contractual relationship,and intentional interference with a prospective economic advantage and a fraud claim solely against sierra pacific.all of these claims are preempted by the federal power act.
the conflict between federal law and tanc state law tort and property claims is readily apparent.as the supreme court has explained,part ii of the federal power act,codified at,delegates to the federal energy commission exclusive authority to regulate the transmission and sale at wholesale of electric energy in interstate commerce,new england power new hampshire,d emphasis added.thus,as we have recently explained,ferc exclusive jurisdiction extends over all facilities for such transmission or sale of electric energy.duke energy trading,davis,cir citing b,d see also ass of pub.agency customers bonneville power,cir interstate transmission of electricity is clearly a federal matter.
all of tanc tort and property claims allege that the operation of the alturas intertie either damages,or trespasses on,the transmission project.ferc,however,approved the operation of the alturas intertie and its connection to the northwest ac intertie,thereby creating an interstate system for the transmission of electricity that stretches from oregon through northern california and into nevada.ferc alone has the authority to modify its decision pertaining to the alturas intertie,or to respond to challenges to the intertie operation.tanc can not obtain state law money damages allegedly resulting from the operation of an interstate electricity intertie expressly approved by ferc.midwestern gas transmission mccarty,cir holding that a state commission may not interfere with an interconnection of interstate gas transmission lines once that interconnection has been approved by ferc 
unable to cite any case involving the interstate transmission of electricity or a like commodity where state law tort or property claims challenging that transmission have been allowed to go forward notwithstanding federal approval of the transmission,tanc relies upon a string of airport cases where federal approval of flight plans did not preempt state law nuisance and noise violation claims.tanc then suggests the analogy that a homeowner would be equally free to file a state law nuisance claim regarding the operation of power lines,and that tanc is in a position akin to that of such a homeowner.this analogy relies upon a number of false premises,but we need only point out the most obvious one.
we may assume for the purpose of argument that a homeowner,in certain circumstances,might be able to pursue a state law tort or inverse condemnation claim challenging the operation of electricity transmission lines,in much the same way a homeowner might pursue a claim challenging airport noise.this does not mean,however,that tanc can do the same.tanc is not a homeowner.it is an operator of an interconnected,federally regulated,interstate transmission system.see generally new york ferc,d describing the highly interconnected nature of the nation electricity grids,including on the west coast.offering an analogy of our own,allowing tanc to sue under state law for damage allegedly caused to its transmission system by an interconnected interstate system approved by ferc would be akin to allowing an airline to sue under state law for damages caused to its operations by the operations of another airline flight plans.not surprisingly,no aviation case nor any other authority supports such a proposition.
more to the point,what tanc seeks to achieve by its tort and property claims would defeat the entire purpose of exclusive federal regulation of interstate transmission of electricity.ferc has approved the construction and operation of the alturas intertie,and ferc alone subject to court review of its final decision can modify that decision,or deal with any party who operates the alturas intertie improperly.we conclude that tanc state law tort and property claims against the utility company defendants are preempted.we next consider tanc claims against these defendants.
all of tanc claims depend upon the assumption that,but for the misdeeds of the utility company defendants,ferc would have continued to allocate mw of electricity transmission capacity from the northwest ac intertie to the intertie.this speculative assumption as to how ferc would have allocated electricity transmission capacity runs afoul of the filed rate doctrine.
at its most basic,the filed rate doctrine provides that state law,and some federal law antitrust law,may not be used to invalidate a filed rate nor to assume a rate would be charged other than the rate adopted by the federal agency in question.county of stanislaus pacific gas,cir.the doctrine applies to rates charged by railroads,see keogh chicago northwestern ry,natural gas companies,see arkansas louisiana gas hall,d,and other interstate operators over whom federal agencies have exclusive power to set rates.more relevant here,the supreme court has extended the doctrine to the federal power act and to electricity rates.
in utilities northwestern public service,the supreme court held that a plaintiff in a case involving electricity rates set by the federal power commission the precursor to ferc could claim no rate as a legal right that is other than the filed rate,whether fixed or merely accepted by the commission,and not even a court can authorize commerce in the commodity on other terms.the court has explained that this rule is without exception congress meant to draw a bright line easily ascertained,between state and federal jurisdiction this was done in the power act by making federal power commission jurisdiction plenary and extending it to all wholesale sales in interstate commerce except those which congress has made explicitly subject to regulation by the states.fed.power comm southern cal.edison,d,quoted in nantahala power light thornburg,d.
as further developed,the filed rate doctrine has prohibited not just a state court or a federal court applying state law from setting a rate different from that chosen by ferc,but also from assuming a hypothetical rate different from that actually set by ferc.in arkansas louisiana gas,at,the court stated 
it would undermine the congressional scheme of uniform regulation of rate regulation to allow a state court to award as damages a rate never filed with the commission and thus never found to be reasonable within the meaning of the natural gas act.following that course would permit state courts to grant regulated sellers greater relief than they could obtain from the commission itself.
the court has also expanded the reach of the filed rate doctrine beyond just rates.in nantahala power,the supreme court held that the filed rate doctrine is not limited to rates per se.at.instead,any allocation of power that directly affects rates is protected by the filed rate doctrine.id.at.thus,following nantahala power,we recognized that an allocation of natural gas approved by the economic regulatory administration era is covered by the filed rate doctrine,just as if the allocation had been a decision on rates.see county of stanislaus,at plaintiffs denial of access claims are,at core,a challenge to the quantity of gas that purchased from canadian producers because such quantities had received era approval and authorization,the claims can not overcome the filed rate doctrine clear instruction that volumes are conclusively reasonable.
in county of stanislaus,we noted that in nantahala the court had left open the possibility that a claim based on allocation might not be covered by the filed rate doctrine,if that allocation had not been set or approved by ferc or another federal agency.county of stanislaus,at.however,the reservation of this issue with regard to allocations of interstate electricity transmission capacity is no longer appropriate because ferc failure to address a specific allocation of electricity no longer invites the possibility that the filed rate doctrine might not apply.we reach this conclusion by giving deference to ferc order,reported at fed.reg.may,
ferc order has functionally combined ferc regulation of rates with ferc regulation of transmission capacity.the order accomplishes this because it regulates rates not by setting them directly,but rather by setting rules requiring open access to transmission lines at uniform,openly disclosed,rates.see id.at see also implementing the nondiscriminatory open access transmission tariff policy.these open policies as to transmission capacity,ferc expects,will result in rates set at a competitive level.see fed.reg.at.thus,ferc regulation of interstate rates now operates through ferc regulation of open access to transmission capacity.for that reason,any right to a particular allocation of interstate transmission capacity must now be considered an exclusive matter of federal law.to conclude otherwise would restrict ferc ability to regulate rates through its open transmission policy.we therefore hold that ferc exclusive jurisdiction over the interstate transmission of electricity extends to any claims of entitlement to a specific allocation of interstate transmission capacity,whether that claim asks a court to enforce such an alleged entitlement or merely to hypothetically assume it 
in the present case,the common theme in tanc claims against the utility company defendants for breach of contract,intentional interference with a contractual relationship,and intentional interference with a prospective economic advantage is the contention that tanc is,or would have been,entitled to mw of transfer capability between the northwest ac intertie and the intertie.this contention stumbles upon
