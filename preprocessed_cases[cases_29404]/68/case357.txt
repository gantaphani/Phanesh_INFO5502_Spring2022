the federal energy regulatory commission ferc rejected connecticut challenge to the structure of the state electricity market.ferc concluded that the current hybrid market,in which some electricity generators sell power at regulated rates and others at market rates,is lawful,and that connecticut proposed alternative would not be.we hold that ferc denial of connecticut complaint was not arbitrary and capricious and thus deny the petition for review.
just over a decade ago,the new england electricity market was highly regulated and relatively uncomplicated.generators sold electric energy wholesale at a regulated price based on the cost of production to entities that transmitted that energy for consumer use.in,the market became less regulated and more complicated when ferc approved a proposal by the new england power alliance of electric move the market toward greater competition.the proposal established iso new england,a private,entity to administer new england energy markets and operate the region bulk power transmission system,nstar gas ferc,and created markets for the sale of several products provided by generators energy,capacity that is,the option of buying a particular amount of energy in the future,and ancillary services that ensure the availability of sufficient electricity at all times to meet fluctuating levels of demand.most importantly,under the new regime,the range of electricity rates is set based on the market and not on the generators costs alone.individual generators offer electricity to the market at a particular price.determines the amount of electricity needed to meet demand for a particular time period and sets the price at which there is no excess demand.this price,which all generators must use,is equal to the bid price of the least expensive megawatt of power not needed to meet is,the next unit of supply that would be employed if demand were any higher.
following the reforms,the new england electricity market encountered problems with infrastructure weaknesses,outdated generating units,and insufficient supply to meet increasing demand.in some areas,including connecticut,the resulting transmission constraint often made it difficult to transmit the available electricity supply to where it was needed.additionally,the inability of many and typically older generating units to earn a profit in the competitive markets threatened the reliability of the already overburdened system.these units were needed to maintain a reliable supply of energy during times of high demand,but were infrequently used because their bids usually exceeded the price during times of low or normal demand.
to address these problems,in ferc approved a new set of operating rules,including market rule,for new england.to respond to the problem of transmission constraint,market rule adopted locational marginal pricing.had previously set the price using offers of electricity based only on meeting demand at the least possible cost.under locational marginal pricing,the decision to use a particular offer also depends on the feasibility of transmitting that power to where it is demanded.the price thus includes the additional cost of dispatching power that is more expensive but which can be transmitted to where it is needed.market rule also authorized the use of rmr agreements to prevent generators from shutting down for lack of profitability.an rmr agreement entitles the generator to recover a full rate rather than the rate it could obtain on the market.in turn,the generator must offer all of its capacity into the energy markets at a predetermined price representing actual marginal cost,and any revenue from these market sales directly reduces the payments made under the rmr agreement.rmr agreements are available only to those generators that are unable to supply their needed electricity without the compensation of the agreements.
market rule is a temporary and imperfect solution to particular problems in the new england electricity market.by ensuring the availability of sufficient power to meet demand,market rule meets a primary goal of system reliability.that it does so by interfering with the efficient operation of a purely competitive market is a problem.recognizing that,ferc encouraged to develop a new market structure for new england to achieve the benefits of market rule without the drawbacks.after extensive proceedings,including a settlement agreement between and more than one hundred interested parties,ferc approved a plan for a new forward capacity market.see me.pub.utils.comm ferc,affirming ferc approval order.under the new scheme,will hold annual capacity auctions three years before the capacity is needed.the advance time will allow potential new generators to compete in the auctions and plan for market entry.the forward capacity market will also continue locational marginal pricing through separate auctions held in capacity zones that are designated based on relative transmission constraint.
because of the lead time,the forward capacity market will not take effect until june.in the meantime,ferc has approved several interim measures to ensure reliability of the electricity system in new england as a whole and connecticut specifically.it approved temporary transition payments to new england generators between,when the forward capacity market was finalized,and,when it will take effect.additionally,ferc approved more rmr agreements than anticipated under market rule.this proliferation of rmr agreements was prompted by determination in that all electric generation in connecticut is necessary for all connecticut generators satisfy the first half of the rmr eligibility test.finally,ferc authorized the use of peaking unit safe harbor push bidding.push bidding allows generators in constrained areas that are operating at only of their capacity to offer supply into the markets at a higher price than they otherwise could under prevailing market rules.units tend to be those that only go into operation during peak demand periods,and push bidding was supposed to enable them to earn sufficient revenue from those periods to stay in the market.in january,however,ferc eliminated push bidding,finding that it had not worked as anticipated.
these interim strategies did not meet with universal support.on september,connecticut attorney general richard blumenthal and other interested entities filed a complaint against with ferc.the complaint charged that ferc changes to the electricity market structure in connecticut violate the requirement of the federal power act that all rates for the sale of electric energy,and all rules and regulations affecting those rates,shall be just and reasonable,a.the complainants argued that what they termed the hybrid which some generators are compensated through rmr agreements,others receive market rates,and still others at the time operated under push bidding produces unjust and unreasonable rates.
the complainants theory was that generators,which generally earn lower revenues in the market because they can not match the lower bid prices of more efficient generators,were opting out of the market and into rmr agreements that guaranteed they would recoup their costs.then,because these units must bid their necessary energy supplies into the market at marginal cost,the price was set based on the cost of service for these units.generators,on the other hand,continued to collect rates,reaping excessive rewards because of the difference between their marginal costs and the inflated price.push bidding exacerbated the problem by further inflating the price in much the same way rmr agreements did.as a result,according to connecticut,electric consumers in connecticut are forced to pay the higher of either rates under rmr agreements or rates for electricity.blumenthal iso new england,blumenthal i,at.
connecticut theory was that the electricity market must either be fully competitive or fully regulated.therefore,it asked ferc to amend market rule to require that all generators designated necessary for is,under decision,every generator in for an rmr agreement.this relief would effectively return the connecticut market to the fully regulated system that pr
