this case concerns certain obligations that the telecommunications act of,stat.codified at et,the act,imposed on incumbent providers of local telephone service.two of the act obligations on incumbent service providers,such as southwestern bell swbt,are at issue in this case a resale duty and a duty to provide access to elements of the incumbent network.the united states district court for the western district of oklahoma found that an limitation imposed by swbt on its optional toll calling plans sold to at t was an unreasonable resale restriction,in violation of the act.in a separate order,it instructed swbt to provide at t with immediate access to certain network elements.exercising our jurisdiction pursuant to,we reverse the district court order pertaining to the limitation and vacate its order dealing with access to network elements.
in,congress enacted the telecommunications act of,which fundamentally change d telecommunications regulation by introducing competition in the local service market.see first report and order,implementation of the local competition provisions in the telecomm.act of,fccr local competition order.prior to the act,telephone service was a regulated monopoly,in which incumbent providers enjoyed protection from new companies entering the market.the act sought to remove the outdated barriers that protect monopolies from competition and affirmatively promote efficient competition.id.under the act,incumbent local exchange carriers ilecs,ones which previously had enjoyed a monopoly over the provision of local telephone service,acquired affirmative duties.incumbent lecs must provide unbundled access to their network elements unbundled access provision,c,and offer for resale at wholesale rates any telecommunications service that the carrier provides at retail to subscribers who are not telecommunications carriers resale provision.c a.the resale duty also prohibits ilecs from imposing unreasonable or discriminatory conditions or limitations on the resale of such telecommunications service.c b.
these distinct duties on ilecs offer unique opportunities to new market entrants and are premised on different pricing strategies.under the unbundled access provision,a new competitor local exchange carrier clec can acquire various network elements from an ilec and can reconfigure them in various packages to sell to.unbundled access permit s new entrants to offer competing local services by purchasing from incumbents,at prices,access to elements which they do not already possess,unbundled from those elements that they do not need.see local competition order emphasis added.in contrast,if a clec buys services under the resale provision,it is able to resell that service under its own name,but is limited to selling the service that the ilec provides at retail.c a.these services are purchased at wholesale rates,which are determined by subtracting costs avoided from the ilec retail rate.see d.in other words,the proper starting point for determining the wholesale price under the resale provision is the retail price from which one subtracts the ilec avoided costs,whereas under the unbundled access provision,the starting point is cost see generally at t communications of the states,bellsouth,cir discussing different pricing methodologies.
ii.background 
at t seeks to enter the oklahoma market for local telephone service.the parties agree that swbt,an incumbent provider of local service in the state,is obligated to resell to at t telephone services that swbt provides to its own customers.the services at issue are certain optional toll calling plans otcp,under which customers can opt to make unlimited calls within a certain geographic radius for a flat monthly fee.the otcp allows customers to widen their free calling area,and thereby turn what would otherwise be considered toll calls long distance into local calls that are covered by the local service fee.aplt.at.swbt offers these plans to only,and specifically prohibits multiple users from sharing one plan.swbt seeks to impose this limitation on at t resale of the plan,essentially requiring that at t only sell one plan to one.at t contends that this condition is a restriction on resale,which is generally presumed to be unreasonable under the act.swbt,on the other hand,contends that the condition is a use limitation as opposed to a restriction on resale,and that eliminating the restriction would allow at t to resell services that swbt does not currently provide to its own customers.
at t challenged the limitation before the oklahoma corporation commission occ,which agreed with swbt.the occ concluded that at t literally would be offering a different service for resale than the one that swbt currently offers its customers,a situation that the act does not require.it further concluded that the restriction was reasonable and.at t appealed the occ decision to the united states district court for the western district of oklahoma,which disagreed with the occ and held that the restriction was a resale restriction and that swbt had not overcome the restriction presumption of unreasonableness.
iii.discussion 
standard of review 
although the act provided for federal court review of state commission decisions concerning interconnection agreements,see e it did not articulate the standard of review that courts should apply to those decisions.see philip weiser,chevron,cooperative federalism,and telecommunications reform,vand.the tenth circuit has joined most other federal courts in applying a de novo standard when reviewing state commissions interpretations of the act and its regulations,as those decisions turn on determinations of federal law.southwestern bell.brooks fiber communications of,cir.see also mci telecomm.bell,cir us west communications mfs intelenet,cir mci telecomm.bellsouth,d,us west communications,hix hix i,holding that courts should apply de novo review to questions of whether the state commissions actions were procedurally and substantively in compliance with the act and its implementing regulations see also michigan bell.climax,d,stating that the fourth,fifth,and ninth circuits have used de novo review of state commissions application of the act us west communications,hix hix ii,d,applying de novo review to state commission interpretation of the act and its regulations bellsouth,itc deltacom communications,d,adopting de novo standard of review for questions of whether state commission properly interpreted and applied the act internal quotation marks omitted weiser,supra,at stating that federal courts have declined to accord state agencies deference when it comes to construing ambiguous statutory terms or filling gaps in the telecom act and collecting cases 
once federal courts determine that state commissions properly interpreted the act and its regulations,courts apply an arbitrary and capricious standard to review the remaining state commissions determinations.mci telecomm,d at see also at t communications of the states,bellsouth,d,explaining that federal courts review de novo state commission interpretation of the act,but that if state commission interpretation is in compliance with federal law,that federal courts review all other issues using arbitrary and capricious standard hix i.at same.
most federal courts to analyze claims similar to the ones at issue in this case have applied de novo review,and reserved the arbitrary and capricious standard for highly technical issues.see,bell,at reviewing de novo whether directory publishing services were a telecommunications service that ilec was obligated to offer clec at wholesale rates under c a at t communications of the states bellsouth,at characterizing what services an ilec must provide to a clec under the resale provision as a purely legal question to be reviewed de novo west communications,at reviewing de novo whether certain services were exempt from the act resale provisions,but applying an arbitrary and capricious standard of review to state commission characterization of a switch as a tandem switch because it was not a determination of compliance with the requirements of the act and its implementing regulations,d at reviewing d
