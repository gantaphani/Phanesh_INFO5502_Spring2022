iowa network services,ins brought suit against qwest corporation qwest in federal district court seeking to collect amounts allegedly due under ins federal and state telecommunications tariffs for services ins provided in connecting wireless calls to rural iowa local telephone companies.the district court dismissed the action as precluded by the iowa utility board prior decision that ins tariffs did not apply to the services provided.ins appeals the dismissal,and we reverse and remand for further proceedings.
individual telephone companies provide local telephone service or telephone exchange service to customers within the telephone company local exchange area.a number of small independently owned telephone companies provide much of the local telephone exchange service to the residents of iowa.each company serves a localized geographic area,and the companies are referred to as local exchange carriers or lecs.see defining lec.qwest,providing both local and telephone service in iowa and fourteen other states,is also a lec to the extent that it supplies local telephone service in many iowa communities.lecs typically own the wires,computer switches,and related facilities needed to provide telephone service to their customers.in,nearly of the small,lecs in iowa joined together and formed ins.membership in ins allows each independent lec to utilize ins expanded centralized network as its own.qwest is not a member of ins.
even after the breakup of the at t telecommunications monopoly,which,inter alia,divested at t of its local exchange carriers,local telephone service continued to be viewed and operated as a natural monopoly,with state utility boards,or commissions,giving one local telephone service provider exclusive coverage of a given geographic area.the telecommunications act of act,fundamentally restructured local telephone markets and the regulatory scheme that governed them.no longer could states enforce laws that impeded competition in the local markets.no longer was the local market to be viewed as a natural monopoly with only one authorized provider of local telephone service.to the contrary,the act required local exchange carriers to facilitate local competition by sharing their networks with their new competitors.the act also thrust the federal government into the local telephone market regulatory arena,which had previously been the exclusive domain of the states.mci telecomm.bell atl,cir the act requires that local service,which was previously operated as a monopoly overseen by the several states,be opened to competition according to standards established by federal law,cert.denied,d.the new relationship between the federal government through the federal communications commission fcc,the federal courts,and the state commissions in regulating local telephone markets and the competing providers of telephone services in those markets is at the heart of this case.
as relevant to this case,there are two types of charges which one carrier can extract from another for the provision of telecommunication services.the first deals with local telephone service.as noted above,one of the primary purposes of the act was to promote competition in the local telephone service market.to facilitate that purpose,the act requires incumbent lecs ilecs to interconnect with another carrier providing local telephone service to a person within the ilec local exchange.see c providing that each ilec has t he duty to provide,for the facilities and equipment of any requesting telecommunications carrier,interconnection with the lec network for the transmission and routing of telephone exchange service and exchange access with quality at least equal to that provided the ilec own customers and at reasonable rates and conditions.without the interconnection requirement,a competing new lec would not be able to connect its customers to a customer served by the ilec without building its own infrastructure to serve both customers.under the act,the amount an ilec can charge for allowing a competitor to use its infrastructure to deliver a local call is to be determined by an interconnection agreement negotiated or imposed by arbitration between the ilec and the interconnecting carrier that has been approved by the state commission.see c e.
the second type of charge is the access fee charged by common carriers for use in carrying telecommunications via their infrastructure,or toll services.see requiring common carriers engaged in interstate communication to furnish communication service upon request,to establish physical connections with other carriers,and to establish through routes,prohibiting discrimination related to the use of common carrier lines of communication.a common carrier must file with the fcc a schedule of all of its charges for interstate wire and radio communication using its network before it may charge its customers for the service.see a.this schedule is the carrier federal tariff.carriers file similar tariffs with the applicable state commission for charges related to intrastate communications.
this dispute arises from the growing use of wireless telecommunications commonly referred to as cell phone or mobile phone services.commercial mobile radio service cmrs providers offer radio communication services between land stations and mobile receivers.see.traditional notions of local exchange areas do not fit neatly into this new world of wireless communications.for wireless communications,the country is divided into major trading areas mtas rather than local exchange areas.thus,the local calling area for a cell phone user is determined by the cell phone user mta.see b.the mta for iowa is the des moines mta,which encompasses virtually all of iowa and small portions of its neighboring states.intramta traffic originates and terminates within the same mta,while intermta traffic originates in one mta and terminates in another we are concerned in this case with the charges applicable to intramta traffic.
this case involves traffic which occurs when a cell phone user located within the des moines mta initiates a call to a customer of one of the iowa independent lecs,and the cell phone user cmrs provider uses qwest network to transport the call to ins network for final termination on the lec infrastructure to the called party.between the and,qwest paid ins the access charges established by ins relevant tariffs for ins services in transporting the calls that qwest received from a cmrs provider and handed off to ins for delivery to and termination at an independent ilec customer via ins network.qwest also paid termination fees to the ilec pursuant to the independent ilecs tariffs.three years after passage of the act,however,qwest took the new position that wireless calls originating and terminating within the des moines mta were local rather than calls,and thus were not subject to the tariffed access charges imposed by either ins or the terminating ilec.rather,according to qwest,ins had to look to the cmrs provider for payment pursuant to a reciprocal compensation arrangement as required by the act.see b.
for its new position,qwest relied upon an order issued by the fcc.pursuant to the act requirements,the fcc issued its first report and order implementing the act local competition provisions.see in re implementation of the local competition provisions in the telecommunications act of,interconnection between local exchange carriers and commercial mobile radio service providers,first report and order,fcc rcd.hereinafter first report and order.the order was in response to the act direction to the fcc to establish regulations to implement the requirements of,that is,the requirements to advance local competition.gte south,morrison,cir quoting d.the order specifically addressed the billing of calls originated by a wireless provider and delivered to a lec within the same mta.first report and order at.the fcc decreed that traffic to or from a cmrs network that originates and terminates within the same mta is subject to transport and termination rates under section b requiring lecs to establish reciprocal compensation arrangements,rather than interstate and intrastate access charges.id.at.the fcc also found that the reciprocal compensation provisions of section b for transport and termination of traffic do not apply to the transport or termination of interstate or intrastate interexchange traffic.id.interexchange traffic is a term of art which correlates to what consumers would traditionally consider to be telephone service for which toll charges are incurred an interexchange carrier ixc is a carrier who provides intrastate or interstate communications services between local exchange areas.qwest argued that paragraph of the first report and order controlled,precluding ins from charging access charges for the relevant traffic.ins countered that paragraph governed,based on the premises that qwest is an ixc,the traffic is interexchange traffic,and qwest was using trunk lines it had designated for traffic to handle the cmrs originated calls.
unable to come to an agreement on how to treat the traffic,in september,qwest stopped paying for access charges billed by ins dating back to april that qwest determined were related to intramta calls and sought a declaratory order from the iowa utilities board iub or the board that qwest was not liable for such access charges.the iub determined that factual disputes and the complexity of the issues regarding the proper treatment of the transported traffic at issue precluded issuance of the requested order and docketed the matter as a contested case,allowing ins to intervene.in the contested case,qwest,in addition to the declaratory order,sought a refund of access charges it had paid to ins for the period prior to april.ins in turn sought payment of the access charges qwest had refused to pay from april through the time of the hearing.
the iub held extensive hearings,including technical workshops,to better understand the parties claims.the presiding officer entered a proposed decision and order in which she determined that the traffic at issue was local traffic pursuant to the first report and order paragraph,and ruled that the access tariffs did not apply.the iub rejected ins reliance on paragraph.the iub determined that the fcc reference to an ixc was to a traditional ixc that had an established billing relationship with either the originating caller or the,whom the ixc could bill.because qwest did not have such a relationship with either the calling or the called parties in the traffic at issue,qwest was not an ixc.the iub determined that qwest provided an indirect connection,not toll services.the presiding officer determined that the cmrs providers and the lecs should negotiate and enter an interconnection agreement,including a reciprocal compensation arrangement,related to the traffic.the presiding officer stated that the parties should operate on a basis pursuant to regulation,at least until an imbalance could be shown justifying charges for the traffic.b arrangements are those in which neither of the two interconnecting carriers charges the other for the termination of telecommunications traffic that originates on the other carrier network,a,and are appropriate when the amount of telecommunications traffic from one network to the other is roughly balanced with the amount of telecommunications traffic flowing in the opposite direction,id.b.
the presiding officer denied qwest request for a refund for the prior months because she found that the parties had agreed to use the rates previously charged by ins,at least until the time that qwest formally disputed them as of april.she further determined that if the cmrs providers wanted to exchange traffic with the lecs,they should enter an interconnection agreement with the lecs,and that if the cmrs providers wished to use ins facilities to indirectly connect with the lecs,then ins was entitled to compensation for its indirect transport services and should be included in the negotiations for the agreement.the presiding officer determined that the terms of the interconnection agreement should apply prospectively from april.thus,while the iub rejected ins request for the payment of funds withheld by qwest since april,it did determine that ins was entitled to be compensated by the cmrs providers for the transport services qwest refused to pay since april at the rate ultimately determined to apply to such traffic going forward.
ins appealed the presiding officer proposed decision and order to the full board,which affirmed,making the board action final.instead of appealing the final iub decision to the iowa courts,see iowa code,or bringing an action challenging the iub decision in federal court pursuant to the act,ins brought this rather ordinary collection action in federal district court.ins brought claims based on alleged violations of its federal and state tariffs as well as an unjust enrichment claim.ins sought payment of charges billed and allegedly owed under both its federal and state tariffs for the time period beginning in april,or alternatively,damages for the unjust enrichment received by qwest in using ins facilities without paying for them.the district court determined that the claims based on ins tariffs had been decided by the iub when it decided that the traffic was local and not subject to tariff charges,and consequently were barred by the doctrine of res judicata.it further determined that ins failed to state a claim for unjust enrichment.the district court granted qwest motion to dismiss,and ins appeals.
ii.res judicata 
we begin by focusing on the issue before us.the merits of ins claims stemming from its tariffs are not before this court.we have before us only the district court determination that ins claims are precluded by the iub decision.because the relevant prior judgment was a state of iowa administrative proceeding,we apply iowa res judicata or claim preclusion law.see canady allstate ins,cir i t is fundamental that the res judicata effect of the first forum judgment is governed by the first forum law,not by the law of the second forum.internal quotation marks omitted.under iowa law,
a valid and final judgment on a claim precludes a second action on that claim or any part of it.the rule applies not only as to every matter which was offered and received to sustain or defeat the claim or demand,but also as to any other admissible matter which could have been offered for that purpose.
arnevik of.bd.of regents,iowa internal citations omitted.iowa courts look for three factors in applying the defense of claim preclusion the parties in the first and second action were the same the claim in the second suit could have been fully and fairly adjudicated in the prior case and there was a final judgment on the merits in the first action.id.citing judgment.
ins argues that the doctrine of claim preclusion does not apply because the first judgment was entered by a state administrative agency and was unreviewed in state court.iowa courts follow the general rule that gives preclusive effect to adjudications by administrative agencies.see gardner hartford ins.accident indem,iowa.the supreme court of the united states has also allowed unreviewed state administrative decisions to be given preclusive effect,but only when doing so did not contradict congressional intent as to the interplay between federal court jurisdiction and state agency findings.of elliott,d considering whether preclusive effect should be given to an unreviewed state agency with respect to title vii case,even though,requiring federal courts to give full faith and credit to state court judgments,does not apply to unreviewed state administrative findings.in the interpretation of a federal statute,the question of whether a state administrative agency decision should be given preclusive effect is not whether administrative estoppel is wise but whether it is intended by the legislature.astoria fed.sav.loan ass solimino,d.the court held that the age discrimination in employment act adea filing requirements make clear that collateral estoppel is not to apply,id.at,where the adea requires a petitioner to exhaust state administrative remedies,if available,before seeking redress in federal court,id.at.citing b.that scheme plainly assume s the possibility of fe
