pacific gas electric company pg e petitions for review of federal energy regulatory commission ferc orders that require the california independent system operator,rather than participating transmission owners like pg e,to conduct interconnection studies when a new electric generator seeks to interconnect with the electric transmission grid.pg e contends that the orders violate of the federal power act.but pg e petition,while cloaked in the guise of a challenge to the orders below,is in fact an impermissible collateral attack on a series of orders that ferc issued in and.we therefore dismiss the petition for review.
in its order,ferc laid the foundation for the development of competitive wholesale power markets by requiring public utilities to offer nondiscriminatory open access transmission services.transmission access policy study group ferc,aff g promoting wholesale competition through open access nondiscriminatory transmission services by public utilities,order,ferc stats.regs.the order required all utilities to provide access to their transmission lines to any entity generating or purchasing electricity in the interstate market on the same terms as the utilities use their own lines.id.at.to effectuate this reform,ferc adopted a pro forma open access transmission tariff oatt,containing minimum terms and conditions for service,which every public utility must file with the commission and by which it must abide in providing transmission services to itself and others.id.at.
as one means of complying with order,ferc encouraged public utilities to participate in independent system operators isos.california indep.operator ferc.as we have explained 
an iso conducts the transmission services and ancillary services for all users of such a system,replacing the conduct of such services by the system is,the integrated electric utilities whose market power ferc was attempting to control by encouraging the creation and operation of the isos.in order to accomplish that purpose,ferc deems it crucial that an iso be independent of the market participants so that decisions of policy,operation,and dispute resolution be free of the discriminatory impetus inherent in the old system.
id.citing order,ferc stats.regs,at.the california electric power industry responded in part by restructuring its market and establishing the california independent system operator california iso or caiso.see pacific gas,at.
in the period immediately after the commission issued order,ferc monitored one element of open access transmission agreements between operators of generators and transmission a basis.national ass of regulatory util.comm rs ferc naruc.in its proceedings regarding the establishment and implementation of the california iso,for example,the commission considered,inter alia,whether participating transmission owners ptos should have the exclusive right to perform facilities studies necessary for interconnection,or whether the california iso should be made the coordinator for all expansion projects,including any necessary studies.pacific gas,at.at that time,the commission concluded that the ptos should retain responsibility for performing such studies.id.at.
the approach,however,produced an increasing number of disputes,and,in its order,ferc concluded that this approach was an inadequate and inefficient means to address interconnection issues.standardization of generator interconnection agreements and procedures,order,at.in the interests of achieving transparency and preventing transmission facility owners from favoring affiliated generators over independents in interconnection,the commission decided to require all transmission facilities to adopt a standard agreement for interconnecting with generators larger than megawatts.naruc,at.ferc order series required all public utilities that own,control,or operate facilities used for transmitting electricity in interstate commerce to file revised open access transmission tariffs that include pro forma large generator interconnection procedures and a pro forma large generator interconnection agreement,unless the commission approved a utility request for a regional variance from the standard terms.order,at.
among other things,order pro forma procedures address interconnection studies,which are performed to evaluate a proposed interconnection in detail,identify any adverse system impacts,and specify any facility modifications needed to complete the interconnection safely and reliably.id.at.the procedures provide that the interconnection studies will be performed by,or at the direction of,the transmission provider.id.in california,the transmission provider is the california iso,which exercises operational control over the facilities owned by the california ptos,including pg e,southern california edison company,and san diego gas electric company.see california indep.operator,at first order on review pg e br.in its orders on rehearing of order,ferc clarified various aspects of the pro forma procedures,including the requirement that interconnection studies be performed by the transmission provider.see generally order,order,order.this court upheld the order series against an unrelated challenge in naruc.
pg e submitted its initial order compliance filing in january,and made an amended filing to comply with order and in january.it submitted its order compliance filing in february.see first order on review,at.those filings proposed that,instead of having the transmission provider conduct the interconnection studies,each affected pto would continue to conduct the studies in its own service territory.id.at.in its first order on review,ferc rejected that proposal.with each affected pto conducting system studies,ferc said,a generator could be required to coordinate and pay for studies conducted by all three ptos instead of having one set of studies that would examine the effect of the interconnection and additional generation on the caiso grid as a whole.id.ferc was concerned that,if the interconnecting pto continues to conduct the studies,there is a risk that separate transmission investments will work at and possibly even hurt reliability.id.it also declared that allowing the ptos to conduct the studies undermines the very independence on which the commission relies.id.ferc therefore held that caiso must adopt a centralized study process,in which caiso itself conducts the studies.id.
in subsequent orders,the commission held that the ptos may participate in the interconnection studies and retain review and recommendation rights,but that they generally may not conduct the studies or retain consent rights over them.see california indep.operator,at second order on review california indep.operator,at third order on review california indep.operator,at fourth order on review.the commission again repeated its concern that caiso must manage its system study process so that an interconnecting generator is not unduly burdened by coordinating multiple studies with the ptos.second order on review,at.and it rejected pg e claim that,in requiring the california iso rather than the ptos to perform the interconnection studies,the commission violated federal power act.ferc concluded that this claim was,among other things,an impermissible collateral attack on order.third order on review,at see fourth order on review,at.
pg e now seeks review of ferc first through fourth orders.
pg e contends that the orders below,which require that the california iso rather than the ptos must perform interconnection studies,violate of the federal power act because ferc did not first find that the practice,in which ptos performed the studies,had become unjust,unreasonable,unduly discriminatory or preferential.a see atlantic city ferc.ferc responds that the requirement that the iso perform the studies was first announced not in the orders below,but rather in the order series,which pg e did not challenge on that ground.ferc contends that pg e petition is therefore foreclosed because it is a collateral attack on the order series.
section b of the federal power act permits a party to obtain review of a ferc order in this court by filing a petition within sixty days after the
