this conflict of interest case grew out of a suit and centering on the activities of appellants michael aloyan and hub city solid waste services,hub.the city of compton had awarded a year waste collection franchise to hub.some years later,compton terminated the franchise.hub sued for breach of contract.compton against hub and aloyan,seeking to void the contract and disgorge funds from appellants.
the trial court found that aloyan was hub alter ego,and granted summary adjudication in favor of compton on its claim for declaratory relief that it did not breach the franchise agreement when terminating it.at trial,compton advanced two conflict of interest theories under government code section section,arguing that aloyan had a prohibited financial interest in the franchise because of his role in managing compton waste division,and the franchise was void because members of the compton city council had illegal interests related to campaign contributions and favors given by hub and aloyan.a jury unanimously found that appellants had violated section and were liable for over million in damages to compton.compton motion for nonsuit was then granted as to appellants complaint.
this appeal followed.appellants argue section does not apply because neither aloyan nor hub was an official or employee of the city,and there was insufficient evidence to prove bribery of city council members.we disagree.evidence presented at trial supported a finding that aloyan,through aus,acted as a public official in advising compton on its waste collection operations.there also was sufficient evidence showing that the campaign contributions and jobs for the council members relatives were provided in return for the council members approval of the franchise agreement with hub.the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the introduction of evidence about aloyan prior involvement with payments to public officials in connection with government contracts.
appellants also claim that the trial court erred in determining that aloyan was hub alter ego,and that disgorgement was not the appropriate remedy.as we shall explain,we do not agree.
factual and procedural summary 
following rules on appellate review after a trial on the merits,we construe the facts in the light most favorable to the judgment.woodman partners sofa u love th,d.
private vendors held franchises for compton waste collection operations.these agreements were due to expire in.in,compton assistant city manager,lawrence adams,was instructed to study the feasibility of the city internalizing its waste management services.requests for proposals for new franchise agreements were suspended.a feasibility study and an associated business plan projected more than in annual savings for compton if it brought its waste management.
beginning in,aloyan advised adams and other city staff about compton efforts to establish an waste management division.aloyan had been involved with the city waste management in the early,and adams valued his expertise.in may,compton entered into a management agreement with aloyan company,american utilities services limited liability company aus under the management agreement,aus was an independent contractor but assumed many of the city waste management needs adams described aus as providing the private management of the city waste operation.before the city began collecting waste in september,aloyan identified vendors,and negotiated to acquire trucks,refuse containers,and real estate on behalf of the city.he negotiated a transfer station disposal contract and a contract for a maintenance facility.aloyan had discretion over which vendors to solicit,and influenced the city staffing decisions.he assisted compton with the acquisition of insurance,and discussed the possibility of outsourcing waste hauling operations to a private contractor.under the agreement aloyan acted as the director of the waste division,working alongside city employees,overseeing operations of compton waste management division,and taking responsibility for public education and compliance with state mandated recycling and waste reduction efforts.the agreement remained in force until february.
in,compton decided to terminate the city police department and contract with the los angeles county sheriff department for law enforcement services.in the summer of,compton controller released a report showing an unexpected transition liability of million arising from severance pay for police officers and other costs.shortly thereafter,aloyan approached adams and offered compton million in return for taking over the waste disposal operation on a franchise basis.a day or two later,aloyan submitted a written proposal to that effect on behalf of aus.aloyan proposal was later reduced to a million initial fee plus in annual fees for a year contract.aloyan proposed licensing the city newly purchased trucks,equipment and facilities from compton,and hiring the city waste management employees.
adams recommended to the city council that,because of the urgent need for funding to address the police department liability,compton negotiate with aus rather than solicit bids for a franchise.in september,aloyan created hub,and substituted that entity as the proposed franchisee.hub had no trucks,equipment,or facilities 
in december,the city council held a public hearing on the proposed franchise with hub.the process was a topic of discussion,as was aloyan reputation and character.the council voted in favor of awarding the franchise to hub.as we discuss in detail,post,in february,shortly after franchise operations began,hub made contributions to council members delores zurita,amen rahh,and mayor omar bradley.all had voted in favor of the franchise.hub was the largest contributor to each council member campaign.the only council member who voted against the franchise did not receive a campaign contribution.
after the franchise was awarded,hub hired several of bradley relatives.bradley brother,henry bradley,was hired although he had no experience in waste management,because he was valued by aloyan as the biggest bookie in compton.hub also hired or gave monetary gifts of approximately each to other relatives of bradley and council member zurita,including wayne bradley,janna zurita,fatin bradley,jerome taylor,charlotte bradley,and jamal bradley.
in september,the city council voted to terminate the franchise agreement.the termination was based on hub failure to file required campaign finance disclosures for contributions to compton city council members,its alleged violation of section,and aloyan conviction in federal court for attempted bribery in connection with a trash contract with the city of carson.appellants commenced this action later that month.the operative complaint was filed by hub against compton in december,and claimed breach of contract,bad faith,unjust enrichment,and declaratory relief.in january,compton filed a against appellants,asserting claims for violation of section,declaratory relief,and alter ego liability against aloyan for hub actions.answers were filed and the actions were consolidated.
the trial court denied compton motion for summary adjudication of its cause of action seeking declaratory relief as to whether its termination of the franchise agreement amounted to breach.the court found that appellants had raised triable issues of fact.in december of,both parties filed motions to bifurcate the trial on the issue of alter ego liability,but disputed the order in which that issue would be tried.the trial court decided to try aloyan alter ego liability before the merits of the parties claims.after a bench trial,the court found that aloyan was the alter ego of hub for purposes of the.
in july,the trial court,acting sua sponte,reconsidered its denial of compton motion for summary adjudication.following briefing and argument,the court entered summary adjudication as to compton cause of action for declaratory relief,finding that compton did not breach the franchise agreement by terminating it without providing aloyan notice,hearing,or an opportunity to cure.
in a motion in limine,appellants unsuccessfully sought to exclude evidence about prior acts of aloyan.the challenged evidence showed that aloyan offered to sell aus to an executive of the waste management corporation,and aloyan threatened that if waste management did not purchase aus,aloyan would advise other cities to bring their waste management services,depriving waste management of business.aloyan told the executive about his plan to purchase compton waste division,and suggested that he was well acquainted with compton officials.the challenged evidence also showed that aloyan had been involved with payments to compton city council members in the related to government contracts,and had been convicted of attempted bribery of a member of the city of carson city council for which he served five months in a federal prison camp.appellants also challenged the introduction of evidence that hub had paid to an organization controlled by an individual named albert robles 
jury trial commenced in october.the issues remaining were appellants claim for money owed under the franchise agreement prior to termination,and compton for restitution of all amounts paid to hub under the franchise agreement.at the close of appellants,compton moved for nonsuit,arguing the franchise was void because it lacked a mayoral signature after trial the motion was granted.the jury returned a unanimous verdict,finding the franchise was obtained in violation of section,and awarded compton on its.this appeal from the judgment followed.
discussion 
appellants argue the trial court erred in its application of the doctrine.they contend that because the court bifurcated the proceedings to determine alter ego before the merits of the parties claims were tried,there was no finding that hub engaged in malfeasance necessitating the application doctrine.this claim does not have merit.
in california,two conditions must be met before the alter ego doctrine will be invoked.first,there must be such a unity of interest and ownership between the corporation and its equitable owner that the separate personalities of the corporation and the shareholder do not in reality exist.second,there must be an inequitable result if the acts in question are treated as those of the corporation alone.sonora diamond superior court th,d.the essence of the alter ego doctrine is that justice be done.what the formula comes down to,once shorn of verbiage about control,instrumentality,agency,and corporate entity,is that liability is imposed to reach an equitable result.citation.mesler bragg management cal d.
in determining a unity of interest between appellants,the trial court found hub was formed for the sole purpose of entering into the franchise agreement with compton,it was inadequately capitalized,and diverted assets to pay among other things for aloyan personal credit card expenses and criminal defense expenses.the trial court also found that hub did not have a board of directors as required by its articles of incorporation,and that aloyan was hub sole shareholder,director,and officer.aloyan was represented by the same attorneys as hub in the underlying transaction with compton and in the present action.appellants do not challenge the trial court finding that there was a unity of interest,but argue there was insufficient evidence to show an inequitable result would occur if hub alone was found liable on the claims alleged by compton in its.
the alter ego doctrine does not guard every unsatisfied creditor of a corporation but instead affords protection where some conduct amounting to bad faith makes it inequitable for the corporate owner to hide behind the corporate form.sonora diamond superior court,supra,th at,d.the trial court found that inequity would result if the wrongdoing the city alleges in its were treated as those of hub alone.because of aloyan practice of diverting hub cash in the form of distributions to himself and others,advances,and payment of aloyan personal expenses hub remained essentially undercapitalized,while aloyan personal wealth increased.under these circumstances in the event that the city obtains a verdict against hub and aloyan on its,it would be unjust to limit the city to recovering from hub alone t he evidence in phase i of the trial overwhelmingly demonstrates that aloyan conduct amounting to bad faith makes it inequitable for him to hide behind the corporate veil.
appellants argue that no malfeasance on the part of hub had been shown at the bench trial,and also contend that the inability of compton to collect from hub was not a sufficient basis for the determination of alter ego.hub inability to pay was not the basis for the determination the trial court found bad faith conduct on the part of aloyan.hub was a vehicle created by aloyan solely for the waste management franchise with compton,and ceased to exist when the franchise agreement was terminated.hub was undercapitalized and used as a source of funds for a variety of purposes not related to the franchise aloyan abused the corporate privilege the evidence showed that an inequitable result would occur if hub alone was held liable.
appellants argue the trial court applied the doctrine in reverse to hold that aloyan conviction for attempted bribery could be imputed to hub and thereby provide a basis for compton termination of the franchise agreement.as we discuss in part v,infra,we do not reach the appeal of the order granting summary adjudication,and we therefore do not consider this contention.
in its statement of decision following the trial on,the trial court found that cross defendant michael aloyan is the alter ego of cross defendant hub city for the purposes of the claims alleged against hub in the of the city of compton.the court expressed the doctrine incorrectly,but there was no error in its application.the piercing of the corporate veil is justified as an equitable remedy when the shareholders have abused the corporate form to evade individual liability,circumvent a statute,or accomplish a wrongful purpose.postal instant press,kaswa th,d,citing witkin,summary of cal.law ed.corporations.aloyan used hub as a shell corporation,and there was no error in the trial court application of the alter ego doctrine to hold aloyan accountable for hub actions should the jury find that section was violated.
appellants argue that section was not violated.they challenge both theories of liability advanced by compton,contending that neither aloyan nor aus was a public official or employee falling within the scope of the statute,and that there is insufficient evidence to prove bribery of compton city council members.
section provides,in pertinent part c ity officers or employees shall not be financially interested in any contract made by them in their official capacity,or by any body or board of which they are members.any contract in which an official is financially interested is void,klistoff superior court th,d.a person in an advisory position to a city may fall within the scope of section.in particular,independent contractors whose official capacities carry the potential to exert considerable influence over the contracting decisions of a public agency may not have personal interests in that agency contracts.california housing finance agency management accounting center,th,d california housing finance agency.
appellants argue there was insufficient evidence showing that aloyan or aus was a public official or employee under section.we disagree.section has been applied to attorneys who render their professional services to a city even though they may have the common law status of an independent contractor.see people gnass th,d defendant partner at private law firm acting as city attorney under a contract violated section based on fees earned in connection with bond issues campagna city of sanger th,d private attorney liable under section for profiting from contingency fee agreement with outside law firm schaefer berinstein d,contract attorney violated section by purchasing properties from city at below fair market value.appellants attempt to distinguish these cases,arguing that corporate consultants such as aus do not owe municipalities the fiduciary duty of an attorney.that may be so,but the statute is not limited to abuse of the relationship.section is a prophylactic against personal gain at public expense.klistoff superior court,supra,th at,d.an individual status as an official under that statute turns on the extent to which the person influences an agency contracting decisions or otherwise acts in a capacity that demands the public trust.see california housing finance agency,supra,th at,d.
the evidence presented at trial was sufficient to establish that aloyan fell within the ambit of section.pursuant to the management agreement between aus and compton,aloyan supervised city staff,negotiated contracts,and purchased equipment and real estate on behalf of the city.his activities served a public function,and he was intricately involved in the city waste management decisions.as hub alter ego see part i,supra,aloyan had a personal financial stake in the franchise agreement.that interest was neither remote nor speculative,and resulted in an immediate and obvious conflict of interest.it cast doubt on whether aloyan was acting in compton best interest when he proposed franchising the city waste management services and licensing equipment and facilities.
appellants argue that aloyan made the franchise agreement between compton and hub on hub behalf and not as a representative of the city.the negotiations,discussions,reasoning,planning and give and take leading to the execution of a contract are deemed to be part of the making of an agreement under section.people gnass,supra,th at,d,citing stigall city of taft cal d.the purpose of section is to prevent a situation where a public official would stand to gain or lose something with respect to the making of a contract over which in his official capacity he could exercise some influence.id.at,d.as its private manager,aloyan had a unique understanding of compton waste management system.he influenced staffing decisions and negotiated to acquire equipment and property.aloyan was still in his official capacity when he proposed a waste management franchise to adams,and continued in that capacity as he negotiated the franchise agreement with compton and prepared the city waste division for the franchise implementation.
in a conversation in may or june of with ray burke,an executive from waste management,aloyan offered to sell aus to waste management.aloyan told burke that his strategy with compton was to get the city into the collection business,and then he was going to purchase the business from the city.aloyan suggested that he would obtain the franchise because he knew the city of compton officials very well.as we discussed,aloyan also told burke that unless waste management purchased aus for million,aloyan would advise other cities where waste management had business to eliminate their agreements with waste management and secure their own solid waste services.this conversation shows aloyan intended to use his position as a private manager of compton waste division to make a franchise agreement with that city,and planned to pursue similar schemes in other cities.we discuss the admissibility of this evidence in part iii,infra.
the evidence reasonably supports the conclusion that aloyan leveraged his public position for access to city officials and influenced them for his pecuniary benefit.aloyan,through aus,performed public functions that brought his actions within section prohibition on.appellants argue that the involvement of appellants counsel and compton city attorney in franchise negotiations shows that aloyan did not make the contract pursuant to section.but there is substantial evidence showing that aloyan made the franchise agreement with compton in his official capacity,as he used his access to city officials and position in compton government to secure a public contract.in so doing,he violated section.
appellants argue that because aus,and not aloyan individually,was the contractual manager of compton waste division,aloyan can not be subject to liability under section.the trial court did not determine alter ego as to aloyan and aus.but this was not necessary.see people honig th,d however devious and winding the trail may be which connects the officer with the forbidden contract,if it can be followed and the connection made,a conflict of interest is established.aloyan,aus president,signed the management agreement with compton.aloyan expertise motivated compton to enter the agreement,which provided for aloyan personal involvement in compton affairs.aus status as the contracting entity with compton was immaterial because aloyan actions fell within the scope of section.
appellants claim there was no showing that compton city council members or mayor bradley were financially interested in the franchise agreement for purposes of section.specifically,they argue that the record contains no affirmative proof that aloyan bribed city council members by offering them campaign contributions and jobs for their relatives in return for the members votes approving the franchise agreement.
appellants do not claim that campaign contributions are not financial interests under section,but,citing buckley valeo,d,argue that we should consider the primacy of the right to political speech when analyzing the sufficiency of the evidence showing the council members were financially interested in the franchise agreement.they contend that only direct evidence should be sufficient to prove contributions were made in exchange for votes,rather than as legitimate support for the members position on the agreement.
we find no authority for their assertion that only direct evidence may be considered on this issue.we conclude that all admissible evidence direct and circumstantial may be considered,and the evidence in this case was sufficient to show that the council members,including the mayor,had illegal interests in the contract within the meaning of section.financial interests prohibited by section are not limited to express agreements for benefit and need not be proven by direct evidence.rather,forbidden interests extend to expectations of benefit by express or implied agreement and may be inferred from the circumstances.people honig,supra,th at,d.in breakzone billiards city of torrance th,d breakzone billiards,the court found that council members who had received campaign contributions ranging from to more than months before a vote did not have a prohibited financial interest under section because there was no evidence the members received a personal benefit that swayed their judgment.id.at,d.in considering whether there was a common law conflict of interest violation,the court noted in dicta we contrast the facts of this case with one in which it is alleged the campaign contribution is made in return for an express promise to act in a particular way in exercising governmental authority with respect to a particular matter then pending or which may be presented for governmental review and action at a later date we do not foreclose a circumstance in which an earlier governmental action is rewarded in an illegal manner.id.at,d.while this prescient dictum is addressed to a hypothetical express promise the decision did not foreclose the adequacy of proof by circumstantial evidence as sufficient to render a contract void under section.
we conclude that proof that a campaign contribution constitutes an illegal interest within the meaning of section may be shown by circumstantial evidence.the purpose of section is to prohibit,not legitimate political activity.breakzone billiards,supra,th at,d.public policy strongly encourages the giving and receiving of campaign contributions.woodland hills residents,city council cal d.but the statute must be broadly construed to further the legislature purpose of regulating the conduct of public officials.carson redevelopment agency padilla th,d.to do otherwise would permit certain categories of schemes and improprieties to go unchecked,a result which would undermine the public confidence not only in the government,but in the court system ruling on such cases.ibid.the fact that persons or entities make campaign contributions to officials who favor a particular position or who support the donee does not prove illegality.but illegality is proven if there is an understanding that a payment is made in anticipation of political favor or on account of favors given,and then only if the political act was made on account of the payment or agreement to pay.this may be,but rarely is,shown by direct evidence of a scheme to repay an official award of a public contract through campaign contributions made by the contracting entity.it also may be shown by circumstantial evidence.
when findings of fact are challenged on appeal,we are bound by the familiar and highly deferential substantial evidence standard of review.this standard calls for review of the entire record to determine whether there is any substantial evidence,contradicted or not contradicted,to support the findings below.we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party,drawing all reasonable inferences and resolving all conflicts in its favor.people ex rel.brown tri union seafoods,llc th,d.
in this case the evidence was sufficient to support a finding that certain compton city council members supported hub franchise proposal in return for campaign contributions from hub.the franchise proposal was not put out to bid.at the hearing where the city council considered hub proposal,no mention was made of compton financial difficulties,although the termination of the city police department was the ostensible reason for the city decision to its waste management.although appellants offer innocent explanations for the form in which the franchise proposal was presented to the council,we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party.cassim allstate ins.cal th.
there was opposition from members of the public to the agreement that centered on the process and aloyan reputation,including opposition from a member of congress who questioned the propriety of the deal.a member of the public who spoke in favor of hub proposal later received a political contribution from hub,and in was hired by the company as a community representative.at the hearing,a representative of a waste management company requested hours to prepare a competing bid.his comments were met with applause from the audience,but no such opportunity was given.despite what appears to have been nearly unanimous public opposition,the council voted to in favor of granting the franchise to hub.
in february,the franchise went into effect.that month,hub began making campaign donations in compton and neighboring cities that totaled some.hub payments were made directly and exclusively from revenues generated by the company franchise with compton.was donated in february,to a campaign committee for mayor bradley.an additional was donated to bradley committee in march of,in april,and in may.in and,hub donated to the campaign committee of council member rahh.was donated to the committee of council member zurita in,and in.during these reporting periods,hub was the largest contributor to both rahh and zurita.no donation was given to the council member who voted against the franchise.
as appellants claim,there is no evidence of an express agreement showing that the donations were made in return for the votes of council members in favor of the franchise agreement.but,there is sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find that the votes in favor of the agreement were cast in anticipation of the contributions,and the payments were made on account of them.the council members approved the deal even though the city had only recently brought its waste management,and a majority of the public who spoke at the city council hearing opposed the franchise.the donations,particularly those to bradley committee,were made close in time to the council approval of the franchise,and constituted substantial portions of the council members campaign funds.breakzone billiards,supra,th at,d.
hub employment of relatives of bradley and zurita provided further evidence of those individuals personal interest in the franchise agreement.employment of an official relatives may constitute a prohibited interest under section.see people honig,supra,th at,d finding employment and remuneration of official wife by nonprofit organization benefiting from government contract a financial interest.evidence was presented that at least one of the relatives hired by hub was unqualified.city staff member kareemah bradford testified that,the week after the franchise went into effect,aloyan asked her to train bradley cousin and zurita daughter,janna zurita,for a community affairs position at hub.after speaking with janna zurita,bradford refused,telling aloyan that she would not train unqualified relatives of city council members.subsequent to her conversation with aloyan,bradford was transferred to a city position where she had no duties,and was later returned to her position after filing a grievance.
evidence of aloyan prior acts showed the campaign contributions were part of his design or plan to influence public officials to award government contracts to his businesses.when working at a waste management company called murcole in the,aloyan delivered a campaign contribution to the of compton to elicit that official support for a rate hike for murcole.aloyan testified against the mayor at the mayor criminal trial under a grant of immunity from the federal government.at about the same time,aloyan was involved with a company called compton entertainment,which lobbied the compton city council to support its opening of a card club and casino in that city.aloyan gave a campaign contribution on behalf of the company to a council member who was generally opposed to gambling in the city.the council member had said she would kill the project unless compton entertainment,gave her money.she left the council without voting on the project,and aloyan testified about her extortion at a criminal trial in under a grant of immunity.in,aloyan gave a carson city council member a payment in exchange for the council member support for hub solid waste disposal contract with that city this payment led to aloyan conviction for attempted bribery for which he served five months in a federal prison camp.we discuss admissibility of these other acts in the next section of this opinion.
taken together,the facts give rise to the inference that the campaign contributions from hub constituted prohibited financial interests.a reasonable person could conclude that the city council members and bradley considered and approved the franchise agreement with hub because they stood to benefit financially from its execution.while the evidence does not preclude other inferences,we must indulge every reasonable inference in support of the verdict.people ex rel.brown tri union seafoods,llc,supra,th at,d.the record shows that the jury could have reasonably found that the franchise agreement violated section.
appellants argue that the plain language of section requires a prohibited financial interest to be in the contract,not ancillary to it.they contend that this means that bribery is not an interest in the agreement under section.this is not a correct reading of the law.see carson redevelopment agency padilla,supra,th at,d s ection applies even when a public official financial interest flows from a source that is independent of a public contract klistoff superior court,supra,th at,d s ection is aimed at any interest,other than an interest that is too remote and speculative,that could compromise a public official judgment or cast doubt on whether he executed his duties with the utmost allegiance,diligence,and loyalty to his office.further,the evidence in this case does not support appellants contention because the contributions received by the council members was paid directly from the franchise proceeds.
appellants claim the trial court erred in admitting evidence about aloyan past involvement with payments to compton city council members and members of the carson city council,and burke testimony about his conversation with aloyan.the court found this evidence was admissible to demonstrate a common plan or scheme,as well as to prove aloyan knowledge,motive and intent,to influence government action
