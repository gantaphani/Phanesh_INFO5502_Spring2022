in the federal energy regulatory commission issued order in the hopes of fostering competition in the electric generating industry.such competition clearly depended on generators having adequate means of getting their power to market.ferc solution in order was to require transmission providers,which typically have a natural monopoly,to give generators equal access to transmission facilities.the commission implemented the requirement in part by mandating the filing of suitable tariffs.see transmission access policy study group ferc,taps.we affirmed order in taps.
in the period directly after issuing order,ferc had monitored one element of the interconnection agreements between operators of generators and transmission a basis.finding that approach inadequate and inefficient,ferc issued order and three successive rehearing orders.standardization of generator interconnection agreements and procedures,order,at p,order on reh g,order,order on reh g,order,order on reh g,order.in the interests of achieving transparency and preventing transmission facility owners from favoring affiliated generators over independents in interconnection,the orders require all transmission facilities to adopt a standard agreement for interconnecting with generators larger than megawatts.
here we review claims advanced by two sets of petitioners the two sets are generally aligned with each other in their positions four utilities utility petitioners and six state regulatory agencies together with an association of such agencies,the national association of regulatory utility commissioners governmental petitioners.they challenge order and its sequels on the grounds that ferc exceeded its jurisdiction,unlawfully commandeered states,departed from its own precedent without explanation,and made policy decisions that are arbitrary and capricious.we reject all of these claims and affirm the orders.
petitioners raise a succession of claims that ferc orders usurp jurisdiction not provided by congress.ferc interpretations of the jurisdictional provisions of the federal power act the act enjoy chevron deference.detroit edison ferc,citing taps,at.
section b of the act makes the statute applicable to the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce and to the sale of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce and gives ferc jurisdiction not only over such transmission and sales but also over all facilities for such transmission or sale of electric energy.b.at the same time the act precludes ferc jurisdiction over facilities used in local distribution or only for the transmission of electric energy in intrastate commerce.id.order asserts jurisdiction over the terms of interconnection between generators and transmission providers,even where the transmission facility also engages in local distribution,but only insofar as the interconnections are for the purpose of making sales of electric energy for resale in interstate commerce.order at p.utility petitioners claim that this represents an unlawful exercise of jurisdiction over that engage in both transmission and local distribution.
petitioners believe that our opinion in detroit edison controls.there we rejected ferc attempt to assert jurisdiction over unbundled retail service,although such service involved neither jurisdictional sales nor jurisdictional transmission.sales under tariffs would have enabled the shipper to escape stranded cost charges imposed under tariffs.at.ferc purported jurisdictional hook was that the power was being shipped over facilities that provided both retail and wholesale distribution services.id.at.we were unconvinced by this theory for asserting jurisdiction over transactions.
here the issue is the inverse of detroit edison order applies to jurisdictional transactions only.ferc determined that the provisions of order should apply to interconnections to the facilities of a public utility transmission system that,at the time the interconnection is requested,may be used either to transmit electric energy in interstate commerce or to sell electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce.order at p.interconnections,though seemingly not defined explicitly in the orders,clearly are not facilities,as that would make the term interconnection facilities,as used in the standardized agreements,a redundancy.see,order at.in fact interconnections appear to be relationships between parties with respect to electricity flowing over facilities,and the orders here by their terms control the agreements governing those relationships.see,standard large generator interconnection agreement lgia,id.at.by establishing standard agreements ferc has exercised its jurisdiction over the terms of those relationships.taps,at fpa makes clear that all aspects of wholesale sales are subject to federal regulation,regardless of the facilities used.emphasis added.
in their reply briefs petitioners note that the orders regulate certain facets of the engineering and construction of facilities needed for the relevant transmissions.utility petitioners reply br.at governmental petitioners reply br.at.but petitioners identify no specific aspect of the regulations that they claim is untethered to the commission authority over interstate transmissions and wholesale sales.as ferc authority generally rests on the public interest in constraining exercises of market power,see associated gas distributors ferc,whether in the utility rates or other service terms,and as a common test for the lawfulness of rates is their connection to the costs of providing the regulated service,national fuel gas supply ferc,it is hard to see how the statute could leave ferc weaponless against conduct that might encourage or cloak the running up of unreasonable costs.the commission indisputable authority to disallow recovery of costs imprudently incurred by jurisdictional firms may,of course,impinge as a practical matter on the behavior of ones.so far as appears,petitioners in this facial attack have identified no impingement that exceeds what may be encompassed in such conventional exercises of jurisdiction.
utility petitioners also dispute ferc assertion of jurisdiction over facilities jointly owned by private firms and states.this presents questions analogous to those raised by the facilities just discussed,though here the divide is between private and public ownership rather than between transmission and distribution.section f of the act provides that n o provision in this subchapter shall apply to,or be deemed to include,the united states,a state or any political subdivision of a state.f.they are brought back in with respect to particular sections not relevant here.see of the act,bonneville power administration ferc,cir.therefore,according to petitioners,ferc may not regulate facilities.although order explicitly states that it applies only to interconnection service provided by the public utility on its portion of a jointly owned facility,order at p,petitioners claim that ferc purported distinction is not possible.in their view,an interconnection affects an entire facility,not simply the public utility portion,and ferc purported exercise of authority over the service therefore violates f.the argument fails for reasons similar to those discussed in the context of ferc authority to regulate jurisdictional transactions occurring over facilities.
any proper construction of must give effect to both ferc jurisdiction over certain transactions occurring over public utilities and to f exclusion of state facilities.as ferc notes in its brief,jurisdictional utilities should not be able,without linguistic support from congress,to escape regulation simply by partnering with utilities.respondent br.at.ferc navigated a similar problem in order,which required equal access to transmission services.there the commission stated clearly that it had authority to regulate a public utility,notwithstanding incidental effects on nonjurisdictional entities 
the fact that a public utility may jointly own,with a entity,transmission facilities through which it engages in sales for resale transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce does not alter the commission authority to regulate that public utility the fact that an order may affect a joint owner does not undermine the validity of the commission order.
order,ferc stats.regs.at.ferc relied on the same logic in order.see order at p.utility petitioners accept the validity of order as well as other cases that they view as distinguishable from the present situation.see,area power pool,at bonneville power,at.
according to petitioners,however,order affected the entities only in the sense of invalidating contractual provisions between jurisdictional and,whereas order addresses the request for and construction of facilities by a.utility petitioners reply br.at.the supposed distinction is of no account,however.as discussed above,assertion of jurisdiction over specified transactions,even though affecting the conduct of the owner s with respect to its facilities,is not per se an exercise of jurisdiction over the facility.the contract modifications mandated in order,forcing the owner to permit certain transactions to occur over the jointly owned facility,obviously affected that owner ownership rights in,and conduct with respect to,the facility the modifications removed a hitherto valid veto power over the use in question.to the extent that order conditions a jurisdictional utility participation in the transmission and interconnection markets on that utility securing physical changes in the facilities,and those changes bear a close enough relation to ferc exercise of jurisdiction over jurisdictional transactions petitioners pose no challenge to the adequacy of that relation,the order effects no legally material extension of the authority exercised in order.
the governmental petitioners challenge ferc articulation of its assertion of jurisdiction over interconnections with facilities ones for transmission and local distribution namely,ferc claim of authority where such facilities are used to transmit electric energy in interstate commerce on behalf of a wholesale purchaser pursuant to a oatt open access transmission tariff.order at p.see also order at p.governmental petitioners claim that this involves jurisdictional.they cite our opinion in columbia gas transmission ferc,where ferc had asserted jurisdiction based solely on a voluntarily filed tariff even if ferc would not otherwise have jurisdiction.id.at.here we have the exact opposite of.ferc is exercising jurisdiction only over interconnections to a distribution facility when the facility is included in a public utility oatt and the interconnection is for the purpose of facilitating a jurisdictional wholesale sale of electric energy.order at p emphasis added.
governmental petitioners also object that ferc approach creates uncertainty by making jurisdiction turn on among other things whether the facility is covered by an oatt.ferc acknowledged the potentiality for uncertainty,but reasoned that most cases would present no controversy and that,if a dispute should arise,it would depend in the first instance on the transmission provider to make the relevant information available to potential interconnecting customers.order at p.on the record before us,we see no grounds for upsetting the commission judgment.
closely related to the jurisdictional claims is the governmental petitioners assertion that ferc erred by not applying its test,which we approved in taps,at,to determine whether a facility is an exempt local distribution facility or a covered transmission facility.but here,as often mentioned above,at least with regard to the exercises of power disputed before us,ferc is exerting jurisdiction over transactions,based on the transactions satisfaction of the act jurisdictional criteria.it thus has had no occasion to decide whether a facility as such should be classified as jurisdictional or not.
in its proposal leading to order ferc had contemplated requiring transmission providers to use reasonable efforts,including available eminent domain authority,if necessary,to facilitate the interconnection of generators.see order at p.responding to comments suggesting that the requirement would unduly burden transmission firms,id.at p,ferc reduced this to a provision forbidding such firms from discriminating in the exercise of eminent domain powers to the detriment of independent generators and to the advantage of affiliates.see,order at p.utility petitioners object that these provisions of order and its sequels impermissibly commandeer states eminent domain authority,contrary to the supreme court holdings in new york united states,d,and printz united states,d.whether ferc has commandeered states is a question of law that we review de novo.
the orders here are a far cry from what the supreme court found objectionable in new york and printz.in new york,the court invalidated a provision of the radioactive waste policy amendments of that gave states a hobson choice either take title to radioactive waste generated by third parties or regulate the waste pursuant to congress direction.congress did have authority to impose either option on states directly and thus could not force states to choose one or the other.the court emphasized that congress may not commandeer states by compelling them either to create or administer a federal regulatory scheme.at.in printz the court found that new york principle precluded a provision of the brady handgun violence prevention act requiring local law enforcement officers to help conduct background checks on individuals seeking to purchase a firearm.at.
we recognize that a state authority to exercise the eminent domain power,and to license public utilities to do so,is an important state power.but ferc has done nothing more than impose a provision on public utilities.the orders explicitly leave state law untouched,specifying that any exercise of eminent domain by a public utility pursuant to the orders mandate be consistent with state law.order at,lgia see also id.at p.thus the states remain completely free to continue licensing public utilities to exercise eminent domain,or to discontinue that practice.to be sure,if hitherto a utility would not have exercised eminent domain to enable interconnection with an independent generator,the orders,conditionally,compel the utility either to broaden its use of the authority for the benefit of independents,or to drop the use for its own and its affiliates power.but the modifier conditionally is critical.nothing in the federal rule compels either continued state retention of the license,or public utilities continued employment of eminent domain.the intrusion on state power is surely no greater than many would say dramatically less than that of a federal command that,if a state hires employees for the performance of traditional governmental functions,it must pay them no less than a federally determined wage.see garcia san antonio metropolitan transit authority,d.moreover,we believe that our dissenting colleague focus on the plain statement requirement that applies to purported federal creation of state obligations is misplaced the orders here leave state law completely undisturbed and bind only state officials.
related to utility petitioners commandeering claim is their assertion that order involves an unlawful taking.they concede,as they must,that the order explicitly requires that any uses of eminent domain by transmission providers be at the expense of the benefiting generator.order at p.but the utility petitioners claim that exercising eminent domain power on behalf of independent generators could undermine transmission providers good will in their relation to landowners.assuming that that is so,we note that petitioners make no claim that the injury to such good will is any more severe than the one inflicted by uses of eminent domain for interconnection to affiliated generators.rules commonly require the incurrence of costs by the obligated parties their very imposition presupposes that some such parties would,in pursuit of their,violate the norm.we can not see that the potential loss of good will rises above the sort of costs commonly inflicted by such mandates.
the remaining significant challenge,brought by both sets of petitioners,is to the at or bey
