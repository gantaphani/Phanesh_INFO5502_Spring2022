this case presents the question,inter alia,of whether the federal energy regulatory commission ferc properly authorized and administered energy tariffs.the state of california california,through its attorney general,claims that it did not,and that california energy consumers are entitled to as much as billion in refunds.we conclude that ferc authorization of tariffs in this case complied with the federal power act,but that ferc abused its administrative discretion by declining to order refunds for violations of its reporting requirements.we therefore grant california petition in part and remand this case to ferc for refund proceedings.
california energy crisis in prompted the california public utilities commission and the california legislature to restructure the electric energy industry.the resulting legislation,assembly bill ab,was designed to dismantle the,utility model and create a deregulated market in which price would be established by competition.act of september,cal.legis.serv,codified in cal.pub.under ab,the major,utilities were required to divest a substantial portion of their power generation plants,to sell the output of their remaining generation capacity to a newly created wholesale clearinghouse known as the california power exchange corporation calpx.calpx,which was created by ab,was to provide a centralized auction market for the trading of electricity.it was thus deemed a public utility pursuant to the federal power act,see e,and thus subject to regulation by ferc,see b,d 
ab created another entity,the independent system operator iso,also subject to ferc jurisdiction,which was to be responsible for managing california electricity transmission grid and balancing electrical supply and demand.its operations were to be governed by a tariff and protocols filed with ferc.under ab,purchases and sales of wholesale power by utilities were now subject to ferc jurisdiction.cal.edison,at.
thereafter,three major utilities filed applications with ferc seeking approval of the establishment of calpx and the iso,authority to convey operational control of the transmission facilities to the iso,and authority to sell electrical energy at market based rates.see pacific gas and electric,ferc pacific gas and electric,ferc pacific gas and electric,ferc.
a condition of ferc approval of an entity rate authority was a ferc determination that the entity lacked,or had adequately mitigated market power in the california markets.ferc conducted these inquiries as a means of carrying out its statutory mandate under the federal power act to ensure just and reasonable wholesale rates for electricity.a.ferc approved the utilities requests,and granted permission for the utilities to sell electricity at rates in california.ferc also approved the establishment of the iso and calpx,which then commenced operations in late march.see generally pacific gas and electric,ferc.
in june,wholesale electricity prices increased dramatically.in august,san diego gas electric company filed a complaint under of the federal power act fpa,a,against all sellers of energy and ancillary services into the calpx and iso markets.in response,ferc instituted hearing procedures under fpa to investigate the justness and reasonableness of the rates of sellers that were subject to ferc jurisdiction into the iso and calpx markets.
electricity prices remained at high levels in the winter of,and california largest utility,pacific gas and electric company,filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code.in january of,the governor of the state of california declared a state of emergency.pursuant to that order,and in light of rolling blackouts,the governor directed the state department of water resources dwr to purchase wholesale power on the spot market.by october of,california energy resources scheduler cers,a division of dwr,had spent approximately billion buying energy on the spot market.
in november of,having reviewed san diego gas electric complaint,ferc adopted several reform measures.ferc found that the california market structure provide d the opportunity for sellers to exercise market power in times of tight supply and that such market power could result in unjust and unreasonable rates.san diego gas electric sellers of energy and ancillary services into markets operated by the california independent system operator and the california power exchange,ferc.in addition to ordering structural and rule changes,ferc ordered an evidentiary hearing to determine the appropriate refund.however,ferc limited the refund to iso and calpx spot market transactions during the period from october,through june.
a year later,the state of california filed the instant complaint against all sellers of power and ancillary services subject to ferc jurisdiction in markets operated by the iso and calpx and sellers of power to cers collectively,california wholesalers,alleging that ferc rate filing requirements violated the fpa and that,even if valid,the reports filed by electricity sellers did not contain the information the fpa requires.california claimed that ferc improper decision to limit the refund period reduced the refunds owed to california purchasers by as much as billion.
in order to remedy the alleged violations,california urged ferc to 
require the california wholesalers to comply,on a prospective basis,with section requirements 
to the extent the information was not already being provided require the california wholesalers to provide information to ferc on all of their sales to the iso,calpx and cers for the calendar years 
to the extent that any rates for power sold to the iso,calpx,or cers are found to exceed just and reasonable levels,require the california wholesalers to refund the difference between the rate charged and a just and reasonable rate,plus interest 
issue a declaration specifying that the rates for power sold to the iso,calpx,and cers are not subject to the filed rate doctrine and 
institute proceedings to determine whether any other further relief is necessary or appropriate,up to and including the revocation of the california wholesalers market based rate authority.
the california wholesalers contended,and ferc ultimately concluded,that california complaint amounted to an impermissible collateral attack on prior commission orders pertaining to ferc rate authority and procedures,on prior ferc determinations regarding refund liability,and as to ferc decisions to grant the various defendants their respective rate authority.ferc granted the complaint in part,holding that where the california wholesalers had reported aggregated rather than data,the reports failed to comply with fpa c.rather than ordering refunds for the reporting violations,however,ferc held that the failure to report transactions in the format required by ferc for quarterly reports is essentially a compliance issue for which of quarterly reports to include data is an appropriate and sufficient remedy.ferc at.
california timely filed a petition for review of ferc decision and properly invokes our jurisdiction to review final orders of ferc pursuant to b.
the federal power act governs the transmission and wholesale sales of electrical energy in interstate commerce.b.pursuant to its authority under the fpa,ferc has exclusive jurisdiction over interstate wholesale power rates.nantahala power and light thornburg,d.the fpa requires that all rates for the transmission and sale of wholesale electricity be filed with ferc and published for public review.c.ferc is obligated to ensure that wholesale power rates are just and reasonable,a,and applied in a manner,b entergy louisiana,louisiana public service com n,d.indeed,ferc authority to determine whether wholesale rates are just and reasonable is exclusive.mississippi power light mississippi,d.
much of the theory that underpins the present controversy has its roots in the filed rate doctrine,which is central to ferc operations.the filed rate doctrine was developed in the century as part of a program to regulate the ruthless exercise of monopoly power by the nation railroads.maislin industries,primary steel,d stevens,dissenting.during that period,railroad companies often charged substantially higher rates on noncompetitive routes,granted secret discounts to preferred shippers,and overcharged competitors of preferred customers.these concerns,among others,led to the passage of the interstate commerce act ica in.see interstate commerce act,ch,stat.codified as amended at scattered sections of.the great purpose of the ica,as the supreme court has said,was to regulate commerce,whilst seeking to prevent unjust and unreasonable rates,to secure equality of rates as to all,and to destroy favoritism,these last being accomplished by requiring the publication of tariffs,and by prohibiting secret departures from such tariffs,and forbidding rebates,preferences,and all other forms of undue discrimination.new york,icc.under the ica,a carrier could charge a shipper only those rates incorporated in a tariff that the carrier had filed with the icc.the rate became effective after it was filed unless the rate or the practice employed by the carrier was deemed unreasonable by the icc.the requirement that carriers collect only the rate they filed,or that the icc established,became commonly referred to as the filed rate doctrine.the doctrine,as applied,also meant that private parties could not contract for a price other than the filed rate.
the supreme court first articulated the filed rate doctrine as applied to the power industry in in utils.northwestern pub.serv.the court held that rates established in power sales contracts filed with and accepted by ferc predecessor,the federal power commission,were not only binding on the parties,but on the federal courts.id.in short,under the filed rate doctrine,once rates have been accepted for filing under fpa,utilities must adhere to those rates absent a waiver.arkansas louisiana gas hall,d.the rate filed by the wholesale seller of electricity or fixed by ferc is the only lawful charge and d eviation from it is not permitted upon any pretext.at t central office telephone,d.unless the filed rates are challenged administratively,the filed rates become the legal rates.if the rates are challenged,then ferc decides whether the rates are just and reasonable and not unduly discriminatory.parties may challenge ferc resolution of these issues in a petition for review before the appropriate united states court of appeals.b.however,appellate review is deferential.see city of seattle ferc,cir.
with a fixed rate tariff,the review process is relatively straightforward.a wholesaler would file a rate,which would become the legal rate unless challenged.if ferc determined that the rate was not just and reasonable after a challenge,then it would order refunds.
however,approximately a decade ago,companies began to file tariffs that did not specify the precise rate to be charged.as a result,ferc then departed from its historical policy of basing rates upon the cost of providing service plus a fair return on invested capital,and began approving tariffs.
california contends that the tariff system approved by ferc in this case violates the fpa because it relies on unfiled,privately negotiated rates to satisfy statutory rate filing requirements,and that this can not be sustained even when the agency has made a prior determination that market forces will drive rights into a zone of reasonableness.
in considering ferc authority,the supreme court has emphasized that the just and reasonable standard does not compel the commission to use any single pricing formula mobil oil exploration producing southeast united distribution,d discussing the just and reasonable requirement in the natural gas context.the court has recognized that the just and reasonable requirement accords ferc broad authority.id.
the use of tariffs was first approved in the natural gas context,see elizabethtown gas ferc,then as to wholesale sellers of electricity,see louisiana energy and power authority ferc.however,approval of such tariffs was conditioned on the existence of a competitive market.id.thus,applications were approved only if ferc made a finding that the seller and its affiliates did not have,or adequately had mitigated,market power.id the principle justifying this approach as just and reasonable was that i n a competitive market,where neither buyer nor seller has significant market power,it is rational to assume that the terms of their voluntary exchange are reasonable,and specifically to infer that the price is close to marginal cost,such that the seller makes only a normal return on its investment.tejas power ferc.
in support of its contention that tariffs are impermissible under the fpa,california relies on mci telecommunications v.at t,d and maislin indus.us primary steel,d.in mci,the supreme court held that the fcc could not eliminate requirements for any class of carrier,even when necessary to promote competitive markets.in maislin,the court held that the icc could not allow common carriers to charge unfiled,privately negotiated rates lower than the filed rates,even when the carriers were in highly competitive markets.id.at.as the court stated in maislin,the existence of a competitive market can not provide the icc authority to alter statutory filed rate requirements.id.at.
however,the regulatory scheme before us is different from those under consideration in mci and maislin.the agencies in mci and maislin relied on market forces alone in approving tariffs.in contrast,ferc system consists of a finding that the applicant lacks market power or has taken sufficient steps to mitigate market power,coupled with strict reporting requirements to ensure that the rate is just and reasonable and that markets are not subject to manipulation.here,ferc required the wholesale seller to file a market analysis every four months,and quarterly reports summarizing its transactions during the preceding three months.these transaction summaries include both long and contracts,purportedly with reports of some sales for intervals as small as ten minutes.ferc has affirmed in its presentation before us that it is not contending that approval of a tariff based on market forces alone would comply with the fpa or the filed rate doctrine.rather,the crucial difference between mci maislin and the present circumstances is the dual requirement of an ex ante finding of the absence of market power and sufficient reporting requirements.given this,ferc argues that its tariff does not run afoul of mci or maislin,and we agree.
california argues that different reporting requirements should have been established.however,congress specified that filings be within such time and within such form and under such rules and regulations as the commission may prescribe,c.thus,so long as ferc has approved a tariff within the scope of its fpa authority,it has broad discretion to establish effective reporting requirements for administration of the tariff.
for all of these reasons,california facial challenge to tariffs fails 
our determination that tariffs do not,per se,violate the fpa does not end our inquiry.california also argues that,even if tariffs are lawful in concept,ferc failed to administer the tariffs in accordance with their terms and abused its discretion in limiting available remedies for regulatory violations.on these issues,we agree with california.
as we have discussed,there is nothing inherent in the general concept of a tariff that violates the fpa however,as mci and maislin affirm,a tariff can not be structured so as to virtually deregulate an industry and remove it from statutorily required oversight.the structure of the tariff complied with the fpa,so long as it was coupled with enforceable reporting that would enable ferc to determine whether the rates were just and reasonable and whether market forces were truly determining the price.
for example,in enron power marketing,ferc,ferc emphasized that reporting is necessary so that the marketer rates will be on file as required by section c of the fpa,to evaluate the reasonableness of the charges,and to provide for ongoing monitoring of the marketer ability to exercise market power.similarly,ferc has stated that data is the minimum needed for market monitoring purposes.revised pu
