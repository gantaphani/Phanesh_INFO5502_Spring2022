in,the federal energy regulatory commission issued a regulation that used a united states forest service rental fee schedule to set annual charges for hydropower projects occupying federal land.since then,ferc has issued annual updates to reflect the forest service revised fee schedule.in,however,the forest service began using a significantly different valuation methodology than the one ferc had reviewed and endorsed in its regulation.ferc nonetheless used the revised forest service schedule when it issued its in substantially higher rates to many licensees.petitioners and intervenors in this case,a group of hydropower licensees who pay ferc annual rental fees,challenge the commission update,arguing that it was required to go through notice and comment before it could impose charges according to the revised forest service methodology.for the reasons set forth in this opinion,we grant the petition and vacate ferc rental fee update.
under section e of the federal power act fpa,e,licensees of hydropower projects regulated by ferc must pay to the united states reasonable annual charges in an amount to be fixed by the commission to,among other things,recompens e the federal government for the use,occupancy,and enjoyment of its lands or other property.ferc and its predecessor,the federal power commission,have utilized various methodologies to set these land use charges.originally,the federal power commission calculated annual fees through individual project appraisals.see update of the federal energy regulatory commission fees schedule for annual charges for the use of government lands rehearing order,ferc,at.when such appraisals proved inefficient,ferc adopted national per acre land values,which it used in combination with an annual rate of return to set land use fees.id.at.
in,the department of energy inspector general issued a report finding that ferc methodology led to significant because it relied on outdated land value averages.see id.at.the report recommended that ferc revise its regulations so that its fees would reflect current fair market value and also suggested that the commission cease using a national average that failed to account for land value variations.see id.responding to these and other recommendations and following notice and comment rulemaking,ferc issued order,which established a new methodology for assessing annual rental fees.see revision of the billing procedures for annual charges for administering part i of the federal power act and to the methodology for assessing federal land use charges,order.may.in that order,ferc explained that it would use the schedule published by the forest service to determine rental fees for linear across national forest system lands.id.at.a linear is a for a linear facility,such as a road,trail,pipeline,electronic transmission line,fence,water transmission facility,or fiber optic cable.
as described in order,the forest service methodology was based on a survey conducted jointly by the forest service and the bureau of land management blm of market values for the types of land those agencies allowed linear to occupy.see order.at.using the survey data,the forest service and blm assigned each county in the united states excluding counties in hawaii and alaska to one of eight different fee zones based on the county raw land values,with values ranging from per acre for zone one to per acre for zone eight.see linear fees.to determine rental fees,the forest service multiplied the applicable zone values in its index by two additional factors designed respectively to account for the land use impact of different and to provide the government with a reasonable rate of return for using its land.see id.at.the forest service also included an annual adjustment to account for inflation.see id.at.
in adopting the forest service fee schedule,ferc acknowledged that the service valuation methodology was not precisely fitted to hydroelectric projects.order.at.ferc nonetheless concluded that the linear zone values were the best approximation available,and it noted that m ost commenters shared its view that the forest service index would be more representative of the fair market value of the type of land most often used for hydroelectric projects than any of the other methodologies proposed in the commission initial rulemaking notice.id.among the alternative methodologies ferc considered and rejected was a proposal to use a land value index published by the united states department of agriculture that provided per acre averages for the value of farm land and buildings.according to ferc,c ommenters almost unanimously object ed to the use of this agricultural land value index,arguing that farm land values were typically much higher than the values of federal land used for hydropower projects and that substantial adjustments to the index would have been needed to account for the value of farm buildings,arable land,and private ownership.id.at.ferc agreed,concluding that t he agricultural index would require major adjustments and so would be an inefficient metric for the value of land used by hydropower projects.id.
at the end of order,ferc promulgated regulation,which implemented the order by amending the commission fpa regulations.the provision relevant to this case,section b,provides that p ending further order of the commission and subject to adjustments as conditions may warrant,annual charges for the use of government lands will be set on the basis of the schedule of rental fees for linear an appendix that reproduced the forest service schedule.b.the provision added that t he commission,by its designee the executive director,will update its fees schedule to reflect changes in land values established by the forest service.the executive director will publish the updated fee schedule in the federal register.id.
for over twenty years from to,blm and the forest service made no changes to their linear fee schedule except for the annual inflation adjustment.despite generally recognized increases in land value in most areas,the agencies zone values remained static.see rehearing order,ferc at.in accordance with regulation,ferc executive director published annual fee schedule updates to reflect the forest service most recent schedule.see id.at.
in,congress,concerned that zone values for linear had become outdated,directed both the forest service and blm to revise their per acre rental fee zone values to reflect current values of land in each zone.following notice and comment,blm issued the required update in october.see update of linear rent schedule blm order.days later,the forest service published its own notice,formally adopting blm revisions to the linear fee schedule.see fee schedule for linear authorized on national forest system lands.
the methodology blm and the forest service used to set rates in this revised schedule differed in several significant ways from their previous methodology,with each input in the agencies calculation formula changing in some respect.the most significant change,and the one the parties focus on here,related to zone values.responding to congress command to use data,the two agencies chose to replace their index with a new index called the census of agriculture,which the national agricultural statistics service nass publishes every five years.the nass census reports average per acre land and building values by county or other relevant geographical unit for each state and lists individual values for cropland,woodland,pastureland,rangeland,and a broad other category that includes,building lots,wasteland,and land with roads and ponds.blm order.at.blm and the forest service determined not only that the nass census is a reliable data source,but also that the land types measured in the census are comparable to land they administer.id.to set zone values for each county using this data,the agencies employed the average per acre land and building values from the nass census and then reduced them by twenty percent to eliminate the added value of irrigated cropland and land encumbered by buildings.id.at.in addition,because the land values contained in the nass census exceeded those in the service survey,the agencies increased the number of zones from eight to twelve,with zone values ranging from per acre for zone one to per acre for zone twelve.see id.at.
in january,and setting the stage for the issue before us,ferc sent letters to all hydropower licensees apprising them of the forest service revised fee schedule and explaining that the new schedule would cause annual federal land use charges to increase substantially for many projects.acting pursuant to regulation,ferc executive director subsequently issued the commission annual fee update notice on february,which incorporated the forest service new rate schedule.update of the federal energy regulatory commission fees schedule for annual charges for the use of government lands,update,codified at pt,app.a.like all previous updates issued by the executive director,the notice was published in both the federal register and the code of federal regulations.
a group of licensees,including petitioners and intervenors in this case,filed a timely rehearing request.the group contended that the update amounted to a rulemaking that ferc improperly issued without notice and an opportunity for comment.they also argued that by adopting the new forest service land valuations without any independent inquiry,ferc unlawfully delegated to that agency its fpa section e responsibility to set reasonable annual charges for hydropower licensees.e.
denying the rehearing petition,ferc first stated that the petition was procedurally improper because the licensees were either effectively challenging the final actions of other agencies the forest service and blm or collaterally attacking regulation.see rehearing order,ferc at.notwithstanding these purported procedural failings,ferc addressed the merits and concluded that no notice and comment was required prior to the update because the update did not qualify as a legislative rule.ferc explained that the update was not a rulemaking of any kind,but was instead a procedural action required by regulation.alternatively,ferc determined that even if the update were a rulemaking,it was an interpretive rule rather than a legislative rule because it did not create new law,rights,or duties but rather simply informed licensees of the updated fees according to the procedure the commission had followed since.id.at.
central to ferc reasoning was its insistence that although the forest service and blm concededly modified their land valuation methodology prior to the update,the commission own updates based on the forest service rental fee schedule for linear constant.ferc acknowledged that changes the forest service and blm made to their fee schedules might be cause for the commission to reexamine the propriety of using the service calculations,but it nonetheless contended that the executive director ministerial act of issuing the update can not be considered a change in commission regulation.id.at.ferc explained that although order discuss ed various methodologies,regulation itself adopted the service index as the basis for determining its land use fees without recognizing any exception for changes in the underlying methodology of blm and the forest service.id.at.indeed,ferc observed,the regulation specifically contemplates that the forest service land values might change and that the commission would continue to use them.id.at.responding to the licensees criticism that the new forest service zone value index was based on agricultural land values and that ferc had expressly rejected the use of another agricultural land value index in order,the commission insisted that the data now being used by the forest service and blm differed from the index at issue in order.therefore,although ferc took no position on whether the new service methodology results in a reasonably accurate valuation of federal land used for hydropower purposes because it believed the question was not properly presented,it found no conflict between the methodological change by the forest service and blm and the commission own prior conclusions in order.id.at.
ferc also rejected the licensees argument that by issuing the update,it improperly delegated to other agencies its section e responsibility to fix reasonable land use charges.noting that it adopted the service linear fee schedule in order after full review,ferc asserted that its decision to rely on other agencies for data updates was consistent with its statutory responsibilities.see id.at.
one commissioner dissented on the ground that ferc ha d not assessed the new service methodology to determine whether it was appropriate for arriving at reasonable annual charges for hydropower licensees.id.at.lamenting that the decision to forgo public comment reduces confidence in the fairness of government process,the dissent argued that the majority should have opened a notice of inquiry or other public rulemaking process before accepting the new methodology and the higher rates it produced.id.
this petition for review followed.urging us to vacate the update,the licensees argue that ferc failed to provide notice and an opportunity for public comment as required by section of the administrative procedure act apa.they also contend that the update violates fpa section e and that ferc acted arbitrarily and capriciously in denying the rehearing request.
the key issue before us is this in promulgating the update,did ferc change its methodology for setting rental fees charged to hydropower licensees from the methodology it had adopted in order and regulation if the answer is yes,then ferc violated apa section.having established through public rulemaking in regulation a methodology for setting future rates for licensees,ferc may modify that methodology only after notice and comment.see alaska prof l hunters ass n,faa,cir rule making,as defined in the apa,includes not only the agency process of formulating a rule,but also the agency process of modifying a rule.citing batterton marshall,f d,holding that the department of labor adoption of a new methodology for collecting and computing employment statistics was a rule requiring notice and comment where those statistics were used as part of a statutory formula for allocating job program funds between states.conversely,if the answer is is,if as ferc held in its rehearing order,the update was mandated by regulation and was issued in accordance with the commission longstanding interpretation of that it is equally clear that notice and comment rulemaking was unnecessary.whether characterized as an interpretive rule or just a procedural action,a notice doing no more than faithfully implementing established regulations does not require renewed notice and comment.paralyzed veterans of am.arena,concluding that the department of justice interpretation of its regulation in a manual supplement was not sufficiently distinct or additive to the regulation to require notice and comment.moreover,if ferc understanding of the update is correct,then the licensees only remedy for the significant rate increase caused by the new forest service rental fee schedule would be the one ferc suggests petitioning for a new rulemaking on the grounds that the factual premises underlying the commission adoption of regulation have fundamental ly change d.midwest indep.transmission.operator ferc,describing the standard of review for an agency decision not to initiate a rulemaking.
ferc argues that it has reasonably interpreted regulation to permit it to use the forest service land values without first allowing for notice and comment.recall that section b of the regulation adopts the forest service linear fee schedule as the basis for setting hydropower land use fees and also instructs ferc executive director to update the commission fees schedule to reflect changes in land values established by the forest service.b.according to ferc,the executive director followed this command exactly when he issued the update implementing the forest service revised zone valuations.rehearing order,ferc at.true,in chang ing its land values,the forest service,in conjunction with blm,jettisoned its prior valuation methodology by replacing its own survey with an index produced b
