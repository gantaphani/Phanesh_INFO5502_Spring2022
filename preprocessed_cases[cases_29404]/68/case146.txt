indiana gas and citizens gas coke,two utilities that supply natural gas to customers in indiana,formed a joint venture called proliance energy to manage the contracts by which they purchase gas and transportation services from the interstate pipelines that pass through that state.united states gypsum usg purchases substantial quantities of gas for use in manufacturing it buys gas at the wellhead and deals directly with the pipelines for transportation.in this litigation under sections and of the sherman act,usg contends that proliance is an unlawful combination that by contract controls a substantial fraction of the transport capacity between the gas fields and indiana,and that it has used this market power to monopolize.even though usg buys transportation directly from the pipelines,it alleges,the price the pipelines can charge for their services depends on what proliance has done with its portion of the capacity.according to usg,pipelines have been able to charge more for their residual capacity because of proliance existence and practices than the pipelines would have been able to charge in its absence.
indiana gas and citizens gas have many customers with firm entitlements to gas.in order to assure delivery,indiana gas and citizens gas purchase more pipeline capacity than needed for daily deliveries they hold the excess as reserve for the benefit of the uninterruptible customers during periods of peak demand,such as cold snaps or a business high season.during times of average demand,indiana gas and citizens gas sold their excess transport entitlement on the spot market,where usg bought it at attractive prices and used it to secure gas that it stored for times when spot market prices were high.after proliance came into existence,however,it ended or at least greatly curtailed these sales,forcing usg to pay more for firm capacity from the pipelines firm commitments always sell for more than interruptible or spot purchases.
there are several ways to characterize what happened.proliance contends that,by managing purchases on behalf of both indiana gas and citizens gas,it has achieved efficiencies when one utility demand peaks,the other may be closer to normal,which means that less aggregate reserve capacity is needed.this is the way in which an insurer,by pooling many imperfectly correlated risks,creates a portfolio that is less risky than any insured standing alone.thus proliance needs less standby capacity for peak periods and can provide more firm,uninterruptible commitments per unit of pipeline capacity than either indiana gas or citizens gas could do on its own.an increase in demand from the utilities customer base then can be met without an increase in price.the upshot,however,is that third parties such as usg find fewer bargains in the spot market.as usg sees matters,however,the higher prices stem not from risk pooling but from proliance either holding reserve capacity off the market a reduction in output that drives up prices or bundling the release of reserve transport capacity with gas which usg describes as a monopolistic sale.
because all we have to go on is usg complaint,it is too soon to determine whose understanding of these events is superior.the district judge concluded that it would never be necessary to examine these issues and dismissed the complaint,citing.b,on three grounds first,usg has not suffered antitrust injury because it does not buy from proliance second,the suit is barred by the period of limitations in third,usg could not prove its claims in light of adverse findings by the indiana utility regulatory commission in a proceeding to which usg was a party.none of these is a good ground on which to dismiss usg the latter two are not permissible even in principle,because the statute of limitations and issue preclusion are affirmative defenses.see.c.complaints need not anticipate or attempt to defuse potential defenses.see gomez toledo,d.a complaint states a claim on which relief may be granted when it narrates an intelligible grievance that,if proved,shows a legal entitlement to relief.see swierkiewicz sorema,d bennett schmidt,cir.a litigant may plead itself out of court by alleging and thus admitting the ingredients of a defense,see walker thompson,cir applying this principle to the period of limitations,but this complaint does not do so the district judge thought,rather,that the complaint had failed to overcome the defenses.as complaints need not do this,the omissions do not justify dismissal.what is more,all three grounds are unsound in application as well as in principle.
a private plaintiff must show antitrust is to say,injury by reason of those things that make the practice unlawful,such as reduced output and higher prices.the doctrine was created to filter out complaints by competitors and others who may be hurt by productive efficiencies,higher output,and lower prices,all of which the antitrust laws are designed to encourage.see,atlantic richfield usa petroleum,d cargill,monfort of colorado,d brunswick pueblo,d.a plaintiff who wants something,such as less competition or higher prices,that would injure consumers,does not suffer antitrust injury.in midwest gas services,indiana gas,cir,we held that the doctrine prevents a suit by one of proliance business rivals.usg,by contrast,is a consumer of gas it is in the class of persons protected from reductions in output and higher prices.and usg contends that it has been required to pay higher prices.its injury if any is antitrust injury.that at least one of proliance rivals has sued,and that none of its indirect purchasers the customers of indiana gas and citizens gas has done so,may be informative,but it does not prevent usg from attempting to show that proliance has anticompetitive consequences.
portions of the district court opinion equate the doctrine of brunswick and its successors with the doctrine of illinois brick illinois,d,and hanover shoe,united shoe machinery,d.usg may suffer from higher prices but does not buy from defendants,which the district judge thought dispositive.if usg were seeking damages,and proliance direct or derivative customers also wanted or could seek monetary relief,then defendants would have a point.see kansas utilicorp united,d reserving the possibility of suit by an indirect customer if the direct customer is a participant in the cartel paper systems nippon paper industries,cir.but the doctrine does not foreclose equitable relief,nor does it apply when no purchaser could obtain damages,for then there is no risk of double recovery and no need to calculate elasticities in order to apportion damages among multiple tiers.
a cartel cuts output,which elevates price throughout the market customers of fringe firms sellers that have not joined the cartel pay this higher price,and thus suffer antitrust injury,just like customers of the cartel members.we noted and reserved in loeb industries,sumitomo,cir,a number of potentially difficult issues about the design of relief when the customer of a fringe firm sues the supposed cartel members and the injury is derivative.see also associated general contractors of california,california state council of carpenters,d blue shield of virginia mccready,d.courts sometimes label this antitrust standing,despite the potential for confusion with article iii standing which requires only injury in fact plus redressability.we did not resolve these issues in loeb and need not do so here either.it is enough to reiterate,as loeb holds,that the buyers from fringe firms suffer antitrust injury,that their complaints can not be dismissed at the outset under the illinois brick doctrine,and that the potential to establish injury through elevation of price in the affected market satisfies any distinct antitrust standing requirement.see also metallgesellschaft ag sumitomo of america,cir.
now we turn to the statute of limitations.proliance was formed in march,and usg did not file this suit until october.the statute of limitations is four,as the district judge recognized,this time runs from the most recent injury caused by the defendants activities rather than from the cartel inception.see,zenith radio hazeltine research,d
