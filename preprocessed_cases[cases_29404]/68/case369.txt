in these consolidated cases,the petitioners challenge two orders of the federal energy regulatory commission ferc following our decision in consolidated edison of new york ferc.in con edison,the court remanded two issues to ferc for further explanation in connection with the remedies available for electric service providers that experienced substantial price increases in as a result of failures in a deregulated energy market.id.at.in the challenged orders,ferc explained its reasoning for not invoking temporary emergency procedures tep of the new york independent system operator,nyiso that allowed rebilling,and for not ordering refunds despite the nyiso violation of its tariff when pricing different types of power reserves.indep.operator,remand order indep.operator,rehearing order.in view of the deference due to ferc determinations that the nyiso had acted reasonably in not implementing tep because problems in the reserves market did not rise to the level of a market design flaw,and that retroactive refunds were not an appropriate remedy for nyiso tariff violation because its pricing system protected system reliability,we conclude that ferc denial of a remedy was not arbitrary and capricious or contrary to law,and we deny the petitions.
the issues before the court arise out of events occurring approximately two months after the nyiso began operations.con edison,at.between january and march,transmission facility,entities lses experienced dramatic price increases for reserve nsr in markets administered by the nyiso.nsr is a power reserve that can be synchronized within ten minutes and is of lower quality than spinning reserve sr,which is available almost immediately.in response to these price increases,nyiso presented a number of requests to ferc,including immediately suspending bids and authorizing a cap for nsr bids.the lses complained to ferc that the nyiso had violated its tariff and operated under several market design flaws by failing to accept bids from other qualified suppliers,and sought correction of these practices and refunds they also sought to compel the nyiso to invoke tep remedial measures.ferc found no withholding of capacity by any supplier,but inasmuch as the market was not operating properly,approved the nsr bid cap while concluding that it lacked authority to grant retroactive relief,that the nyiso had not violated its tariff,and that it would not require the nyiso to implement tep.upon the lses petitions for review,this court agreed that ferc lacked authority to revise rates retroactively under the federal power act fpa,d,d,but held that ferc had not adequately explained why tep was unavailable and had incorrectly concluded that the nyiso had not violated its tariff by linking the prices of sr and nsr reserves.the court remanded to ferc,requiring additional explanation concerning why the nyiso tep tariff mechanism should not be implemented,and whether refunds should be provided for the nyiso violations of its tariff when pricing operating reserves.id.at.
the tep process was established,and approved by ferc,in order to address market design flaws,transitional abnormalities and severe operational difficulties indep.operator,tep order.in instances where the nyiso declares that a market design flaw or transitional abnormality is occurring,extraordinary corrective actions can be taken on an interim basis,such as recalculation of clearing prices to the level that would have been reached if a market design flaw or transitional abnormality had not arisen id.at.a possible indicator of a market design flaw is excluding a resource for no valid reason.remand order,at.tep requires,where possible,prior notice of any such actions by the nyiso.tep order,at.
on remand,in response to the court holding in con edison that ferc view of tep scope was excessively narrow,at,ferc offered that tep was inapplicable to address the price increases of early in the nyiso market because the nyiso did not abuse its discretion by refraining from exercising its tep authority to recalculate prices,remand order,at in any event,ferc concluded that refunds could not be recalculated with reasonable certainty as tep required.id.at.specifically,ferc explained that tep provides the nyiso with discretion as to when,or whether,it may take extraordinary corrective actions,id.at,as well as what measures to take,id.at abuse of discretion turns on what was reasonable under the circumstances faced by the nyiso at the time,rehearing order,at.ferc concluded that the nyiso made a reasonable determination that problems in its market were primarily due to the concentration of market power and related bidding behavior,not market design flaws,and that invocation of tep was not the best and most efficient procedure to remedy such flaws.remand order,at.under tep,ferc noted,possible indications of market design flaws include the dispatch of higher priced resources when bids are available and not selected and there is no valid reason for not operating the resource.id.citing tep,nyiso services tariff,attachment e,at section a.here,three entities controlled percent of the nsr market in new york.id.although certain lower priced resources were available,namely the western generators and the facility,ferc explained that there were valid reasons for these sources exclusion from bidding into reserves.the nyiso had noted that western generators faced serious transmission constraints eighty percent of the time,making them unreliable reserves for eastern areas of the system,while the owners of,the only other source of potential reserves,wished to use its output for energy rather than reserves.id.at rehearing order,at.according to ferc,the nyiso market is not designed to provide it with unconstrained authority to compel sources like to sell reserves if the owners choose not to do so.rehearing order,at.further,ferc noted,the nyiso did not attribute the reserve market problems to the western generators and.id.at.
ferc further emphasized that under tep,even if market design flaws had been found,tariffs could be recalculated only i f it is possible to do so with reasonable certainty.remand order,at quoting nyiso services tariff,attachment e.this would not be possible,in ferc view,given that the nyiso had only recently commenced operations and historical price information was thus limited.ferc possessed no evidence regarding the effect that inclusion of the western generators could have had on nsr prices.id.at.although the nyiso had attempted to create proxy prices through modeling the effect of including in the reserve market,ferc found that the proxy prices use of future rather than contemporary prices did not yield sufficient certainty.had not bid in the nsr market at the time,and there is no evidence as to what its bid would have been or what factors would have influenced its bid.id.in addition numerous other parties had raise d significant objections to the nyiso methodology id.
the court held in con edison that the nyiso setting of sr prices to be no lower than nsr prices violated its tariff and that on remand ferc should either follow its general policy of providing refunds,or explain its divergence from this policy.at citations omitted.on remand,ferc determined,upon balancing the equities,considering what was just and reasonable,and exploring whether an alternate remedy was more appropriate,that it would not order refunds.remand order,at.ferc explained that the nyiso pricing policy did not provide an improper windfall for sr providers because it was the proper and appropriate pricing method that provided efficient prices for the least cost dispatch.id.in particular,ferc found that the nyiso pricing method served consumers and interests and protected the reliability of the system,id.at,assuring the availability of higher quality sr,which the nyiso tariff required to represent fifty percent of available reserves,id.at con edison,at,by preventing sr reserves diversion into nsr markets when the latter were expected to be higher priced.remand order,at.ferc also found that the nyiso pricing approach provides,in the long run,the lowest costs to customers and the correct market incentives to g
