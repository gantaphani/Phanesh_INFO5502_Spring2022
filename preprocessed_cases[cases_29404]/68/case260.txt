we must decide whether employees of an electric utility who reside on their employer remote premises were wrongfully denied overtime pay in violation of the federal fair labor standards act and oregon state law.
james brigham,carl hall,gary millsap,and donald reed the employees are current or former employees stationed at the carmen smith hydroelectric project project or site,a power generation facility straddling the upper mckenzie river some miles east of eugene,oregon,on lands located predominantly within the willamette national forest owned by the city of eugene,oregon through its eugene water electric board eweb,the site was constructed in the early and is comprised of three sizeable dams and two powerhouses.although the site is partially monitored at a central facility in eugene,four eweb employees work and are required to live along with their families in housing provided to them by eweb 
these worked weeks,which usually were comprised of three maintenance shifts and one duty shift on maintenance shifts,the employees worked from to accounting for breaks,the employees performed ten hours work during the course of a maintenance shift and accordingly were paid ten hours wages.any work performed beyond ten hours was paid at a rate.
in contrast,duty shifts lasted a full hours.during that time,a designated employee was responsible for the operation and safety of the entire project.between and noon,he was charged with monitoring,inspecting,and logging the status of the two generating plants and performing any necessary maintenance.at noon,he usually returned to his house.in the evening,he was required to inspect and again to log the status of powerhouses,a task which took about an hour.indeed,for the entirety of his employee was required to remain at carmen smith,available for emergency phone or radio contact with the central dispatcher in eugene each house on the site was also equipped with a system that would alert the employee to any automated monitoring alarms,to which along with any calls from the central dispatcher the duty employee was required to respond immediately.subject to these well as the requirement that they be fit employees were free to sleep,to eat,and to spend time with their families.
although the employees performed only about hours of scheduled work during the course of a duty shift,they were paid ten hours wages.employees also were compensated at a rate for any time lasting beyond a call first minutes.and,in addition to these wages,eweb provided the employees with free housing,electricity,water,garbage service,and satellite television,along with a bus driver and the cost of fuel and maintenance for a school bus to transport the employees children to school.
between their maintenance and duty shifts,the employees were often on some form of duty performing actual maintenance or on as much as hours per week.
the employees filed suit in the circuit court of lane county,oregon,on august,alleging that their duty shift time was uncompensated and,accordingly,seeking compensation for unpaid overtime under the fair labor standards act flsa,a and under two provisions of oregon law,and eweb removed the case to federal court on september,and filed a motion for summary judgment on july.the employees opposed eweb motion,and argued alternatively that,if the district court granted summary judgment on the flsa claim,it should decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over their claims.
on august,the district court heard oral argument on the motion and that same day issued an order granting summary judgment to eweb,denying the employees request that it decline supplemental jurisdiction,and dismissing their causes of action with prejudice.judgment was entered on august,and seven days later the employees filed a motion to amend the judgment on the grounds that the district court should not have decided their claims.subsequently,the employees also objected to defense counsel bill of costs.
the district court denied the motion to amend on october,and two days later issued an order awarding eweb costs in the amount of.the employees timely filed an amended notice of appeal.
we first consider whether the formally uncompensated hours of each duty shift constituted compensable working time within the meaning of the flsa 
as the supreme court long ago recognized,the inquiry into whether or waiting time constitutes compensable working time for purposes of flsa a is particularly challenging.although no principle of law found either in the statute or in court decisions precludes waiting time from also being working time,we can not lay down a legal formula to resolve cases so varied in their facts as are the many situations in which employment involves waiting time.skidmore swift.f acts may show that the employee was engaged to wait,which is compensable,or they may show that the employee waited to be engaged,which is not compensable.owens local,ass of pulp paper workers,cir quoting skidmore,at.
in determining whether the employees spent the uncompensated hours of each duty shift engaged to wait,and therefore working within the meaning of a,or simply waiting to be engaged,and therefore not working within the meaning of the statute,the court has directed us to scrutin ize and constru e the agreements between the particular parties,apprais e their practical construction of the working agreement by conduct,consider the nature of the service,and its relation to the waiting time,and all of the surrounding circumstances.skidmore,at.our most recent cases emphasize that the two predominant factors in determining whether an employee waiting time is compensable overtime are the degree to which the employee is free to engage in personal activities and the agreements between the parties.berry,at cir quoting owens,at we address these considerations in turn.
in owens,we enumerated an illustrative list of factors to consider in gauging the extent to which employees could pursue personal activities during the course of their shifts 
whether there was an living requirement whether there were excessive geographical restrictions on employee movements whether the frequency of calls was unduly restrictive whether a fixed time limit for response was unduly restrictive whether the employee could easily trade responsibilities whether the use of a pager could ease restrictions and whether the employee had actually engaged in personal activities during time.
owens,at footnotes omitted.because n o one factor is dispositive,a court should balance the factors permitting personal pursuits against the factors restricting personal pursuits to determine whether the employee is so restricted that he is effectively engaged to wait.berry,at quoting owens,at.of course,an employee need not have substantially the same flexibility or freedom as he would if not on call,else all or almost all time would be working time,a proposition that the settled case law and the administrative guidelines clearly reject.owens,at quoting bright houston northwest med.ctr.survivor,cir en banc.
in this case,the owens factors are closely divided.as previously noted,eweb did require the employees to live on premises factor.indeed,it forbade them from maintaining an primary residence.while,the employees were subject to strict geographic constraints factor they had to remain within earshot of their home phones and alarm systems because they were required to respond instantaneously to any alerts factor.use of a pager or,for that matter,a wireless phone or radio would do little to lessen these burdens factor,as the plant was readily accessible only by foot from the employees homes.
at the same time,the employees acknowledge that each was called out,on average,only about once or twice a month factor.when an employee was sick,on vacation,or otherwise occupied by personal needs,he usually was able to trade duty shifts with his colleagues factor.and,perhaps most notable in this regard,the employees routinely engaged in personal activities while they were factor.as the district court highlighted,they were able to use portions of their duty shifts to sleep,eat,read,study,exercise,watch television,help their children with homework,play games,maintain their homes and yards,work on their motorcycles,and entertain guests.
this especially narrow division of the owens factors reveals this case to be far closer than our previous flsa waiting time cases with the arguable exception of service employees international union,local county of san diego seiu,cir,which evaluated fewer factors than we do here.seiu,at during the shift,there is an living requirement and strict geographical restrictions on employees movements.however,the record shows the actual calls are infrequent,the employee can trade responsibilities,and employees do engage in personal activities.berry,at a ll of the relevant factors in this case,except perhaps one,weigh in favor of concluding the coroners are free to engage in personal activities while.owens,at the mechanics here were not required to remain on the premises they were not required to remain at home to receive calls they were not required to respond to all calls they were not subject to a fixed acceptance rate they received an average of only six calls a year they were not required to be reachable by beeper and,those who did not request beepers were not expected to respond to a call within a fixed time.footnotes omitted.
nevertheless,we must find a way to balance these factors,see berry,at,and comparatively evaluating them within the specific contours of this case,we conclude that they least favor of the employees.first,the geographic and restrictions associated with their duty shifts were especially restrictive.because the employees had to be able to hear their phones ring at all times and were required to respond instantaneously to alerts and calls while on their duty shifts,they were effectively tethered to their homes.perhaps in good weather they could enjoy use of their yards at all other times,they would have to remain inside.in the event of a call,the employees had to be able to reach the powerhouse and accompanying was half a mile away and most expeditiously reached on soon as humanly possible these limitations are more severe than those at issue in our prior cases,as well as those of our sister circuits.id.at,employees limited to remaining within the county,given fifteen minutes to respond by phone or radio rather than in person owens,at mechanics limited at most to pager area,could leave a forwarding number,and were required only to reply within ten minutes of receiving a call or page see also,ingram county of bucks,cir sheriff deputies could leave word where they were reachable,were not required to report to office within a fixed amount of time,and often took minutes before leaving their location in response to a call martin ohio turnpike comm n,cir employees were free to leave a forwarding number,policy imposed no significant travel restrictions,no fixed time to respond in person renfro city of emporia,cir twenty minute response time supports the holding that time is compensable.
second,we believe that at least two of the owens factors weighing against the employees have a lesser significance in this case.that the average number of and emergency alarms was low seems less important here than it might in the context of the coroners in berry or the manufacturing plant mechanics in owens.while on call,these particular employees were responsible for the safety of thousands of people and,accordingly,had to be absolutely prepared to respond at all times,rested,sober,clothed,and otherwise able to race immediately to the trouble source if needed,without regard to how often they were actually called out.such constant pressures simply did not exist in berry where the coroners dead bodies were not going to go anywhere or owens where the mechanics freely could decline to respond to calls,and where,at most,a short period of plant downtime was at stake.
and although it is true that the employees could arrange to exchange their duty shifts with each other in enabling them to engage in personal activities on special occasions or to deal with illnesses and other family are inclined to see this particular owens factor as somewhat less important than its peers.after all,our task ultimately is to determine how to characterize the time the employees spent on their duty shifts,and the employees ability occasionally to avoid those shifts altogether does little to shape our view of the restrictions imposed on them during such shifts.
we therefore conclude that the owens factors weigh narrowly in favor of the employees.
our analysis of the issue,however,does not end there.the degree to which the employees were free to engage in personal activities is but one of the two factors that our caselaw directs us to consider in characterizing their duty shift time.see berry,at owens,at.we now turn to an analysis of the second factor,the parties agreement and its significance.
we first observe that to the extent the parties dispute whether they had an agreement we are quite certain that there was one.our caselaw clearly recognizes that an agreement cognizable for purposes of the flsa overtime inquiry may arise by conduct.in owens,for instance,we explained that the plaintiff mechanics in the present case may not have liked the company formal system,but by continuing to work,they constructively accepted the new terms.id.at.and in berry,we reiterated that a constructive agreement may arise if employees have been informed of the overtime compensation policy and continue to work under the disclosed terms of the policy.berry,at see also porter,cir we hold that as a matter of law the unilateral action of the employer was impliedly accepted by the firemen and that a new contract was created whereby the employees agreed to work on a system at a fixed monthly wage.
our sister circuits likewise have recognized the force of constructive agreements in the flsa overtime compensation context.see,braziel tobosa dev,cir a n agreement to exempt sleep time from paid work under the flsa can be implied although it is clear from the record and appellants pleadings that they became unhappy with the policy,it is equally clear that appellants understood and acquiesced to the policy when they were hired.bodie city of columbia,cir c ontinuance in the job and acceptance under the new plan of payment was sufficient to create a valid agreement,even though the agreement was implied and not in writing.rousseau teledyne movible offshore,cir of course,it is clear that the employees did not like the no leave rule.but their dislike does not negate the existence of an agreement.as the district court pointed out,continuance of employment can be evidence of an implied agreement to the terms of that employment.ariens olin mathieson chem,cir w e are of the opinion there was a meeting of minds resulting in a valid agreement that plaintiffs would not be paid for sleeping time.the work schedule was explained in the pamphlet given to each man before he commenced work.the men found out about their work schedule on their first day of duty.the work schedules were posted and plaintiffs continued throughout the time in question to accept paychecks which excluded sleeping time from hours worked.certainly,this was sufficient to constitute an implied agreement between the parties.
in this case,the record demonstrates and the employees do not contest that each of them was aware of eweb duty shift compensation policy when he began working such shifts at carmen smith,and that each continued to work under the relevant policy during the time he worked duty shifts.whether the parties agreement is delineated express as arising through the employees acceptance of duty shifts with a prior understanding of how they were to be compensated for those shifts,see berry,at constructive as arising from the employees decision to continue working under the policy,see arrive at a single conclusion the parties had an agreement.
the far more interesting question is what we ought to make of the parties agreement in this case.berry explains the meaning of an agreement in the flsa overtime context as follows 
the significance and importance of evaluating the agreements between the parties is that the existence of such agreements
