southwestern electric cooperative,southwestern challenges four orders of the federal energy regulatory commission relating to its withdrawal from the soyland power cooperative,soyland.the parties entered into a series of agreements for accomplishing the withdrawal.due to ambiguities in the agreements,the commission endeavored to interpret the agreements in a manner that best reflected the parties intent,consistent with the public interest.on appeal,southwestern contends that the commission erred by failing to dismiss soyland counterclaims as barred under the closing agreement and mutual release release and,alternatively,as unduly discriminatory.southwestern additionally contends that the commission was arbitrary and capricious in construing and applying the withdrawal formula.
we hold that the commission interpretation of the release,namely that southwestern would be released from further liability for its withdrawal obligations to soyland only once it paid the amount that was ultimately due under the parties agreements,was reasonable.by contrast,southwestern interpretation relies on an exception in the release while both ignoring anterior language in the release that limits its effect to prior acts or omissions,and also failing to account adequately for the ambiguity of what constitutes a default under the release.the commission also reasonably concluded that there was insufficient evidence of undue discrimination,particularly in light of the fluidity of the situation of other contemporaneously withdrawing members.accordingly,because southwestern other challenges did not show the commission construction and application of the parties agreements to be arbitrary and capricious,but a reasonable effort to reflect the parties intent,we deny the petition for review.
southwestern electric cooperative is an electricity distributor serving customers in rural illinois.soyland power cooperative provides its with electricity generation and transmission services.all soyland members are electricity distribution cooperatives in rural illinois.in,southwestern entered into a wholesale power contract with soyland that was due to expire in.southwestern thereby became a member of soyland,and was represented on soyland board of directors.until,soyland had operated subject to rules of the rural electrification administration,now the rural utilities service rus,pursuant to the terms of a large loan.rus required the cooperative to secure the loan by entering into,wholesale power contracts with all its members.after paying off its billion debt to rus in,however,soyland became subject to regulation by the federal energy regulatory commission.pursuant to of the federal power act fpa,and the commission regulations,pt,soyland filed its wholesale power contracts,formula rate for recovery of its costs under those contracts,and its budget.the commission accepted those contracts and the formula rate.soyland power,letter order,docket no.ff.may.
relieved of its obligation to maintain the contracts with its members,soyland formed a special buyout evaluation committee to develop a method for members to withdraw from the cooperative.the committee formation was spurred by southwestern expressed desire,previously frustrated,see united states southwestern,soyland power,memorandum and order,to cancel prematurely its contract with soyland.the president of southwestern board of directors,who held one of his cooperative two seats on the soyland board,served on the committee.the committee,aided by outside consultants,devised a withdrawal policy.the policy was adopted unanimously by soyland board of directors,including both southwestern representatives.
the withdrawal policy included a formula for satisfying withdrawing members obligations to the remaining soyland members.the board sought to ensure that the nonwithdrawing members would not bear added costs as a result of the early withdrawal of members like southwestern.therefore,withdrawing members were required to make a withdrawal payment sufficient to cover their share,among other things,of soyland agreements with third parties.the withdrawal policy required withdrawing members to make a payment,as calculated by soyland using a withdrawal formula,contained in attachment a of the withdrawal policy.the attachment,entitled methodology for computing lump sum payment of member withdrawal,included an example of application,which consisted of items.each item described how a particular component of the formula might be estimated and allocated among members,and each provided a reference to serve as a basis for the item computation.
pursuant to the withdrawal policy,southwestern entered into a withdrawal agreement with soyland on november.the commission approved the withdrawal policy and the withdrawal agreement by order of may.the parties also signed a release on may,which freed each party from any and all claims,known or unknown,arising from any act or omission prior to the date of this release the release provided an exception for any such claim arising out of a failure by withdrawing member to perform its obligations under the withdrawal agreement on may,southwestern made its exit payment of,as calculated by soyland.it withdrew from soyland the following day.as provided for by the parties agreements,the withdrawal payments were twice recalculated by soyland,reducing southwestern payment to.
on december,southwestern filed a complaint with the commission for a refund of approximately million based on soyland alleged miscalculation of the withdrawal payment.see.soyland counterclaimed,seeking an upward adjustment of approximately million of southwestern withdrawal payment.the commission,in the first order on review,ferc hearing order,dismissed the complaint in part,denied southwestern motion to reject the counterclaims,and established a refund effective date.the commission set for hearing the computation of the withdrawal payment under the withdrawal policy,which it treated as akin to a formula rate.
following the hearing,the administrative law judge alj ruled that soyland had miscalculated various aspects of the withdrawal payment.see ferc initial decision.he rejected soyland counterclaims as unduly discriminatory,because they sought additional amounts from southwestern that soyland had not sought from two other contemporaneously withdrawing members,which had not filed complaints with the commission.the alj also rejected southwestern claim that the mandatory fee paid by soyland to illinois power,its electricity supplier,as a result of southwestern withdrawal had been passed on incorrectly to southwestern.on the whole,however,the alj granted southwestern much of the relief it had sought.both parties requested rehearing.
in the second order on review,opinion,ferc,the commission summarily affirmed most of the alj rulings,but reversed the finding that soyland counterclaims were unduly discriminatory.the commission reasoned that undue discrimination in the fpa context only applies where there is a formula rate disparity,as opposed to when that rate is applied in different ways to particular fact situations.because the same formula was used for both southwestern and the other two withdrawing members,corn belt electric cooperative,corn belt and edgar electric association edgar,there was no undue discrimination.the commission noted that it did not have anything approaching a complete record of how corn belt and edgar rates were calculated pursuant to the withdrawal agreement,as they neither intervened in this proceeding nor filed complaints over the manner in which soyland made their calculations.id.at.the parties sought rehearing.
in the third order on review,opinion,ferc,the commission changed course,resolving most issues in soyland favor and rejecting southwestern undue discrimination argument on the weight of the evidence.while noting that it was conceivable that different calculations based on the same rate could constitute undue discrimination,the commission found the evidence before it insufficient to establish a prima facie case.the commission also reversed several of the alj findings as misreading the parties intent in reaching the withdrawal agreement.these findings included whether southwestern must pay a share of soyland loan guarantee costs and its margin on power sales,as well as whether various costs were to be calculated based only on the specific references contained in the withdrawal agreement.southwestern requested rehearing.
in the fourth order on review,opinion,ferc,the commission concluded that southwestern had failed to show that the commission construction of the withdrawal policy and the withdrawal agreement was unreasonable,explaining that its decision in opinion benefits the customers by properly enforcing the terms of the parties agreement.id.
the commission described its role in reviewing the parties agreements as ventur ing into this contractual heart of darkness to inform the parties as to their own intent on the disputed issues in order to properly enforce the terms of the agreements,consistent with the public interest.opinion,ferc at.there is little doubt that much in the parties agreements is ambiguous.the withdrawal agreement and withdrawal policy set out to enable members to leave a contractual relationship without causing unnecessary harm to the remaining members.however,they fail to spell out explicitly how various components are to be calculated,even though each withdrawal might have an impact of tens of millions of dollars.instead,the agreements leave the computation of the withdrawing utility exit payment up to soyland to compute,based primarily upon the items in attachment a of the withdrawal policy.however,soyland and southwestern have long disputed whether the attachment items are mere examples,or if they constitute the definitive method for calculating the relevant parts of the withdrawal payment.
the commission efforts to interpret ambiguous language indicate a continuing attempt to make sense out of the parties intent.our review indicates that,rather than reflecting what southwestern characterizes as the commission vacillation in seesaw rulings,petitioner reply br.at,the orders on review reflect the commission willingness to reexamine its interpretation in light of the parties arguments on rehearing in order to apply the agreements as the parties had intended.given ambiguity and the technical aspects of some of the determinations,the court review is most deferential.see koch gateway pipeline ferc,national fuel gas supply ferc,see also chevron,natural res.def.council,d power partners,ferc.
we first address southwestern claim that soyland counterclaims were barred by the release agreement and by their unduly discriminatory nature.in part iii,we address southwestern other challenges to the commission orders.
southwestern contends that upon payment of the withdrawal amount that soyland calculated,soyland was barred,under b of the release,from holding southwestern liable for soyland counterclaims.because,in its view,southwestern had satisfied all its obligations under the withdrawal agreement,southwestern was permanently protected from claims based on that agreement.the other than exception in the release,which provides for ongoing liability for any such claim s arising out of a failure by southwestern to perform its obligations under the withdrawal agreement,was therefore inapplicable.that is,because soyland did not assert in its counterclaims that southwestern had failed to perform,and because the amounts sought under the counterclaims do not reflect costs associated with such failure,the commission,in southwestern opinion,erred in ruling that the counterclaims were not barred by the release.
the commission construed the release to mean that southwestern was not released until it paid the withdrawal amount ultimately determined to be owed pursuant to the withdrawal agreement.see opinion,ferc at.or,as southwestern views the commission interpretation,even though it was soyland failure to charge the counterclaim amounts that led to southwestern failure to pay the amount that the commission subsequently determined was required under the withdrawal policy,southwestern failure to pay that amount was nonetheless a failure to perform its obligations under the withdrawal agreement.southwestern maintains that interpreting the release such that a failure to pay in an amount that was not determined to be owed until improperly expands the other than clause beyond its plain meaning.
the difficulty for southwestern position arises from the language of the release.in contending that the plain meaning of the exception precludes soyland from lodging its counterclaims,southwestern ignores the anterior language in b,which provides a release only for an act or omission prior to the date the release is signed.the parties signed the release on may,and southwestern paid soyland the next day.the acts alleged in soyland counterclaims are therefore not barred,because southwestern failure to pay fully what was due occurred after may.
furthermore,southwestern characterization of its acts as not falling within the exception clause is unpersuasive,because the exception fails to define what constitutes a default under the withdrawal agreement.southwestern reads the exception to exclude costs that soyland failed to include in its calculations for the withdrawal payment,because such costs are purportedly unrelated to southwestern performance under the withdrawal agreement.soyland,on the other hand,bases its counterclaims on the view that southwestern failed to meet its obligations under the withdrawal agreement by failing to pay the correct amount,thus invoking the exception.under the circumstances,the commission reasonably construed the release to require southwestern to pay the full amount that was due under the withdrawal agreement,and its interpretation of southwestern obligations was not contrary to the plain language of the release.
southwestern claim that the counterclaims are unduly discriminatory under fpa,fares no better.because the commission did not approve a change to the calculation of the corn belt and edgar withdrawal payments,southwestern argued that recovery by soyland based on its counterclaims would be per se unduly discriminatory.the alj agreed,finding that the three cooperatives were similarly situated and southwestern was being asked to reimburse soyland or allocate items of expense in a manner not required of corn belt and edgar.southwestern further noted that soyland testified that at the time of withdrawal it treated all three withdrawing members the same.
although in opinion the commission reversed the alj finding of undue discrimination because southwestern was not challenging the formula itself,and thus not raising an issue of undue discrimination as that phrase in the fpa had generally been interpreted,the commission shifted ground in opinion.earlier undue discrimination cases had usually involved questions of formula design and selection,as opposed to how a consistent formula was applied to a given set of facts.see opinion,ferc at see also cities of newark ferc,cir.on rehearing,the commission acknowledged that differing calculations based on the same rate could indeed establish a prima facie showing of undue discrimination.see opinion,ferc at alabama,ferc.the commission nonetheless affirmed its denial of the discrimination claim on the ground of evidentiary insufficiency.ferc at.the commission explained that the limited evidence the alj had relied upon for a prima facie case of undue discrimination,based on his findings that the three cooperatives were similarly situated and that the same withdrawal formula was applied to all,did not suffice.id.
first,southwestern complaint against soyland had not alleged undue discrimination,and therefore the record was not properly developed to make out the required prima facie showing.southwestern had initially argued that soyland counterclaims were barred based on commission practice,as well as on the parties agreements,including the release.see hearing order,ferc at.it was not until the hearing before the alj that southwestern asserted that the counterclaims were unduly discriminatory.initial decision,ferc at.consequently,the commission did not have before it the materials that its rules required
