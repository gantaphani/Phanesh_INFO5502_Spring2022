we issued a writ of review in this case to consider the lawfulness of certain rulings by the public utilities commission commission,revising a formula adopted pursuant to public utilities code section,subdivision b,which is used to determine the amount petitioner southern california edison edison is required to pay certain providers of small amounts of electricity.we affirm the decisions of the commission except as modified.
procedural background 
on march,in decision decision the commission instituted a new formula by which to measure a portion of a utility short run avoided costs srac.decision modifying decision march.edison petition for rehearing was denied by the commission in decision,on december.order modifying decision and denying rehearing,as modified.the petitions for rehearing of the other parties,who are essentially members of a trade association of owners or owners of small electric generation facilities,were denied in decision on february.order granting limited rehearing of decision filed by qf parties.petitions for writ of review were filed in this court by edison,los angeles county county and the california cogeneration council ccc.petitioner,independent energy producers association iepa filed its petition for review in the third district.the supreme court ordered that matter transferred to this court for consideration along with the other petitions concerning decision,decision and decision.
the central hydroelectric corporation chc was not a party to the original proceedings,but it became a party when it filed a petition for rehearing of the decision,subd.b.thereafter,chc filed a petition for review directly with the supreme court.that court ordered the chc petition transferred to this court for disposition.we then ordered the chc petition consolidated with the other pending petitions 
federal history and regulations 
in congress enacted the public utility regulatory policies act of purpa.public,stat.purpa was passed in response to the energy crises of the,and was prompted in part by efforts to lessen this country dependence on foreign energy.in order to prompt the development of more efficient means of providing energy,congress provided certain benefits and exemptions for qualifying cogeneration facilities and small power production facilities qfs the concern of congress in regards to qfs was stated by the supreme court in ferc mississippi,d,as follows congress believed that increased use of these sources of energy would reduce the demand for traditional fossil fuels.but it also felt that two problems impeded the development of nontraditional generating facilities traditional electricity utilities were reluctant to purchase power from,and to sell power to,the nontraditional facilities,and the regulation of these alternative energy sources by state and federal utility authorities imposed financial burdens upon the nontraditional facilities and thus discouraged their development.
in order to alleviate these concerns,section of purpa ordered the federal energy regulatory commission ferc to implement the congressional intent and specifically to encourage cogeneration and small power production.the ferc subsequently adopted those rules,which were codified as part et.the regulations require electrical utilities to purchase energy or capacity made available by a qf a at prices equivalent to the utilities avoided costs.b.avoided costs are defined as the incremental costs to an electrical utility of electrical energy or capacity or both which,but for the purchase from the qualifying facility or facilities,such utility would generate itself or purchase from another source.b.in other words,avoided cost is not measured by what the utilities are paid when they sell energy,but instead what they must spend to produce or procure that energy in the absence of qfs.opinion re san diego gas and electric company.lexis.the regulations further provide that the costs paid are to be fair and reasonable to the electric consumer of the electric utility and in the public interest and not be discriminatory against the qfs.a.the same regulation also provides that public utilities need not pay qfs more than the avoided costs.ibid.
the effect of deregulation in california 
the cost of natural gas was one factor considered in determining the avoided cost of the various utilities.between and,the commission had used an administratively determined avoided cost price,but that methodology had been fraught with contention.see,re biennial resource plan update,wl see also.re biennial resource plan update.
in the california legislature enacted assembly bill number,reg.sess.which restructured and deregulated the electrical industry.stats,ch,eff.as part of the restructuring process an independent systems operator iso was created,m.the iso was under and subject to the jurisdiction of the ferc,and assumed responsibility for scheduling the transmission of power throughout its statewide control area,m.the legislature also created a power exchange px,which was to work in conjunction with the iso.the purpose of the px was to provide an efficient competitive auction for all suppliers.
in order to determine the srac of the public utilities,the legislature ordered the computations to be based on the clearing price paid by the px however,since the px was not yet operating,the legislature provided an interim formulistic approach that was to be used until such time as the commission issued an order declaring the px was properly functioning,subds.b c.the legislative formula set a starting price that was to be adjusted monthly to reflect changes in the natural gas prices at the california border.
the commission,in compliance with the mandate of the legislature,issued decision on december.re biennial resource plan update,wl.in that ruling,the commission determined that it was reasonable to use a simple average of topock indices for purposes of calculating monthly changes to sce edison and sdg e san diego gas electric interim srac formula.id.at,italics added.
it was assumed by most of the parties that the transition formula was to have a short duration.however,by the power market was in a chaotic state,energy costs were beginning to spiral upward,and the px had still not been certified as operating properly within the meaning of section.in april,the commission filed a complaint with the ferc which alleged,among other things,that el paso natural gas company and its affiliates were engaging in unreasonable and anticompetitive practices that could end up costing california taxpayers more than million.specifically,the commission alleged that traders and transporters of natural gas were exercising their market power to inflate the price of natural gas delivered at the california border.
on july,edison filed a petition to modify decision.edison sought a revision of the formula,contending that the srac being paid to the qf was exceeding edison actual avoided cost in violation of purpa.on august,the office of ratepayer advocates ora filed a response generally in support of edison position.however,given the commission complaint with ferc and other adverse developments that had occurred in the spot market,ora raised the question whether the topock index was sufficiently robust to be used in the transition formula.ora noted that the cost of transporting natural gas had decreased while the cost of natural gas had tripled.as a result,ora noted that edison ratepayers were experiencing substantially higher natural gas prices while reeling under a rigidly adopted value of the factor within the srac formula.ora further stated,indices that rely upon an abused market are not a reasonable measure of avoided cost.
on august,three days after ora filed its response,edison filed the first of two emergency petitions,pursuant to commission rule,seeking a commission provisional srac posting using the lower of the gas price derived from the topock index for the month of august,or the current topock index for the current posting month.edison urged immediate action because the price differential increase in gas prices was more than ten times higher than what had caused the commission to file its complaint with ferc in april.the result to the ratepayer was that the qfs,in the month of august alone,would be paid more than million to which they were not entitled.
the next day,september,the assigned administrative law judge alj issued a ruling expanding the edison petition to modify decision to include the issue of whether the topock index was reliable and valid enough to be used as a means of determining edison srac.on september,the assigned alj issued a draft decision setting a briefing schedule and ordering the parties to comment and provide substantive analysis on the issue of irreparable harm to rate payers or market participants should the commission choose to adopt a provisional posting.one month later,on october,four commissioners voted to deny relief finding there was no evidence that ratepayers were being harmed.in dissent,commissioner wood stated that the mechanism for determining the srac was flawed and favored qfs.
on november,edison,fearing that the topock index was going to be three times higher than it had been in august,filed yet another emergency petition.in that petition,edison requested the commission to replace the topock index with a new proxy consisting of ten percent of the topock index and percent of edison core subscription weighted average cost of gas wacog.edison argued that it appeared the payments to qfs were going to increase by about million over the amount of the previous month.this increase would amount to a substantial windfall to some of the qfs,because many qfs used little or no natural gas.edison also contended that the topock border point was being subjected to price manipulations.edison further pointed out that the topock index was not a reliable factor for measuring edison avoided costs because edison bought very little natural gas at the topock spot price.rather,edison had several contracts with other suppliers that enabled it to purchase gas at rates more favorable than the topock spot price.once again edison urged the commission to modify decision since the transition formula did not measure edison avoided costs,which is what is required under purpa.
on december,the ferc issued a ruling in san diego gas electric company,complainant sellers of energy and ancillary services into markets operated by the california independent system operator and the california power exchange et ferc at,wl,eliminating the public utilities mandatory buy and sell requirements from the px.the ferc also terminated the px wholesale rate schedules.
on january,commissioner wood issued a draft decision draft decision granting edison motion to modify decision by replacing the topock index with indices published each month for the at malin plus an interstate transportation charge the malin index.
two months later,on march,the px filed for protection under the bankruptcy laws.it has not been in operation since that date less than a week later,on march,the commission circulated a revised copy of the draft decision calling for legislative repeal of section.the reason given was that the possibility of market power abuse on the el paso pipeline coupled with reduced liquidity in the topock market had convinced the commission that topock no longer met the requirements of a robust market that was required in decision.
six days later,on march,the commission modified decision by issuing decision.the decision is the subject of the writs before this court that we are presently reviewing.the decision,which was a modified version of the draft decision,revised the factor in the transition formula and ordered that it be updated on a monthly basis.decision also modified decision by substituting the malin index for the topock index in edison transition formula on the ground that the topock index was no longer sufficiently robust to serve as a proxy for edison avoided fuel procurement cost.there was no mention of a legislative repeal of section 
the contentions of the parties 
ccc,county of los angeles and iepa each contend that the decision violates section and purpa.additionally,the county alleges the decision discriminates against qfs,violates due process and amounts to an impermissible taking without due compensation.
edison contends the commission is in violation of purpa because it is forcing edison to pay more than its avoided costs to the qfs from which it buys electricity.
standard of review 
this is not a complaint or enforcement proceeding nor is it a ratemaking or licensing decision.therefore,we review,on the basis of the entire record,whether the order or decision was an abuse of discretion the commission proceeded in the manner required by law the commission acted without or in excess of its jurisdiction the decision is not supported by the findings the order or decision was procured by fraud and whether the constitutional rights of the petitioners were violated.
the iepa,ccc,and county petitions 
the decision did not violate section 
public utilities code section b states b until the requirements of subdivision c have been satisfied,short run avoided cost energy payments paid to power generators by an electrical corporation shall be based on a formula that reflects a starting energy price,adjusted monthly to reflect changes in a starting gas index price in relation to an average of current california natural gas border price indices.the starting energy price shall be based on averages of recent,avoided energy prices paid by each public utility electrical corporation to power generators.the starting gas index price shall be established as an average of index gas prices for the same annual periods.
the legislature did not prescribe a specific formula.rather,it prescribed a general formula to be transitional until such time as the px was up and running properly.although not mentioned in either the decision or in the orders denying rehearing it is now becoming obvious that the px will never properly function thus,it was up to the commission to arrive at a formula that met the requirements of section and also complied with purpa.
one of the requirements of the section formulation was that the srac was to take into account current natural gas border price indices.the commission also noted that more than four years had passed since the original formulas had been in place and it was time to revisit the formula and the components of that formula.that is exactly what the commission did.after noting the wildly fluctuating prices along the border the commission concluded that the topock index was no longer robust and could no longer serve as a proxy for utility avoided costs.the commission then concluded that adopting a malin border price plus interstate transportation as a temporary replacement for topock meets the requirements of section b.county argues that this was error because edison does not procure its natural gas from malin.however,the evidence before the commission was that edison buys very little natural gas on the spot market.using the topock index as the basis for the section formulation thus caused edison avoided costs to be overstated in violation of purpa.whether the malin or topock indices or any combination thereof should be used was a decision for the commission and not for this court.eden hospital dist.belshe th,d.
ccc further argues that section must somehow be contrary to purpa because,in a revised draft of the draft decision,the commission urged the repeal of section.however,ccc overlooks the omission of this request in the final version of the decision.only filed decisions are the final opinions or decisions of the commission.the argument will be disregarded.
ccc also argues that the decision violates section by employing current natural gas transportation prices in the newly resurrected index methodology.this imports indices in the starting energy price,contrary to the explicit language of section b.however,the commission ruling did not change the starting price.what was changed was the border index and edison energy factor.ccc further argues that section requires the components to the formula shall be based upon on month averages of recent,avoid prices.what ccc ignores in its analysis is that section also requires the starting price to be changed monthly to reflect changes in the index.the commission recognized this in when it arrived at its original decision on section,re biennial resource plan update,wl.as the commission stated in the order granting limited rehearing t he transition formula has been in place for over years.it would be unreasonable to believe that this interim formula would still accurately reflect current utility avoided costs.to the extent that ccc is arguing that the commission is forever wedded to the figures and can not take current prices into account,ccc is in error.
county alleges that there was,and remains,a question as to whether the malin index was a proper proxy to replace the topock index.the evidence presented to the commission,however,reveals that the prices at malin were not spiraling out of control as were the topock prices.secondly,when decision was decided,both malin and topock were deemed to be sufficiently robust to meet the requirements of section b.the evidence presented to the commission was that topock was no longer robust.there was no evidence indicating that malin was no longer robust.the fact that edison did not buy gas from the malin exchange does not mean malin could not be used as an index.rather,as the commission pointed out in its denial of rehearing,section b does not require that the gas border prices represent where the utility would procure its gas,but rather whether the gas border price is a reasonable proxy for utility avoided cost.
finally,ccc and county both argue that they are forced to pay the topock prices and that it is unfair to allow edison not to pay the same price they are forced to pay.however,qf have never been absolutely entitled to a payment to cover their costs.what is being measured is the utilities srac,not that of the qf.as congress stated in title united states code annotated section b,a utility shall not be required to pay a qf more than the utilities avoided cost.see also a.
the parties due process rights were not violated because of a lack of hearing 
public utilities code section f,which was added in stats,provides notwithstanding section,the commission may conduct any proceeding to adopt,amend,or repeal a regulation using notice and comment rulemaking procedures,without an evidentiary hearing,except with respect to a regulation being amended or repealed that was adopted after an evidentiary hearing,in which case the parties to the original proceeding shall retain any right to an evidentiary hearing accorded by section.here,the evidence shows that decision was a regulation that had been adopted without any evidentiary hearings.thus,by its terms section,subdivision f,permitted the procedure employed by the commission in this case.
however,iepa argues that section is a special section that enables the commission to permit interested parties to petition the commission to adopt,amend or repeal a regulation.iepa further contends that since neither decision nor the decision in this case arose out of a petition pursuant to section,subdivision f,simply does not apply.in response,the commission notes that there are two different types of proceedings covered by section.in subdivisions a through e,the legislature set up a procedure to allow interested parties to petition the commission for adopting,repealing or amending regulations.in subdivision e,the legislature directed the commission to amend its rules of practice and procedure to establish procedures for handling petitions under section.this the commission has done in the wright petitions procedure.
the commission further argues that section subdivision f,was intended to cover not only petitions pursuant to subdivisions a through e,but also any proceeding.this intent is shown by the reference to any proceeding.we agree with the commission and have concluded that subdivision f,applies to proceedings other those initiated by the petition procedure of subdivisions a through e.had the legislature intended subdivision f to be applicable only to proceedings initiated by petition,then the legislature would have used language such as any such proceeding,or any proceeding initiated by petition or other limiting language.we must assume that legislature knew what it was doing and meant the words to be applied as they were written.city of ontario superior court th,d.since the legislature did not impose any limitation,it would be improper for this court to add words to limit or change the plain meaning of the statute.people baker cal d,cisneros vueve th,d.the language of the statute is plain,clear and unambiguous.therefore,there is no need to resort to statutory construction unless it clearly appears that the language used is contrary to what the legislature intended.california fed.savings loan city of los angeles cal th,d,cisneros vueve,supra,th,d.here,there is no evidence that the legislature meant anything other than what it wrote.accordingly,there is no need to indulge in statutory construction or resort to other indicia of legislative intent to interpret the statute.hale southern cal.ipa medical group,th,d.
iepa next contends that california trucking public utilities com.cal d,mandates that the opportunity to be heard requires at a minimum the right to present evidence.in california trucking,the court was concerned with the statutory right to be heard as set forth in sections through.in that instance the court,based on statutory language,held that when the commission alters or rescinds a prior order the right to be heard includes a right to present evidence.here,in section,the legislature has said there is no right to an evidentiary hearing provided that the original regulation was not enacted following an evidentiary hearing.since decision was not enacted following an evidentiary hearing,iepa had no right to an evidentiary hearing prior to the amendment of decision 
there was no taking within the meaning of the federal and state constitutions 
the county contends the srac decision constitutes a taking because the substitution of the malin index for the topock index resulted in payments less than the utility avoided costs in violation of purpa.specifically,the county alleges that it and other qfs entered into gas contracts based upon the topock index.these qf have been harmed because they were not given the chance to allow their contracts to be renegotiated or expire.as the commission stated in its order granting limited rehearing,applicants takings claims are premised on their assertions that the modified formula results in srac prices below their operating costs.however,srac payments were never intended to reflect qf operating costs.rather purpa caps srac payments at the utility avoided costs.a.county has failed to demonstrate that the srac was below edison avoided costs and therefore the argument fails.
the edison petition 
edison waived its right to complain about the use of the malin index 
edison initially urged the commission to modify the formula by substituting the malin index for the topock index.later,in its emergency motion of november,edison requested that the commission adopt a formula in place of the topock index.ten percent was to be the topock indices and percent was to be based on edison cost of gas.this request was denied in favor of the malin index originally requested by ora and further suggested by edison.edison now contends use of malin was error since the commission did not make specific findings as required by section.edison,however,failed to raise this issue in its petition for rehearing.at best,edison made a request that the commission make a better record of its reasons.edison did not protect the use of malin as error.rather,edison apparently seemed to be attempting to have the commission state that section was either inconsistent with federal law or was unlawful.having failed to specifically address the alleged error of using the malin index to the commission,edison may not raise it before this court.
in failing to consider the retroactive application of the modified formula,the commission erred 
on november,edison filed its second motion for relief.this motion,entitled an emergency motion,sought immediate re
