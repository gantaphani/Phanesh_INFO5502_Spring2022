in a dispute with two of its massachusetts customers,boston edison petitions for review of a decision of the federal energy regulatory commission ferc.the customers are the municipal power departments of the towns of concord and wellesley collectively,the towns.the common question is whether boston edison is permitted to impose a particular transmission charge in delivering electrical power to the towns.
boston edison is a massachusetts utility which owns transmission facilities that are part of the new england power grid.the grid is an interconnected network of transmission lines and stations in new england,owned by various utilities,which is the backbone network for distributing power within new england it is controlled by an organization of utilities and others,including both boston edison and the towns,called the new england power pool nepool,under the current version of the new england power pool agreement nepool agreement.
the towns own local distribution facilities by which they offer electricity to retail customers in their areas,using power generated by others and transmitted to the towns over the new england power grid.boston edison provides the transmission facilities that interconnect with the towns networks for a number of years,the towns also purchased their power from boston edison,which charged negotiated bundled rates to encompass both the power and its delivery to the towns own networks.
the bundled rates covered use of two different classes of facilities one ptf pool transmission facilities are the core backbone transmission facilities in the new england power grid as defined by the nepool agreement,which governs their use and charges for it the other set,including local connections owned by boston edison,are called lns local network service.to use boston edison metaphor,ptf facilities are the electricity highway and lns facilities are the access ramps connecting to the local streets,the town networks.
the transmission and sale of power at wholesale is regulated by ferc.a.in april,boston edison and the towns reached an agreement to settle rate disputes then pending before ferc and parallel federal law suits.the terms included the sale by boston edison for a lump sum and annual payments to the towns of use rights in certain boston edison transmission facilities used in supplying power to the towns a provision that the towns thereafter would be deemed to be kv customer s and a further provision article iv 
concord or wellesley may utilize for ptf transactions,as defined in the nepool agreement,their shares of the capacities of the use rights facilities without payment of a ptf interconnection charge 
finally,article iv imposed in issue the quantities of power that could be acquired under the exemption 
in effect,in exchange for specified payments,the towns were given lower transmission rates afforded to high voltage kv customers even though the town facilities were low voltage and normally paid more,and exemption without payment of a ptf interconnection charge from the payment of otherwise applicable charges for interconnecting the facilities with ptf.the scope of this exemption,as applied to present delivery arrangements,is the nub of the present controversy.
pertinent to the dispute are further contracts,made in the,and yet to be described,between boston edison and the towns.a further and pivotal event was the decision of the towns,effective june,to purchase their power from another supplier constellation power services,in place of boston edison,supplanting the bundled rates and requiring the wheeling of this power to the towns over both ptf facilities and boston edison lns facilities.
the charges for use of ptf for this wheeling service are fixed by the nepool agreement and are not in dispute.the disputed element is the use of boston edison lns facilities for the from ptf to the town networks.in the ferc proceeding now before us,the towns urged that the language of article iv without payment of a ptf interconnection charge exempted their purchases from constellation,up to specified maximum amounts of power see note,above,from lns charges that boston edison sought to impose to carry the power.
exemption slightly overstates the issue.the nepool agreement as restated in provided that for participants directly connected to ptf,lns charges would be phased down and ultimately eliminated over a period ending in february of.the position of the towns is that for transactions after the they are contractually entitled to be treated as falling within this exempt category while paying the rate for the period of 
after a proceeding ending with a lengthy hearing,in august ferc administrative law judge alj issued a thoughtful decision.boston edison,wl.the decision glossed article iv of the settlement agreement in light of intervening agreements,and the alj concluded that the towns were contractually entitled to make their constellation purchases without being subject to the lns charges that boston edison sought.the commission affirmed and denied rehearing.boston edison,wl affirming boston edison,wl denying rehearing.
in this review proceeding,we are concerned primarily with issues of contract interpretation.boston edison concedes that under our precedents,ferc views are entitled to some deference in construing contracts,at least where the sales are subject to ferc regulation,boston edison fed.energy regulatory comm n,cir.in other words,the agency interpretation must be reasonable,boston edison fed.energy regulatory comm n,cir,but at the very least close calls tend to go its way.see sierra club larson,cir.
the dispute,both in front of ferc and in this court,begins with the agreement and,although its meaning is illuminated by subsequent agreements,the result is largely controlled by whatever reading is given to the original agreement.recall that the agreement says that the towns may use,for power obtained through ptf,their shares of the capacities of the facilities without payment of a ptf interconnection charge.what,then,is the ptf interconnection charge from which the towns are exempted up to the quantity limits elsewhere specified 
boston edison argues that this language must refer only to charges covering the costs of the facilities in which the towns purchased use rights.these facilities include boston edison station facilities and associated lines but they do not include longer distance,kv lines also owned by boston edison that connect their nearby stations to other stations that are part of the main ptf grid.see note,above.so,says boston edison,it is entitled to charge the towns for the use of the kv lines under lns tariffs.
the main counter to this reading is the fact that earlier provisions of the agreement already gave the towns the right to use the facilities without payment of further charges for those facilities and also freed them from higher charges associated with connection of lines.so,the alj reasoned,the article iv interconnection charges exemption would be redundant unless it the towns they were to be treated as if they were connected to ptf,exempt from lns charges.
to a utilities lawyer,for whom it is gospel that customers pay costs associated with facilities that they use,kahn,the economics of regulation principles and institutions,boston edison reading would be attractive the use rights in one set of facilities would not automatically carry over to allow what boston edison likes to call free use of other facilities.but the settlement was a compromise of many issues and resolved some in ways that may not be strictly,such as discontinuance of the higher charges for connection to town lines.
boston edison also relies on another provision of the addressed transmission rates.although at the time of the agreement the towns apparently intended to continue purchasing considerable electricity from boston edison at rates that bundled power and transmission,article vii addressed the contingency that the towns might want to purchase power elsewhere to be wheeled by boston edison.because the parties were unable to agree on such rates,article vii provided that boston edison would file its proposed rates and the towns could co
