this case concerns the subject matter jurisdiction of federal district courts pursuant to e of the telecommunications act of the telecommunications act or act,e,and the scope of immunity of a state commission and state commissioners from suit under.in october,the destek group,destek,initiated this action in the district court against the state of new hampshire,public utilities commission the state commission,members of the commission the commissioners and verizon new england,verizon.destek sought judicial review pursuant to e of the act,as well as injunctive relief and damages from the state commission,the commissioners,and verizon pursuant to for violations of the telecommunications act and the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.ultimately,the district court granted summary judgment for the state commission,the commissioners,and verizon on all claims,save the claim for prospective injunctive relief against the commissioners.the district court denied destek summary judgment motion.destek stipulated to dismissal with prejudice of the claim for prospective injunctive relief in order to proceed with this appeal.
on march,verizon executed an agreement the agreement with the university of new hampshire in which verizon contracted to provide asynchronous transfer mode atm cell relay service to the university of new hampshire within the state of new hampshire at a uniform statewide rate of per per month,provided the university of new hampshire purchase at least thirty interfaces.on june,verizon submitted a petition with the state commission seeking approval of the agreement as a special contract pursuant to.ann.verizon claimed that the agreement would enable the university of new hampshire to provide distance learning services to new hampshire school students and libraries,as well as high speed internet access 
on june,destek sought to intervene in the state commission proceedings and opposed the approval of the agreement.destek maintained,inter alia,that special contracts pursuant to.ann,such as the agreement at issue,are discriminatory and minimize competition.additionally,destek noted that the university of new hampshire had not filed with the state commission to become a telecommunications reseller or competitive local exchange carrier clec 
by an order dated july,the state commission approved the proposed special contract,subject to two conditions the state commission required that verizon file a tariff,within ninety days,making atm services available statewide with the same terms,conditions,and at the same prices as in the agreement and the state commission required that verizon resubmit the agreement to the state commission disclosing more details regarding the atm circuits noting the special circumstances of this agreement,the state commission opined that the public interest strongly favored quick approval of the contract because any delay could deny school children the benefits of atm services.
destek sought reconsideration of the state commission order arguing that approval of the agreement violated,inter alia,the telecommunications act,and the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.specifically,destek argued that congress intended the act to promote competition and thus,special contracts,as defined by,are preempted by the act because they stifle competition and to the extent that special contracts are not preempted,the state commission approval of this special contract violates b and a of the act.in an order dated november,the state commission denied destek motion for reconsideration.
on october,destek filed suit in the district court for the district of new hampshire.destek amended complaint sought declaratory relief,injunctive relief,and damages,raising three specific claims.first,destek asserted a right to judicial review under e of the telecommunications act,claiming that the agreement was an interconnection agreement and discriminatory and contrary to the public interest.second,destek sought injunctive relief and damages from the state commission,the commissioners,and verizon,pursuant to,for alleged violations of destek rights under the act,citing the state commission approval of the agreement without considering the federal standards for approval of interconnection agreements.third,destek sought injunctive relief and damages,pursuant to,against the state commission and the commissioners for alleged violations of destek rights under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment by repeated denials of destek requests for a hearing.
all parties sought summary judgment based on the agency record developed before the state commission.the district court granted verizon motion for summary judgment in its entirety,granted partial summary judgment for the state commission and the commissioners,and denied destek motion for summary judgment.first,the district court found that destek could not proceed under e of the act because the state commission had not made a determination under that section,a prerequisite for federal district court review.second,the district court held that destek failure to demonstrate that verizon conduct was fairly attributable to the state precluded destek from asserting claims against verizon,a private actor.third,the district court held that the state commission and commissioners in their official capacities were immune from suit under.fourth,the district court found that destek claims for damages against the commissioners in their individual capacities were barred by the doctrine of immunity.finally,the district court denied both the commissioners and destek motions for summary judgment with respect to destek claim for prospective injunctive relief,finding a potentially viable claim for seeking to compel the commissioners to comply with the telecommunications act,depending on the resolution of genuine issues of material fact as to whether the agreement was subject to the act.
in order to allow this appeal to proceed to this court,destek stipulated to the dismissal with prejudice of claims not resolved against it by the district court summary judgment decision,including the claim for prospective injunctive relief.on september,the district court entered final judgment based on the stipulation.this appeal follows.
destek raises four main arguments on appeal the district court erred in concluding that the state commission had not made a determination verizon was not liable under the state commission and commissioners acting in their official capacity were immune from the claims and the commissioners were immune from the claim in their individual capacities.we disagree with destek and for the reasons discussed below affirm the judgment of the district court.

first,destek argues that the district court erred in holding that destek lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the state commission had not made a determination.we disagree and affirm the district court dismissal.ultimately,the state commission never made a determination for the purposes of e and destek never raised this issue before the state commission.
a principal purpose of the telecommunications act is to increase competition in the market for local telephone services.see telecommunications act of,stat,at.the statute imposes obligations on companies that control the existing telecommunications network in the local area,known as ilecs.see,at.verizon is an ilec.
section of the act provides a comprehensive framework within which competitor telecommunications carriers,seeking to enter the local market,may negotiate interconnection agreements linking the two networks for mutual exchange of traffic with ilecs.under e,if the telecommunications carrier and the ilec agree on the terms for the interconnection,the parties must submit their interconnection agreement to the relevant state regulatory commission for review.id.e.the state commission must then either approve or disapprove the voluntarily negotiated interconnection agreement within ninety days otherwise the agreement is deemed approved.id.e.
section e a provides,in relevant part,that the state commission may only reject a proposed interconnection agreement adopted by voluntary negotiation if 
i the agreement or portion thereof discriminates against a telecommunications carrier not a party to the agreement or ii the implementation of such agreement or portion is not consistent with the public interest,convenience,and necessity 
finally,e allows any party aggrieved by the state commission determination under to seek judicial review,in a federal district court,of the determination for compliance with and.id.e.under,the only determination that can be made by a state commission in the case of a voluntarily negotiated interconnection agreement is the determination of whether to approve or reject it.see id.
a fundamental principle of the structure of our democracy is that federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction,owen equip.erection kroger,d props.constr,cir.the power of lower federal courts is limited to jurisdiction authorized by the constitution and expressly conferred by congress.id.
in this case,destek sought review of the state commission actions under e of the act.section e provides,in relevant part,
i n any case in which a state commission makes a determination under this section,any party aggrieved by such determination may bring an action in an appropriate federal district court to determine whether the agreement or statement meets the requirements of section of this title and this section.
e emphasis added.thus,in order for a federal district court to have jurisdiction under this section,congress required a determination by the state commission under,approving or rejecting an interconnection agreement and a party aggrieved by that determination.clearly,the dispositive jurisdictional inquiry under e is whether there was a determination for the purposes of that section.we will assume,without deciding,for the purpose of this inquiry,that the agreement is an interconnection agreement.
verizon and the university of new hampshire sought approval of their agreement as a special contract,pursuant to.ann.upon motion to intervene,destek argued that such contracts were discriminatory and anticompetitive,never mentioning the telecommunications act.the state commission conditionally approved the agreement as a special contract.destek sought reconsideration of the state commission approval,arguing,inter alia,that the agreement violated b describing the obligations of local exchange carriers not to impose discriminatory conditions on the resale of telecommunications and a prohibiting state and local regulations from creating barriers to entry of the act.the state commission denied the motion for reconsideration.destek then sought review of this case in the district court,claiming that the state commission had made a determination for the purposes of e.the district court correctly found this claim to be without merit.the record indicates that no determination approving or rejecting an interconnection agreement,pursuant to,was made by the state commission.the state commission reviewed and approved the agreement solely under new hampshire state law.accordingly,e can not be the court source of subject matter jurisdiction in this case.
moreover,orderly procedure and good administration require that objections to the proceedings of an administrative agency be made while it has opportunity for correction in order to raise issues reviewable by the courts.united states tucker truck lines.see also pepperell assocs.epa,cir holding that a claim not timely raised before an administrative agency could not be subject to judicial review.the record indicates that destek raised this issue for the first time before the district court.in other words,destek failed to timely present this issue before the state commission,and thus deprived the state commission of the opportunity to address the issue.subjecting the state commission to federal court jurisdiction,in this case,would violate the state commission autonomy.see,id.noting that this rule preserves judicial economy,agency autonomy,and accuracy of result by requiring full development of the issues in the administrative setting to obtain judicial review quoting wind,daley,cir citations omitted internal quotation marks omitted.
accordingly,the district court correctly dismissed this claim because it was not properly before the court for judicial review 
second,the district court found that destek claims against verizon,under,were without merit.we agree 
section allows plaintiffs to seek redress for deprivation of any rights,privileges,and immunities secured by the constitution and laws.a critical element of any claim is that the plaintiff show deprivation caused by a person acting under color of any statute,ordinance,regulation,custom,or usage of any state or territory or the district of columbia,cir.as a result of this color of state law requirement,rarely provides a cause of action against a private individual,restrict ing to state action.id.quoting lugar edmondson oil,d.only when a private individual conduct can be deemed fairly attributable to the state will a cause of action exist against that individual.lugar,at,at.
destek failed to show any conduct by verizon that was fairly attributable to the state see gerena legal,cir the mere fact of government regulation does not convert the regulated entity into the government.accordingly,the district court properly granted summary judgment for verizon on these claims.
third,the district court held that the state commission and the commissioners in their official capacities were immune from suit for damages under we agree 
destek argues that the state commission and the commissioners waived their immunity by voluntarily participating in the regulatory scheme established by the telecommunications act.whether a state waives its sovereign immunity by participating in the act regime is irrelevant to this issue because destek seeks to impose liability pursuant to,not the act.
it is well settled beyond peradventure that neither a state agency nor a state official acting in his official capacity may be sued for damages in a action.see johnson rodriguez,cir citing will.dep t of state police,d.thus,destek claims against the state commission and the commissioners in their official capacity for damages are contrary to established law.
finally,the district court held that destek claims for damages against the commissioners in their individual capacities,pursuant to,were barred by the doctrine of immunity.we agree 
this court must take a functional approach to determining whether absolute immunity is appropriate for the commissioners.see forrester white,d bettencourt,at citing scott centr.me.power,even though by statute a state agency official at various times may perform legislative,executive and judicial functions,each of which may entitle the official to a different level of immunity,the functional approach to immunity requires that actions taken in the performance of a particular function are to be accorded the level of immunity appropriate to that function.emphasis in original.absolute immunity is available to certain quasi judicial agency officials who,irrespective of their title,perform functions essentially similar to those of judges in a setting similar to that of a court.id.citing butz economou,d emphasis in original.this is the doctrine of immunity for members of adjudicatory bodies.
accordingly,we must decide here whether the commissioners have shown that while executing the activities which gave rise to this cl
