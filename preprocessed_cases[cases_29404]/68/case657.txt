in this appeal,we consider whether civil code section immunity precludes suit by a child who suffered injuries when he attempted to retrieve his kite from an overhead power line.we determine the utility is immune from suit under these circumstances and none of the statutory exceptions applies.further,we conclude public utilities code section does not abrogate the immunity afforded a utility by section.we therefore affirm the entry of summary judgment.
background 
on april,joshua jackson was playing video games at the home of his friend,dominic portera.dominic mother,laura portera,suggested the boys go outside and fly joshua new kite,and they did so.but while joshua stood in the portera backyard flying his kite,the wind blew the kite out of his hands and carried it over the adjoining property of eve prince laura portera mother.there,the kite became entangled in a power line owned by respondent pacific gas electric company pg e.joshua,dominic and dominic younger sister natalie ran onto the prince property.prince was not home at the time.after an unsuccessful attempt to reach the kite with a branch,joshua tried to dislodge it using an aluminum pole the children found nearby.the pole touched the electrical line,causing joshua serious physical injury.

discussion 
summary judgment is proper only if there is no triable issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.code civ,subd.c.a court must strictly construe the moving party papers and liberally construe those of the opposing party to determine if they raise a triable issue of material fact.citation.calhoon lewis th,d.on appeal,we review the record de novo,considering all the evidence set forth in the moving and opposition papers except that to which objections have been made and sustained.citation.guz bechtel national cal th,d.
section immunity applies 
the recreational use immunity statute,codified in section,creates an exception to the general rule of rowland christian cal d,that a private landowner owes a duty of reasonable care to any person coming onto the land.ornelas randolph cal th,d.portions of section relevant to this appeal provide 
an owner of any estate or any other interest in real property,whether possessory or nonpossessory,owes no duty of care to keep the premises safe for entry or use by others for any recreational purpose or to give any warning of hazardous conditions,uses of,structures,or activities on such premises to persons entering for such purpose,except as provided in this section.
a recreational purpose,as used in this section,includes such activities as fishing,hunting,camping,water sports,hiking,spelunking,sport parachuting,riding,including animal riding,snowmobiling,and all other types of vehicular riding,rock collecting,sightseeing,picnicking,nature study,nature contacting,recreational gardening,gleaning,hang gliding,winter sports,and viewing or enjoying historical,archaeological,scenic,natural,or scientific sites.
this section does not limit the liability which otherwise exists a for willful or malicious failure to guard or warn against a dangerous condition,use,structure or activity or b for injury suffered in any case where permission to enter for the above purpose was granted for a consideration or c to any persons who are expressly invited rather than merely permitted to come upon the premises by the landowner.
retrieving kite is a recreational use of property 
joshua argues pg e does not enjoy immunity under section because he did not enter its property for a recreational purpose.he flew his kite on the portera property and only entered the prince property and pg e easement to retrieve the kite after it blew out of his hands.since retrieving a lost item is not generally considered recreation,joshua contends the recreational use immunity statute does not apply,or the recreational nature of his activity was a factual issue precluding summary judgment.
section describes a wide range of recreational activities giving rise to immunity.indeed,the legislature has amended section several times since its enactment in to broaden the range of activities included within the statute definition of a recreational purpose.ornelas randolph,supra,cal th at,fn,d.kite flying is indisputably a recreational activity,and,consistent with section broad language,we conclude the steps a takes to retrieve his wayward kite are included in the statutory definition of recreation.a trusts his instrument to the whims and fancies of the is the joy of the sport.but in doing so,he takes a risk that the wind will blow the kite in an unintended direction or to an undesired location.given the nature of the activity,we do not agree with joshua that recreation stops the moment a kite leaves the flyer control.
still,joshua insists summary judgment was improper because the existence of recreational purpose under section is a question of fact.generally,whether one has entered property for a recreational purpose within the meaning of the statute is a question of fact,to be determined through a consideration of the totality of the facts and circumstances,including the prior use of the land.while the plaintiff subjective intent will not be controlling,it is relevant to show purpose.gerkin santa clara valley water dist.d.ornelas randolph,supra,cal th at,d.however,the relevant facts here are not in dispute.joshua went outside to fly a kite,at one point the kite blew out of joshua hands and became entangled in lines above the neighbor property,and joshua and his friends tried to retrieve it.an issue may exist as to whether joshua intended to continue flying the kite after he recovered it,but this question is immaterial.see ornelas randolph,supra,at,d.as in ornelas,joshua presence on the pg e easement was occasioned by his recreational activity see ibid.therefore,the recreational use immunity statute applies.
express invitation exception inapplicable to plaintiff claims 
in general,section provides owners of any interest in land,possessory or nonpossessory,with immunity from tort liability for injuries sustained in the recreational use of that land.hubbard brown cal d.however,the statute does not limit liability to any persons who are expressly invited rather than merely permitted to enter a property.this express invitation exception requires a direct,personal request from the landowner to the invitee to enter the property johnson unocal th,d ravell united states cir,although the invitation need not be for the specific purpose of engaging in recreation.calhoon lewis,supra,th at,d.
joshua contends summary judgment under section was improper because laura portera expressly invited him to play on the adjoining prince and portera properties.he offered evidence below showing portera had the authority to invite children onto the prince property in her mother absence.pg e disagreed that this evidence established an express invitation under section,as opposed to mere permission.in any event,pg e argued,an invitation from portera was irrelevant because only an invitation from pg e could abrogate the utility immunity under section.the trial court relied largely on pg e second argument in granting summary judgment,stating even if the plaintiff had demonstrated an express invitation from the owner of the underlying property,no such third party invitation will abrogate pg e immunity pursuant to civil code.
while her son and joshua were inside playing,laura portera told them,look,it nice outside.why do you go outside and play the boys then decided to go out and fly joshua new kite.portera testified that the boys routinely played on her property and her mother adjoining property and never needed to ask permission from her or prince.portera also submitted a declaration in opposition to pg e motion for summary judgment,explaining that she was responsible for supervising the prince
