plaintiffs own a parcel of land in rural solano county bounded by a county road.the land underlying and immediately adjoining the road is subject to a public.defendant aba energy corporation aba is a private company that operates a natural gas field located near plaintiffs parcel.after obtaining an appropriate permit from the county,but without notice to plaintiffs,aba installed a pipeline in the on plaintiffs land to transport natural gas recovered from aba drilling operations.plaintiffs sued for trespass,contending that aba was required to obtain their consent before laying pipe in the.the trial court agreed with plaintiffs,finding that aba pipeline constituted a trespass,but the court refused to require aba to remove the line and awarded only nominal damages.
aba contends that the trial court erred in finding a trespass.plaintiffs contend in their that the trial court erred in permitting the pipeline to remain,in awarding only nominal damages,and in refusing to award attorney fees.we reverse the trial court finding that aba is a trespasser,direct entry of judgment for aba,and dismiss plaintiffs as moot.
background 
plaintiffs tony,virginia and frank bello bellos are the trustees of three living trusts that together own a parcel of agricultural land in solano county.at the time of trial,the parcel was farmed by tenants and planted with clover and alfalfa.the northern border of the bellos property is subject to a public in favor of the county.the full width of the is feet,containing a paved county road,midway road,and feet of unpaved reserve on either side.because the is shared by the parcel across the road,the bellos parcel supports one longitudinal half of the road and one of the unpaved shoulders.
aba is a privately owned natural gas exploration and production company.in the year,aba drilled natural gas wells on property near the bellos parcel.aba anticipated that the unprocessed natural gas recovered from these wells would be transported by pipeline to a metering station operated by the local natural gas utility,pacific gas electric company pg e.at that point,aba gas would be mixed with gas from other producers.aba customers,rather than receiving the actual gas recovered by aba,would be entitled to draw from pg e natural gas delivery system a cubic yardage equivalent to that delivered into the system by aba.as aba president testified,the system is similar to a bank.
to transport the gas recovered from the well,aba applied to the county for a encroachment permit authorizing the burial of a,metal pipeline in the shoulder along local roads.approximately one mile of the proposed pipeline was to be buried in the alongside midway road,including that portion of midway road on the bellos parcel.the county approved the permit,and aba installed the pipeline.aba neither sought nor received the consent of the underlying landowners to installation of the pipeline.
the bellos filed this action for trespass and ejectment after aba had completed construction of the pipeline.their complaint asserted that aba was required to obtain their consent prior to burying a pipeline in the roadway on their property and sought damages and an injunction requiring aba to remove the pipeline.
the case was tried without a jury.in its statement of decision,the trial court concluded that aba installation of the pipeline was not within the scope of uses permitted in the public because t he installation of a natural gas pipeline within the easement is not a use incidental to the road purposes for which the was acquired by the county.based on its conclusion that the pipeline was not a proper use of the,the court found that aba,having never obtained the bellos consent to installation of the pipeline,was a trespasser.nonetheless,the court granted only nominal damages,finding that the pipeline did not interfere with the bellos use of their land and that they had provided no evidence to support their claim that the pipeline had diminished the value of their property.because aba trespass was made in good faith and did not injure the bellos,the court found that the balance of hardships weighed against their request for removal of the pipeline and denied injunctive relief.the trial judge also declined to award attorney fees.
ii.discussion 
we first address aba contention that the trial court erred in finding that it was required to obtain the bellos consent before installing a pipeline in the public on their property although the trial court cited no legal authority in its decision,the language of its ruling suggests that the court was relying on gurnsey northern cal,gurnsey,in which the supreme court held that the defendant installation of electrical transmission poles and lines in the along a public wagon road across a large tract of land in tehama county id.at,constituted a trespass because the electric lines did not serve purposes incidental to the effective use by the public of the highway.id.at.
gurnsey represents one of two distinct lines of authority in the supreme court jurisprudence.the second line was established nearly years prior to gurnsey by montgomery railway company cal,montgomery,in which the supreme court allowed an interurban railway to be constructed in a public without the landowner consent.montgomery holds that,as a result of the demands of urbanization,public located in developed areas are subject to a wide range of other and further uses besides surface transportation,including the installation of sewage,water,gas,and communications lines.id.at.this expansive approach was reaffirmed by colegrove city of hollywood cal,colegrove,decided only four years prior to gurnsey.
we find gurnsey distinguishable in these circumstances and hold that the standard adopted in montgomery governs use of the along the bellos property.the rule of law announced by gurnsey is applicable only to that have yet to be subjected to the other and further uses that are incident to modern development.montgomery,supra,cal.at.because public even in rural portions of the san francisco bay area are now subject to the intensive use described in montgomery,the rule of law adopted in that case must govern here.
a.the supreme court public jurisprudence 
a public is a form of easement,in that it grants use rights in a particular parcel of land to nonowners of the land,subd.city of manhattan beach superior court cal th,d.a private easement ordinarily vests those use rights in the owner of a particular parcel of neighboring property,the dominant tenement.moylan dykes d.unlike a private easement,the use rights of a public are vested equally in each and every member of the public.in re anderson.the city or county government ordinarily administers use of the,sts.
the late century saw a dramatic change in the judicially recognized scope of public in california.before the widespread adoption of railroads,electricity,and the telephone,the term was given its literal public right to construct,maintain,and use a road over private land.any other use required the landowner consent.see,muller railway cal,reed cal.shortly before the turn of the century,however,the supreme court recognized that urbanization was placing a much greater demand on public resources than could be accommodated by this literal view of public rights.
in montgomery,supra,the court expressly overruled the prevailing narrow interpretation of in holding that a municipality could grant a private company the right to construct and operate a railroad in a public without the landowner consent.summarizing its holding,the montgomery court affirm ed that when a public street in a city is dedicated to the general use of the public,it involves its use subject to municipal control and limitations for all the uses and purposes of the public as a street,including such methods for the transportation of passengers and freight as modern science and improvements may have rendered necessary,and that the application of these methods and indeed of those yet to be discovered,must have been contemplated when the street was opened and the right of way obtained,and hence that such a user imposes no new burden or servitude upon the owner of the abutting land.montgomery,supra,cal.at.
in justifying this departure from what the court acknowledged was contrary prior precedent,it summed up the basis for its holding in three words the world moves the trend of judicial opinion is to a broader and more comprehensive view of the rights of the public in and to the streets and highways of city and country montgomery,supra,cal.at.the court was not deterred by its recognition that in granting a broad scope to public rights it was depriving underlying landowners of the rights of use and control that traditionally accompany private land ownership.on the contrary,it quoted approvingly an oregon case which concluded that t he establishment of a public highway practically divests the owner of a fee to the land upon which it is laid out of the entire present beneficial interest of a private nature which he has therein.it leaves him nothing but the possibility of a reinvestment of his former interest in case the highway should be discontinued as such id.at,quoting paquet tabor r y or.
the montgomery court expressly limited the application of its ruling to areas in which the public were being used to contain significant public infrastructure.before stating its holding,the court noted that there is a wide distinction between a highway in the country and a street in a city or village,as to the servitude in the land upon which they are located.montgomery,supra,cal.at.this wide distinction was not based on any inherent difference between in city and countryside.rather,it was based on the practical recognition that development was placing demands on streets in urban that,in,had not yet reached the enormous expanse of california outside its cities.as the court noted,while country roads were used only for surface transit,i n the case of streets in a city there are other and further uses,such as the construction of sewers and drains,laying of gas and water pipes,erection of telegraph and telephone wires,and a variety of other improvements,beneath,upon,and above the surface,to which in modern times urban streets have been subjected.id.at.
the expansive interpretation of in developed areas was reaffirmed in colegrove,supra,cal,which concerned the right of an underlying landowner to lay pipe in a previously dedicated roadway.the road in question ran through a lemon orchard in the city of developed area,by the court reckoning,despite the property agricultural use.id.at.discussing the scope of the,the court noted that i n city streets the easement of the public is,as a result of the conditions of urban life,more extensive than in roads through sparsely inhabited regions.in cities,it is customary to devote not only the surface of the street and the space above the street to public use,but the municipality may,and frequently does,occupy the soil beneath the surface for the accommodation of sewers,gas and water pipes,electric wires,and conduits for railroads.where the city undertakes to occupy the space above or below the surface of the street for any purpose within the scope of the public uses to which highways may be put,the use by the owner of the fee must yield to the public use.id.at.colegrove also recognized that the scope of roadway is not fixed but responds to changing societal conditions,noting that t his right of the owner may grow less and less as the public needs increase id.at,quoting allen boston.
four years later,in gurnsey,the supreme court had occasion to rule on the scope of public underlying what colegrove had described as roads through sparsely inhabited regions.colegrove,supra,cal.at.at issue was the scope of a public underlying a public wagon road crossing a large ranch in tehama county.gurnsey,supra,cal.at.the defendant power company had obtained a franchise from the county that permitted it to erect poles and string electrical transmission wires in public.ibid.relying on that franchise,it ran wires along the road crossing the plaintiff ranch to bring electricity to two other private ranches.id.at.in ruling on the scope of this,the court held that a ll that the public acquires under the easement is declared by former section of the political code,as follows by taking or accepting land for a highway,the public acquire only the right of way,and the incidents necessary to enjoying and maintaining the same id.at.acknowledging the statutory right of the local government to grant franchises to private companies for lawful use of the,the court held that the lawful uses of the wagon road were restricted to something which will promote the public comfort and convenience in the use of the highway.id.at.because the defendant power lines served no function,the gurnsey court found them not to be incident to the wagon road and therefore to be outside the rights granted to the public in the.id.at.
since gurnsey,the supreme court has only twice addressed the scope of roadway,both times adopting a broad construction.in hayes handley cal,the court reaffirmed montgomery and colegrove,holding that the city of los angeles was permitted to construct a traffic tunnel beneath a street without paying compensation to abutting landowners.in doing so,the court quoted the expansive view of public from both colegrove i t is well settled that the manner and extent of such public use is not limited by any standard of methods of use in vogue at the time of dedication and montgomery a public includes such methods for the transportation of passengers and freight as modern science and improvements may have rendered necessary and,indeed,of those yet to be discovered.hayes handley,at.somewhat more recently,in faus city of los angeles cal d,the court again applied a flexible approach,holding that a public easement granted expressly for the operation of an electric interurban railway must be interpreted to allow the operation of equivalent motorbus service.although the decision was not a general pronouncement on the scope of roadway,being limited to the specific language of the easement dedication,it interpreted that language broadly,holding that such easements are deemed to have been intended to accommodate future needs.citation.our courts have been receptive to the contention that changed economic and technological conditions require reevaluation of restrictions placed upon the use of real property citations.id.at.
the courts of appeal have also consistently adopted a broad and flexible interpretation of the scope of public.in in re anderson,supra,the court approved the establishment of a public market in los angeles as an appropriate use of a public.in discussing the breadth of uses permitted in a,the court quoted approvingly an earlier massachusetts case,which held the easement which the public acquires includes every reasonable means of transportation for persons,and commodities,and of transmission of intelligence which the advance of civilization may render suitable for a highway,including gas and water pipes,sewer,telephone,telegraph,electric light and power poles,wires and conduits,electric and horse railways,the subway and private railroads id.at,quoting commonwealth morrison.other decisions have echoed this breadth.see,galeb cupertino sanitary dist.d.includes use rights mancino santa clara county flood.dist.d.same smith county of san diego d.approving a flood control channel as a proper use,holding that a ny use which was rendered necessary for the public by future development or discovery would also have been contemplated norris state of california ex rel.pub.wks.d.w hen land is taken or dedicated for use as a highway,the taking or dedication should be presumed to be not merely for such purposes and uses as were known and customary,at that time,but also for all public purposes,present or prospective,whether then known or not,consistent with the character of such highways collopy united railroads,highway includes new and improved methods of transportation,such as rail.
applying montgomery and gurnsey 
the rule of montgomery and colegrove,rather than the rule of gurnsey,is more appropriate for the at issue here.both montgomery and colegrove justified their adoption of a broad interpretation of public rights by the need to accommodate the extensive infrastructure that accompanies modern development.see montgomery,supra,cal.at,colegrove,supra,cal.at.as summed up by colegrove,the scope of public in developed areas is more extensive because of the need to accommodat e sewers,gas and water pipes,electric wires,and conduits for railroads.colegrove,at.in areas where intensive use of the is necessary to support public infrastructure,the use by the owner of the fee must yield to the public use.id.at.in contrast,the under consideration in gurnsey,a wagon road,appears to have been used solely for private surface transportation.it crossed land that was sparsely inhabited colegrove,at,and,because the area had yet to receive even electricity,presumably also lacked the other public infrastructure that served to justify a broad scope in montgomery and colegrove.see montgomery,supra,cal.at,colegrove,supra,cal.at.
since,the intensive use of found in montgomery and colegrove has migrated with city populations into the countryside.today,much of california now shares in the type of public services described in montgomery and colegrove,which have only expanded in number since the turn of the century.rural homes that once used a well and a septic tank or outhouse are now often connected to a water main and sewer.drainage lines are common.rural electricity,a novelty in,is universally available,as is the service similarly restricted to urban areas at the turn of the century.now added to these is the availability of cable television and even the internet,causing the in the countryside to be as filled with the transmission hardware of public services as were city in the time of montgomery and colegrove.
rural solano county is no exception the advance of public services into the solano county countryside is dramatically illustrated by the record in this case.aba had originally intended to bury its pipeline in the shoulder on the opposite side of midway road,an arrangement that would have avoided the bellos property altogether.the change in routing occurred because,upon opening a trench on the opposite side of the road,aba discovered that the was already occupied by cable laid down by at 
although it may be objected that the scope of public rights in a should not depend upon trends of development beyond the control of local landowners,the supreme court instructed to the contrary in colegrove,holding that t his residual right of the owner may grow less and less as the public needs increase colegrove,supra,cal.at,quoting allen boston,supra.it is important to remember that the modern began in california with montgomery in to construe public to accommodate technological advancement in the conveyance of goods and people,an approach that has been adopted invariably by california courts in decisions since gurnsey.
this flexible approach is consistent with the conclusions reached by courts in most other states.in addition to the pioneering decisions from massachusetts and oregon dealing primarily with urban areas,cited in montgomery and colegrove,a predominant plurality of states has adopted a broad scope for outside cities.notably,ohio courts had originally developed a distinction between the scope of in developed and rural areas similar to that drawn by montgomery and gurnsey.however,in ziegler service ohio,the ohio supreme court concluded that the steadily increasing process of rural urbanization had rendered the distinction untenable.id.at.accordingly,the court allowed the installation of a water line in a rural without the consent of or compensation to the landowner,adopting a uniformly broad scope for regardless of location.in bogart caprock communications,the plaintiff owned property adjoining a county road in oklahoma.the defendant,a telecommunications company,sought to lay cable in the alongside the county road.as here,the landowner contended that the installation constituted a trespassing,requiring his consent.the oklahoma supreme court rejected this contention,holding that t he new or different use of the highway,or new or different method of transmission or transportation,is but a further proper use of the highways as new methods of transportation develop they are used upon the highway whether that use is by bus,truck,or oil pipeline id.at,quoting nazworthy illinois oil.similar reasoning led the supreme court of west virginia to find the installation of a natural gas pipeline to be within the proper scope of a public,noting that there is no difference whether the question arises in regard to a rural highway right of way or to a city street.herold gas.equivalent cases are legion although other states courts are not unanimous 
because the bellos property is located in an area with public infrastructure occupying the public,we find that the trial court erred in applying the standard of gurnsey,rather than that of montgomery and colegrove,to the along the bellos property.we now proceed to consider whether aba pipeline was properly within the scope established by montgomery and colegrove.
aba status as a private company 
the bellos argue that aba should be denied use of the because aba is a private company rather than a public utility.although it is true that most prior decisions have addressed the use of by publicly regulated utilities or public agencies we can find no statutory or doctrinal basis for a per se exclusion of private users from.on a fundamental level,every member of the public has an equal right in the use of a public.in re anderson,supra.at,people henderson d.aba status as a private corporation no more disqualifies it from access to the underground portion of the than it would justify excluding aba trucks from using the.
significantly,streets and highways code section,which grants to county governments the right to issue encroachment permits in county,makes no distinction between public agencies or utilities and other proposed users.indeed,streets and highways code section,which implements section,expressly anticipates that encroachment permits will be granted to private users.it notes that permits issued to a public agency or a public utility must contain a particular provision while a ll permits other than those issued to public agencies or a public utility are subject to a somewhat different rule.sts,italics added.consistent with this view,people sweetser d.interpreted section as granting counties the statutory authority to issue a written encroachment permit allowing any person,including the underlying landowner,to place fences or other structures or objects upon portions of a county highway easement.id.at,citing sts,subds.a b,subd.b,italics added.
d.the standard for use of a public 
although there is no per se ban on private users of a public,every encroachment permit should be measured against the standards governing the permissible uses of a public.as discussed above,the scope of public has been the subject of a number of prior decisions.although these cases have not established uniform criteria for evaluating the propriety of a permitted use of a public,a synthesis of the examples found in them establishes that a proposed use of a public should serve as a means,or be incident to a means,for the transport or transmission of people,commodities,waste products or information,or serve public safety montgomery,supra,cal.at,in re anderson,supra.at,mancino santa clara county flood,supra,d at.serve either the public interest or a private interest of the underlying landowner that does not interfere with the public use rights people henderson,supra,d at,and not unduly endanger or interfere with use of the abutting property.norris state of california ex rel.pub,supra,d at.
the initial task of determining whether a proposed use of a county road satisfies these criteria is vested by statute in the county road commissioner.see people henderson,supra,d at.streets and highways code section grants to the road commissioner the authority to issue permits for the use of,including the making of any opening or excavation in the and the placement of any encroachment.sts,subds.a b.the road commissioner decision will be reversed only if it is found to have been the result of capricious or arbitrar
