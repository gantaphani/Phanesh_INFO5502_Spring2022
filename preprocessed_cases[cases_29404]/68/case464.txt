petitioner,idaho power company,challenges two ferc orders barring idaho power from entering into a contract to provide electricity to the ip merchant group ip merchant from december through december.see idaho power,order denying petition for declaratory order,wl order denying petition idaho power,order denying rehearing and clarifying prior order,order denying rehearing.before receiving the bid from ip merchant,idaho power had been furnishing electric transmission service to the arizona public service company aps.aps had a right of first refusal to match the ip merchant bid for service from idaho power.in order to exercise its right of first refusal,aps had to agree to accept a contract term at least equal to the competing request offered by ip merchant in its bid for transmission service from idaho power.idaho power company open access transmission tariff idaho power oatt,joint appendix.however,because it could only seek service from idaho power in increments,aps was unable to match ip merchant contract bid.ferc nonetheless ruled that idaho power was obliged to continue providing service to aps,because the transmission service requests were not substantially the same in all respects due to the dissimilarity in available terms of service.order denying rehearing,at.in other words,ferc reasoned that the offers by aps and ip merchant were not substantially the same in all respects,and thus not competing bids,because ip merchant offered a term while aps offered only an term.order denying petition,at order denying rehearing,at.
ferc interpretation of the right of first refusal provision defies reason.idaho power open access transmission tariff oatt and ferc orders creating the applicable pro forma tariff provide that,in order to exercise a right of first refusal,the existing firm service customer must agree to accept a contract term at least equal to a competing request by any new eligible customer.idaho power oatt,promoting wholesale competition through open access transmission services by public utilities recovery of standard costs by public utilities and transmitting utilities,order,stats.regs.order.ferc has turned the tariff and orders on their heads by suggesting that the competitor must put forward an offer identical to the incumbent in order for the competing bids to be substantially the same in all respects.under this reasoning,the competitor is not allowed to make a better offer,which of course ensures that the incumbent never loses.this is a nonsensical construction of the right of first refusal,which we reject as arbitrary and capricious.accordingly,we grant idaho power petition for review.
background 
a.the pro forma tariff 
in,ferc promulgated a set of rules designed to create a more competitive environment in the electric utility industry.promoting wholesale competition through open access transmission services by public utilities recovery of stranded costs by public utilities and transmitting utilities,order,stats.regs.order,order on reh g,order,order on reh g,order,wl,order on reh g,order,wl,aff in part and remanded in part sub nom.transmission access policy study group ferc,aff jurisdictional ruling sub nom.new york ferc,d.these rules required each utility to separate its transmission function from its wholesale merchant function,the selling of electric power at wholesale rates.they also required each utility to file and take transmission under an oatt designed to assure access to transmission service on a basis.ferc rules specified the terms of a pro forma tariff designed to achieve the competitive goals of order.order at.with limited exceptions,each utility oatt must conform to the terms and conditions specified in the pro forma tariff.report of the committee on electric utility regulation,energy,the ferc will allow deviations from the terms and conditions to reflect regional practices,but these deviations are limited primarily to scheduling deadlines.with very limited exceptions,the ferc has rejected all other deviations.ferc revised the pro forma tariff in order.
the pro forma tariff required each utility to create an open access same time information system oasis,an electronic system for accepting transmission requests that would make them known simultaneously to all potential customers.while of the pro forma tariff specified that requests for firm service would generally be accepted in the order in which they are received,order at,it also noted a special provision in for determining priority where an incumbent customer seeks to renew service.id.at.
section of the tariff provided the incumbent customer with a right of first refusal to match the duration offered by a new customer at the full oatt rate.section provides,in relevant part 
if at the end of the contract term,the transmission provider transmission system can not accommodate all of the requests for transmission service the existing firm service customer must agree to accept a contract term at least equal to a competing request by any new eligible customer and to pay the current just and reasonable rate,as approved by the commission,for such service.

aps is idaho power incumbent customer,receiving service from substation in southeastern idaho,through brownlee substation in western idaho,to the lagrande substation in northeastern oregon.the history surrounding the dealings between aps and idaho power is somewhat convoluted.in,aps submitted several requests through idaho power oasis for,transmission service for an period.the following year,idaho power provided aps with a facility study that demonstrated that existing obligations prevented idaho power from meeting aps service request for the full period without constructing facility upgrades.idaho power offered aps mw of transmission service on borah west that pacificorp had contractual rights to use,but could not due to system limitations.however,idaho power cautioned that this service would terminate when pacificorp upgraded the facilities and exercised its preexisting rights to the capacity.
after further negotiations between idaho power and aps failed to yield an executed service agreement,ferc directed idaho power to provide aps with partial interim transmission service.idaho power,order rejecting unexecuted service agreements,and requiring the filing of new service agreements and the provision of partial interim transmission service,wl.since idaho power facility study indicated that it could provide mw of aps requested firm service for a term of months rather than the eight years that aps requested,ferc required idaho power to file new service agreements providing aps with firm transmission service for an term.id.at.ferc also stated that aps would be entitled to roll over its service at the end of the term,if it chose not to construct additional facilities and the capacity committed to pacificorp remained available.id.this ferc order effectively restricted aps ability to bid to increments.
subsequently,on november,ip merchant submitted a request on idaho power oasis for mw of firm transmission service for the period december,through december.the following day,aps sent a letter to idaho power stating that it was exercising its rollover rights for an additional period from april,through september.then on november,ip merchant submitted a second request on idaho power oasis for an additional mw of longterm firm transmission service.this service was also from the idaho power system to lagrande,for a period from january,to december.
on december,idaho power advised aps of its right of first refusal.idaho power simultaneously informed aps that it was filing a petition for declaratory order.the petition requested guidance as to whether,if aps submitted a or longer request for which the continuation of service beyond months would be contingent on the continuing availability of capacity over borah west,this contingent request would be sufficient to match the,noncontingent ip merchant request.in response to the petition,aps questioned the validity of the ip merchant transmission requests in light of the fact that they were not preconfirmed requests,no service agreements had been executed,and no facilities study agreements or financial commitments had been proffered.arizona public service company motion to intervene,protest and request for expedited consideration at,idaho power,wl.aps also argued that,since it is willing to match the idaho merchant group term of years,and to extend it for an additional years,for a term from april,through march,to the extent necessary for aps to retain service,it should prevail over ip merchant under oatt mechanism.id.at.however,aps did not seek a waiver from ferc order limiting it to terms so that it could compete fully against ip merchant in exercising its right of first refusal.
ferc orders 
despite the shorter term offered by aps,ferc ruled in its initial order that aps could roll over its contract.ferc acknowledged that the priority rule was designed to provide a mechanism for allocating transmission capacity when there is insufficient capacity to accommodate all requesters.order denying petition,at.however,ferc stated that,under order,the two customers requests had to be substantially the same in all respects in order to be competing.id.at quoting order at emphasis in original.ferc found that the two requests were not,in fact,substantially the same instead,it found them to be vastly different,primarily because they flowed in different directions and used different portions of the idaho power system.id.ferc also noted that the dissimilarity in available terms of service also supports the variant nature of the two customers transmission service requests.id.ferc further noted that aps expressed an intention to match the ip merchant group offer,but was restricted from doing so by a prior ferc order.id.since ferc found that the requests were not substantially the same in all respects,the agency ruled that they were not competing.it thus ordered idaho power to give the available mw to aps.id.
idaho power petitioned for rehearing.it first noted that a central factual premise for ferc order that the two requests flowed in different directions and used different portions of the idaho power system was incorrect.rather,the requests flowed in the same direction over the line in dispute.further,idaho power argued that,because aps had not matched the ip merchant group offer,the ip merchant group should be the priority applicant.
ferc denied idaho power request for rehearing.it retreated from its reliance on the alleged physical differences between the services,stating that,while it had discussed the physical differences between the transmission service requests,our primary rationale for determining that the transmission service requests were not substantially the same in all respects was the dissimilarity in available terms of service.order denying rehearing,at.since aps was limited to increments,ferc reasoned that to permit ip merchant longer term service request to obtain transmission capacity at the expense of arizona public service would inappropriately disadvantage an existing transmission customer.id.thus,ferc awarded the mw of service to aps,for the period ending september.idaho power now petitions this court for review.
ii.analysis 
the first issue we must address is whether idaho power possesses constitutional standing to challenge ferc orders.ferc argues that idaho power suffered no injury in fact because the utility can not prove that ferc orders will cause any monetary loss.we reject this argument.
the two principal forms of standing are article iii case or controversy and prudential.article iii standing entails three requirements 
first,the plaintiff must have suffered an injury in fact an invasion of a legally protected interest which is a concrete and particularized,and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.second,there must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained injury has to be fairly trace able to the challenged action of the defendant,and not th e result of the independent action of some third party not before the court.third,it must be likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.

ferc only standing argument is that idaho power suffered no injury in fact because the utility can not prove that ferc orders will cause it to lose any profits.ferc points out idaho power statement that ferc orders required it to enter into a contract that,for an period,would generate,and forgo entering into a contract that would yield,br.of petitioner at,and states that the two amounts,adjusted for time differential,are equivalent.thus,at least for the next months,ferc argues that petitioner is in exactly the same position,regardless of which contract it is required to accept.br.of respondent at.
this argument is meritless.idaho power has suffered an injury in fact because ferc orders bind it to an contract with aps and preclude it from entering a contract with ip merchant.
as a general matter,in a perfectly competitive market,a contract incorporates a premium for stability,and a pipeline naturally values a transportation contract more highly,ceteris paribus if the maximum approved rate artificially limits a rival shipper ability to outbid the existing shipper,the rival shipper may offer a contract by bidding up the contract duration instead.
united distrib.ferc.t he reality is that contract duration is a measure of value.id.because idaho power possesses a interest in entering a contract,it suffered a cognizable injury when it was compelled to forgo a contract with ip merchant and instead enter a contract with its associated market risks.that injury was immediate,concrete,and particularized.
we have previously recognized that an agency ruling that replaces a certain outcome with one that contains uncertainty causes an injury that is felt immediately and confers standing.in rio grande pipeline ferc,petitioner rio grande pipeline company could either justify the rates for its service through a,in which it was required to file cost,revenue and throughput data supporting the proposed rate,or through b,which required only a sworn statement that the proposed rate is agreed to by at least one person who intends to use the service.rio grande pipeline,at.the major advantage to the former provision was that rates justified under b were ineffective if a protest to the initial rate was filed after the protest,the carrier would be required to seek a a justification.id.rio grande requested ferc approval pursuant to a.ferc denied this request.however,the agency noted that since rio grande had supplied the affidavit required by b,and no entity had protested the charged rate,rio grande was free to charge the proposed rate in its transactions.id.at.when rio grande petitioned this court for review,ferc argued that the petitioner had suffered no injury in fact,because it remained free to establish the same rates under b.id.at.however,we found that ferc orders caused the petitioner a present economic injury because approval under that section left the rates open to challenge at any time by third parties,while approval under a would have afforded greater certainty.id.at.
ferc argues that idaho power is unlikely to suffer any economic loss in the future because at least three parties aps,the ip merchant group,and pacificorp have expressed an interest in using that capacit
