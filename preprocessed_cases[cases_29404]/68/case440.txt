the petitioners,a group of hydroelectric utilities licensed under the federal power act fpa or act,et,seek review of three orders of the federal energy regulatory commission commission or ferc that denied them refunds of annual charges that ferc imposed on them pursuant to section of the fpa.the charges should be refunded,they contend,because ferc inadequately supervises the submission of cost reports by other federal agencies ofas upon which the annual charges are based.they also argue that the charges should be refunded because they are based on costs beyond the scope of those recoverable under the act.
ferc argues that the court lacks jurisdiction because the orders under review are not final.we conclude that the orders are final and we grant the petition because ferc method of assessing the annual charges based on ofas fpa costs conflicts with its obligations under the act.
when the congress began to regulate the production of hydroelectric power pursuant to the federal water power act of fwpa,it intended to pass the costs of administration on to the regulated entities.to that end,in addition to authorizing the federal power commission now ferc to charge utilities for the use of federal lands or property,the fwpa now the federal power act required that licensees shall pay to the united states reasonable annual charges in an amount to be fixed by the c ommission for the purpose of reimbursing the united states for the costs of the administration of this act.federal water power act of,ch,e,stat,codified as amended at e pursuant to this statutory directive,codified in section e of the fpa,the commission issued regulations to govern the computation and collection of the fixed charges.pt.
until,the commission used this authority to impose charges only to reimburse the commission for its costs incurred in administering the act.city of idaho falls,wl,idaho falls i.in that year,however,the inspector general of the united states department of energy issued a report interpreting section e of the act to authorize ferc,in imposing charges for the purpose of reimbursing the united states,to impose additional charges reflecting ofas costs incurred in administering the act emphasis added that same year,the congress enacted the omnibus budget reconciliation act obra.omnibus budget reconciliation act,pub,stat,codified at.that legislation directed that ferc shall,using the provisions of this subtitle and authority provided by other laws,assess and collect fees and annual charges in any fiscal year in amounts equal to all of the costs incurred by the commission in that fiscal year and that the fees or annual charges assessed shall be computed on the basis of methods that the commission determines,by rule,to be fair and equitable.id.accordingly,ferc began to pass the additional costs on to the hydroelectric licensees.idaho falls i,at.ferc has continued to assess charges for ofas costs ever since.
in the early,several hydroelectric licenses were due for relicensing and ferc anticipated a heavy strain on federal and state wildlife agency budgets to complete required studies as part of the relicensing process.i,at,reprinted in.the congress responded to ferc concern by amending section e as part of the energy policy act epact to provide that federal and state agencies were to be reimbursed for their work.id.section of the epact made the costs recoverable and authorized annual appropriations to cover some of the agencies costs 
the commission has established a relatively simple system to assess charges for fpa administrative costs.for each fiscal year,the commission solicits from the eight cost reports of their administrative costs for the previous fiscal year.g city of idaho falls,wl,idaho falls ii.the commission adds these figures to its own and assesses the licensees according to a weighted formula that considers the type of licensee municipal,state or other and the kind of hydroelectric project conventional,pure pumped storage or mixed c h.
since the commission began imposing charges for ofa costs,the charges have sharply increased.in fy,for example,ofas reported costs totaling by fy,the total rose to.brief for petitioner at.contributing to the escalation has been the ofas expansion of costs sought to be recovered,including overhead,preparation of comments on ferc rulemakings,training and attendance at well as costs attendant to certain ofas block grants to indian tribes to oppose hydroelectric licenses,legal fees and litigation expenses.in,hydroelectric licensees brought a challenge before the commission on the ofa charges,complaining that the costs were not based on substantial evidence there was no mechanism in place to review agency cost submissions to determine whether those costs are reasonable,necessary and within the scope of section e of the act and the commission impermissibly broadened the scope of costs beyond those for the fpa studies and reviews specified in section e of the fpa as amended by the epact.idaho falls i,at.
the petitioners initial challenge appealed fiscal year fy ofa costs included in the fy annual charges before the commission chief financial officer cfo.id.their objections were in the main rejected by the cfo.id.ferc postponed review of the cfo decision until an administrative law judge alj concluded his regarding the fy ofa costs.id.at.in the meantime,however,the petitioners had filed similar objections to the fy ofa costs.the commission then consolidated the two appeals and ordered the alj to include in his both the fy and fy ofa costs.id.the parties opted to settle the disputed costs before the alj.idaho falls ii,at.on review,ferc declined to approve the settlement,uncertain that the figures contained in the agreement had an adequate factual basis.id.at.the commission did,however,consider the petitioners legal issues.
first,the commission rejected their claim that recoverable costs under the fpa are limited to those specified in the amendment.id.at.notwithstanding the amendment addition of the language including any reasonable and necessary costs incurred by federal and state fish and wildlife agencies and other natural and cultural resource agencies in connection with studies or other reviews to section e,ferc concluded that recoverable costs were not limited to fish,wildlife and other natural and cultural resource agencies nor to costs related to studies and reviews.id.the only effect of the amendment,the commission said,was to broaden the scope of recoverable costs from ofas administrative costs to qualifying administrative and study costs of qualifying state resource agencies,whose costs had never before been the subject of section e.id.at emphasis added.furthermore,the commission ruled,there was no merit to the petitioners claim that section e limit of recoverable costs to those incurred under fpa part i made ofa overhead and litigation costs unrecoverable.id.at.according to the commission,the recovery of those costs was justified because the administration of fpa part i is inextricably interwoven with the administration of other federal statutes addressing important national resources,statutes that may be triggered by hydroelectric licensing or other action under part i of the fpa.id.
next,the commission rejected the petitioners argument that the section e requirement also found in obra that annual charges be reasonable and fair and equitable meant the commission was obligated to provide a mechanism to review the ofas cost reports for reasonableness and consistency with recoverable costs under the act.id.at.instead,the commission said,the language addressed the commission rate design responsibility only.id.at.in fact,ferc said that it did not consider it to be in the ambit of this commission authority to purport to tell another agency what studies or other reviews it should or should not undertake in the exercise of its statutory obligations.id.at.it did announce,however,that thenceforth ofas were required to certify as true and accurate their cost reports according to federal cost accounting rules.id.at.future cost reports,the commission said,must comply with the office of management and budget circular charges and the federal accounting standards advisory board material cost accounting concepts and standards for the federal government statement of federal financial accounting standard number.id.at.if ofa cost reports were so certified,the commission then considered them based on substantial evidence and recoverable under section e.id.at.in the future,challenges to recoverable ofa costs were to be made directly to the agency involved.id.the commission also required a complaining hydroelectric utility to lodge a placeholder appeal with the commission cfo while pursuing its challenge before the agency.id.once the agency resolved the challenge,it was to submit a revised cost sheet to the commission which would make an adjustment if necessary in the next annual charge total.id.at.if the administrative process did not resolve the matter,the agency was required to file its cost documentation with the commission for the record on appeal.id.at.
ferc,however,did not apply its new certification rule retroactively to the fy and fy ofa charges that were under challenge.because those costs had been only partially certified,it again remanded to the alj for him to determine which fy and fy costs were substantiated.id.at.while the idaho falls ii matter was pending,two more years worth of charges were assessed against,and paid by,the petitioners and they again challenged the ofa costs,this time for fy and fy.in its idaho falls ii order,ferc decided to apply its certification requirement to those appeals and ordered the ofas to review their submissions for fy and fy to ensure that the costs were appropriately certified.it also announced that cost submissions had to be certified within ninety days of the order.id.at.
thus,following idaho falls ii,the petitioners challenges to ofa costs in four fiscal years were pending the fy and fy cost challenges were pending before the alj and the fy and fy cost challenges were pending ferc approval of costs certified in accord with the idaho falls ii order.the parties again settled the fy and fy costs,the alj again certified the settlement and the petitioners again sought ferc approval.city of idaho falls,wl,idaho falls iii.this time the commission gave its approval,noting at the same time that the settlement does not affect or preclude any parties appeals,on legal grounds that are the same as or similar to legal arguments made in this proceeding,of any other pending or future ofa cost submittals.id.although idaho falls iii is entitled order approving settlement agreement,id.at,the commission went beyond the settlement and ruled on the fy and fy appeals.id.at.with little discussion other than to state that the new certification requirement was applicable starting with the ofas costs for fy and fy,id.at,the commission granted and denied to the extent discussed in the text of this order the fy and fy cost appeals,id.at.
because the fy and fy challenges had not been consolidated with the fy appeals that were the subject of the settlement,and because the idaho falls iii order failed to indicate which fy costs were allowed and disallowed consistent with the certification requirements of idaho falls ii,the petitioners sought clarification from the commission and,in the alternative,requested rehearing.motion for clarification or,in the alternative,request for rehearing regarding appeals of fy annual charges bills,at,city of tacoma,wl idaho falls iii motion for clarification in their motion,the petitioners indicated they had obtained through freedom of information act requests correspondence between the agencies and the commission regarding the fy ofa cost recertifications that ferc in idaho falls ii had ordered to be performed.id.at.based on the correspondence,they contemplated refunds because many of the ofa submissions did not conform to the idaho falls ii standard.id.because the idaho falls iii order was silent as to which certifications had been allowed,the petitioners inquired whether the commission intended to deduct the nonconforming costs from the charges.id.at.
in city of tacoma,the commission clarified its idaho falls iii order,declaring that it did indeed intend in idaho falls iii to resolve the appeals of the fy and fy ofa costs.city of tacoma,wl.the commission further explained that the petitioners and others that had appealed fy costs would receive credit in fy assessments consistent with the deficiencies they had identified in their clarification motion.id.at.the commission rejected the petitioners assertion that upward adjustments made by some ofas were impermissible,concluding instead that,because the charges had been appealed,they were not final and thus subject to change.id.at.the commission further provided that the petitioners could again obtain commission review of any legal,policy,and factual arguments they wish to make with respect to the rulings in the idaho falls ii and idaho falls iii orders regarding the ofa fy costs should they appeal the fy assessments.id.at.
the petitioners filed the instant petition on august,seeking review of the commission orders in idaho falls ii,idaho falls iii and city of tacoma and raising the same legal issues they raised in idaho falls ii iii as well as additional issues ruled upon by the commission in city of tacoma.at the same time,the petitioners have separately appealed the commission decision regarding fy and fy credits reflected in fy assessments following city of in that appeal which is not before us they simply make four challenges specific to the fy and fy credits 
the commission first challenges our jurisdiction to consider the petition.in doing so,it places great significance on the fact that it specifically provided in city of tacoma that licensees that appealed the ofa fy costs submittals,may have the opportunity to obtain commission review of any legal,policy,and factual arguments they wish to make with respect to the rulings in the idaho falls ii and idaho falls iii orders regarding the ofa fy costs,within the appeal time periods that will pertain for the fy bills.city of tacoma,at.because it permitted the petitioners to resurrect their challenges to ofa costs in any fy appeal,the commission says,its rulings on issues regarding the fy costs are not final for the purpose of judicial review.furthermore,the commission insists,because the petitioners have in fact appealed the fy costs adjustments included in the fy assessments,their petition is incurably premature because they can not simultaneously seek both agency reconsideration and judicial review of the same ferc order.see.gas pipeline ferc.
we reject the commission challenge to this court jurisdiction.see b papago tribal util.auth.ferc,cert.denied,d.as the commission would have it,so long as it permits the petitioners to raise all legal,factual or policy issues regarding costs in challenges to subsequent annual charges,its action is not final because it has not finally impose d an obligation,denie d a right,or fixe d some legal relationship as a consummation of the administrative process,and therefore the orders are not final.power ferc,quoting papago tribal util,at.the commission willingness to reconsider the petitioners legal arguments originally made and ruled on in idaho falls ii iii and city of tacoma in a later proceeding notwithstanding,the commission decisions manifest that its position with respect to the issues raised in the petition is unchanged.the commission does not deny that its orders firmly establish its position on the issues under review,namely the ofa cost submission and reimbursement scheme and the scope of section e of the fpa.indeed,the commission does not suggest that it intends to shift its position on these issues nor does it indicate that it could alter its decision denying the petitioners challenge to the increased fy costs resulting from the recertifications following the commission idaho falls ii order.n ormally,where an agency has stated that the action in question governs and will continue to govern its decisions,such action must be viewed as final.valley gas ferc,internal quotations omitted emphasis removed.as a practical matter,the commission rulings in the orders represent a d
