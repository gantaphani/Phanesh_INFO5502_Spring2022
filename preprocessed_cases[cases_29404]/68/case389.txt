this case raises the question of whether ferc rejection of a rmr agreement covering cts in a nepool dca violates the apa because ferc ignored ppl objections to ferc push and lmp assumptions we conclude that it does.for those not fluent in the language of ferc,a translation follows.
petitioners ppl wallingford energy,llc and ppl energyplus,llc collectively,ppl challenge orders of the federal energy regulatory commission ferc that rejected ppl agreement with iso new england,to provide electric power on a basis.ppl also challenges ferc orders rejecting similar agreements between devon power,llc and iso new england.because ppl was not a party to the latter agreements,it lacks standing to challenge the orders that relate to them.ppl does have standing to challenge the orders rejecting its own agreement,however,and we conclude that those orders violate the administrative procedure act apa.we therefore vacate the orders relating to ppl and remand the case to the commission for further proceedings.
the federal power act gives ferc jurisdiction over the transmission and sale of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce.see b.the act requires public utilities to file schedules with ferc showing,among other things,the rates they will charge for the transmission or sale of energy.id.c.if,after a hearing,ferc find s that any rate collected by any public utility for any transmission or sale subject to its jurisdiction is unjust,unreasonable,unduly discriminatory or preferential,the commission shall determine the just and reasonable rate and shall fix the same by order.id.a.
iso new england,is an independent system operator that runs the new england electricity market,known as the new england power pool nepool.see new england power pool,order on reh g.it acts as a middleman,matching bids offers to sell power by generators with requests from customers.see new england power pool iso new england,at,order on reh g,order on reh g,order on reh g.
in,ferc proposed the creation of standard market designs smds to standardize the sale of electric power,with the goal of creating seamless wholesale power markets that allow sellers to transact easily across transmission grid boundaries and that allow customers to receive the benefits of and more reliable electric supply.remedying undue discrimination through open access transmission service standard electricity market design,notice of proposed rulemaking.in response to ferc proposal,iso new england,along with the nepool participants committee,submitted an smd for the new england region.ferc approved the smd,with certain modifications not relevant here.see new england power pool.
in chronically constrained regions identified as designated congestion areas dcas,the new england smd created a complex system of compensation for generators under what was known as market rule.see id.at.first,the smd attempted price reduction mitigation in ferc setting a price cap based on the estimated price to recover the annual cost of a new combustion turbine unit ct for the region over the number of hours it is expected to operate during the year.devon power llc,at.this estimated price was known as the ct proxy.id.second,to mitigate the impact of mitigation,under certain circumstances the smd allowed the highest bid accepted in a particular area to set the price,called the locational marginal price lmp,for all bids accepted in that area.see new england power pool,at.
to further soften the impact of mitigation,the smd also allowed certain generator units needed to assure system reliability to be classified as rmr units.these are units that must be run,that iso new england can compel to run during certain periods to alleviate transmission congestion.id.at.this designation entitled the generator to apply for an rmr agreement if the unit could not recover its costs under the ct proxy mechanism and would otherwise be shut down.id.at.an rmr agreement provides monthly payments to enable the unit to recover its costs plus a reasonable return on investment.see pseg power connecticut,llc.in its order upholding the smd,ferc confirmed that has the authority to negotiate individual rmr agreements as are required to maintain improve system reliability.new england power pool,at.ferc further stated that such agreements are to be filed with the commission in accordance with the commission rules and regulations,and,as such,may be subject to the review of the commission.id.
ppl built a generating station consisting of five natural gas combustion turbines in the southwest connecticut dca,from which it began selling power in december.the units were relatively peaking units,intended to run only during times of peak demand or system need.on january,ppl submitted a request for ferc approval of an rmr agreement negotiated with iso new england to cover four of the five units.while the rmr request was pending,ppl filed an application with iso new england to temporarily deactivate the four units for economic reasons.the deactivation application was denied,on the ground that the units were necessary for reliability purposes,and ppl was required to continue operating the units regardless of economic considerations.in february,devon power,llc and three affiliated entities collectively,devon submitted a similar request for ferc approval of four rmr agreements for their connecticut units.
ferc ruled on devon rmr request first,denying it in an april order that significantly changed the existing compensation scheme.first,it found that rmr contracts suppress prices,increase uplift payments,and make it difficult for new generators to profitably enter the market,and that extensive use of rmr contracts undermines effective market performance.devon power llc,at devon order.fearing that it would face a proliferation of rmr agreements,the commission held that such agreements should be a last resort.id.second,ferc decided to revise market rule,pursuant to section of the federal power act.id.at.the revision entailed the elimination of the ct proxy standard,because u nits that produce energy in substantially fewer hours,such as the devon units,are not likely to be able to recover all of their fixed costs under the current ct proxy.id.
in place of ct proxy,ferc adopted a new methodology called peaking unit safe harbor push bidding.id.at.the push methodology gave a generator that had operated at ten percent or less of capacity during a safe harbor bid price based on the sum of its units and components.the component for was calculated by dividing a unit annual fixed costs including a reasonable return on investment by the number of megawatt hours the unit supplied in.the push price would therefore allow the generator to recover its costs in if the generator ran for the same number of hours and had the same costs as it did in.the goal of push bidding was to provide a market mechanism for high cost,seldom run units to recover their fixed costs.id.ferc maintained that replacing rmr agreements with push bidding changed only the form in which generators will be able to recover their fixed and variable costs,use of a safe harbor bid within the market rather than an rmr contract.id.ferc further decided that the revised market rule shall provide that the energy bids of peaking units are eligible to determine lmp which meant that those units push bids could set the lmp,thereby serving as the sales price for all power sold in the area during the time period id.
ferc declared that it would direct to make compliance filings to reflect these changes in market rule.id.the changes were only intended,however,as a temporary solution.as initially contemplated,they were to last until june,when a new system,called licap,would be implemented.id.ferc has since pushed back licap implementation date to the beginning of.devon power llc.
in response to the devon order,many industry members submitted requests for rehearing and clarification.devon power,at devon order on reh g.ppl was among the industry intervenors.rejecting the intervenors arguments to the contrary,ferc maintained that the push bid mechanism gives a generator a reasonable opportunity to recover its costs.id.at.
