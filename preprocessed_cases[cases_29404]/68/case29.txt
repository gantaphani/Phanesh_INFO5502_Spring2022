in this appeal,two groups of petitioners challenge four orders issued in and by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc.the challenged orders approved a proposal by the new york independent system operator nyiso to create a new wholesale electric power capacity zone comprising certain areas of southeastern new york,including the lower hudson valley the lower hudson valley zone.the orders represent the culmination of a multiyear process during which nyiso,at ferc direction,sought to identify areas of new york in which customers received power from suppliers located on the other side of a transmission constraint in the electrical grid.because of the way new york capacity markets work as we explain later in this opinion,nyiso concluded that the financial incentives for capacity resources in the area that became the lower hudson valley zone were inadequate,jeopardizing the reliability of the grid for customers there.ferc approval of the lower hudson valley zone,along with a new demand curve that nyiso uses to set capacity prices for the zone,was designed to address this potential reliability problem by providing more accurate price signals to resources.for customers in the new zone,however,the creation of the new zone was expected to result in higher prices.
the first group of petitioners in this case comprises central hudson gas electric,new york power authority,new york state electric and gas corporation,and rochester gas and electric corporation utility petitioners.the second group comprises the people of the state of new york and the new york public service commission nypsc new york petitioners.the essence of petitioners claims is that ferc failed adequately to justify the new,higher prices expected to result from the creation of the lower hudson valley zone,particularly without a of the new zone and its demand curve to soften the impact.accordingly,petitioners claim that the challenged orders are arbitrary and capricious,are unsupported by substantial evidence,and disregard ferc statutory mandate to ensure that rates are just and reasonable.a.for the reasons set forth below,we disagree,and we therefore deny the petitions for review.
background 
due to the technical nature of the ferc orders that we are called on to review,we first discuss the characteristics of the capacity market in new york,as well as the history behind nyiso proposal to create the new lower hudson valley zone,before describing the challenged orders.
new york capacity market for wholesale electric power 
in some regions of the united states,including new york,certain functions involving the coordination,control,and operation of the wholesale electric transmission grid and markets for wholesale electric power are administered by organizations known as regional transmission organizations rtos or independent system operators isos.around the turn of this century,ferc formally encouraged the formation of these organizations through several orders that restructured wholesale transmission and energy markets.see promoting wholesale competition through open access non discriminatory transmission servs.by pub.recovery of stranded costs by pub.utils.transmitting,order,stats regs.y,order on reh g,order a,stats regs.y,order on reh g,order b,y,order on reh g,order c,y,aff in relevant part,transmission access policy study grp.ferc,aff sub nom.new york ferc,regional transmission,order,stats.regs,on reh g,order a,stats.regs.codified at.as part of their administration of these markets,rtos and isos must,pursuant to the federal power act fpa,obtain ferc approval of proposed rules and regulations affecting rates for the sale of electric energy,and ferc must ensure that these rules and regulations are just and reasonable and result in just and reasonable rates.while many rtos and isos in the country have authority over areas whose boundaries cross state lines,new york has its own iso,nyiso,which is responsible for the reliable operation of new york transmission grid and administers bulk power markets in new york.
one function that nyiso performs is administering a capacity market for wholesale electric power.installed capacity is the amount of electricity that a producer can supply at a given time.simon keyspan,cir see also.dep t of pub.util.control ferc,capacity is not electricity itself but the ability to produce it when necessary.capacity markets are a tool that some rtos and isos use to help ensure that there is a reliable and adequate supply of electric power.in a capacity market,suppliers sell a commitment to produce electric energy if called upon to do so during a specified future time period,rather than electric energy itself.nyiso capacity market is implemented chiefly through monthly mandatory spot auctions,which are conducted a short time in advance of the month for which capacity is being supplied.see nyiso market administration and control area services tariff hereinafter nyiso services tariff.
nyiso capacity market is divided into capacity zones.prior to the orders at issue here,the capacity market was divided into three different capacity zones the long island capacity zone covering nassau and suffolk counties,the new york city capacity zone covering all of new york city,and the new york control area covering the entire state,including both the long island capacity zone and the new york city capacity zone.while the amount of capacity supply in each zone is determined by market actors,the demand for capacity in each zone is administratively determined by nyiso.the administratively determined demand for a given region is known as that region demand curve.the point at which the supply curve intersects with the administratively determined demand curve is the market clearing price.all suppliers whose bids clear the market are paid the clearing price,regardless of the price of each specific supply bid.explaining the method by which nyiso sets the demand curve for each region requires some additional background on the way in which reliability is regulated in new york.
while nyiso administers new york capacity market,reliability is also regulated by a separate entity,the new york state reliability council nysrc.nysrc periodically calculates a figure called the installed reserve margin,which is an amount of power that must be procured for new york as a whole in addition to the amount needed for peak customer demand.it sets this margin at a level necessary to prevent a loss of load event,a system failure from occurring,on average,more than once every ten years.keyspan ravenswood,at.the installed reserve margin for new york is currently percent of the amount of energy needed for peak consumer demand.
to achieve the installed reserve margin set by nysrc,nyiso sets an installed capacity requirement for new york,which is the specific amount of megawatts necessary to meet peak demand plus the installed reserve margin.for regions within new york,nyiso sets installed capacity requirements.nyiso also determines the net cost of new entry for each capacity zone.this number is calculated to equal the cost of constructing a new peaking plant,a plant that runs only during times of peak demand in the zone,minus such a plant revenues from energy and ancillary services.
these figures installed capacity and net cost of new entry help nyiso determine the demand curve for each capacity zone the demand curve is designed to procure,over time,an amount of capacity equal to the installed capacity requirement for each zone at a price equal to the net cost of new entry for that zone.see centralized capacity mkt.design elements,docket no,commission staff report,at,explaining that capacity markets are designed to achieve the planning reserve margin at a price equal to the net cost of new entry nyiso services tariff see also describing the demand curves in new york capacity zones.once every three years,nyiso sets separate demand curves for each region for each of the following three years.indep.operator.at p see.
for each capacity zone except the new york control area,nyiso also requires a certain amount of capacity the exact amount is different for each zone to be supplied from resources located within the zone.these requirements are called locational minimum installed capacity requirements lcrs.the logic is that lcrs must be set for certain capacity zones because even if the overall grid would otherwise have adequate reserves,a particular zone may risk a blackout if those reserves can not reach the zone due to a transmission constraint.
nyiso capacity market was originally created after ferc ordered nyiso to develop a proposal to implement a capacity market in.see cent.hudson gas,y at.ferc subsequently approved major elements of nyiso capacity market design,see indep.operator,y,including its use of an administratively determined demand curve,see indep.operator,y.while new york capacity market has historically been divided into the long island zone,new york city zone,and new york control area,in ferc ordered nyiso to work with stakeholders to address dynamic changes to the new york control area that may warrant the creation of additional capacity zones within the nyiso market.indep.operator,y at p.ferc stated that t he establishment of criteria for the addition of zones will facilitate their development and allow market participants to assess the effect on their interconnected projects.id.
b.the new zone criteria orders 
in january,nyiso submitted a filing addressing the creation of new capacity zones in compliance with ferc order.indep.operator,docket no,compliance filing.nyiso proposed two criteria for determining whether or not to create a new capacity zone.see indep.operator,at pp new zone criteria order.the first criterion nyiso proposed was a highway capacity deliverability test,which was designed to assess whether transmission into a potential new zone was constrained.id.at p.a transmission highway is a bulk electric transmission facility a highway transmission constraint occurs when electric power can not be transmitted from where it is generated to where it is needed due to congestion on a transmission highway.the second criterion was a reliability criterion,which would assess the reliability of the bulk transmission network in the potential new zone by simulating whether certain contingency scenarios would result in a deficiency of energy resources in the zone.id.at p.nyiso proposed that once it identified a new capacity zone based on these criteria,it would engage in further analysis of the implications of the new capacity zone on reliability and energy costs for customers in the zone.id.at p.
ferc addressed nyiso january filing in its new zone criteria order.ferc ruled that nyiso specific methodology for the highway capacity deliverability test was flawed.id.at p.accordingly,it ordered nyiso to conduct a test for detecting the presence of transmission constraints using a different methodology,and to file proposed tariff changes incorporating the test.id.at p.ferc later clarified the methodology of this test in an order on clarification.see indep.operator,new zone criteria order on clarification.
in the new zone criteria order,ferc also rejected nyiso proposed reliability criterion,finding that it may improperly result in a new capacity zone not being created when one is necessary.new zone criteria order at p.if the highway capacity deliverability test were satisfied on the basis of an identified transmission constraint,but a new zone was not created because the reliability criterion was not satisfied,an energy resource could enter bids in a zone capacity auction even though the transmission constraint would prevent the energy generated by that resource from reaching customers in the constrained area of the zone.id.in that event,ferc reasoned,price signals sent to the constrained and unconstrained areas would not accurately signal the relative needs for and values of capacity in the two areas of the broad zone.id.
some commenters in the new zone criteria proceedings suggested that,in addition to setting forth a method for creating new capacity zones,ferc should also require nyiso to provide a process for the elimination of capacity zones.id.at pp.ferc,however,declined to do so.id.at p.
in accordance with ferc new zone criteria order and new zone criteria order on clarification,nyiso made a compliance filing proposing tariff changes to implement the criterion for creating new zones based on the transmission constraint test.see indep.operator,at pp new zone criteria compliance order.nyiso proposed starting the new capacity zone process by conducting a study in which it would apply the highway test for identifying transmission constraints.id.at p.if the study identified such a constraint,nyiso would then identify the boundary for a new capacity zone.id.at p.nyiso also stated that any new capacity zone would require a new lcr.id.at p.nyiso proposed that it would determine the lcr for a new capacity zone no later than march of each year in which it administratively determines demand curves for its capacity zones.id.at p.ferc approved nyiso filing.id.at p.
c.the orders under review 
applying the new zone criteria orders,nyiso proposed the creation of the lower hudson valley zone and a demand curve for the new zone.in response,ferc issued the four orders that are the subject of this appeal.in one pair of orders,it approved the creation of the new lower hudson valley zone,see indep.operator,y zone order,on reh g,indep.operator,y zone rehearing order.and in a second pair of orders,it approved the establishment of a new demand curve for the lower hudson valley zone.indep.operator,y demand curve order,on reh g,indep.operator,y demand curve rehearing order.
zone orders 
nyiso filed its tariff revisions to establish the lower hudson valley zone on april.along with its tariff revisions,nyiso provided a report laying out the results of its study,which showed that the transmission highway providing power from certain nyiso load zones in upstate new york into load zones downstate was constrained.nyiso filing accordingly proposed creating the lower hudson valley zone,and laid out the timing and sequence of steps required to do so.
nyiso set the boundaries for the lower hudson valley zone to encompass all of the nyiso load zones located to the south of the constrained transmission interface,except for load zone k,which covers nassau county and suffolk county in long island.load zone j,comprising new york city,would be part of the new lower hudson valley zone,but it would also continue to be its own capacity zone,with a separate lcr and demand curve.nyiso filing did not include provisions to govern the potential future elimination of the lower hudson valley zone.nor did nyiso tariff provisions provide for a of the new zone.
nyiso proposed that the demand curve for the lower hudson valley zone would be filed on november,and would become effective may.in the zone order,ferc accepted all of nyiso proposed tariff revisions creating the new lower hudson valley zone.zone order at p.ferc rejected protestors contentions that the new zone boundary was not just and reasonable.it also concluded that it was unnecessary for nyiso to propose a mechanism for eliminating the lower hudson valley zone upon the elimination of the transmission constraint on which the zone was premised,and declined to require a of the new zone.various parties petitioned for rehearing of the zone order and ferc denied rehearing on all the issues which are now subject to appeal see zone rehearing order at pp.
demand curve orders 
in accordance with ferc zone order,nyiso filed tariff revisions proposing a new demand curve for the lower hudson valley zone on november.unlike its tariff filing in the zone proceeding,nyiso proposed tariff revisions included provisions that would phase in the demand curve for the new lower hudson valley zone to help soften the impact of the higher capacity prices that were likely to result from the new zone creation.nyiso proposed calculated the demand curve for the first year of operation of the lower hudson valley zone using a reference value for the cost of a new peaking plant of only percent of what it otherwise would be,and calculated the demand curve for the second year of operation using a value of percent of what it otherwise would be.ferc accepted nyiso tariff filing but rejected its proposal.demand curve order at p.ferc later denied rehearing of its demand curve order on the same day that it issued its zone rehearing order.demand curve rehearing order at p.
petitions for review 
in this appeal,petitioners argue that the zone order,zone rehearing order,demand curve order and demand curve rehearing order are not supported by reasoned decisionmaking and substantial evidence.they make five principal arguments against ferc orders ferc did not adequately justify its conclusion that consumers would benefit from the creation of the new lower hudson valley zone and the implementation of its associated demand curve ferc failed to adequately support its conclusion that implementing the new zone without a of its demand curve would result in just and reasonable rates in creating the new zone,ferc improperly ignored evidence regarding new york transmission upgrade initiatives ferc improperly failed to set forth criteria for the potential elimination of the lower hudson valley zone after the transmission constraint no longer exists and ferc did not demonstrate that the increases in rates arising from the new zone would reflect to some degree the costs actually caused by the customer who must pay them.midwest iso transmission owners ferc,quoting kn energy,ferc.

discussion 
jurisdiction 
before turning to the merits of petitioners arguments,we address joint intervenors contention that we lack jurisdiction over new york petitioners petition for review.
the fpa requires an aggrieved party to seek rehearing of a ferc order by the commission itself before the party may obtain judicial review of that order.specifically,the statute provides that no entity may bring a proceeding to review any ferc order unless such entity shall have made application to the commission for a rehearing thereon.a.it also provides that a party must file a petition for review in an appropriate federal court of appeals within days after the order of the commission upon the application for rehearing,and that n o objection to the order of the commission shall be considered by a court unless such objection shall have been urged before the commission in the application for rehearing unless there is reasonable ground for failure so to do.id.b.under these provisions,courts are barred from considering a party objections if the objection either amounts to collateral attack on an earlier ferc order,see pac.gas ferc,d,or was not specifically raised by the party in a petition for rehearing provided that there is no reasonable ground for its failure to do so,see save our sebasticook ferc.
joint intervenors argue that we lack jurisdiction over new york petitioners objections to the zone order because those objections amount to impermissible collateral attacks on the new zone criteria orders and with one exception have been waived by virtue of new york petitioners failure to preserve them in a petition for rehearing.the circuit has long held that the bars erected by the fpa provisions are jurisdictional in nature,see pac.gas,at save our sebasticook,at,and we will assume that the circuit is correct.accordingly,we will consider ourselves obligated to evaluate joint intervenors and waiver arguments before turning to the merits of petitioners objections.see steel citizens for a better env t,u.
collateral attack 
joint intervenors contend that by authorizing the creation of the lower hudson valley zone in the zone orders,ferc merely evaluated nyiso proposal against requirements that had already been imposed by the previously issued new zone criteria orders.in other words,it was the new zone criteria orders and not the zone orders that required nyiso to use the highway deliverability test for determining the necessity of establishing a new zone in the zone orders,ferc merely approved nyiso application of that test and the resulting creation of the lower hudson valley zone.on this basis,joint intervenors claim that new york petitioners challenges to the creation of the lower hudson valley new york petitioners frame as challenges to the zone actually impermissible collateral attacks on the new zone criteria orders.we disagree.
when a petitioner objection is aimed not at the order purportedly under review but instead at an earlier ferc order,it is barred as a collateral attack on the earlier order unless the objection attacks ferc constitutional or statutory authority,ferc has effectively reopened the earlier order,or the earlier order failed to place parties on notice of what would be required.sacramento mun.util.dist.ferc.contrary to joint intervenors argument,new york petitioners objections with one possible exception described below are aimed at the zone orders themselves,and not at the new zone criteria orders.
in cases where the circuit has held that a petitioner challenge is an impermissible collateral attack on a prior ferc order,the challenge has involved a significantly more direct attack on the prior order than do the bulk of new york petitioners objections here.in sacramento,for example,a municipal utility district asserted a right of first refusal for firm transmission service when its transmission contract with certain utilities was set to expire.at.the utilities demurred,and the district filed a complaint with ferc.id.earlier,however,ferc had ordered entities to take transmission service under the california iso tariff after their transmission contracts expired in doing so,it explicitly approved the absence of a provision in that tariff.id.at.accordingly,the district challenge was effectively a direct attack on the earlier ferc order that approved the california iso tariff,so it could not be raised in a later proceeding.id.at.in pacific gas electric ferc,also cited by joint intervenors,the petitioner challenged orders requiring the california iso,and not the petitioner,to conduct interconnection studies for new resources.but a prior order had made clear that the iso conducts all studies in a region with an iso,and the relevant area was plainly in the california iso jurisdiction.id.at.in both cases,then,the petitioner challenge was squarely foreclosed by the prior order and therefore could not succeed except by undermining the prior order.
here,by contrast,new york petitioners objections again,with one possible exception do not attack the general principles set forth in the new zone criteria orders.instead,they concern the specific application of those principles to the creation of the lower hudson valley zone an application that ferc could not have opined on in the new zone criteria orders.it may be true that new york petitioners would prefer ferc to have approved,in the new zone criteria orders,criteria other than the highway criterion that it ultimately settled on for example,ones based on system reliability or consumer economic impacts.but new york petitioners are not challenging ferc adoption of the highway criterion,nor do their arguments necessarily call the adoption of that criterion into question.instead,they argue that the creation of the lower hudson valley zone will,under the circumstances,result in unjust and unreasonable rates,and that the challenged ferc orders are arbitrary and capricious.when the new zone criteria orders were issued,it was clear that,while nyiso would have to file for the creation of a new zone if the test prescribed by the new zone criteria orders were satisfied,ferc would still have to approve the new zone pursuant to its statutory obligation to ensure that rates and the rules and regulations affecting them are just and reasonable.a,c.new york petitioners arguments that ferc has not adequately made such a demonstration therefore do not constitute collateral attacks on the new zone criteria orders.
this point can also be understood as an application of the notice exception to the prohibition on collateral attacks see sacramento mun.util,at.in applying this exception,the circuit has said that an objection is a collateral attack on an earlier order only if a reasonable firm in petitioners position would have perceived a very substantial risk that the order meant what the commission now says it meant.dynegy midwest generation,ferc,d.alterations in original quoting,ferc,internal quotation mark omitted.the new zone criteria orders would have put new york petitioners on notice only that nyiso would have to file for the creation of a new zone upon finding a transmission constraint under the test prescribed by those orders not that the new zone would have the boundaries of the lower hudson valley zone,nor that ferc would necessarily approve the creation of the lower hudson valley zone for the reasons that it did.in other words,while joint intervenors may be correct that new york petitioners can not claim that they lacked adequate notice that the new zone criteria orders would control the creation of the lower hudson valley zone,joint intervenors br.at,they also had no way of knowing that those orders would be applied to these specific facts in this specific manner.
indeed,joint intervenors never suggest that ferc approval of the creation of the lower hudson valley zone was a foregone conclusion under the new zone criteria orders.ferc itself apparently thought that it was not hence its explanation,in the zone order,of why nyiso proposed creation of the lower hudson valley zone not only was consistent with and required by nyiso tariff as modified by the new zone criteria orders,but also would not result in unjust and unreasonable rates.see zone order at pp.put simply,the fact that ferc approved a general process does not suggest an advance determination that applying that process to all potential factual situations would necessarily fulfill its statutory obligation to ensure just and reasonable rates.because new york petitioners challenges are aimed primarily at ferc rate determination,and not at the test imposed by the new zone criteria orders,they are not barred as impermissible collateral attacks on those prior orders.
the one argument advanced by new york petitioners that might amount to a collateral attack on the new zone criteria orders is their argument that ferc should have required nyiso to put in place criteria for the elimination of the lower hudson valley zone at the same time that the zone was created.in its first new zone criteria order,ferc explicitly declined to require a process for eliminating zones even as it set up the process for new zone creation.see new zone criteria order at p w e will not expand our compliance directive to require nyiso to define criteria regarding the potential elimination of capacity zones as some commentators have suggested.thus,new york petitioners argument that ferc unreasonably declined to establish criteria for eliminating the new zone in the event the transmission constraint is relieved,pet rs br.at,is directly at odds with the conclusion reached in that prior order.there may be a distinction between the need for zone elimination procedures in this particular case and the need for such procedures in general,given that new york petitioners supplied evidence that new york transmission upgrade initiatives might eliminate the transmission constraint necessitating the lower hudson valley zone.we need not decide whether this distinction is relevant,however,because ferc has effectively reopened the issue.sacramento mun.util,at.
an agency reopens an issue decided in a previous thus lifts the bar against challenging that decision in a subsequent in responding to comments the agency uses language that shows that it did in fact reconsider an issue.pub.citizen nuclear regulatory comm n.here,ferc reopened the issue of zone elimination in the zone order by articulating a different rationale than the one it relied on in the new zone criteria order.
in the new zone criteria order,ferc justified its decision not to require criteria for eliminating new zones based in part on the logic that t he impact of the failure to create a zone where one is needed is much more significant than the impact of a failure to eliminate an existing unneeded zone because an unneeded zone should not experience price separation from the neighboring zones.new zone criteria order at p.but in the zone order,ferc suggested that its prior reasoning was incorrect,indicating that price separation may well continue after the constraint leading to a new capacity zone disappears.zone order at p.ferc went on to conclude that criteria for eliminating the lower hudson valley zone were nevertheless unnecessary because any such price separation would be an appropriate reflection of a zone relative cost of entry and therefore necessary to attract adequate resources to be located within the zone.id.it also relied on new record affidavit submitted by nyiso david support of its conclusion.id.ferc revised,and newly supported,explanation for its decision not to require zone elimination criteria shows that the agency did in fact reconsider the issue of zone elimination in the zone order,and that new york petitioners arguments on that subject are not barred by the fpa prohibition on collateral attacks.pub.citizen,at.
failure to preserve on rehearing 
joint intervenors also argue that new york petitioners waived their challenges to the zone orders with the exception of the argument that new york transmission initiatives made the creation of the lower hudson valley zone unnecessary by failing to raise them in a petition for rehearing.fpa requirement that a party must raise its objections in a petition for rehearing enables the commission to correct its own errors,which might obviate judicial review,or to explain why in its expert judgment the party objection is not well taken,which facilitates judicial review.save our sebasticook,at see also asarco,ferc,examining the natural gas act identical provision.thus,to preserve an objection for judicial review,a party must raise it in a request for ferc rehearing with specificity.allegheny power ferc,quoting.power light ferc.cir.
joint intervenors point to two objections in particular that they claim new york petitioners did not preserve that ferc failed to quantify consumer price impacts and that the creation of the lower hudson valley zone was not necessary to maintain reliability.we agree that that new york petitioners failed to raise the first of these objections with sufficient specificity in their petitions for rehearing.
in its request for rehearing of the zone order,the nypsc objected to ferc conclusion that the benefits of creating the lower hudson valley zone justified the zone costs.in essence,the nypsc argued that ferc had identified only benefits from the creation of the lower hudson valley zone,because even assuming that the zone creation would eventually incent new generation there,those resources would not materialize for several years particularly in light of state regulatory initiatives that the nypsc argued would alleviate the transmission constraint identified by nyiso.upon the creation of the new zone,however,consumer rates would increase immediately,so ferc failure to identify benefits of the new zone therefore suggested that the rate increases were unjustified.the nypsc thus urged ferc to either delay or phase in the rate increases associated with establishing the new zone.but nowhere did it make the specific argument that new york petitioners do,that ferc was obliged to quantify the amount by which consumer rates would increase.see pet rs br.at despite ferc refusal to do so,the fpa requires that it quantify and review the extent of the possible price impacts to ensure that they fall within a reasonable range of rates.nor did the nypsc raise this argument in seeking rehearing of the demand curve order,when it also highlighted ferc failure to identify benefits from the lower hudson valley zone in light of ongoing state initiatives,and therefore urged ferc to have nyiso phase in the new zone demand curve.
we do not intend to suggest that a petitioner may never,in seeking judicial review,supplement an argument raised in its request for rehearing by adding new nuances or framing the argument in a slightly different way.see,city of oconto falls ferc.but the nypsc failure even to mention to ferc that quantifying price impacts was required led ferc quite understandably not to consider that question at all.for us to address new york petitioners argument on the merits would therefore disserve the fpa purpose of enabling ferc to correct any error in its initial order or explain why,in its considered judgment,there was no error.accordingly,we conclude that the quantification argument has not been preserved for our consideration.see allegheny power,at finding that an objection had not been preserved where it was not made specifically in the petitioner request for rehearing and did not elicit a response from ferc.in light of the foregoing discussion,however,we also conclude that new york petitioners more general argument,that ferc failed to identify benefits of creating the lower hudson valley zone that would justify consumer rate increases has been adequately preserved.
joint intervenors also contend that new york petitioners failed to preserve their argument that ferc improperly relied on reliability concerns to justify the creation of the lower hudson valley zone.in its request for rehearing of the zone order,the nypsc raised reliability concerns only in connection with its argument that ferc should establish criteria for nyiso to determine when the lower hudson valley zone should be eliminated.it pointed out that,in the zone order,ferc justified the creation of the new zone based in part on the fact that reliability concerns required locating a certain amount of generation within the zone itself,so higher capacity prices would be justified based on the zone higher net cost of new entry other zones.see zone order at p.the nypsc argued that the sustained price separation contemplated by ferc was unjust,and asked ferc to prescribe a process for the elimination of the new zone.in the zone rehearing order,however,ferc cited reliability concerns not only as a reason for tolerating price separation,but also in response to the nypsc separate argument that the zone should be delayed or phased in ferc claimed that the accurate price signals created by the new zone would enhance reliability.zone rehearing order at pp.perhaps for this reason,new york petitioners now argue that ferc improperly cited reliability concerns to justify the immediate creation of the new zone and not just to justify its refusal to require elimination criteria.
new york petitioners did not specifically argue on rehearing,as they do now,that ferc decision to create the lower hudson valley zone was erroneous because there was inadequate evidence of a reliability concern.under the circumstances,however,this failure does not preclude us from addressing the merits of new york petitioners argument.to the extent that there is error in ferc reliance on reliability concerns to justify the immediate establishment of the new zone as opposed to a delay or a new york petitioners specifically argued on rehearing that the new zone should be delayed or phased in,so the adequacy of ferc reasoning in rejecting that argument is properly before us.similarly,to the extent that ferc cited reliability concerns in deciding not to establish elimination criteria for the new zone,that decision also was objected to on reconsideration,see,so we may examine the adequacy of ferc explanation on that subject,too including its reliance on reliability concerns

zone creation 
petitioners contend that ferc did not adequately support its conclusion that the creation of the new lower hudson valley zone justified the costs imposed by the zone,its conclusion that the creation of the new zone would ultimately result in just and reasonable rates.we disagree.ferc adequately supported its decision to approve the creation of the lower hudson valley zone by relying on economic theory.
the circuit has held that ferc may permissibly rely on economic theory alone to support its conclusions so long as it has applied the relevant economic principles in a reasonable manner and adequately explained its reasoning.see,sacramento mun.util.dist.ferc,holding that ferc appropriately made findings based on generic factual predictions derived from economic research and theory given that it explained and applied the relevant economic principles in a reasonable manner quoting transmission access policy study grp.ferc.pub.power ferc,holding that ferc prediction that a given formula for allowing electricity suppliers to recover fixed costs in setting prices would provide an efficient incentive to invest was a reasonable predictive judgment that warrants judicial deference associated gas distribs.ferc,stating that courts should not set aside an agency reliance on generic factual predictions merely because they are typically studied in the field called economics.we agree,and we will therefore consider whether ferc reasonably applied sound economic principles and articulated an adequate explanation for how those principles justified its conclusion.
as ferc explained in the new zone criteria order,the highway deliverability test pursuant to which nyiso determined that the lower hudson valley zone should be created is designed to address reliability concerns that arise due to transmission constraints between different areas of an existing zone.because nyiso capacity auctions are,capacity resources that bid to supply capacity for a given zone can be located anywhere in the zone.if a transmission constraint exists,the capacity auction for that zone may accept more capacity in the unconstrained area than can be delivered to the constrained area.new zone criteria order at p.capacity in the unconstrained area may even displace capacity located in the constrained area,id.at p,if,for example,the cost of supplying capacity is lower in the unconstrained area and resources in that area therefore provide lower bids at auction,see zone rehearing order at pp.under those circumstances,the amount of capacity that is actually deliverable to the constrained area might be less than the amount needed for reliability.new zone criteria order at p.moreover,failing to pay resources located in the constrained area for their capacity could lead to insufficient capacity supply in the constrained area,jeopardizing reliability.to put it in simple terms,nyiso auctions award capacity payments to the resources who supply capacity at the lowest cost,and if those payments are going only to cheaper upstate resources that may be unable to actually deliver power to downstate consumers,then downstate resources who can deliver power to those consumers might not stay in business.by providing for the creation of a new zone in a way that accounts for transmission constraints,ferc sought to ensure that capacity prices in the constrained area would be allowed to rise above prices in the unconstrained area,thereby providing stronger incentives to attract and retain capacity needed to meet reliability objectives in the constrained area.id.at p.
after nyiso applied the deliverability test prescribed by the new zone criteria orders and sought ferc approval to create the lower hudson valley zone in the zone proceeding,ferc reaffirmed the economic basis for its conclusion that the new zone would lead to just and reasonable rates by generating more accurate price signals.see zone order at p the results of nyiso application of the deliverability test demonstrate that a significant transmission constraint currently exists into nyiso proposed new capacity zone.any resulting higher capacity prices in the new capacity zone will help to encourage the development of new generation transmission capacity to help alleviate the constraint.such price changes promote efficient decisions and are not unreasonable.indeed,in its request for rehearing in the zone proceeding,the nypsc recognized the validity of ferc economic reasoning,conceding that creating the lower hudson valley zone could have reliability benefits and may eventually incent new generation in that location.
we conclude that ferc articulated sound economic principles supporting the creation of the lower hudson valley zone and satisfactorily explained how those principles justified its conclusion.accordingly,ferc determination that the creation of the new zone would lead to just and reasonable rates was adequately supported,and was not arbitrary and capricious.
new york petitioners arguments to the contrary are not persuasive.new york petitioners claim that the benefits that ferc claims will follow from the accurate price signals generated by the new zone are merely predictions.pet rs br.at.quoting the circuit decision in electricity consumers resource council ferc,they contend that mere reliance on an economic theory can not substitute for substantial record evidence and the articulation of a rational basis for ferc decision.but the d.circuit has since clarified repeatedly that ferc economic argument in electricity consumers was unavailing not because reliance on economic theory alone is never permissible,but because the court there was persuaded that the commission had inexplicably distorted the theory that it claimed to apply.associated gas,at quoting consumers,at see also sacramento mun.util,at neither electric sic consumers nor any other case law prevents the commission from making findings based on generic factual predictions derived from economic research and theory.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.here,as we have explained,ferc has not distorted economic theory in reasoning that the creation of the lower hudson valley zone will ensure accurate price signals and thereby alleviate the risk of reliability problems in the long run.
petitioners also argue that ferc failed to consider the new zone impact on consumer rates.ferc orders,however,show that it did consider the new zone impact on consumer rates.see,zone rehearing order at p the reality is that,in the short run,consumers may pay more but doing so is necessary to provide the appropriate price signals to incent developers to build or restore capacity and address a problem the commission hopes to emphasize that based only on avoiding price increase in the could threaten reliability and price stability in the.ferc also explained that rates in the lower hudson valley zone would be likely to decrease over time a s more capacity locates in the new capacity zone.id.and,as we have explained,new york petitioners failed to preserve their argument that ferc was required to quantify consumer benefits.
t he fpa has multiple purposes in addition to preventing excessive rates,including protecting against inadequate service and promoting the orderly development of plentiful supplies of electricity.consol.edison of,ferc,citations and internal quotation marks omitted.in determining whether rates are just and reasonable,ferc is charged with balancing these competing interests,see,new eng.power generators ass n,ferc.cir,and we are not persuaded that there is anything unreasonable in ferc conclusion that higher prices were necessary to ensure reliability by generating accurate price signals in the long run.
apart from challenging ferc balancing of higher consumer costs against the benefits of generating more accurate price signals,petitioners also object to ferc decision to reject a of the lower hudson valley zone and the rate increases portended by the new zone demand curve.this issue arose in both the zone proceeding and the demand curve proceeding.in the zone proceeding,nyiso proposal did not call for a of the new zone,but a group of new york transmission owners including utility petitioners protested that the zone should be phased in to soften the impact of rate increases.see zone order at p.in the demand curve proceeding,nyiso proposed to phase in the demand curve for the new zone by discounting the demand curve to percent of the cost of new entry in the first year and percent in the second year,and petitioners urged ferc to adopt this aspect of nyiso proposal.see demand curve order at pp.in both proceedings,ferc rejected the,explaining that a would delay the capacity market ability to send more efficient investment price signals to attract and maintain sufficient capacity to meet local demand.demand curve order at p see also zone order at p zone rehearing order at pp demand curve rehearing order at p.
ferc rejected petitioners arguments that the timeframe for the construction of new capacity resources in the lower hudson valley zone implied that increases in capacity prices would be irrelevant to ferc goal of maintaining adequate capacity supply in the new zone.ferc explained that accurate price signals would not only create the proper incentives for building new capacity resources,but would also affect shorter term supply responses,demand response and repowering options.demand curve order at p see also zone rehearing order at p reiterating ferc finding that a could adversely affect incentives to supply shorter term capacity responses,such as demand response and repowering options.additionally,ferc asserted that accurate prices would guide efficient investment decisions to add or retire capacity resources.demand curve order at p emphasis added see also zone rehearing order at p warning that failure to create a new zone would encourage premature capacity retirements in the area because of the area inefficiently low prices demand curve rehearing order at p same.thus,in ferc view,an immediate increase in prices would,in fact,help alleviate reliability concerns by properly incentivizing demand response and repowering options and by discouraging early retirement of existing resources none of these sources of capacity would require years to come on line.
petitioners argue that ferc rejection of a resulted in unjust and unreasonable rates and was not supported by substantial evidence they contend that there was insufficient evidence of a reliability needs in the new zone,and they accuse ferc of failing to identify supply responses whose decisions would actually be affected by higher prices.
in this context,petitioners are arguably on stronger footing in suggesting that ferc reliance on economic analysis alone is insufficient.as we have discussed,in describing the benefits of creating the lower hudson valley zone,ferc persuasively explained why economic theory dictated that reliability concerns are likely to arise in a area and that creating a new demand curve for the constrained area would appropriately incentivize the supply of capacity within that area on an aggregate level.but in zeroing in on specific categories of capacity suppliers that would respond to incentives and mitigate reliability needs,ferc necessarily assumed that such suppliers existed and would respond to higher prices,and that a reliability need required an immediate response.however,even accepting for the sake of argument petitioners position that ferc was required to point to evidence supporting its factual premises,we conclude,for the following reasons,that the evidence was sufficient to justify ferc rejection of the.
nyiso asserted,in its proposed tariff revisions in the zone proceeding,that the reliability needs that the new zone would address are becoming increasingly significant.ferc pointed to this statement,as well the state of the market report cited by nyiso,in determining that a lack of accurate price signals in the constrained zone was already leading to a decrease in available capacity within the zone.see zone order at p see also demand curve order at p declining to reconsider the zone order decision not to adopt a.the state of the market report supported ferc conclusion.it suggested that the new zone should have been created even sooner,and that the delay has had several consequences including that t he total amount of unforced capacity sold in zones g,h,and i has fallen by gw or percent since the summer of.joint intervenors app x a.the report further suggested that s ome of this capacity may have been economic to remain in service or been maintained more reliably if the capacity zone had been implemented sooner.id.this evidence of negative consequences resulting from the initial delay in the lower hudson valley zone implementation supported ferc prediction that further delay would cause similar results.
there was also evidence supporting ferc prediction that further capacity resource losses in the lower hudson valley zone not only would occur,but also would jeopardize reliability an expert affidavit that ferc cited in the demand curve order stated that the loss of any of three large generating facilities in zones g i would likely cause immediate and significant reliability problems for the nyiso.see demand curve order at p.moreover,in both of its orders on rehearing,ferc pointed to nyiso summer capacity assessment,which indicated that under extreme weather conditions,southeast new york would experience a capacity reserve shortage,and that nyiso might therefore be required to invoke its emergency operating procedures to ensure sufficient generation to meet southeast new york needs.zone rehearing order at p demand curve rehearing order at p.new york petitioners claim that ferc miscalculated the size of the potential shortage,but as joint intervenors point out,a shortage of any magnitude would reasonably have provided cause for concern.ferc is owed deference in drawing conclusions from this report.and although ferc ordinary practice is not to consider new evidence on rehearing,see exxon ferc,petitioners point to no authority suggesting that ferc is prohibited from doing so when the evidence is in the record already or,as with nyiso summer capacity assessment,is publicly available.see.power light ferc,approving consideration of relevant,publicly available studies,which need not have been introduced into the record.
furthermore,there was evidence in the record suggesting that specific resources would respond to the incentives created by immediate implementation of the lower hudson valley zone demand curve.in the demand curve order,ferc cited a submission from entergy,which suggested that a that would suppress prices for a period would discourage competitive supply.demand curve order at p.the cited portion of entergy submission discussed a specific generating facility called bowline unit,which nrg was considering restoring in response to the creation of the lower hudson valley zone.nrg had indicated that it was far more likely to pursue this restoration if there were no of the demand curve for the new zone contrary to utility petitioners argument,this evidence was not newly introduced at the rehearing stage.although utility petitioners challenge nrg suggestion that the of the demand curve would actually affect its investment decisions given that bowline unit would not be restored in time for,or eligible to participate in,capacity auctions,we think ferc rationally could have credited nrg and entergy arguments,which were supported by an affidavit from entergy expert,that a would increase perceived regulatory risk and therefore reduce the likelihood of bowline unit being restored in the short term regardless of when the facility would actually be able to participate in capacity auctions.see.
finally,new york petitioners also suggest that ferc concern about reliability can not be squared with its rejection of a reliability criterion in the new zone criteria orders,rendering its reasoning arbitrary and capricious.this argument is a red herring.as we have discussed,ferc made clear throughout both of the proceedings at issue that the highway deliverability criterion that it instructed nyiso to apply in determining the need for a new zone was designed to address reliability concerns caused by transmission constraints.accordingly,ferc reliance on reliability concerns in rejecting a was wholly appropriate.
given the deference that ferc is owed in this highly technical area,we conclude that its economic predictions about the effects of immediately implementing the lower hudson valley zone and its demand curve,combined with the evidence described above suggesting that a of the demand curve would inhibit efforts to incentivize needed supply responses,were sufficient to support its decision to reject the of the new zone and its demand curve.because ferc adequately justified higher prices by reference to specific offsetting benefits,there is no basis for us to disturb ferc conclusion that the higher rates generated by the immediate implementation of the new zone were just and reasonable.
state transmission upgrades 
we also reject new york petitioners argument that it was arbitrary and capricious for ferc to decide to proceed with establishing the lower hudson valley zone despite the nypsc claims that new york planned transmission upgrades would eliminate the transmission constraint on which the new zone was premised.
ferc rationally considered and rejected evidence introduced by the nypsc regarding new york planned transmission upgrades.in its zone rehearing order,ferc stated that it was fully cognizant that the nypsc has two proceedings underway that may result in the construction of major transmission facilities during the timeframe which could alleviate the transmission constraint.zone rehearing order at p footnote omitted.but it explained that,to date,no major new transmission facility has completed the certification review process required under article vii of the new york state public service law which sets forth the existing certification review process for citing major utility transmission facilities in new york state and there is no assurance that any facilities would be completed during the time frame.id.at p.similarly,in the demand curve rehearing order,ferc explained that there is no assurance that any facilities would be completed during the time frame.demand curve rehearing order at p.and in the zone order,ferc emphasized that the transmission upgrades that the nypsc expects to result from its proceedings have not yet been built.zone order at p.
as discussed above,ferc approved the lower hudson valley zone in order to ensure that the capacity market more accurately reflected true market conditions.because ferc explained that potential future transmission upgrades that might alter those conditions were speculative,it rationally explained its decision to act according to existing market
