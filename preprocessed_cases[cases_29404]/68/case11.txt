the commonwealth of massachusetts wishes to ensure that the united states nuclear regulatory commission nrc or the commission will take account of the commonwealth safety concerns about treatment of spent fuel rods before the nrc decides whether to renew the operating licenses of two nuclear energy plants the pilgrim plant in plymouth,massachusetts,and the vermont yankee plant in vernon,vermont,which is within ten miles of the massachusetts border.the licenses were originally issued in and will expire in the proceedings have been initiated and are ongoing.
the commonwealth says that old assumptions about safe storage of spent fuel which the nrc has relied since at least the early longer hold.the commonwealth claims that more recent studies and changed circumstances indicate an increased risk that the plants method of storing spent fuel rods will lead to an environmental catastrophe.it also raises its concern that the plants method of storing spent fuel leaves the plants vulnerable to terrorist attack.
both sides agree that the safety issues raised are deserving of careful consideration.both sides also agree that the commonwealth is by law permitted to raise its various concerns by some path and to obtain judicial review of any nrc decision that adversely affects its interests in this matter.the question presented here is whether the commonwealth has,from the regulatory maze,chosen the correct path for doing so.the commonwealth insists it has chosen the appropriate path,indeed,the only one available to it.in short,the commonwealth argues that it must be allowed to participate directly in the proceedings as a party in order to get its contentions heard.in the alternative,the commonwealth argues that the nrc must ensure that it resolves a separate rulemaking petition,initiated by the commonwealth and based on the same concerns about spent fuel storage,before the commission issues any renewal licenses so that the results of the rulemaking will apply to the pilgrim and vermont yankee proceedings.
the nrc says the commonwealth has chosen the wrong path,indeed,one precluded by its regulations.the agency also says that another option is available,is the proper path to be followed,and will adequately protect the state interests.according to the nrc,the commonwealth must abandon its attempt to attain formal party status in the licensing proceedings and instead seek to participate in those proceedings as an interested governmental entity.the commonwealth may,in that capacity,petition the agency to delay issuance of the renewal licenses until the commonwealth request for a rulemaking is resolved.indeed,the nrc has committed itself in this case to an interpretation of its regulations in such a way as to provide this alternative path,complete with opportunities for eventual judicial review,to the commonwealth.
we hold as a matter of law that the commonwealth has chosen the wrong path in seeking to raise the safety issues as a party in the licensing proceedings and deny its petition.we also bind the nrc to its litigation position,described in more detail below.this leaves the commonwealth free to follow the nrc preferred path if it so chooses.to the extent the commonwealth seeks an order from this court interfering with the nrc ongoing proceedings by imposing timetables on the agency,we issue a very brief stay but otherwise decline to issue such relief.
regulatory background 
a description of the regulatory scheme governing the process for renewing licenses to operate nuclear power plants is helpful to understand this case.the atomic energy act aea contains the statutory basis for issuing and renewing such licenses.see,b.the aea empowers the nrc to make licensing decisions.id,b.the aea provides for initial operating licenses valid for up to forty years and specifies that licenses may be renewed.id.c the aea says nothing more about requirements for,instead delegating to the nrc authority to determine applicable rules and regulations.id,b.
the nrc has codified two distinct sets of regulations containing requirements for license renewal applications.the first set of regulations focuses on technical issues such as equipment aging.see,defining scope of renewal requirements in part.those provisions are not at issue here.
the nrc promulgated the other set of regulations,codified at part,primarily to fulfill the agency obligations under the national environmental policy act nepa.see explaining purpose of part regulations.nepa requires federal agencies to document the environmental impacts and possible alternatives to proposed major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.c.in doing so,nepa fulfills dual purposes.first,it places upon an agency the obligation to consider every significant aspect of the environmental impact of a proposed action.balt.gas res.def.council,d quoting.yankee nuclear power res.def.council,d internal quotation marks omitted.second,it ensures that the agency will inform the public that it has indeed considered environmental concerns in its decisionmaking process.id.citing weinberger catholic action of haw.peace educ.project,d.
issuance or renewal of a license to operate a nuclear power plant is a major federal action triggering nepa requirement that the agency produce an environmental impact statement eis for such proceedings.
producing an eis containing adequate discussion of all the environmental issues relevant to licensing the operation of a nuclear power plant poses a significant task for the nrc.in an effort to streamline the license renewal process,the nrc in conducted a study to determine which issues could be addressed generically that is,applying to all plants and which need to be determined on a basis.the agency characterizes the first group of issues as category,and the second as category,issues.see generally office of nuclear regulatory research,nuclear regulatory comm n,generic environmental impact statement for license renewal of nuclear plants.
category issues are common to all nuclear power plants,or to a of plants.as such,the nrc does not analyze generic category issues afresh with each individual plant operating license application.instead,the agency conducted an extensive survey and generated findings,contained within a generic environmental impact statement geis,that answer category issues as to all nuclear power plants.see id.at to.the geis findings have since been codified through a rulemaking.see environmental review for renewal of nuclear power plant operating licenses.june,hereinafter final rule see also pt,subpt.a,app.b listing nepa issues for license renewal of nuclear power plants and assigning them to either category or.category issues,by contrast,are those issues that require analysis for each individual licensing proceeding.pt,subpt.a,app.b.
these categories affect how the nrc handles the eis requirements.the process of creating the eis for an operating licensing or proceeding begins with the applicant,although producing the eis is ultimately the nrc responsibility.under the regulations,each applicant must submit to the agency an environmental report that includes analysis of all category issues.id.c ii.the regulations generally relieve applicants of having to discuss category issues,instead allowing applicants to rest on the geis findings.id.c i.
the regulation does require an applicant report to include any new and significant information regarding the environmental impacts of license renewal of which the applicant is aware.id.c iv.the nrc concedes that this applies even to new and significant information concerning category issues.
nrc staff then draw upon the applicant environmental report to produce a draft supplemental eis seis for the license renewal.see id.c.this seis addresses category issues and complements the geis,which covers category issues.id.d.when the geis and seis are combined,they cover all issues that nepa requires be addressed in an eis for a nuclear power plant license renewal proceeding.
once the agency has prepared a draft seis,it must be made available for comment both to the public and to other federal,state,and local agencies.id.after receiving comments,the nrc must then prepare a final seis.id.c referencing id.
because category issues have already been addressed globally by pt,subpt.a,app.b,they can not be litigated in individual adjudications,such as license renewal proceedings for individual plants.see id.power light turkey point nuclear generating plant.instead,the agency has established other means for challenging geis findings regarding category issues when necessary,whether by the agency own initiative or by petition from an outside entity.this divergent treatment of generic and issues is reasonable and consistent with the purpose of promoting efficiency in handling license renewal decisions.
there are several methods of review of category issues.first,the agency must review the geis findings every ten years.see final rule,supra.at.second,the nrc staff may make a request to the commission that a rule be suspended on a generic basis or that a particular adjudication be delayed until the geis and accompanying rule are amended.id.at.this would be an appropriate course of action should public comments on a draft seis or information submitted by a license renewal applicant alert the agency to new and significant information calling into question the validity of a geis finding.id.
third,the nrc staff may request that a rule be suspended with respect to a particular plant if comments to a draft seis reveal information indicating that the rule would be inapplicable to that particular plant.id.
fourth,a party to an adjudicatory proceeding may petition for a waiver of an nrc rule or regulation with respect to that proceeding.b.the sole ground for petition of waiver or exception is that special circumstances with respect to the subject matter of the particular proceeding are such that the application of the rule or regulation would not serve the purposes for which it was adopted.id.
finally,any member of the public may petition the agency for a rulemaking proceeding aimed at altering the geis and its accompanying rule.final rule,supra.at.
administrative proceedings 
entergy intervenor to these petitions,obtained operating licenses for the pilgrim and vermont yankee plants in.those licenses will expire in,but they may be renewed for an additional period,which would last until.on january,entergy submitted applications to begin the license renewal process 
both the pilgrim and the vermont yankee applications included an environmental report specific to the respective plant.entergy environmental reports did not contain discussion of any category issues and represented that entergy has not identified any new and significant information concerning the impacts addressed by these geis findings.
on may,the commonwealth of massachusetts submitted parallel hearing requests in each of the two plant proceedings.each request included only one contention that the commonwealth proposed to introduce into the proceedings that entergy environmental reports for each plant did not satisfy nepa because they do not address the environmental impacts of severe spent fuel pool accidents.
the storage of spent fuel on site at nuclear power plants is a category issue for operating license renewal purposes pt,subpt.a,app.b.that subject is normally exempt from discussion in a license renewal applicant environmental report,id.c i,but may be raised elsewhere.the commonwealth contends that it may raise the issue in the proceeding and that entergy report violated nepa and c iv because it failed to address new and significant information regarding the risks of spent fuel storage.
spent fuel rods are a radioactive waste product of nuclear power plants.when the pilgrim and vermont yankee plants were originally licensed in,it was common practice to arrange spent fuel rods in racks in storage pools located at the plant that produced the waste.at the time,there was a national policy of eventually disposing of spent fuel through reprocessing.storage in a central geologic repository posed another option for removing spent fuel from reactor sites.however,the reprocessing strategy was abandoned in the,and although the federal government has been planning to accept spent fuel at a proposed repository at yucca mountain,nevada,that option will not be available until at least,if at all.as a result,spent fuel has accumulated at storage facilities,and power plant operators have replaced racks with racks in storage pools in order to accommodate the mounting volume of spent fuel rods.according to the commonwealth,use of racks restricts the flow of cooling fluid around spent fuel rods and raises the risk of fire under a number of scenarios.
the commonwealth contended in the proceedings that new and significant information about spent fuel storage at the pilgrim and vermont yankee plants was demonstrated by the switch to storage racks,recent scientific studies regarding the dangers of storage pool fires,and the increased likelihood of terrorist attack following september.according to the commonwealth,
s ignificant new information now firmly establishes that a if the water level in a fuel storage pool drops to the point where the tops of the fuel assemblies are uncovered,the fuel will burn,b the fuel will burn regardless of its age,c the fire will propagate to other assemblies in the pool,and d the fire may be catastrophic.
a spent fuel pool fire would be catastrophic in large part because a large,atmospheric release of radioactive material would occur.
the commonwealth appended four reports to its hearing requests in support of its pool fire contention.the first two resulted from studies commissioned by the commonwealth to assess the risks of and alternatives to,pool storage at the pilgrim and vermont yankee plants.the first of these was written by gordon thompson of the institute for resource and security studies in cambridge,massachusetts.the thompson report surveyed analyses by nrc staff and others and found that they recognized that a loss of water from,storage racks would,over a range of scenarios,lead to of a fire that could propagate across the pool.the report assessed the probability of a storage pool fire occurring at either pilgrim or vermont yankee as at least one per years.thompson recommended replacing the storage racks at both facilities with,racks.this course would,according to thompson,return the plant s to their original design configuration and achieve the largest risk reduction during plant operation within a license extension period.thompson also surmised that the plants with the recommended racks would cost less than million for each plant.
the second study commissioned by the commonwealth was authored by jan beyea,a nuclear physicist affiliated with consulting in the public interest,and focused on the consequences of a hypothetical pool fire at the pilgrim or vermont yankee plants.under a scenario in which ten percent of the radioactive material in storage at the plants was released into the atmosphere due to a pool fire,beyea estimated economic costs of billion for pilgrim,and billion for vermont yankee.if one hundred percent of the radioactive material were released in such a fire,the costs would rise to billion at pilgrim and billion at vermont yankee.beyea estimated that a one hundred percent release of radioactive material at either plant could result in up to cases of latent cancer.beyea report further concluded that the results of recent epidemiologic studies could significantly inflate his estimates of the economic and health costs of a pool fire.
the third report submitted by the commonwealth with its hearing requests was authored by nrc staff to assess the risk of spent fuel pool accidents at decommissioned nuclear power plants.published publicly in early,the report acknowledged the possibility that even a partial loss of cooling fluid in a storage pool could result in a fire.the report also observed that because fuel assembly geometry and rack configuration are plant specific,the possibility of pool fires can not be precluded on a generic basis.however,the report also concluded that even though the consequences from a zirconium fire could be serious,the risk of such fires at decommissioning plants is low and well within the commission safety goals.
finally,the commonwealth submitted a report produced,at the request of congress,by the national academy of sciences to examine the potential consequences of a terrorist attack on spent fuel storage facilities sited at nuclear power plants.the report concluded that while all plants should have pools for storage of spent fuel,there is some risk that a terrorist attack could partially or fully drain such a pool,leading to a fire and the release of radioactive material.the report also concluded that t he potential vulnerabilities of spent fuel pools to terrorist attacks are specific.therefore,specific vulnerabilities can be understood only by examining the characteristics of spent fuel storage at each plant.
the nrc convened two atomic safety and licensing boards aslb or board to assess whether the various contentions submitted by the commonwealth and other entities were admissible in the pilgrim and vermont yankee license renewal proceedings.on june,entergy and the nrc staff filed oppositions to the commonwealth hearing requests,arguing the commonwealth had chosen the wrong path to raise its contentions.they asserted the commonwealth had impermissibly challenged a generic category issue without requesting a waiver of the agency rule within the pilgrim and vermont yankee proceedings.they also argued that the information submitted by the commonwealth did not constitute new and significant information within the meaning of c iv.during oral arguments at conferences in front of the aslbs,the commonwealth staked out its position that the waiver provision was unavailable in any event it could not seek waiver in the individual proceedings because its contention regarding pool fires was not specific to either of the two plants,but was a safety issue common to all plants.
the commonwealth also informed the aslbs of its intention to file a rulemaking petition aimed at modifying the geis findings about spent fuel storage.the parties agree that this rulemaking path is and always has been open to the commonwealth.
on august,following oral arguments in front of the pilgrim and vermont yankee aslbs,the commonwealth filed a petition for rulemaking with the nrc based on the same pool fire contention raised in its hearing requests in the individual licensing proceedings the petition requested that the nrc 
a consider new and significant information showing that the nrc characterization of the environmental impacts of spent fuel storage as insignificant in the geis is incorrect,b revoke the regulations which codify that incorrect conclusion and excuse consideration of spent fuel storage impacts in nepa documents,c issue a generic determination that the environmental impacts of pool storage of spent fuel are significant,and d order that any nrc licensing decision that approves pool storage of spent fuel at a nuclear power plant must be accompanied by an eis that addresses i the environmental impacts of pool storage of spent fuel at that nuclear plant and ii a reasonable array of alternatives for avoiding or mitigating those impacts.
the petition also urged the nrc to withhold any decision to renew the operating licenses for the pilgrim and vermont yankee nuclear power plants until the requested rulemaking has been completed and suspend consideration of the commonwealth contentions in the individual proceedings.in support of its petition,the commonwealth appended the same four reports described above.to date,there has been no decision on the rulemaking petition,and the issue before us does not involve that petition,but rather the commonwealth hearing requests in the individual plant proceedings.
the vermont yankee aslb issued its decision on the hearing requests in that proceeding on september.entergy nuclear.yankee,llc.yankee nuclear power station.yankee i.as an initial matter,the aslb granted standing to the commonwealth.id.at.the board went on to reject the commonwealth contention,ruling that even if the commonwealth contention presented new and significant information about pool fires,as a matter of law the contention is not admissible because the commission has already decided,in turkey point,that licensing boards can not admit an environmental contention regarding a category issue.id.at.the board stated the agency position that under c,a licensing applicant such as entergy must provide analysis of new and significant information regarding a nepa issue,whether category or,in its environmental report.id.further,the board observed that if the information that the commonwealth presents is indeed new and significant,the staff seis needs to address it.id.at.
the board ruling did not purport to foreclose any challenge by the commonwealth to the agency rule on spent fuel storage.again citing turkey point,the board pointed out that the commonwealth has several options,including filing a petition for rulemaking,providing the information to the nrc staff which can then seek commission approval to suspend the application of the rules or delay the license renewal proceeding,or petitioning the commission to waive the application of the rule.id.at.the board concluded its discussion of the commonwealth contention by noting the commonwealth pending rulemaking petition.thus we see,the board stated,that the commonwealth has already begun to pursue the alternative remedies specified in turkey point.id.at.
on october,the pilgrim aslb issued a ruling rejecting the commonwealth pool fire contention on substantially the same grounds as had the vermont yankee aslb.entergy nuclear generation pilgrim nuclear power station.
the commonwealth appealed the aslb decisions to the nrc.the commission affirmed the pilgrim and vermont yankee aslb decisions on january.entergy nuclear.yankee,llc.yankee nuclear power station.yankee ii,wl.the nrc agreed with the aslbs that the commonwealth chose the appropriate way to challenge the geis when it filed its rulemaking petition.id.at.the commission explained that i t makes more sense for the nrc to study whether,as a technical matter,the agency should modify its requirements relating to spent fuel storage for all plants across the board than to litigate in particular adjudications whether generic findings in the geis are impeached by claims of new information.id.at.otherwise,litigation of category issues would defeat the purpose of resolving generic issues in a geis.id.at.
the commission decision also described how the pending rulemaking could affect the pilgrim and vermont yankee licensing proceedings.the commission rejected the commonwealth request that it suspend the licensing proceedings.it would be premature to delay a final decision on licensing,the commission reasoned,where final decisions in those proceedings are not expected for another year or more and involve many issues unrelated to the commonwealth rulemaking petition.id.at.however,depending on the timing and outcome of the rulemaking,the commission recognized the possibility that nrc staff could request that the commission suspend the generic rule and include analysis of pool storage in the pilgrim and vermont yankee seiss.id.at.we are told that to date,that has not happened.
the commission also outlined a route by which the commonwealth itself could influence the timing of the licensing decisions 
nrc regulations provide that a petitioner who has filed a petition for rulemaking may request the commission to suspend all or any part of any licensing proceeding to which the petitioner is a party pending disposition of the petition for rulemaking.d.an interested governmental entity participating under could also make this request.
id.at.because alternatives were available,admitting the commonwealth contention for an adjudicatory hearing is not necessary to ensure that the claim receives a full and fair airing.id.at.
the commonwealth filed a motion for reconsideration and clarification on february.the commonwealth requested that the commission 
establish that a.yankee ii is not a final decision with respect to the commonwealth rights of participation in the pilgrim and vermont yankee license renewal proceedings,b the commission will treat the commonwealth as a party if the commonwealth later decides to seek to suspend the license renewal decisions for the plants under,and c as a party,the commonwealth would be permitted to seek judicial review of any decision by the nrc that fails to make timely application of the results of the proceeding on the commonwealth petition for rulemaking to the individual license renewal decisions for pilgrim and vermont yankee.
the commission denied the motion on march.entergy nuclear.yankee,llc.yankee nuclear power station.yankee iii.the commission found that the motion failed to demonstrate compelling circumstances justifying reconsideration.id.at.the commission clarified that its previous decision constituted a final decision with regards to the nrc rejection of the commonwealth contentions in the licensing proceedings.the commission also pointed out that the commonwealth,after the nrc decision of the rulemaking petition,could eventually also obtain judicial review of that decision.id.at.finally,the commission made clear that the commonwealth could seek interested governmental entity status even now,a maneuver that would allow the commonwealth to request a stay of the licensing proceedings under d.id.at.
the commonwealth petitioned this court for review of the commission decisions.
the commonwealth principal argument in these petitions is that by refusing to take into account its alleged new and significant information regarding pool fires in the pilgrim and vermont yankee license renewal proceedings,whether by admitting the commonwealth as a party to the licensing proceedings or by promising to apply the results of the rulemaking to those proceedings,the nrc violated nepa and the administrative procedure act apa.
the nrc and entergy respond that the commonwealth nepa and apa claims are not properly before this court.both of these parties assert that the agency ruling in.yankee ii that it had not suspended the licensing proceedings is not yet ripe for judicial review because there has been no final agency action on either the rulemaking petition or the license renewal applications.entergy further argues that we may not review the nepa and apa claims because the commonwealth failed to exhaust available administrative remedies.
nrc decisions 
the administrative procedure act authorizes this court to displace the commission decisions only to the extent that they are arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a massachusetts nuclear regulatory comm n,cir.this general posture of deference toward agency is particularly marked with regards to nrc actions because t he aea is hallmarked by the amount of discretion granted the commission in working to achieve the statute ends.massachusetts,at quoting pub.serv.of nuclear regulatory comm n,cir.this principle is applicable in the context of licensing decisions,where statutory directives are scant and the aea explicitly delegates broad authority to the agency to promulgate rules and regulations.see,b.
this court must also be mindful of the substantial deference required when an agency adopts reasonable interpretations of regulations of its own creation.fed.express holowecki,d auer robbins,d.we must accept the agency position unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.auer,at.quoting robertson methow valley citizens council,d internal quotation marks omitted.
the commission decision to deny party status to the commonwealth in the pilgrim and vermont yankee license renewal proceedings is reasonable in context,and consistent with agency rules.as the commonwealth has conceded,the pool fire contention it raised in its hearing requests does not apply solely to the pilgrim or vermont yankee plants and instead challenges a category geis finding.
where environmental impacts of an nrc action are not,the supreme court has endorsed t he generic method as clearly an appropriate method of conducting the hard look required by nepa.balt.gas,at.citing.yankee,at.administrative efficiency and consistency of decision are both furthered by a generic determination of these effects without needless repetition of the litigation in individual proceedings,which are subject to review by the commission in any event.id.
the nrc procedural rules are clear generic category issues can not be litigated in individual licensing adjudications without a waiver.see also dominion nuclear,millstone nuclear power station,turkey point,at duke energy oconee nuclear station.if the commonwealth or any citizen wishes to attack the agency rule on such an issue,it must petition for a generic rulemaking.turkey point,at.
nepa does impose a requirement that the nrc consider any new and significant information regarding environmental impacts before renewing a nuclear power plant operating license.however,nepa does not require agencies to adopt any particular internal decisionmaking structure.balt.gas,at.here,the nrc procedures anticipate a situation,such as that alleged here by the commonwealth,in which a generic finding adopted by agency rule may have become obsolete.in such a situation,the regulations provide channels through which the agency expert staff may receive new and significant information,namely from a license renewal applicant environmental report or from public comments on a draft seis,and the nrc staff may seek modification of a generic category finding.
the commonwealth has already chosen the available option of a rulemaking petition.but the rulemaking petition may not move quickly enough to address the commonwealth safety concerns before the commission renders decisions regarding the pilgrim and vermont yankee plants.
the commonwealth argues that the nrc acted arbitrarily and capriciously when it channeled the commonwealth pool fire concerns into a generic rulemaking without any assurances that the result of the rulemaking would apply to the individual licensing proceedings for the pilgrim and vermont yankee plants.central to the commonwealth argument is its assumption that u nder the nrc present process,the commonwealth does not even have a right to request the agency to exercise its discretion to stay the individual proceedings so that the results of the rulemaking may be applied to pilgrim and vermont yankee.pet r br.
the commonwealth concern is apparently based on a misreading of the nrc position.both in its decisions in the administrative proceedings and before this court,the nrc has outlined at least one path by which the commonwealth may establish a connection between the rulemaking and the licensing proceedings.that path consists of two stages.first,the commonwealth may participate in the licensing proceedings not as a party with its own contentions,but as an interested governmental body under c second,in the rulemaking proceedings,the commonwealth may invoke d,which provides that a rulemaking petitioner may request the commission to suspend all or any part of any licensing proceeding to which the petitioner is a party pending disposition of the petition for rulemaking.this stay procedure would,the agency argues,allow the commonwealth an opportunity to influence the order and timing of the agency final decisions in the rulemaking and licensing proceedings.but,since the commonwealth has as yet done neither of those things,there is no final order and those issues are premature.
the commonwealth asserts the agency is changing positions before this court regarding the availability of the d mechanism.again,we think this is based on a misunderstanding.the commonwealth quotes a passage from the nrc denial of the motion for reconsideration u nder nrc regulations,the commonwealth currently has no right to request that the final decisions in the pilgrim and vermont yankee license renewal proceedings be stayed until the rulemaking is resolved.pet r br.quoting.yankee iii,at internal quotation marks omitted.the commission decision goes on to explain,however,that the commonwealth could not currently request a stay under d because at the time of the nrc decision,the commonwealth had neither been admitted as a party to the licensing proceedings nor asserted interested governmental
