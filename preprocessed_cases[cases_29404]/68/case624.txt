to accommodate the connection of newly created sources of electrical energy to a transmission facility that is part of the national grid,it is often necessary to upgrade the grid at the point of interconnection.federal law,as set forth in a recent order of the federal energy regulatory commission ferc,states that the generator of the energy is initially responsible for the costs of the upgrade but further provides that the owner of the transmission facility,typically a public utility such as petitioner southern california edison sce,may elect to pay those costs.in either case,the costs are later reimbursed through energy sales.california public utilities code section,as interpreted by respondent california public utilities commission puc,permits a requirement that the public utility pay the costs.the issue in this case is whether puc interpretation has been preempted by federal law.we conclude that it has.accordingly,on a petition for a writ of review filed by sce,we annul certain puc decisions to the extent they purport to interpret public utilities code section to permit a requirement that transmission owners pay the costs of network upgrades.
background 
the california energy security and reliability act of assem.bill reg.sess,contains a legislative declaration that i n recent years there has been significant growth in the demand for electricity in the state due to factors such as growth in population and economic activities that rely on electrical generation,and that a s a result,california faces potentially serious electricity shortages over the next two years,which necessitates immediate action by the state.stats,ch,a,c.on november,puc filed investigation,wl,instituting investigation into implementation of assembly bill.
in,california senate bills and reg.sess,both addressing the state need for generation of renewable electrical energy such as wind,solar,and geothermal energy,were signed into law.stats,chs.this legislation,which included public utilities code section,called upon the state to increase its electrical generation from renewable sources by at least percent a year until those sources comprise percent of the energy procured by public utilities such as sce.in early,as part of investigation,wl,puc requested comments on procedural coordination of renewables procurement,transmission planning and statutory interpretation of pub,as of.
on july,puc issued decision,captioned interim opinion on procedures to implement public utilities code section hereafter interim opinion,wl cal.puc lexis.among the many topics covered,the interim opinion discussed the financing of upgrades to the grid network.the interim opinion provides in part 
by way of definition,we refer to transmission facilities needed to bring power from the plant to the first point of interconnection with the existing transmission grid as.we refer to facilities needed to upgrade the existing transmission grid to ensure reliable electric service and full delivery of a generator output with the added generation as network or system upgrades.under current ferc policy,new generators absorb costs as part of the cost of producing power.with respect to network upgrade costs,current ferc policy requires a new generator to fund network upgrades for which the new generator is the but for causation.however,the transmission owner,the public utilities must credit back those costs,with interest,in monthly payments amortized over a number of years beginning when the new generation is available to the grid.thus,the renewable developer knows that it currently must finance the needed transmission network upgrades,but will receive that money back with interest once it comes.
the language of does not modify the developer cost responsibility for either or network upgrades.the former continues to be funded by the new generator and the latter by ratepayers,under current ferc policies.the difference is that b provides the possibility of ratemaking for network upgrade costs,which we define to mean that the developer would not have to fund network upgrades upfront and await recovery of those costs over time.instead,ratepayers would fund those in transmission rates authorized by ferc or in retail rates authorized by this commission.more specifically,the utilities would finance these transmission projects as part of rate base,with the associated costs recovered in rates.under this scenario,ratepayers assume the financial risk of the generation projects actually coming on line.interim,supra,wl,fns.omitted cal.puc lexis,pp.
the interim opinion also addresses the responses of sce and pacific gas electric pg e to puc previous request for comments.in these comments,sce and pg e argued that federal preemption precludes an interpretation of public utilities code section that requires the utilities to pay for the costs of network upgrades.the interim opinion states pg e and sce are simply incorrect in this regard,we note that nowhere in their comments do either pg e or sce cite to a specific federal law or ferc rule that articulates this ferc policy as a legally binding requirement.nor could they do so if they tried,because the ferc policy in question,which requires the developers of new generation to front transmission system network upgrade costs and to recover these costs in credits after the new upgrade is available to the grid,is precisely policy it is neither a law nor a rule.the various ferc decisions cited in pg e comments reflect various instances in which that policy was implemented.however,the implementation by a federal agency such as ferc of a particular policy preference in various individual cases does not amount to the establishment of federal law that supports the application of the doctrine of federal preemption,and the states must be presumed to be able to implement their own alternative policy preferences in such matters unless federal law expressly or impliedly mandates otherwise.interim,supra,wl,pp.cal.puclexis,pp.
sce filed an application for rehearing.on october,the application was denied in cal.decision,captioned order denying rehearing of decision hereafter order denying rehearing,wl cal.puclexis.the order denying rehearing notes that days after issuance of the interim opinion,ferc issued an order applicable to large power generators,captioned standardization of generator interconnection agreements and procedures hereafter standard interconnection agreement order ferc,wl ferclexis.order denying,supra,wl,cal.puclexis.the order denying rehearing continues 
ferc indisputably has jurisdiction over interconnection agreements,and the standard interconnection agreement order that ferc issued on july,is,as sce correctly points out,a final rule effective october,that will require public utility transmission providers to use a standard interconnection agreement.however,as certain parties point out,the standard interconnection agreement order does not require that the developer of new generation advance the costs of transmission upgrades.citation.ferc expressly allows the transmission provider to elect to fund the network upgrades itself,with no advance payment by the interconnection customer,and thus no need for subsequent reimbursement credits.standard interconnection agreement order.section of the standard large generator interconnection agreement,attached to the order,provides that unless the transmission provider or transmission owner elects to fund the capital for the network upgrades,they shall be solely funded by the interconnection customer.as the standard interconnection agreement order expressly allows the costs to be paid by the transmission provider,such an arrangement clearly does not conflict with any of the policy goals discussed in the order.moreover,this provision does not represent a change in ferc policy it merely preserves an option that has been available under existing policy.citation.
the preemption question,therefore,is properly narrowed to whether a federal statute,ferc policy,or ferc rule precludes a state commission from requiring a utility to provide the funding for transmission upgrades,subject to ferc approval of the interconnection agreement.sce has cited no statute,no provision of the standard interconnection agreement order,or any other authority,that expressly precludes a state commission from doing this.the standard interconnecion agreement order is silent on this question,and as a generator of renewable energy that previously submitted comments correctly points out,the courts are reluctant to infer preemption from silence,especially in the context of a federal statutory scheme that does not entirely supplant state regulation.citation.order denying,supra,wl,pp,fn.omitted cal.puclexis,pp.
the order denying rehearing continues by noting that u nder the federal power act,the states retain regulatory authority over transmission siting and integrated resource planning,among other things order denying,wl,cal.puclexis,and that w ith respect to wholesale rates for electric power,ferc has recognized that ferc jurisdiction over wholesale rates does not preclude state regulators from determining whether a purchaser has prudently chosen from among available supply options,wl cal.puclexis.thus,concludes puc in light of the role state regulators continue to play with respect to transmission upgrades as well as retail rates under the federal power act,we are not persuaded that ferc silence on this point should be construed as an expression of congressional intent to preempt state commissions from directing a utility to provide the costs of necessary network upgrades,subject to ferc approval of the interconnection agreement,and to seek recovery of those costs in transmission rates.order denying,wl,cal.puclexis.
following the order denying rehearing,sce petitioned this court for a writ of review.the petition was opposed by puc,as well as by real party in interest center for energy efficiency and renewable technologies ceert.sce filed a reply,addressing both opposition briefs.we issued a writ of review and set the matter for oral argument.
discussion 
a federal statute or regulation may preempt state law in three situations,commonly referred to as express preemption,field preemption,and conflict preemption.first,congress can define explicitly the extent to which its enactments state law.citations.second,in the absence of explicit statutory language,state law is where it regulates conduct in a field that congress intended the federal government to occupy exclusively.citations.finally,state law is to the extent that it actually conflicts with federal law.citations.citations.olszewski scripps health cal th,d.federal regulations have no less effect than federal statutes.id.quoting fidelity federal sav.loan de la cuesta,d.
sce argument is limited to field preemption.as conceded by puc in the order denying rehearing,ferc indisputably has jurisdiction over interconnection agreements order denying,supra,wl,cal.puc lexis.thus,the issue we address is the preemptive effect of this jurisdiction.
as a preliminary matter,we disagree with puc assertion that the matter is not ripe for review.this is not a situation,as in pg e public utilities com.th,d,where the admittedly vague subject matter of a puc interim opinion had been given an almost equally ambiguous interpretation.id.at,d.the interim opinion and the order denying rehearing at issue here are unambiguous in asserting puc control over financing of the costs of interconnection upgrades.and as noted by sce,negotiations on developing new sources of renewable energy for connection to the grid are being inhibited by the uncertainty over this issue.see pacific legal foundation california coastal com.cal d,quoting abbott laboratories gardner,d determination of ripeness requires the court to evaluate both the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration italics omitted.
turning to the substantive issue,we note that sce transmits electricity through the grid,and any electricity that enters the grid immediately becomes a part of a vast pool of energy that is constantly moving in interstate commerce.new york ferc,d.federal statutory jurisdiction over transmission of electrical energy emanates from the federal power act et,which declare s that the business of transmitting and selling electric energy for ultimate distribution to the public is affected with a public interest.a.federal regulation of matters relating to generation and transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce and the sale of such energy at wholesale in interstate commerce is necessary in the public interest,such federal regulation,however,to extend only to those matters which are not subject to regulation by the states.a.the federal power act generally applies to the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce and to the sale of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce and over all facilities for such transmission or sale of electrical energy.b.it gives ferc jurisdiction over all facilities for such transmission or sale of electric energy b.the jurisdiction includes the authority to order interconnection to the grid and to specify the terms of the interconnection.
while this matter was pending before puc,ferc issued the standard interconnection agreement order.its background section states that ferc to date has addressed interconnection issues on a basis.although a number of transmission providers have filed interconnection procedures as part of their open access transmission tariffs,many industry participants remain dissatisfied with existing interconnection policy and procedures.with the increasing number of interconnection related disputes,it has become apparent that the approach is an inadequate and inefficient means to address interconnection issues.interconnection plays a crucial role in bringing generation into the market to meet the growing needs of electricity customers ferc concludes that there is a pressing need for a single set of procedures for jurisdictional transmission providers and a single,uniformly applicable interconnection agreement for large generators.standard interconnection agreement order,supra,ferc,pts,fns.omitted,wl,ferc lexis,pp.
given this vast amount of federal statutory and regulatory authority,sce relies on the following rule in the absence of express language,congress intent to all state law in a particular area may be inferred where the scheme of federal regulation is sufficiently comprehensive to make reasonable the inference that congress left no room for supplementary state regulation.citation.of a whole field also will be inferred where the field is one in which the federal interest is so dominant that the federal system will be assumed to preclude enforcement of state laws on the same subject.citations.hillsborough county automated medical labs,d.
puc argues that the federal statutory and regulatory scheme regarding interconnection is not so pervasive as to preempt the field of interconnection agreements and thereby nullify puc interpretation of public utility code section.puc first relies on the general rule disfavoring implied preemption.as observed in consumer justice center olympian labs,th,d,because congress knows how to write a preemption clause if it wanted to,analysis of a preemption issue should start with a presumption against preemption.but this presumption is characteristically applied where the field is one that the states have traditionally occupied and regulated.see,olszewski scripps health,supra,cal th at,d,public health and the costs of medical care.the presumption is not triggered when the state regulates in an area where there has been a history of significant federal presence.citation.laplante wellcraft marine th,d.inasmuch as the field of interconnection agreements has a history of significant federal presence,the presumption against preemption is not applicable here.
puc further notes that federal policy,as reflected in ferc decisions handed down before the standard interconnection agreement order was promulgated and in the standard interconnection agreement order itself,permits utilities that provide transmission facilities to pay the upfront costs of network upgrades.consequently,puc urges,federal policy is not in conflict with puc interpretation of
