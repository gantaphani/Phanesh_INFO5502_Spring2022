these are petitions for judicial review of a federal energy regulatory commission ruling that a rule does not apply to power sales contracts terminated by of the of the power company of america pca.
pca is a power marketer.as such,it buys and sells wholesale electricity at rates but does not own generation or transmission facilities.it purchases electricity from other power marketers and from traditional utilities.in contrast to power marketers,traditional utilities not only buy or sell electricity,they also own generation or transmission facilities.power marketers and traditional utilities receive different regulatory treatment,especially in regard to the transaction documents they are required to file with the commission.
during the summer of,several entities terminated their contracts to sell power to pca,purportedly because of pca weak financial condition.pca creditors then forced it into involuntary bankruptcy.
the present dispute is about the notice pca counterparties had to give before unilaterally terminating their contracts.those contracts apparently do not address the matter of notice,but pca claims a commission regulation does.the regulation requires days notice to the commission to terminate a rate schedule or part thereof required to be on file with the commission.a the issue,then,is whether the terminated contracts were required to be on file with the commission.the canceling parties filed notices with the commission as a precautionary measure,but not sufficiently far in advance to satisfy pca.the commission dismissed the notices as not required all of the canceled transactions were power sales made from time to time at the discretion of the parties,and,as such,did not have to be on file under a.see southern.energy marketing,at,wl.
jurisdictional issues 
pca concedes that the contracts at issue have been irrevocably cancelled.final brief of petitioner at.the commission did not cancel the contracts private parties did,many of whom are not party to this suit.it is not obvious that pca can show an injury in fact that is fairly traceable to the commission actions and that will likely be redressed by a favorable decision,as article iii requires.bennett spear,d see also lujan defenders of wildlife,d animal legal defense fund,glickman,en banc.
pca ultimate injury is the termination of its contracts.although the commission did not terminate them,it acquiesced in their termination by others.if,as pca claims,the commission had a duty to prevent those terminations by requiring more notice than was given,then pca injury is terminations by others,and the commission failure to prevent this.in these circumstances,the latter injury is cognizable.the loss of a valuable contractual interest in a licensee is an injury sufficient to invoke our jurisdiction.telephone and data,fcc.the injury is directly traceable to the commission alleged nonfeasance.see id.at see also animal legal defense fund,at.
redressability is another matter.pca is not asking for damages or injunctive relief in this court,although it is seeking such relief elsewhere.pca stated that the commission has the power to fashion any number of remedies,and pca would ask ferc to use that power if this court holds that violations of the fpa and ferc regulations have occurred.final reply brief of petitioner at.the commission does not dispute that it has remedies for unlawful contract terminations.in holding that the terminated agreements were not subject to the rule,however,the commission effectively held that the contracts were legally terminated.as such,no contract remedies will be forthcoming if the commission determination stands.in these circumstances,a declaratory ruling that the terminations at issue are subject to the notice requirement is a necessary first step on a path that could ultimately lead to relief fully redressing the injury.telephone and data,at see also hazardous waste treatment council epa.pca is in the same position as the litigants who had standing in telephone and data will not necessarily prevail if we overturn the commission,but they can not prevail unless we do so.at 
failure to properly intervene and obtain party status 
the commission treated each contract termination as a separate proceeding and assigned each its own docket number,though it disposed of them on a consolidated basis.pca sought to become a party to each proceeding by intervention.the commission permitted pca to intervene in most proceedings but denied intervention in the six proceedings involving idaho power energy,south jersey energy vitol gas electric llc el paso energy marketing and cook inlet energy supply,see new york state gas,denying pca motions to intervene in the vitol and cook inlet proceedings southern.energy mktg,wl denying intervention in the idaho power and south jersey energy proceedings energy,wl denying intervention in the energy and el paso proceedings.as a consequence,pca was not party to these six proceedings.
we have no jurisdiction over proceedings in which pca is not a party because only part ies to a proceeding may seek judicial review under the federal power act.see b.the commission concluded that pca did not properly intervene and therefore did not become a party to these six proceedings.pca did not file timely motions to intervene,and the commission was not obligated to accept untimely ones.
pca claims that ferc had no grounds on which to deny intervention.final brief of petitioner at.under the commission rules,however,the burden is on the untimely movant to show good cause to intervene.see b.pca has not demonstrated good cause,certainly not to a degree sufficient to warrant our upsetting the commission application of its own procedural rule.pca also asserts that the commission arbitrarily considered only good cause,to the exclusion of four other factors identified in the rule.final brief of petitioner at.failure to establish good cause is,however,a sufficient condition to deny intervention,so the commission was not obligated to consider any other factor.see b 
ii.the merits 
pca has four arguments the commission erroneously viewed of the terminations as involving discretionary sales the commission interpretation of a violates the federal power act the commission interpretation violates the regulation itself and the commission should have applied its new interpretation assuming its validity prospectively only.
a.the nature of the terminated transactions 
pca asserts that the commission misconceived the nature of the terminated transactions,that of them were umbrella agreements or their functional equivalents.see final brief of petitioner at.we have jurisdiction to consider only pca argument regarding of the transactions because pca was not a party to the proceedings involving the other five see supra section 
one of the,washington water power company wwpc,clearly did not terminate an umbrella agreement with pca.wwpc notices of termination stated that it was terminating transactions under the western systems power pool agreement.see joint appendix at.while the pool agreement may constitute an umbrella agreement required to be on file,wwpc could not have terminated it merely by terminating individual transactions under it.the pool agreement has numerous parties in addition to wwpc and pca,and as such is not subject to termination by a single party.as the commission put it in western systems power pool,at,wl,the wspp is an umbrella arrangement that will continue for at least ten years while members come and go over time.when one member leaves,the arrangement does not terminate.see generally western systems power pool,wl.
we will assume arguendo that the remaining cancellations were of umbrella agreements.pca still must establish that these umbrella agreements were required to be on file with the commission.a.if they were not required to be on file,they are not subject to the commission requirement.pca makes no attempt to prove this essential predicate.
as it turns out,the canceled agreements were not required to be on file,whether they were umbrella agreements or not.this is so because these terminating counterparties were power marketers like pca rather than tradit
