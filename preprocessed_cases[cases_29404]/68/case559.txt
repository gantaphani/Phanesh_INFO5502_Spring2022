introduction 
the facts underlying this appeal concern the intricate realm of california energy crisis of may to june.the precise legal issue,however,is relatively straightforward the exhaustion of administrative remedies doctrine.plaintiffs and appellants are pacific gas and electric company,southern california edison company,and san diego gas electric company collectively referred to as the ious entities that bought electricity during the crisis.defendant and respondent is arizona electric power cooperative,arizona,which sold electricity during the crisis.
in,the ious initiated a proceeding before the federal energy regulatory commission ferc,the federal agency charged with regulating transmission and sale of electric energy for resale in interstate commerce.ferc found that unjust and unreasonable rates had been charged during the crisis and ordered refunds from energy sellers,including arizona.the problem with the order was that ferc jurisdiction extended to public utilities,which essentially were private sellers of energy.nonpublic entities,including governmental entities,were not subject to ferc jurisdiction.rural cooperatives like arizona had historically been treated as nonpublic entities that were also not subject to ferc jurisdiction.ferc nonetheless concluded that arizona was subject to its order,not because arizona was no longer a nonpublic entity,but because ferc had jurisdiction over the subject matter of the dispute.arizona appealed to the ninth circuit court of appeals,which agreed that ferc exceeded its jurisdiction when it held that arizona was subject to its refund order.bonneville power admin.cir bonneville.
unable to obtain a remedy against arizona before ferc,and following bonneville suggestion that a remedy might be found in a contract action,the ious filed this state court action.arizona demurred to the complaint on the ground,among others,that by failing to argue in the ferc proceedings that arizona nonpublic status should be changed,the ious failed to exhaust their administrative remedies.the trial court agreed and sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.the ious appealed.in the published portion of this opinion,we find that any failure of the ious to challenge arizona jurisdictional status did not implicate the exhaustion of administrative remedies doctrine.it was therefore error to sustain the demurrer on this ground.in the unpublished portion of this opinion,we find that there were no valid alternative grounds for dismissal of the iou action on demurrer.the judgment is therefore reversed.
factual and procedural background 
factual background 
in,our legislature enacted assembly bill pub,et,which deregulated california electrical power markets the new scheme created the california power exchange corporation calpx and the california independent system operator corporation caliso,subd.l.calpx operated a clearinghouse for daily and hourly auctions,or trades,of electricity.caliso managed california transmission grid and ensured an adequate and stable supply of energy.the ious supplied electrical power to california residents and businesses,and the ious were required to buy most of their power supply through calpx and caliso 
the calpx auctions resulted in a single market clearing price that applied to all sellers and buyers,even if some sellers would have sold power for less and some buyers would have bought it for more.in other words,all sellers received the market clearing price.bonneville described the auctions like this in a auction,all of the bidders are paid the same price as was bid by the seller whose electric energy was needed to clear the market or balance the supply of electric energy against the demand for electric energy.as a result,all of the bidders in a particular hour in the spot market received the same price for their sales.bonneville,supra,at.
tariffs governed the sale and purchase of electricity through the calpx and caliso markets.rates for such sales had to be just and reasonable under the federal power act.a.each participant in the calpx and caliso markets had to execute a calpx participation agreement and a caliso scheduling coordinator agreement agreeing to abide by the tariffs.the calpx participation agreement,prescribed by the calpx tariff,provided,for example,that the market participant will abide by and will perform all of the obligations under the cal px tariff in respect of all matters set forth therein including,without limitation,all matters relating to the trading of energy by it through the cal px markets and billing payments.
from may to june,california experienced an energy crisis caused by sustained high prices for electricity rolling blackouts occurred in northern california.prices for electricity far exceeded prices in prior periods.sellers,including arizona,received these inflated market clearing prices.the unjust and unreasonable rates were passed through to the ious retail electric customers in california.statutorily forced to buy power through calpx and caliso,some ious amassed crippling debt.calpx collapsed in january.
the crisis ended in june,when ferc established a mitigated market clearing price,which essentially was a recalculated just and reasonable rate.san diego gas sellers of energy et fed.energy reg.com,wl hereafter san diego gas.
ii.procedural background.
proceedings before ferc.background concerning ferc.
the federal power act fpa,codified at title united states code section et,governs ferc ferc has exclusive jurisdiction over the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce and the sale of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce.b.all rates and charges made,demanded,or received by any public utility for or in connection with such transmissions and sales shall be just and reasonable.a.any unjust and unreasonable sale is unlawful.ibid.if ferc determines that an unjust and unreasonable rate has been charged or paid,it can determine the just and reasonable rate and order the public utility to make refunds.
ferc jurisdiction is limited to public utilities.b e.confusingly,public utilities are essentially private sellers of energy.expressly exempted from ferc authority and jurisdiction are nonpublic utilities,such as governmental entities.f see also bonneville,supra,at.although not expressly exempted from ferc authority,cooperatives such as arizona that receive financing under the rural electrification act of rea are also outside of ferc jurisdiction dairyland power cooperative et fed.power com.wl dairyland.this rule is referred to as the dairyland exemption.
the ious file a complaint.
during california energy crisis,on august,the filed a complaint with ferc against sellers of electricity in the caliso and calpx markets.notice of the complaint was filed in the federal register.arizona formally intervened in the ferc proceeding in june.ferc opened an investigation into the justness and reasonableness of the rates and charges of public utilities that sell energy and ancillary services to or through the california iso and px and into whether the tariffs and institutional structures and bylaws of the california iso and px are adversely affecting the efficient operation of competitive wholesale electric power markets in california and need to be modified.san diego gas fed.energy reg.com,wl.after finding that california electrical market structure and rates were flawed san diego gas fed.energy reg.com,wl,ferc proposed price mitigation measures and refund liability and established a methodology for calculating refunds san diego gas fed.energy reg.com.wl.
ferc then issued an order on july,establishing the scope of and methodology for calculating refunds related to transactions in the spot markets operated by the caliso and calpx during october,through june,san diego gas fed.energy reg.com,wl.the order established a mitigated market clearing price,just and reasonable rates an unmanipulated market would have produced during the refund period.the order,however,did something more transactions subject to refunds included sales by nonpublic entities.ibid.the order thus encompassed all sellers of electricity,including sellers that were normally outside of ferc jurisdiction,namely,governmental entities and rural cooperatives arizona that received rea financing.
ferc explained its rationale for extending its jurisdiction the commission has determined that all sellers of energy in the california iso and px spot markets should be subject to refund liability for the period beginning october.we have decided to extend refund liability to public and utility sellers based on our review of the controlling law,the involvement of both types of sellers in the california centralized iso and px spot markets,and the equities of the situation.utility sellers as well as public utility sellers of electric energy in those california markets contributed to and benefitted from the dysfunctions that offered the possibilities for the market abuse under certain conditions,on which the call for refunds are based.in these circumstances,as discussed below,we conclude that although we do not have direct regulatory rate authority over power sales by utilities,we do have authority to order them to abide by the market rules we have established and to make refunds of unjust and unreasonable rates for sales pursuant to those market rules.san diego gas,supra,fed.energy reg.com.at.
ferc characterized itself as having jurisdiction over the subject matter of the affected sales,namely,wholesale sales of electric energy in interstate commerce through a and centralized clearinghouse that set a market clearing price for all wholesale seller participants,including utilities.exempting transactions involving utility sellers from refund scrutiny here would allow them to make such sales without regard to the just and reasonable standard that applies to the market clearing price administered san diego gas,supra,fed.energy reg.com.at.our action thus revises the market clearing prices that all market participants previously agreed to accept for their sales.in this context,we see no reason to treat nonpublic utility sellers differently,as they are receiving the same price,the just and reasonable market clearing price established pursuant to market rules approved by this commission,that they expected to obtain for their wholesale sales into the centralized iso and px spot markets.ibid.
arizona appeals ferc july,order to the ninth circuit court of.
arizona and governmental entities appealed to the ninth circuit,which reversed ferc july,order insofar as it found it had refund authority over wholesale electric energy sales made by governmental entities and nonpublic utilities,including arizona.bonneville,supra,at.after the court found that the fpa expressly limited ferc authority to investigate rates and order refunds from a public utility,the court considered the unique position of arizona.bonneville first noted that ferc had initially respected arizona historical status as a nonpublic entity ferc has,until its appellate brief in this proceeding,treated arizona as a utility.ferc has offered nothing in the record to support its change of position nor did its refund orders single out arizona for treatment as a public utility.we can not accept ferc rationalization for ordering refunds from arizona.consequently,in this proceeding we treat arizona as a utility but without prejudice to reclassification by ferc in a different proceeding.id.at,fn.omitted.bonneville therefore held that the retroactive imposition of a market price that effects a refund responsibility is a regulatory action that falls outside of ferc jurisdiction with respect to utilities and governmental utilities.id.at.
c.this state court action.
before filing the state court action,pacific gas electric company,southern california edison,and the california electricity oversight board filed,on march and,complaints in federal court,which were dismissed in march for lack of federal subject matter jurisdiction.pacific gas and arizona power coop.d.
the ious then filed,in april,this state court complaint containing causes of action for breach of contract,anticipatory breach of contract,unjust enrichment,money had and received,and through declaratory relief.the named defendants included arizona the ious sought to recover the amounts that each governmental entity including arizona received in excess of the lawful rates for its wholesale sales of electric power to the california ious in the cal iso and cal px markets.
arizona demurred to the complaint.in its demurrer,arizona pointed out that its exemption from ferc jurisdiction rested on agency doctrine rather than statute.arizona therefore argued that the ious could have asked ferc to revisit arizona exempt status,but it did not.by failing to ask for revocation of the dairyland exemption,the ious failed to exhaust their administrative remedies,arizona argued.the other defendants also filed a joint demurrer in which arizona joined.they raised arguments that the action was barred by the statute of limitations,failed to state a claim,and the parties lacked privity.
the trial court largely overruled the governmental entities joint demurrer finding,as to the statute of limitations,that the ious had properly pled equitable tolling and that factual issues had been raised which could not be resolved on demurrer the trial court,however,sustained arizona demurrer without leave to amend for failure to exhaust administrative remedies the amended judgment of dismissal was entered on april.this appeal followed

ii.exhaustion of administrative remedies.
arizona argument that the ious failed to exhaust their administrative remedies is premised on this the ious should have tried to revoke or to limit the dairyland exemption in the ferc proceedings.as we explain,we do not agree that any failure to challenge the dairyland exemption in the ferc proceedings constituted a failure to exhaust administrative remedies.
where an administrative remedy is provided by statute,relief must be sought from the administrative body and this remedy exhausted before the courts will act.abelleira district court of appeal cal d.exhaustion of administrative remedies is a jurisdictional prerequisite to resort to the courts.id.at johnson city of loma linda cal th.several rationales underlie the doctrine.its primary purpose is to afford administrative tribunals the opportunity to decide in a final way matters within their area of expertise prior to judicial review.citation.citizens for open government city of lodi th.exhaustion of administrative remedies also facilitates the development of a complete record that draws on administrative expertise and promotes judicial efficiency.ibid.the principal purposes of exhaustion requirements include avoidance of premature interruption of administrative processes,allowing an agency to develop the necessary factual background of the case,letting the agency apply its expertise and exercise its statutory discretion,and administrative efficiency and judicial economy.citation.the exhaustion doctrine is grounded on concerns favoring administrative autonomy,courts should not interfere with an agency determination until the agency has reached a final decision and judicial efficiency,overworked courts should decline to intervene in an administrative dispute unless absolutely necessary.citation.california water impact network newhall county water dist.th.
we do not see how the way in which the ious pursued arizona before ferc undermined the exhaustion of administrative remedies doctrine.arizona does not dispute that ferc power includes the exclusive authority to determine the reasonableness of wholesale rates.wholesale electricity antitrust cases i ii th.arizona thus agrees that the ious had to first file a proceeding before ferc,which is exactly what the ious did the ious were initially successful in obtaining refunds from arizona in that proceeding,although they suffered a reversal in bonneville.after bonneville,it then was clear that the ious could not seek a remedy against arizona from ferc.the ious therefore pursued a judicial remedy by filing this state court action.on these facts,the ious exhausted any administrative process they might have been required to pursue they sought a remedy from the agency having jurisdiction over rates and only sought judicial review after the ninth circuit ruled that the remedy was not available from the agency.
arizona,however,contends that the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies required something more of the ious the ious should have asked ferc to revoke or to limit the dairyland exemption.this contention,it seems to us,relies on a corollary principle to the doctrine that administrative remedies must be exhausted.that principle is a litigant must fully present its arguments and evidence at the administrative hearing.before seeking judicial review a party must show that he has made a full presentation to the administrative agency upon all issues of the case and at all prescribed stages of the administrative proceedings.edgren regents of university of california d.the requirement that a litigant present his or her arguments and evidence fully at the administrative hearing level is analogous to the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies,though it is based on different policies.cal.administrative mandamus laying the foundation at the administrative hearing ed,administrative mandamus.
the ious did not fail to satisfy any presentation requirement concerning arizona jurisdictional status in the ferc proceedings.to recap,a public entity was,in simplified terms,a private seller of energy.public entities were subject to ferc jurisdiction.a nonpublic entity,a government entity was not subject to ferc jurisdiction.arizona,a rural cooperative subject to a mortgage,was traditionally afforded nonpublic entity status,and thus was outside of ferc jurisdiction.that exempt status was first recognized in dairyland,supra,fed.power com.at page,where the commission noted that the record over the past years discloses not a single instance where commission jurisdiction over cooperatives was asserted.all the indications are to the contrary.we therefore conclude that such jurisdiction does not presently exist.a year after dairyland,a federal district court suggested that the status afforded cooperatives by dairyland might one day change if the commission had found that conditions in the power industry had so changed that generating cooperatives now did fall within its jurisdiction,this court would be faced with a different issue.for just as the commission determination here that it is without jurisdiction is entitled to judicial deference,so would be its determination that it had the requisite authority.salt river project agr.dist.federal power comm,fn.salt river.salt river thus suggested that perhaps ferc could one day exercise jurisdiction over a cooperative if changes in the industry occurred such that rural cooperatives should be considered public entities.there was,however,no need for the ious to challenge the continuing viability of dairyland.ferc found that it could order refunds from arizona under a theory having nothing to do with arizona traditional nonpublic entity status.the ious thus won in front of ferc without having to raise the jurisdictional issue 
even if we agreed that the ious had a duty to argue in the ferc proceedings that the dairyland exemption should be found inapplicable to arizona,that duty was satisfied.arizona jurisdictional or nonjurisdictional status was before ferc.on june,ferc issued an order prescribing mitigation directives against all sellers of electricity.san diego gas,supra,fed.energy reg.com.on july,arizona sought clarification rehearing aepco seeks clarification that the commission did not intend in its june decision to subject sellers located outside of california such as aepco to any possible refund proceedings or refunds for any sales prior to june.underlining in original,italics added.in apparent reference to dairyland,arizona noted that it was,under established precedent,not subject to the commission public utility jurisdiction.
ferc responded with its controversial july,order to arizona to pay refunds.that order can only be viewed as ferc attempt to get around dairyland by characterizing its jurisdiction over nonpublic utilities like arizona as deriving from its broad authority over rates.arizona then filed a request for rehearing of the july order.citing dairyland,arizona argued that it was not subject to ferc public utility jurisdiction accordingly,the commission was without authority to determine if arizona rates were not just and reasonable or to order a refund based on such a determination.thereafter,arizona again asked ferc to clarify whether its treatment of governmental entities extended to arizona for the purposes of an order ferc had issued on december.these events show that arizona jurisdictional status was at issue in the ferc proceedings.but rather than address dairyland head on,ferc tried to get around it by deriving its jurisdiction over arizona from its general authority over rates and from arizona participation in the regulated markets.
in any event,a failure on the part of the ious to challenge dairyland head on in the ferc proceedings might have been excusable.t he doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies has not hardened into inflexible dogma.citation.it contains its own exceptions,in re hudson th.those exceptions include when the administrative agency can not provide an adequate remedy when the subject of controversy lies outside the agency jurisdiction and where it would be futile to pursue a remedy.campbell regents of university of california cal th,unnamed physician board of trustees th.the ious could have reasonably concluded that attacking dairyland would be futile.at the time the ious initiated the ferc proceeding in,a rural cooperative had never been treated as an entity subject to ferc at least such an instance has not been brought to our attention by the parties.in fact,just two months before ferc issued its july,order,ferc affirmed,in an unrelated proceeding,that arizona was not subject to the commission jurisdiction.sierra southwest cooperative services,fed.energy reg.com.after bonneville,ferc found that arizona traditional nonpublic entity status should be maintained.san diego gas,supra,fed.energy reg.com.and the fpa has now codified dairyland no provision in this subchapter shall apply to,or be deemed to include,the united states,a state or any political subdivision of a state,an electric cooperative that receives financing under the rural electrification act of f.it therefore was unlikely that attacking dairyland would have been successful,notwithstanding bonneville suggestion that ferc perhaps could have revisited the status traditionally afforded arizona,had it done so not in a fashion.
instead,the manner in which the ious a proceeding before ferc in the first furthered the purposes of the doctrine of administrative remedies.it allowed ferc,which was uniquely situated and had expertise over the subject matter,to develop the record.it allowed ferc to promptly address problems in the market and to establish a methodology by which to reconfigure the rates.it also led to congressional confirmation that rural cooperatives,like arizona,were not subject to ferc jurisdiction.rather than inhibiting the purposes of the exhaustion doctrine,they were promoted.the demurrer therefore should not have been sustained on the ground that the ious failed to exhaust their administrative remedies.
iii.alternative grounds for sustaining demurrer.
arizona argues that there are alternative grounds on which the trial court order sustaining its demurrer could nonetheless be upheld a statute of limitations,b failure to state a claim,and c lack of privity 
statute of limitations and equitable tolling.
arizona contends that any limitations period expired before the ious filed this state court action the ious allege,however,that the limitations period was tolled,at a minimum,from the time the california p arties initiated refund proceedings at ferc on august,through the time the ninth circuit issued its decision in bonneville on september,and from march,through march,or from march,through march,while the claims alleged in the eastern district were pending.we begin by deciding whether equitable tolling applies because if it does,then we need not decide what limitations periods apply to the various causes of action and when they accrued.
the doctrine of equitable tolling is designed to prevent unjust and technical forfeitures of the right to a trial on the merits when the purpose of the statute of notice to the defendant of the plaintiff been satisfied.citation.mcdonald antelope valley community college dist.cal th,see also elkins derby cal d.in broad terms,the doctrine applies when an injured person has several legal remedies and reasonably and in good faith pursues one.mcdonald,at.it may apply where,for example,administrative remedies must be exhausted before a second action can proceed and where a first action,embarked upon in good faith,is found to be defective.ibid.
to invoke equitable tolling,a plaintiff must allege three elements timely notice to the defendant in filing the first claim lack of prejudice to defendant in gathering evidence to defend against the second claim and good faith and reasonable conduct by the plaintiff in filing the second claim.addison state of california cal d,collier city of pasadena d,collier.
timely notice to arizona.
this first prong of the doctrine requires the plaintiff to have filed his first claim within the statutory period.collier,supra,d at.this filing must have alerted the defendant in the second claim of the need to begin investigating the facts which form the basis of the second generally means that the defendants in the first and second claims are the same.ibid.
the complaint here alleges that the ious filed the first ferc august,while california energy crisis was ongoing.there is no dispute that this filing was timely.the dispute instead centers on whether arizona received notice of the ferc proceeding.arizona argues it lacked notice because the complaint filed before ferc was directed against only public entities,not nonpublic entities like arizona.
it may be true that there was some confusion in the ferc proceedings as to how rural cooperatives would be treated.that does not necessarily negate notice.rather,notice of the proceeding was published in the federal register.and,as alleged in the complaint,the ferc proceeding was against all sellers of energy and ancillary services into markets operated by the iso and px,and g overnmental e ntities,including arizona,were parties to the proceeding.arizona actively participated in the ferc proceeding by,for example,filing motions for clarification or rehearing in which it specifically raised the issue of its nonjurisdictional status.also,ferc july,order stated from the time the commission acted on the complaint,all sellers into those markets were on notice that those clearing prices,and the market rules that set the clearing prices,were subject to change if they were found to be unjust and unreasonable.san diego gas,supra,fed.energy reg.com.at.
these events suggest that arizona was alerted to the need to begin investigating facts forming the basis of the claims in this state court action,which,as we discuss below,are similar to the issues involved in the ferc proceeding.these allegations raise a dispute about notice that is not proper to resolve on a demurrer.see thompson california fair plan d,where facts concerning notice were undisputed,applicability of equitable tolling could be determined.
lack of prejudice to arizona.
this element essentially requires the facts underlying the two claims to be identical or at least so similar that the defendant investigation of the first claim will put him in a position to fairly defend the second the critical question is whether notice of the first claim affords the defendant an opportunity to identify the sources of evidence which might be needed to defend against the second claim.collier,supra,d at,fn.omitted.so long as the two claims are based on essentially the same set of facts,timely investigation of the first claim should put the defendant in position to appropriately defend the second.once he is in that position the defendant is adequately protected from stale claims and deteriorated evidence.in terms of the underlying policies of the statutes of limitation,it is irrelevant whether those two claims are alternative or parallel,consistent or inconsistent,compatible or incompatible.id.at.
arizona argues that the ious claim before ferc and their contractual claim here are so dissimilar as to cause prejudice to arizona to have to defend against this second action.arizona characterizes the issue before ferc as whether rates were just and reasonable in contrast,the claims here rest on alleged breach of contract.these claimed differences,however,do not render the claims in the ferc proceeding so dissimilar to the ones in this proceeding as to make the existence or lack of prejudice indisputable.rather,both proceedings arose out of the same energy markets in california,the same energy crisis of may to june,and the same rates that were imposed during that time.both proceedings address the same wrong whether sellers of energy received unjust and unreasonable rates.loehr ventura county community college dist.d,statute of limitations is not tolled while a plaintiff who has suffered several different wrongs pursues only one remedy as to one of those wrongs.both proceedings also seek the same remedy a return of any unjust and unreasonable rates.certainly,a contract claim may lead to defenses and relief inapplicable in the ferc proceedings,but this is not sufficient to definitively establish prejudice as a result of the delay in filing the second claim.
the ious good faith and reasonable conduct.
nor do we think there can be a finding at this stage in the proceedings that the ious lacked good faith and acted unreasonably in first pursuing a remedy from ferc.arizona suggests that the ious acted unreasonably by failing to raise the dairyland issue before ferc.while it might have been reasonable for the ious to have expressly raised it in the ferc proceedings,we can not say it was unreasonable for them not to do so.arizona does not dispute that ferc had jurisdiction over the market rates.and,as we have said,rural cooperatives have never been treated as public entities.ferc reaffirmed arizona status as a nonpublic entity just months before it issued the july,order and congress has recently amended the fpa to expressly exclude rural cooperatives from ferc jurisdiction.if the ious made an assessment not to challenge dairyland head on,the status of the law at the time the underlying events,as well as events since that time,demonstrate it was not a facially unreasonable one.a plaintiff seeming misanalysis of the facts or the law,particularly in a relatively esoteric area does not amount to the sort of bad faith found to thwart equitable tolling.that type of bad faith typically involves trifling with the courts or the other party.mojica wilshire,llc th.in fact,it might be hard to find the ious tactics before ferc unreasonable,given that they won in front of that entity,despite their later loss in the ninth circuit.
the timing of events similarly does not indicate bad faith.the ious filed the ferc proceeding in august,during the energy crisis.the ious then filed their federal court action approximately six months after their defeat in bonneville.when the federal district court dismissed their action in march,the ious filed this state court action one month later,in april.
we therefore conclude that the complaint sufficiently alleges equitable tolling.
failure to state a claim.
although bonneville found that ferc had improperly asserted jurisdiction over arizona,it nonetheless observed that the parties had entered into agreements with calpx and caliso obligating them to abide by the tariffs.bonneville,supra,at.the court noted that the focus on these agreements demonstrated that any remedy might lie in a contract claim.ibid.arizona,however,disagrees that the contract approach is viable.it distinguishes alliant energy nebraska public power dist.cir alliant,which bonneville cited to support its suggestion that a contract action might be feasible against governmental and nonpublic entities.
alliant involved area power pool mapp,an association of energy companies that included public utilities and cooperatives.alliant,supra,at.each party in alliant was a mapp member and a signatory to the enabling agreement,which set forth members contractual rights and obligations.the agreement obligated parties to accept modifications.ferc found that certain fees collected by mapp were discriminatory and ordered mapp to refund charges.ibid.some mapp members refused to refund the charges,causing some parties to the mapp agreement to sue each other for breach of contract.alliant found that this was permissible.the court said that when a contract provides that its terms are subject to a regulatory body,all parties to that contract are bound by the actions of the regulatory body as a result,we are not enforcing the ferc order instead,we are enforcing an agreement,which the parties freely entered.id.at.
arizona points out that there are many factual differences between the mapp agreement and the tariffs here.for example,alliant involved a pool agreement and express agreement to be bound by certain ferc orders.but the differences,while relevant,do not minimize alliant broader holding that where parties sign an agreement containing terms subject to a regulatory body,the parties may be subject to regulatory actions by that if the body can not directly,for example,order refunds from the parties.
the complaint here alleges facts showing that the parties entered into agreements subject to a regulatory body,ferc.for example,the complaint alleges that calpx and caliso were subject to ferc exclusive regulatory jurisdiction.all sales and purchases in the calpx and caliso markets were made under tariffs filed with and approved by ferc and that prescribe the terms and conditions of all transactions in the markets.arizona voluntarily bought or sold electric power in the calpx and caliso markets.each market participant,including arizona,was required to execute a participation agreement or scheduling coordinator agreement under which it agreed to abide by the tariff.for the purposes of withstanding a demurrer,these allegations are sufficient to show that the broad principle enunciated in alliant might apply 
arizona makes a related claim that the ious own breaches of the alleged contracts bars any recovery.specifically,arizona argues that the ious did not perform their obligations under the contracts because they failed to maintain their creditworthiness became ineligible to purchase power through calpx and caliso,became insolvent,and underscheduled load.these alleged performance issues are clearly fraught with factual issues rendering them unresolvable on demurrer.
lack of privity 
arizona final argument why the causes of action should be dismissed is that there was no contractual privity between it and the ious.the ious respond that privity existed either under a beneficiary theory or a contract theory.
the notion that a contract can be made to benefit a third party who is not a signatory to the contract is in california law.the beneficiary need not be named or identified in the contract.spinks equity residential briarwood apartments th,spinks.rather,whether a third party has rights under a contract depends on the contracting parties intent to benefit that third party.garcia truck ins.exchange cal d.whether a third party was an intended beneficiary is to be determined from the contract as a whole in light of the circumstances under which it was entered.bancomer,superior court th,garcia,at spinks,at in determining intent to benefit a third party,the contracting parties practical construction of a contract,as shown by their actions,is important evidence of their intent.
in contrast to a contract made to benefit a third party,a contract is a more amorphous concept.the ious cite gear webster d,as one example of a contract under which members were allowed to bring an action against each other.in gear,a real estate salesperson and broker were members of a board of realtors,a voluntary association governed by bylaws requiring members to arbitrate any disputes.id.at.when a dispute arose over a commission,the court held that,by agreeing to abide by the bylaws,the members were bound by the arbitration provision.
arizona counters with stoops abbassi th,as an example of a contract under which members could not sue each other.stoops was a member of an cooperative that created a trust fund,funded by member contributions,to cover malpractice lawsuits.id.at.when members failed to pay assessments into the fund,stoops was unable to receive defense or indemnification costs from the trust for a malpractice suit he faced.he tried to sue other members directly to recover funds he spent in connection with the lawsuit.we held that stoops,as a member of the cooperative,could not sue other members directly to collect unpaid assessments.id.at.that holding,however,was based on the statutes governing the type of arrangement at issue,and,in particular,the power vested in the cooperative not in its pursue assessments.id.at stoops is bound by the contract he signed and by the statutory authority from which the cooperative was formed.
the unique facts of this case do not fit neatly into either gear or stoops,neither of which describe the universe of contracts that might exist.the structure of the energy markets created unique relationships and the energy crisis created a unique situation.a liberal view of the complaint allegations,however,shows that privity might be shown to exist between the parties under either a third party or a contract theory.those allegations are that the ious and arizona entered into direct agreements with calpx and caliso,as neutral clearinghouses acting essentially as nonprofit auction houses pairing buyers and sellers of energy.each participant in the calpx market agreed to abide by and perform all of the obligations under the cal px tariff in respect of all matters set forth therein including,without limitation,all matters relating to the trading of energy by it through the cal px markets and billing and payments.the complaint also alleges terms in the agreements which can be interpreted to support actions by one participant against another 
the cal iso will not act as a principal but as agent for scheduling coordinators 
t he cal px will not be,and shall not be deemed to be,a counterparty to any trade transacted through the cal px markets 
a market participant who fails or refuses to pay its bill becomes responsible for a market shortfall,and is deemed a cal iso debtor or a cal px creditor.an entity that is owed money because of the market shortfalls is deemed a cal iso creditor or cal px creditor,with the right to enforce its contractual right to payment against a cal iso or cal px debtor 
t o ensure that market participants are financially capable of satisfying obligations running to each other from these transactions,the cal iso a
