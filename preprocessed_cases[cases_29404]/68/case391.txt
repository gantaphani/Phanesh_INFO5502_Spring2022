fpl energy marcus hook marcus hook petitions for review of a federal energy regulatory commission ferc or the commission order denying a request for a reallocation and redetermination of marcus hook cost responsibility for a construction upgrade resulting from its request to interconnect with an electricity transmission grid.marcus hook also petitions for review of ferc order denying its request for rehearing.because we find that ferc did not adequately explain its decision on the upgrade system benefit,we grant the petition for review,partially vacate the orders,and remand for further proceedings.
formed in in the region,intervenor pjm interconnection pjm has operated since as a tight power pool,having a single control area with transmission lines.see atl.city ferc.in,ferc initiated sweeping changes in the electric utility industry,which led pjm to reorganize itself in as an independent system operator iso.pub.power agency ferc.adhering to ferc regulations for isos,pjm adopted a open access tariff and a regional energy market in.id.at.
further changes in led ferc to designate pjm as the first regional transmission organization rto.pjm interconnection,llc,ferc,order on reh g,ferc,order on reh g,ferc,order on reh g,ferc,reh g pending.as an rto,pjm acts as an umbrella entit y that controls electricity transmission assets.pub.power,at.under ferc new regime,plants can interconnect with transmission lines owned by rtos and then sell energy to one result favorable to competition.as administrative entities,rtos and isos like pjm must handle the interconnections of new electricity generating facilities lying within the geography of their members.pjm responsibilities included the interconnection of petitioner,whose project resides within the service area of peco energy company,a member of pjm.the marcus hook combined cycle,electric generating facility in marcus hook,service in late.
the open access tariff provides the terms and conditions for all such interconnections under pjm purview.the process begins when a new generating facility first approaches pjm and submits an interconnection request.that request must describe the new facility size and location,among other things.tariff section.pjm then places all such requests into a,queue.tariff section.
the tariff requires pjm to undertake several studies of the queued projects.the first is a feasibility study,which preliminarily determines what system upgrades are necessary to accommodate the new interconnection.tariff section.from this study,pjm must estimate the requesting party cost responsibility for the upgrades.following the feasibility study,pjm must conduct a system impact study,which refines and more comprehensively estimates cost responsibility for necessary system upgrades.tariff section.defined as a comprehensive regional analysis of the effect of a new interconnection,a single impact study may include an evaluation of multiple interconnection requests.id.customers may terminate or withdraw their interconnection requests based on the impact study findings.pjm then conducts a final facilities study on the remaining customers and allocates good faith estimates of cost responsibility among them.tariff section.upon completion of the facilities study,pjm tenders to the interconnection customer an interconnection service agreement isa,which specifies the customer actual cost responsibility.tariff sections.
all cost figures produced by pjm studies must comply with section.interconnection customers must pay for all necessary attachment facilities.tariff section.in addition,section imposes on the interconnection customer percent of the costs of the minimum amount of upgrades necessary to accommodate its generation interconnection request and that would not have been incurred under the regional transmission expansion plan but for such generation interconnection request,net of benefits resulting from the construction of the upgrades pjm prepares regional transmission expansion plans rteps,which forecast the enhancement and expansion of the transmission system in order to meet the demands for firm transmission service in the pjm region.tariff section a see also pjm interconnection llc,ferc.the costs and benefits listed in section include costs and benefits associated with accelerating,deferring,or eliminating planned upgrades,upgrades resulting from modifications to the rtep,and other upgrades that never become part of an rtep.
interconnecting facilities must meet milestones in order to maintain their place within the queue.tariff section a see also id.section.failure to meet a milestone or execute an isa could trigger termination and withdrawal of the project.tariff section c.because the tariff allows pjm to evaluate multiple interconnection requests in a single study,withdrawal of one request could affect the cost responsibility of other interconnection customers.indeed,following a withdrawal,the tariff directs pjm to reevaluate upgrades previously deemed necessary by a facilities study that had evaluated multiple projects.id.the tariff also directs pjm to redetermine cost responsibility for,and enter into an amended isa with,customers remaining in the queue.
following these tariff procedures for facilities interconnection,marcus hook submitted an interconnection request to pjm,which placed the project in queue position with a queue date of august.it submitted another small request to pjm on october,which received a queue position of.pjm conducted the required feasibility,impact,and facilities studies for marcus hook request.
the facilities study,most important for this case,evaluated the combined effect of marcus hook project and two other projects,queued with earlier priority at and.according to the study,sufficient system capacity existed to support the project,but the addition of and would push the system beyond the breaking point.to alleviate the capacity burden,pjm advised an upgrade to the circuit.towers along that circuit had been built with a single transmission line but included unused positions for a second line filling the open positions with a new transmission line would support the new interconnections,including marcus hook.by recommending the upgrade,the facilities study revised the prior studies.
pjm estimated the cost of the upgrade at nearly million.because the upgrade was unnecessary at the time of the request,that project escaped cost responsibility entirely.pjm therefore assigned the costs to the projects,and marcus hook.on january,pjm and marcus hook entered into an isa,which saddled marcus hook with over million of the upgrade total cost.the balance fell to the project.
had the interconnections proceeded as forecasted in pjm studies,this action would not have been brought.but,alas,the plans of mice and rtos often go awry,and project withdrew from the queue prematurely.the withdrawal presented pjm with an unexpected question whether to complete the upgrade.pjm studies of multiple interconnection requests had shown that the transmission system could support projects and without the upgrade.scrapping the upgrade would therefore not harm the remaining projects.economic concerns operated on the other side of the coin,however.at the time of withdrawal,the upgrade was over ninety percent complete removing the largely completed upgrade would not be an inexpensive undertaking.judging completion to be the least costly alternative,pjm trudged forward and completed the upgrade.
marcus hook disputed its cost responsibility for what it considered to be an unnecessary project.claiming that pjm had infringed sections c and of its tariff,marcus hook filed a complaint with ferc.as a remedy,marcus hook sought recompense from pjm for over million,the sum total of its payments in support of the upgrade.to obtain its relief,marcus hook asked ferc to direct pjm to draw up a new,revised isa with reduced cost responsibility for marcus hook.the complaint suggested that a favorable ruling would also require pjm to refund the difference between the original and amended isas,which marcus hook argued should be the entirety of the payments already made.
marcus hook grounded its grounds its petition for t
