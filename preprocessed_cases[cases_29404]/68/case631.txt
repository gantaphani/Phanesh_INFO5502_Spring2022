in january,in an exercise of his powers under the california emergency services act et sometimes the act,former governor gray davis proclaimed a state of emergency in california based on shortages of electricity that he found were causing blackouts affecting millions of californians.nearly two years later,plaintiffs the national committee,lewis uhler,and senator ray haynes commenced this mandamus proceeding to compel the governor to proclaim an end to the state of emergency because,according to them,california is no longer in the midst of a power crisis.the trial court sustained the governor demurrer without leave to amend,concluding it was for the governor or the legislature,not the courts,to decide whether there was still an energy shortage justifying a state of emergency.
plaintiffs appealed from the resulting judgment in favor of the governor.while the appeal was pending,however,former governor davis proclaimed an end to the state of emergency.as a result,the parties have filed a stipulation requesting that we dismiss the appeal.
we agree with the parties that because the state of emergency has already been terminated,plaintiffs petition for a writ of mandate directing the governor to take that action is moot,and the appeal should be dismissed.nevertheless,because we believe this case presents an issue of continuing public interest,we will exercise our inherent discretion to decide that issue.
on review,we conclude the trial court erred in sustaining the demurrer.although the act implicitly gives the governor discretion to determine when conditions warrant the termination of a state of emergency he has proclaimed under the act,under california law a writ of mandate will lie to correct an abuse of that discretion.
neither the separation of powers doctrine nor the political question doctrine precludes the trial court from exercising its power under code of civil procedure section to correct abuses of discretion by public officers like the governor.in addition,the governor is not immune from a properly issued writ of mandate under the immunity provision in the act.
it may be a rare case in which a plaintiff will be able to prove the governor has unreasonably exercised his discretion in refusing to terminate a state of emergency.nevertheless,the courthouse door is,and must remain,open to a plaintiff claiming such an abuse of discretion by the governor.accordingly,the trial court erred in sustaining the governor demurrer.because this case is now moot,however,we will dismiss the appeal pursuant to the stipulation of the parties.
factual and procedural background 
under the california emergency services act,the governor is empowered to proclaim a state of emergency when he finds that certain conditions exist,subd.b,subds.a,c.the act further provides the governor shall proclaim the termination of a state of emergency at the earliest possible date that conditions warrant.all of the powers granted the governor by this chapter with respect to a state of emergency shall terminate when the state of emergency has been terminated by proclamation of the governor or by concurrent resolution of the legislature declaring it at an end.
on january,pursuant to his powers under the act,former governor davis proclaimed a state of emergency to exist based on the following findings 
s hortages of electricity available to california utilities have today resulted in blackouts affecting millions of californians and 
u nanticipated and dramatic increases in the price of electricity have threatened the solvency of california major public utilities,preventing them from continuing to acquire and provide electricity sufficient to meet california energy needs and 
t he california public utilities commission,the independent systems operator and the electricity oversight board have advised that the electricity presently available from california s utilities is insufficient to prevent widespread and prolonged disruption of electric service within california and 
t his energy shortage requires extraordinary measures beyond the authority vested in the california public utilities commission and 
t he imminent threat of widespread and prolonged disruption of electrical power to california emergency services,law enforcement,schools,hospitals,homes,businesses and agriculture constitutes a condition of extreme peril to the safety of persons and property within the state which,by reason of its magnitude,is likely to be beyond the control of the services,personnel,equipment,and facilities of any single county or city 
in an exercise of his emergency powers,former governor davis then ordered the department of water resources the department to enter into contracts and arrangements for the purchase and sale of electric power with public and private entities and individuals as may be necessary to assist in mitigating the effects of this emergency.in connection with this order,the governor suspended the provisions of the government code and the public contract code applicable to state contracts,including but not limited to,advertising and competitive bidding requirements.
on june,uhler,the president of the national committee,wrote to the governor and asked that he proclaim the termination of his emergency powers immediately because t he energy crisis has long since subsided.the governor refused to do so.
accordingly,on october,plaintiffs filed a petition for a writ of mandate against the governor and the department,alleging that california is no longer in the midst of a power crisis and the governor is mandated to terminate his emergency powers,relating thereto,as a matter of law.plaintiffs requested a writ of mandate requiring the governor to terminate his declaration of an energy emergency and the exercise of all powers flowing therefrom,including,but not limited to,the purchase of electricity or the negotiation of contracts therefore.
the governor demurred to the petition see code civ,arguing,among other things,that the complaint did not state a cause of action because the act provides for termination of a state of emergency only by the governor or the legislature,and therefore the court was barred by the separation of powers doctrine cal,art.iii,from granting the requested relief the trial court agreed,stating that this is not the type of case that is appropriate for judicial review i t is a legislative or a decision of the governor as to whether or not there is still an emergency situation due to an energy shortage.
accordingly,the trial court sustained the governor demurrer without leave to amend and entered judgment in the governor favor.this timely appeal followed.
discussion 
on november,less than two weeks before oral argument in this court,former governor davis issued a proclamation declaring an end to the state of emergency he had first declared in january.as a result,the parties have filed a stipulation to dismiss the appeal.
under rule c of the california rules of court,after the record on appeal has been filed we have discretion whether to dismiss an appeal on the stipulation of the parties.furthermore,i n a proceeding that may otherwise be deemed moot we have discretion to resolve an issue of continuing public interest that is likely to recur in other cases daly superior court cal d.
whether the california courts have the power to direct the governor to terminate a state of emergency he has proclaimed under the act is a quintessential issue of continuing public interest that we believe is likely to recur.accordingly,while the case before us is moot,and we will dismiss the appeal on that basis,we nonetheless exercise our inherent authority to decide the important issues the case presents before doing so.see people west coast shows,d.

the california emergency services act 
the california emergency services act recognizes and responds to a fundamental role of government to provide broad state services in the event of emergencies resulting from conditions of disaster or of extreme peril to life,property,and the resources of the state.its purpose is to protect and preserve health,safety,life,and property.et a state of emergency may be proclaimed by the governor under the conditions proscribed for any area affected.the act confers broad powers on the governor to deal with emergencies.
for example,during a state of emergency,the governor may suspend any regulatory statute or statute proscribing the procedure for conduct of state business,or suspend the orders,rules or regulations of any state agency,if these would prevent,hinder or delay the mitigation of the effects of the emergency.the governor may command or utilize private property or personnel deemed by him necessary in carrying out his responsibilities,paying for its reasonable value.the state is not liable for any claim based upon discretionary functions.the governor is empowered to make expenditure from any fund legally available to deal with the conditions of a state of emergency.martin municipal court d.
the governor power to proclaim a state of emergency emanates from section,which provides the governor is hereby empowered to proclaim a state of emergency in an area affected or likely to be affected thereby when a he finds that circumstances described in subdivision b of section exist and either b he is requested to do so in the case of a city by the mayor or chief executive,in the case of a county by the chairman of the board of supervisors or the county administrative officer or c he finds that local authority is inadequate to cope with the emergency.
subdivision b of section provides state of emergency means the duly proclaimed existence of conditions of disaster or of extreme peril to the safety of persons and property within the state caused by such conditions as air pollution,fire,flood,storm,epidemic,riot,drought,sudden and severe energy shortage,plant or animal infestation or disease,the governor warning of an earthquake or volcanic prediction,or an earthquake,complications resulting from the year problem,or other conditions,other than conditions resulting from a labor controversy or conditions causing a state of war emergency,which,by reason of their magnitude,are or are likely to be beyond the control of the services,personnel,equipment,and facilities of any single county,city and county,or city and require the combined forces of a mutual aid region or regions to combat,or with respect to regulated energy utilities,a sudden and severe energy shortage requires extraordinary measures beyond the authority vested in the california public utilities commission.
a sudden and severe energy shortage is defined as a rapid,unforeseen shortage of energy,resulting from,but not limited to,events such as an embargo,sabotage,the year problem,or natural disasters,subd.h.
under the foregoing provisions,the governor has the power to proclaim a state of emergency when he finds that a rapid,unforeseen shortage of energy has caused the existence of conditions of disaster or of extreme peril to the safety of persons and property within the state that the energy shortage requires extraordinary measures beyond the authority vested in the california public utilities commission and that local authority is inadequate to cope with the emergency.
in his proclamation of a state of emergency,t he governor must state the circumstances of the emergency found to exist and that the emergency is found to be beyond local control measures citation.martin municipal court,supra,d at.
the petition in this case does not allege the governor proclamation of a state of emergency failed to satisfy the foregoing requirements of the act.thus,we must presume the governor acted within his powers under the act in proclaiming a state of emergency based on the conditions that existed in january.the question here is whether,under the conditions alleged to exist nearly two years later,when the petition was filed,the governor had a duty that could be enforced by a writ of mandate to terminate the state of emergency pursuant to section.we turn now to that question.
under the proper circumstances,the governor can be compelled by a writ of mandate to terminate a state of emergency proclaimed under the act 
we begin with the legal principles governing the issuance of a writ of mandate.
a writ of mandate may be issued by any court to any person,to compel the performance of an act which the law specially enjoins,as a duty resulting from an office,trust,or station,code civ,subd.a.it has often been said that two basic requirements are essential to the issuance of the writ a clear,present and usually ministerial duty upon the part of the respondent citations and a clear,present and beneficial right in the petitioner to the performance of that duty citation.superior court d.however,a writ of mandate will also lie to correct an abuse of discretion by a public officer.fair fountain valley school dist.d.
m andamus or any other appropriate writ may issue against the governor under proper circumstances.olson d.as just one example,i t is the duty of the governor to execute a land patent,and a mandamus will issue to compel him to execute it,in case of his refusal,if the statute regulating the sales of such lands has been complied with by the several officers and the purchaser,and the land was subject to sale by the state.middleton low cal.
the parties here have focused on the ministerial duty aspect of mandamus law.the governor contends a writ of mandate is unavailable here because the decision to terminate a declared emergency can not be viewed as ministerial.plaintiffs,on the other hand,contend the governor has a mandatory duty to terminate the state of emergency under section because there is no power crisis.
a ministerial act is an act that a public officer is required to perform in a prescribed manner in obedience to the mandate of legal authority and without regard to his own judgment or opinion concerning such act propriety or impropriety,when a given state of facts exists.discretion,on the other hand,is the power conferred on public functionaries to act officially according to the dictates of their own judgment.rodriguez solis th,d.stated otherwise,a ministerial act is an act with respect to the performance of which a public officer can exercise no act or duty prescribed by some existing law that makes it incumbent on him to perform precisely as laid down by the law.citations.in short,where a statute requires an officer to do a prescribed act on a prescribed contingency,his functions are ministerial.people ex rel.fund american companies california ins.d.
as noted above,section requires the governor to proclaim the termination of a state of emergency at the earliest possible date that conditions warrant.italics added.in their petition,plaintiffs alleged that p resent conditions warrant termination of the governor emergency powers because california is no longer in the midst of a power crisis.they contend that because all of the complaint facts must be taken as true,we must assume for purposes of the demurrer there is no power crisis,and therefore the governor has a ministerial duty to proclaim an end to the state of emergency under section.
we agree with plaintiffs that if their allegations were proven true,the governor could be compelled by a writ of mandate to end the state of emergency,although not exactly for the reasons stated by plaintiffs.as we explain more fully below,if plaintiffs could prove there is no longer a power crisis,then the only reasonable choice for the governor to make would be to determine that conditions warrant termination of the state of emergency.under those circumstances,his refusal to make that choice would be an abuse of discretion that could be corrected by a writ of mandate.
as we have noted,section gives the governor the power to proclaim a state of emergency when he finds that certain conditions exist.undoubtedly,the governor exercises his discretion in determining whether the requisite conditions exist,whether there is an energy shortage,whether that shortage has resulted in conditions of disaster or extreme peril to the safety of persons and property within the state.plaintiffs do not contend otherwise.
it follows,as a matter of parity,that the governor likewise is entitled to exercise his discretion in later determining whether and when conditions warrant termination of the state of emergency under section example,because one or more of the conditions prerequisite to declaring the state of emergency in the first place has ceased to exist.in other words,the governor duty to terminate a proclaimed state of emergency under section arises only when the governor has determined that conditions warrant termination of the state of emergency.that foundational determination is committed to the sound discretion and judgment of the governor under the act.
arguing that mandamus can not lie to control an exercise of discretion,to compel an official to exercise discretion in a particular manner,the governor contends his authority to declare the end of a state of emergency can not be controlled by a writ of mandate because he has the discretion to determine when conditions warrant termination of the state of emergency.
the flaw in that argument is that it ignores a crucial qualification to the legal principle upon which it is based.as our supreme court explained more than years ago there are innumerable cases in which it has been laid down that mandamus can not issue to control discretion.the is undoubtedly correct when properly been expressed in various forms.it has been repeatedly said that the writ can not perform the functions of a writ of error that it can not issue to revise judicial action,but can only compel the performance of ministerial functions and that it will issue to compel a tribunal to act in some way,but not in any particular way.these formulas undoubtedly express a truth,but they express it in an inaccurate and misleading manner and by reasoning from them as if literally and in all cases true,courts have sometimes been led into error,and have frequently been forced to call acts ministerial which are plainly not so.an examination of the authorities will demonstrate the inaccuracy of the above phrases.thus it is not accurate to say that the writ will not issue to control discretion for it is well settled that it may issue to correct an abuse of discretion,if the case is otherwise proper.wood strother cal.
it is the general rule that the writ of mandamus may not be employed to compel a public officer possessing discretionary power to act in a particular way.the court in such a proceeding may compel him to act,but it may not substitute its discretion for the discretion vested in such officer it is a familiar rule governing the issuance of the writ of mandate that an officer in whom public duties are confided by law is not subject to the control of the courts in the exercise of the judgment and discretion which the law reposes in him as a part of his official functions.mandamus may not compel the exercise of such discretion in any particular manner it may only direct that the officer act,and must leave the matter as to what action he will take to his determination.citation.an important exception to the foregoing general rule is that if the facts as admitted or proved be susceptible of but one construction or conclusion the right to the writ becomes a matter of law and the officer may be compelled to act in accordance with the facts as admitted or established citations.bank of italy johnson cal.
where a statute leaves room for discretion,a challenger must show the official acted arbitrarily,beyond the bounds of reason or in derogation of the applicable legal standards.citation.where only one choice can be a reasonable exercise of discretion,a court may compel an official to make that choice.california correctional supervisors organization,department of corrections th,d.
it follows from the foregoing authorities that while the governor may have no ministerial duty to terminate a state of emergency under section until he determines,in the exercise of his discretion,that conditions warrant such an action,mandamus will lie to correct an abuse of discretion by the governor in making that foundational determination.if,under the facts,the only choice that would be a reasonable exercise of the governor discretion would be to determine that conditions warrant termination of the state of emergency,then a writ of mandate can compel him to make that choice.the writ could also compel the governor to perform his resulting ministerial duty to proclaim the termination of the state of emergency because conditions warrant.
under the foregoing analysis,the question here is whether,based on the facts plaintiffs alleged in their petition,the only reasonable choice before the governor was to determine that conditions warrant terminating the state of emergency.we conclude the answer to that question is yes.
in passing upon the sufficiency of a pleading,its allegations must be liberally construed with a view to substantial justice between the parties.marin jacuzzi d.see also code civ.here,plaintiffs alleged that california is no longer in the midst of a power crisis.
liberally construed,that allegation can be understood to mean there is no longer an energy shortage,and no longer any conditions of disaster or of extreme peril to the safety of persons and property within the state resulting from the previously existing shortage.if that is we must assume it is for present one of the requisite conditions for declaring the state of emergency in the first place has ceased to exist,and it would be an unreasonable exercise of discretion for the governor to make any choice other than to determine that conditions now warrant termination of the state of emergency he proclaimed based on the energy shortage.under these circumstances,a writ of mandate will lie to compel the governor to make that foundational determination,which would then require him to terminate the state of emergency under section.
in support of his argument that deciding whether to terminate a state of emergency is a pure decision that can not be controlled by mandamus,the governor cites a number of tort cases arising out of actions taken under the authority of the act.see macias state of california cal th,d,suit against malathion manufacturers and distributors relating to state of emergency based on periodic infestations of mediterranean fruit fly soto state of california th,d suit by public employee injured while participating in a training exercise conducted pursuant to the act labadie state of california d.action for negligent misrepresentation by resident abnormally sensitive to malathion sprayed during state of emergency farmers ins.exchange state of california d.suit against state by insurance companies for damage caused to insured automobiles by malathion spraying susman city of los angeles d.action for riot damage against a city and state.
these cases are inapposite because they primarily deal with the unrelated question of immunity from tort liability based on discretionary decisions made in responding to a state of emergency.none of these cases involved the question of whether or when a writ of mandate can issue to correct an abuse of discretion by the governor under the act.moreover,as plaintiffs point out,these cases deal with the implementation of emergency measures,following the declaration of a state of emergency and do not address the core issue here of whether a governor can continue to exercise emergency powers where no emergency exists at all.
the separation of powers doctrine does not preclude the court from compelling the governor to terminate a state of emergency proclaimed under the act 
as he did in the trial court,the governor argues this proceeding is barred by the separation of powers doctrine because it plainly and fatally intrudes upon the powers of the executive and legislative branches.we disagree.
the separation of powers doctrine is expressed in section of article iii of the california constitution,which provides the powers of state government are legislative,executive,and judicial.persons charged with the exercise of one power may not exercise either of the others except as permitted by this constitution.
as previously noted,section expressly provides that a state of emergency may be terminated by a proclamation of the governor or by a concurrent resolution of the legislature.the governor contends this aspect of section implicates the separation of powers doctrine because,with respect to terminating a declared state of emergency,the legislature has specifically provided that only our executive and legislative branches have the power to do so.in other words,according to the governor,issuance of a writ of mandate in this case would constitute an unconstitutional usurpation of executive legislative authority by the judicial branch.
while it is true section provides for termination of a state of emergency only by the governor or the legislature,it does not follow that in enacting this statute the legislature intended to deprive the judicial branch of its traditional and power to issue writs of mandate in appropriate circumstances.as we have noted,it has long been true that the governor may be the subject of a writ of mandate if the requirements for issuance of the writ are met.middleton low,supra,cal.at olson,supra,d at.these decisions are based on the fundamental principle that under our system of government no man is above the law.chief justice stephen field,speaking for the court in the early case of mccauley brooks cal,stated that where no discretion exists and a specific legal duty is imposed,ministerial in its character,an officer of the executive department of government,like any other citizen,is subject to judicial process and that,if this were not so,the government would cease to deserve the high appellation of being a government of laws.jenkins knight cal d.
although chief justice field specifically referred in mccauley to the ministerial duty aspect of mandamus law,the governor cites no authority,and we have found none ourselves,to suggest the same considerations do not also apply when a writ of mandate is sought to correct an alleged abuse of discretion by the governor.it has long been the law of california that w here only one choice can be a reasonable exercise of discretion,a court may compel an official to make that choice by writ of mandate.california correctional supervisors organization,department of corrections,supra,th at,d.there is nothing to indicate the legislature intended to vitiate this judicial power when it enacted section.
it has also long been the law of california that mandamus will not lie to compel the legislature to enact any legislation.city of sacramento california state legislature d,italics added.thus,the governor is correct when he argues that the courts could not command the legislature to adopt a concurrent resolution under section declaring an end to the state of emergency.
contrary to the governor position,however,it does not follow that because a writ of mandate will not lie to compel the legislature to terminate a state of emergency,it also will not lie to compel the governor to do so.as we have shown,the power of the courts,under proper circumstances,to direct the governor to perform a specific act by writ of mandate is.accordingly,the governor separation of powers argument fails.
the political question doctrine does not preclude the court from compelling the governor to terminate a state of emergency proclaimed under the act 
in a variation on his separation of powers argument,the governor contends this case is not justiciable under the political question doctrine.again,we disagree.
t he political question rule relates to the appropriate role of the judiciary in a tripartite system of government.courts perform the judicial function,that is,they resolve cases and controversies before them and,in the process,interpret and apply the laws.citation.in doing so the courts may not usurp the governmental functions of the legislative and executive branches,and usurpation includes unwarranted intrusion into the roles of those branches.thus it has been said the political question doctrine excludes from judicial review those controversies which revolve around policy choices and value determinations constitutionally committed for resolution to the legislative and executive branches.schabarum california legislature th,d,quoting japan whaling american cetacean soc,d.
the political question rule has two general applications or effects,one that is broad and commonly applied but rarely articulated as such,and one that is narrow but rarely applicable.schabarum california legislature,supra,th at,d.the governor argument which we have rejected already on the facts alleged here that he can not be compelled to exercise his discretion in a particular manner invoked one of the broad applications of the political question rule.see id.at,d noting that the political question concept is the policy behind such frequently identified and applied judicial standards as the refusal to employ judicial remedies to compel the exercise of discretion in a particular manner.
the argument we now confront invokes the narrow application of the rule.in its narrow sense the political question rule relates to the dismissal of lawsuits without reaching the merits of the dispute.the rule compels dismissal of a lawsuit when complete deference to the role of the legislative or executive branch is required and there is nothing upon which a court can adjudicate without impermissibly intruding upon the authority of another branch of government.schabarum california legislature,supra,th at,d.
in baker carr,d,the united states supreme court surveyed a number of its political question cases in order to expose the attributes of the which,in various settings,diverge,combine,appear,and disappear in seeming disorderliness.id.at.in an passage,the supreme court summarized the results of its survey as follows it is apparent that several formulations which vary slightly according to the settings in which the questions arise may describe a political question,although each has one or more elements which identify it as essentially a function of the separation of powers.prominent on the surface of any case held to involve a political question is found a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department or a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it or the impossibility of deciding without an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion or the impossibility of a court undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack of the respect due coordinate branches of government or an unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made or the potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments on one question.id.at.
here,the governor relies on two of the formulations from baker in arguing this case presents a nonjusticiable political question.he contends there are no judicial standards for resolving whether conditions warrant the termination of the emergency proclamation and it would be impossible to decide that issue without making several policy that require balancing myriad factors.
not so.there are judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving whether the governor has abused his discretion in refusing to find that conditions warrant termination of the state of emergency he first proclaimed in january.those standards are found in the act particular,in the circumstances described in subdivision b of section,which,under subdivision a of section,the governor had to find existed before he proclaimed the state of emergency in the first place.
as we have previously
