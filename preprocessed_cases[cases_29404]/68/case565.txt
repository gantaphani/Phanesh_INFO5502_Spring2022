sn sands corporation doing business as s s trucking s s challenges the jurisdiction of the board of supervisors the board of the city and county of san francisco the city to disapprove the entry of a contract by the city public utilities commission puc that was conditionally awarded to s s through a competitive bidding process.the board jurisdiction is governed by a provision of the city charter requiring the board to approve contracts with anticipated expenditures of million or more.the parties disagree about the proper interpretation of this provision where,as here,the contract is not for a fixed dollar amount,and they dispute whether the anticipated expenses under the proposed contract with s s meet the million threshold.we agree with s s and the trial court that the anticipated cost of a proposed contract must be based on probable expenditures for which there is evidentiary support,and that the board assumed jurisdiction in this case without any such support and contrary to the only evidence that was before it.moreover,as the trial court also concluded,the additional evidence presented by the city also fails to show that the expenditures to be anticipated over the term of the contract will equal or exceed million.therefore,we shall affirm the trial court order directing the city to award the contract to s 
background 
the charter 
the authority of the city to contract for services is governed by its charter.in general,the office of contract administration oca under the supervision of the city administrator is authorized to a ward contracts without interference from the mayor or the board of supervisors.charter,art.iii,see also charter,art.ii,neither the board,its committees,nor any of its members,shall have any power or authority,nor shall they dictate,suggest or interfere with respect to any contract or requisition for purchase or other administrative actions or recommendations of the city administrator or of department heads under the city administrator or under the respective boards and commissions.however,a contract extending more than years or requiring anticipated expenditures by the city of million dollars is subject to approval of the board,art.ix,subd.b section.accordingly,prior to awarding any contract,the oca must determine whether the anticipated expenditures under the contract are million or more and if so,submit a resolution to the board for approval of the contract.when a contract is submitted to the board for approval,the board must independently determine the anticipated expenditures under the contract and act on the resolution only if it determines that the contract expenses are anticipated to equal or exceed million.peery superior court d.the issue of subject matter jurisdiction is impliedly determined in every proceeding,in that the court rendering a decree must pass on and determine its own jurisdiction to do so.
history of the proposed contract 
in february,the oca issued on behalf of the puc an invitation for bids for a contract to haul biosolids and grit from the city wastewater treatment plants to locations outside of san francisco the bids were to be submitted based on the rate the bidder would charge per mile traveled to haul the biosolids and grit.s s submitted the lowest responsive bid at per mile for grit and per mile for biosolids,subject to an adjustment for increased fuel costs.in addition,bridge tolls were to be billed separately to the city.s s was conditionally awarded the contract.
in june,the oca requested that natalie sierra,the puc process engineer responsible for managing the contract,prepare an estimate of the value of the potential contract,and sierra estimated that expenditures under the contract would be approximately million.this estimate was calculated by multiplying the per mile charges in s s bid by the number of miles traveled during the previous year by the trucking company then performing the hauling for the city.in a declaration subsequently submitted in opposition to the writ petition,sierra stated that when she submitted the estimate she explained to the oca that she made use of the only reliable information available at the time but because of the structure of the proposed bid any estimate of the cost of the potential contract was,by definition,extremely rough.when she submitted her estimate she made clear that her projection was subject to so many variables that it was likely to deviate significantly from the actual amount the city would ultimately be required to pay under the contract.she identified six variables that rendered the projection unreliable.she noted that the cost of fuel was expected to increase,and that bridge tolls had not been included in her estimate.three of the identified variables related to the possible relocation of landfill sites and would affect the distance s s would travel to deliver the waste,potentially increasing the mileage beyond that traveled in.finally,sierra noted that the contract would be subject to an upward adjustment in the cost of fuel if s s transitioned to an alternative fuel.based on this information,ben kawamura,the supervising purchaser in the oca responsible for the contract,determined that there was a significant possibility that the contract would exceed million over the term so that board approval was required.
on october,the oca submitted to the board a proposed resolution approving the contract.the proposed resolution included a finding that the contract is anticipated to be in excess of million.the city budget analyst,however,estimated that the value of the initial term of the contract was approximately million.in his report to the board recommending approval of the contract,the budget analyst explained that he relied on the puc estimate but increased the cost of the contract by percent per year for the initial term based on actual increases in california diesel fuel prices over the past year.the report stated that t he only rate adjustments permitted during the initial period would be due to diesel fuel price fluctuations.the record before us contains no indication that s s challenged the board jurisdiction to approve or disapprove the contract or that any information regarding the six variables identified by sierra was submitted to the board.on november,the board followed the recommendation of its budget and finance committee and voted not to adopt the proposed resolution.based on the board refusal to approve the contract,the city refused to execute the contract with s s.the puc informed s s that it would instead extend its contract with the existing trucking company to perform the services that would have been provided by s s under the new contract.
on november,s s filed a petition for a writ of mandamus in the san francisco superior court.the petition alleges that the city had a ministerial duty to execute the contract with s s and that the city violated that duty by failing to award it the contract.the petition alleges that the board has a legal duty not to interfere with the puc award,execution and procession of the contract and that the board is not authorized,under the city charter,to approve or disapprove sfpuc contracts having a term of ten years or less and requiring anticipated expenditures of less that million.since the contract term is five years and the anticipated expenditures under the contract are less than million,the board disapproval of the contract was unauthorized interference with the sfpuc ability to contract.the petition requested an order vacating the board resolution disapproving the contract and directing the puc to execute and proceed with the contract.in opposition,the city submitted declarations by sierra and kawamura describing the variables they thought could increase the ultimate cost under the contract and stating oca belief that there was a significant possibility the contract would exceed million over the term.the city also submitted a declaration tending to show that the submission of the contract to the board for approval was consistent with its practice in other cases when there was uncertainty as to the amount of expenditures that ultimately would be required under a proposed contrac
