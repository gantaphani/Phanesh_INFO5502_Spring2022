at the end of a week of evidentiary hearings,the commission suspended proceedings after the utility,csd,and two private parties to the clearances proceedings indicated they had reached a proposed agreement to settle the matter.as described in the commission opinion filed in the proceedings approving the settlement,the agreement includes both specific and monetary relief.the commission opinion characterized the settlement as requiring the utility shareholders to fund up to million in activities over the next five years and make an immediate,million contribution to the california general fund.the commission description of the terms of the settlement agreement continues
