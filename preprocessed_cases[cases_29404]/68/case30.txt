introduction 
this appeal requires us to determine whether the telecommunications act of tca,stat.codified in part at,obligates former telecommunications monopolists,known as incumbent local exchange carriers ilecs,to provide a connection service known as transit traffic service transit service at negotiated rates or at lower regulated rates to new entrants seeking to exchange traffic with each other through the ilec facilities.we agree with the united states district court for the district of connecticut edginton,that the regulated rates apply.
the tca transformed the longstanding regime of monopolies into a competitive market.at t iowa utils,d.prior to its passage,ilecs held franchises to act as exclusive telephone service providers and,after its passage,they continue to control the physical network infrastructure in most states.see h.plaintiff appellant southern new england telephone company,at t connecticut at t,is an ilec in connecticut.
new entrants,known as competitive local exchange carriers clecs,entered the market after deregulation.they now compete with ilecs to provide services,but they lack some of the advantages that the ilecs enjoy due to the ilecs historical ownership of network infrastructure.intervenors defendants appellees comcast phone of connecticut,cablevision lightpath connecticut,and cox connecticut telecom,llc are clecs.commercial mobile radio services cmrss are new entrants who offer wireless communication and compete with both ilecs and clecs to provide telephone service.intervenors defendants appellees metropcs new york,llc,sprint communications,sprint spectrum,nextel communications of the mid atlantic,and youghiogheny communications northeast,llc pocket communications pocket communications are cmrss.
to advance congress goals of promoting competition and widespread user access to telecommunications services,section a of title of the united states code requires all telecommunications carriers to interconnect,that is physically link their facilities for the mutual exchange of traffic.a.in requiring universal interconnection,the tca aims to ensure that the customers of all carriers will be able to exchange telecommunications traffic with each other.in addition,c and d require ilecs,like at t,to physically connect all other carriers to their network facilities at regulated or total element long run incremental cost telric rates c,d.in requiring ilecs to provide interconnection to the facilities of new entrants,the tca seeks to ensure that ilecs do not exploit their former monopoly status and their continuing control of network infrastructure to the disadvantage of clecs.
interconnection may be direct,where a carrier attaches his equipment to the physical network infrastructure of another carrier,or indirect,where the attachment occurs through the facilities or equipment of an additional carrier.in the matters of deployment of wireline servs.offering advanced telecomms.capability and implementation of the local competition provisions of the telecomms.act of.typically,two new entrants use an ilec network to interconnect indirectly.in the matter of dev g a unified intercarrier comp.regime,further notice of proposed rulemaking,notice.when carriers are directly interconnected,they are able to exchange traffic.however,when they are indirectly interconnected,they must rely on and pay the interconnecting carrier to route the traffic between them.
the principal question in this appeal is whether at t,an interconnecting carrier,is obligated under c to provide this routing of traffic,or transit service,at lower telric rates or whether at t is permitted to charge higher negotiated rates.most new entrants interconnect indirectly and transit service is essential to ensuring that indirectly interconnected entrants can exchange traffic.it would be inconsistent with the stated purpose of the tca to allow at t to charge higher negotiated rates for this service because this would impose additional costs and competitive disadvantages upon new entrants.such an imposition would allow at t to further exploit its status as a former monopolist.thus,we conclude that the provision of transit service falls under at t obligation as an ilec and that the service must be delivered at regulated rates.
procedural history 
dpuc decision 
in december,pocket communications petitioned the connecticut department of public utility control dpuc to review a commercial agreement it was negotiating with at t.the main disagreement in that proceeding pocket proceeding was over the rates that at t could charge pocket for transit service.pocket alleged that at t violated connecticut statutory law and the dpuc decision in a proceeding under the tca involving cox communication,both of which required at t to charge regulated rates for transit service.pocket petition,at see also decision.dep t of pub.util.control,petition of cox connecticut telecom,llc for investigation of snet transit service cost study and rates,cox decision.pocket argued that the rates at t charged for transit service in connecticut were significantly higher than those it charged in other states and requested that the commission order them to be lowered.at t argued that because transit service did not constitute interconnection under,it was subject to higher negotiated rates.the dpuc concluded that at t was required to offer transit service at regulated rates and ordered that those rates be afforded not only to pocket but to other at t transit service customers as well.decision.dep t of pub.util.control,petition of youghioghney communications northeast,llc,at,pocket decision.
at t appealed to the district court on a number of grounds.it first argued preemption the dpuc was not authorized to regulate transit service because the fcc had occupied the area by examining but not resolving the question.according to at t,this inaction was tantamount to a decision not to regulate transit service.at t also argued that because transit service did not fit the definition of interconnection under,it was not subject to telric rates.finally,at t argued that under connecticut law the dpuc was not authorized to regulate telecommunications service rates by issuing declaratory rulings.
district court decision 
the district court affirmed in part and reversed and remanded in part.it held that the dpuc determination was not preempted by the fcc comments.agreeing with the dpuc,it concluded that interconnection under section c includes the duties to provide indirect interconnection and to provide transit service because t he act and its attendant regulations should be interpreted so as to promote competition and it would be difficult for clecs to compete without transit service which allows them to connect indirectly.eng.perlermino,cv wwe,wl,at.may.therefore,the district court affirmed the dpuc ruling ordering at t to provide transit service to pocket communications at regulated rates.however,the district court also held that the dpuc order requiring at t to extend regulated pricing to clecs who were not parties to the proceeding was impermissible because that approach would voluntary negotiation,the preferred method under the tca.this appeal followed.we review de novo a district court decision as to whether a state commission order complies with federal law.global naps,verizon new,cir.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the district court.
discussion 
the ultimate question for us is whether at t is obligated to provide transit service pursuant to the interconnection obligations of.this requires us to decide whether the obligation arises under a,which addresses the general duties of all telecommunications carriers,or under c,which addresses the duties of former monopolists.this distinction is significant because the interconnection obligations under a are subject to higher negotiated rates,while those under c are to be fulfilled at significantly lower,regulated rates.
but first,we must decide two threshold issues whether a state commission is preempted from determining that transit service is among the obligations imposed on carriers by when the fcc has considered,but not yet made,this determination,and whether a state commission may interpret the tca in proceedings other than those specified in.at t also contends separately that,under connecticut law,the dpuc was not authorized to resolve this dispute in a proceeding seeking a declaratory ruling.
the fcc comments and inaction relating to transit service do not preempt the dpuc here.the model under the tca is to divide authority among the fcc and the state commissions in an unusual regime of cooperative federalism,with the intended effect of leaving state commissions free,where warranted,to reflect the policy choices made by their states.global naps,at internal citation omitted.while under cooperative federalism,federal and state agencies should endeavor to harmonize their efforts with one another and state commissions are directed by provisions of the act and fcc regulations in making decisions,the tca gives the state commissions latitude to exercise their expertise in telecommunications and needs of the local market.bell.mcimetro access transmission,cir quoting philip weiser,federal common law,cooperative federalism,and the enforcement of the telecom act.
accordingly,congress included a savings clause in the tca to protect state experimentation with interconnection obligations.in that regard,congress expressly left with the states the power to enforce any regulation,order,or policy of a state commission that establishes access and interconnection obligations of local exchange carriers is consistent with the requirements of this section and does not substantially prevent implementation of the requirements of this section and the purposes of this part.global naps,at quoting d a c.the tca,then,permits state commissions to regulate interconnection obligations so long as they do not violate federal law and until the fcc rules otherwise.see iowa network,qwest,cir.
although the fcc has been considering the regulation of transit services for a number of years,it has not yet adopted a final position in its most recent pronouncement,the fcc recognized that while it has yet to determine whether to regulate transit service,a number of state commissions and courts have done so in the matter of connect am.fund,a broadband plan for our future et,report and order and further notice of proposed rule making,report and order.in light of these factors,we have little difficulty concluding that with regard to transit service congress did not intend to preempt state regulation,the text of the tca does not support preemption,and the fcc indecision simply reflects its current preference for continued experimentation by state commissions.
we next consider whether the dpuc exceeded its authority when it resolved the dispute between the parties,which arose under a commercial agreement and not an interconnection agreement ica.at t contends that when it reviewed the commercial agreement between at t and pocket communications,the dpuc exceeded its limited role under,which permits it only to mediate,arbitrate or approve icas.br.at.the dpuc contended below that it is aware that it has no power to review commercial agreements,but that it was authorized to reach its decision because transit service must be regulated under and,therefore,must be negotiated in an ica.brief of appellee at,new eng.palermino,cv conn,ecf.
the enforcement role of state commissions in matters arising under is set out primarily in which authorizes state commissions to mediate,arbitrate and approve icas.see a e.the tca contemplates that when a new entrant requests interconnection from an ilec,the two parties will undertake to reach an agreement through voluntary negotiation.see a.the resulting icas are not subject to the detailed,specific interconnection obligations of c.see id.if negotiations fail,the parties can petition their state commission to either mediate or arbitrate the open issues in their icas.see a b at t,at.where a commission undertakes to arbitrate open issues,it must ensure that the resolution of these issues complies with c and that former monopolies charge telric rates when they provide interconnection.c.
all icas,whether negotiated by the parties or mediated or arbitrated,must be approved by a state commission.see e.negotiated agreements and arbitrated agreements are subject to different approval criteria.the former may be rejected only if they discriminate against carriers not party to the agreement or are inconsistent with public interest,convenience and necessity.e a.the latter may be rejected if they do not meet the interconnection and other requirements of c or pricing standards under d.e b.when approving negotiated or arbitrated icas,a commission may review the agreement for compliance with state law.see e nothing in this section shall prohibit a state commission from establishing or enforcing other requirements of state law in its review of an agreement,including requiring compliance with intrastate telecommunications service quality standards or requirements.
moreover,where parties seek clarification as to whether a contractual agreement is subject to a,the fcc has ruled that b ased on their statutory role provided by congress and their experience to date,state commissions are well positioned to decide on a basis whether a particular negotiated agreement is required to be filed as an interconnection agreement and,if so,whether it should be approved or rejected.in the matter of qwest comm ns int l,petition for declaratory ruling on the scope of the duty to file and obtain prior approval of negotiated contractual arrangement under section a,memorandum opinion and order.therefore,state commissions should determine in the first instance which sorts of agreements shall fall within the scope of the statutory standard under.id.at.
in this case,the dpuc made such a determination.it reviewed the commercial agreement between at t and pocket communications and concluded that negotiations for transit service should have been conducted with the carriers pursuant to,resulting in an interconnection agreement subject to dpuc approval.pocket decision,at.this is consistent with the fcc view that state commissions are authorized to determine whether negotiated agreements must be field as icas under.however,as the dpuc acknowledges,state commissions do not have the authority to order changes in commercial agreements affecting services that are not subject to.id.at.additionally,the dpuc review of the pocket agreement here was authorized by its previous ruling,in the cox proceeding,that transit service should be regulated under.
next,at t contends that the dpuc failed to follow state law and consequently exceeded its authority when it issued binding orders under,which provides that 
a ny person may petition an agency,or an agency may on its own motion initiate a proceeding,for a declaratory ruling as to the validity of any regulation,or the applicability to specified circumstances of a provision of the general statutes,a regulation,or a final decision on a matter within the jurisdiction of the agency.
conn.a.the dpuc contends that a authorizes the result reached in the case.at t argues that an action under a allows the dpuc only to issue advisory opinions and that the dpuc exceeded its authority under that statute because it issued binding generic orders in a declaratory proceeding.
the district court did not comment on this pendant state law claim,and at t failed to argue that the district court abused its discretion when it declined this exercise of supplemental jurisdiction.because principles of federalism and comity instruct us to leave unresolved questions of state law to the states where those questions concern the state interest in the administration of its government,we do not think that the district court abused its discretion by passing on this issue.valencia lee,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted see also c.likewise,we will not consider it here in the first instance or remand for the district court to reconsider.
