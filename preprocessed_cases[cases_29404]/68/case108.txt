the following facts were stated by the district court 
plaintiff darryl white began employment with defendant detroit edison in may,as a pipefitter for detroit edison river rouge power plant.at this time,white became a member of the utility workers union,defendant utility workers union of america local.as a member of the union,white employment status was protected and governed by a collective bargaining agreement between detroit edison and local.pursuant to the agreement,during the first year of employment,an employee has probationary status.after one year,an employee can be discharged only for just cause.
on march,while still a probationary employee,white was disciplined for being away from his work area without permission on two occasions.white did not file a grievance in response to the discipline.white completed his probationary period with detroit edison in may.on both june and june,white left work early by approximately one half hour.on june,a hearing was held concerning white early absences from work in compliance with the collective bargaining agreement which requires a hearing before issuance of serious discipline to a union employee.as a result of the hearing,detroit edison placed white on leave,which is paid leave where an employee is provided the opportunity to consider the future status of his or her employment with detroit edison.leave is considered serious discipline and it puts an employee on notice that any subsequent inappropriate behavior may result in more severe discipline,including discharge from employment.
white challenged the discipline by filing a grievance.pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement,a third step hearing was held on the grievance in september.third step hearings are hearings conducted by employees of detroit edison.white was present at the hearing,had the opportunity to defend himself,and was represented by local.on october,a ruling from the hearing was issued,upholding white leave discipline.white alleges that he did not learn of the ruling until april,which was too late to make an appeal.
between the september third step hearing and april,white had some difficulty with his supervisors.two hearings were conducted on separate incidents in one case,a refusal by white to do work because of safety concerns in another case,an accusation that white engaged in disruptive behavior during a briefing.neither hearing resulted in white receiving any additional discipline.also during this time,white had two counseling sessions for arguing with a supervisor and for failing to tell his supervisors where he could be reached.the counseling sessions were not considered discipline,nor did they result in any discipline.
the events that constitute the reason for white eventual discharge from employment occurred on july and.on july,white finished an assignment at approximately white waited for another assignment until or,and then went on his double shift lunch break.after his lunch,white continued to relax in the break room,waiting for another assignment.white testified that there were several other employees also present relaxing in the break room.white claims that he got up several times to look for his supervisor in order to receive another assignment,but that he was unable to locate him.white waited until without working or receiving another assignment,punched out of work,and went home.
the following day,july,white began working on an assignment in the morning.before white was done with his first job,his supervisor,wallace cash,assigned white to another job.from white testimony,cash told white of the second job at or white testified that he could not get to the second job immediately,because he was not finished with the first job.white testified that after lunch,at around or,he went to check the status of his second job,and found that he could not begin because insulation was still being removed at the job site.white left the job site,and a subsequently began the job without white.white eventually did return to the job site and began work on this second job at around 
on july,a hearing was held to consider the events of july and.white was present at the hearing and was represented by local.the ruling resulting from the was that white was absent from his work location without permission for approximately hours on july and approximately hours on july.because this misconduct occurred while white was still on leave probation,detroit edison then made the decision to terminate white employment.detroit edison discharged white in an official letter dated august.
white filed a grievance,and a third step hearing was held on october.white was again present at the hearing and represented by local.on january,a ruling was issued upholding the termination of white employment.white then asked local to take his case to arbitration.local reviewed white request and decided against taking white case to arbitration,notifying white of its decision on march.
white appealed local ruling to the national union.on july,after providing both local and white an opportunity to submit additional information,the national union decided to uphold local refusal to take white case to arbitration.
white detroit edison,d.
white filed a complaint in federal district court against detroit edison,local,and the national union,alleging violations of the labor management relations act,et.white complaint alleged that detroit edison breached the collective bargaining agreement by terminating his employment without just cause,and that local and the national union breached their duties of fair representation by not submitting white grievance to arbitration in response,the national union,local,and detroit edison all filed motions for summary judgment.the district court ruled on all of the motions in an opinion dated november.
the district court denied detroit edison motion,finding that when viewed in light most favorable to white,a genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether detroit edison had good cause to discharge white.the district court granted local motion,noting that under vaca sipes,d,a breach of the statutory duty of fair representation occurs only when a union conduct toward a member of the collective bargaining unit is arbitrary,discriminatory,or in bad faith.the district court also granted the national union motion,noting that white was similarly unable to point to any arbitrary action on its part.the court held national union did not merely rubber stamp local decision.instead,national union solicited from both local and white any additional information that would be helpful in considering white appeal t here is nothing in the record to indicate that national union did not consider all the evidence in white case.d at.
on november,the district court issued a supplemental order to its november opinion.the order noted that in cases involving inextricably known as hybrid claims against both union and employer,a plaintiff must survive summary judgment on both claims in order to prevail.thus,notwithstanding its november judgment denying detroit edison summary judgment motion,the district court concluded that because neither local nor the national union breached its duty of fair representation to white,his cause of action against detroit edison must necessarily fail as a matter of law.
this court reviews a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,and must view the facts and any inferences that can be drawn from those facts in the light most favorable to the party.bennett city of eastpointe,cir citing matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.s
