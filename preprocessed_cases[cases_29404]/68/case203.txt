the united states petitioned the district court for an order enforcing a drug enforcement administration dea subpoena served on golden valley electric association golden valley for power consumption records concerning three customer residences.the court granted the petition and ordered compliance.golden valley complied with the subpoena but appealed the order.we hold that the appeal is not moot and affirm on the merits.
background 
golden valley is a cooperative providing electricity to roughly meters in fairbanks and other localities in the interior of alaska.in late,the dea was investigating suspected violations of the controlled substances act,et,by several of golden valley customers.as part of its investigation,the dea served an administrative subpoena on golden valley pursuant to a.the subpoena ordered golden valley to provide company records pertaining to electricity consumption at three specified customer addresses.the records subpoenaed were 
customer information including full name,address,telephone number,and any account information for customer method of payment credit card,debit card,cash,check with card number and account information to include power consumption records and date s service was initiated and terminated for the period through,if applicable.
golden valley did not immediately comply with the subpoena.
the government petitioned the district court pursuant to c for an order enforcing its subpoena.golden valley opposed the petition,primarily relying on a company policy of protecting the confidentiality of its members records.the district court granted the petition to enforce the subpoena.
golden valley timely appealed the district court order.it has now complied with the subpoena,but it has not dismissed its appeal.
ii.standard of review 
we review de novo an appeal from an order enforcing an administrative subpoena.eeoc fed.express,cir.we review a question of mootness de novo.alvarez hill,cir.
iii.discussion 
as a preliminary matter,we must decide whether golden valley compliance with the district court order has rendered its appeal moot.neither party has raised the issue,but we have an independent duty to decide whether an appeal is moot within the meaning of the case or controversy requirement of article iii.see renee duncan,wl,at cir.may.
an article iii federal court has no authority to give opinions upon moot questions or abstract propositions,or to declare principles or rules of law which can not affect the matter in issue in the case before it.church of scientology of cal.united states,d internal quotation marks omitted.a case becomes moot only when it is impossible for a court to grant any effectual relief whatever to the prevailing party.knox serv.employees int l union,d,internal quotation marks omitted.a case is not moot as long as the parties have a concrete interest,however small,in the outcome of the litigation.id.internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.
in church of scientology,the supreme court addressed the very issue before us whether compliance with a district court order enforcing a subpoena moots an appeal from that order.the internal revenue service irs had obtained an order enforcing a subpoena requiring the production of records.at.while the order was on appeal,copies of the records were delivered to the irs.id.we dismissed the appeal as moot.id.at.the supreme court reversed,concluding that the appeal was not moot.it explained 
while a court may not be able to return the parties to the status quo ante there is nothing a court can do to withdraw all knowledge or information that irs agents may have acquired by examination of the tapes a court can fashion some form of meaningful relief in circumstances such as these.taxpayers have an obvious possessory interest in their records.when the government has obtained such materials as a result of an unlawful subpoena,that interest is violated and a court can effectuate relief by ordering the government to return the records.
prior to the supreme court decision in church of scientology,we had held in several cases that an appeal was moot if the subpoenaed party had complied with an enforcement order.see,remark united states,cir eeoc regis paper,cir united states silva silva accountancy,cir sec laird,cir.as a panel,we must follow prior decisions of our court unless intervening supreme court authority is clearly irreconcilable with our prior circuit authority.miller gammie,cir.t he issues decided by the higher court need not be identical in order to be controlling.id.but the intervening supreme court precedent must undercut the theory or reasoning underlying the prior circuit precedent in such a way that the cases are clearly irreconcilable.id.
we have previously recognized that church of scientology is controlling on this issue.see united states rubin,cir.we take this opportunity to further clarify our case law.we conclude that the supreme court decision in church of scientology is clearly irreconcilable with our prior decisions listed above.see remark,at regis paper,at silva,at laird,at.the fact that these cases arose under different federal statutes does not distinguish them from church of scientology.church of scientology,at relying on earlier cases involving other statutes to hold the appeal not moot.
accordingly,we hold that golden valley appeal is not moot despite golden valley compliance with the district court order.
congress enacted the comprehensive drug abuse prevention and control act of,inter alia,to strengthen law enforcement tools against the traffic of illicit drugs.gonzales raich,d.the statute gives the attorney general the authority to issue administrative subpoenas to investigate drug crimes 
in any investigation relating to his functions under this subchapter subchapter i control and enforcement with respect to controlled substances the attorney general may subp o ena witnesses,compel the attendance and testimony of witnesses,and require the production of any records including books,papers,documents,and other tangible things which constitute or contain evidence which the attorney general finds relevant or material to the investigation.
a.section c provides for judicial enforcement of a subpoena issued under a in the case of contumacy by or refusal to obey a subp o ena issued to any person,the attorney general may invoke the aid of any court of the united states within the jurisdiction of which the investigation is carried on to compel compliance with the subp o ena.
an administrative subpoena may not be too indefinite or broad.peters united states,cir.the critical questions are whether congress has granted the authority to investigate whether procedural requirements have been followed and whether the evidence is relevant and material to the investigation.eeoc children hosp.med.ctr.of,cir en banc,overruled on other grounds as recognized in prudential ins.of am.lai,cir.even if other criteria are satisfied,a fourth amendment reasonableness inquiry must also be satisfied.see reich.sulphur chem,cir.the scope of judicial review in an administrative subpoena enforcement proceeding is quite narrow.children hosp.med,at.
golden valley makes four principal arguments on appeal.first,it argues that the subpoenaed records are irrelevant to the dea investigation.second,it argues that the attorney general did not verify the existence of a pending drug investigation involving the three residences prior to issuing the subpoena.third,it argues that the subpoena was an overly broad john doe subpoena.fourth,it argues that issuance of the subpoena violated the fourth amendment because the government should have obtained a search warrant or a grand jury subpoena.we take each argument in turn.
relevancy is determined in terms of the investigation rather than in terms of evidentiary relevance.fed.express,at.the relevance requirement is not especially constraining.id.internal quotation marks omitted.we must enforce administrative subpoenas unless the evidence sought by the subpoena is plainly incompetent or irrelevant to any lawful purpose of the agency.eeoc karuk tribe hous,cir internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.
