appellant central iowa power cooperative cipco,a generation and transmission electrical power cooperative,sued the appellees midwest independent transmission system operator,miso,the resale power group of iowa rpgi,and members of rpgi in iowa state court.cipco raised state law implied contract and tort claims,generally alleging that the appellees had either used cipco transmission system without authorization and compensation or benefitted from that allegedly wrongful use without compensating cipco.the appellees removed the suit to federal court,and cipco moved to remand the case to state court.the district court denied the remand motion,concluding that it had jurisdiction over the suit because cipco state law claims necessarily depended on the resolution of substantial and disputed issues of federal law.thereafter,the district court granted the appellees motion to dismiss because it concluded that cipco state law claims were preempted by the federal power act fpa.cipco appeals both the denial of the motion to remand and the dismissal.we conclude that the district court erred by denying cipco motion to remand,and we therefore reverse.
a.the regulatory backdrop 
due to the technical and complicated nature of this case,we begin by describing the general transformation from the bad old days of local monopolization of the electricity market,midwest iso transmission owners ferc,to the brave new regulatory world that provides the backdrop for this appeal.power,ferc.we describe this transition in some detail at the outset because it is helpful to an understanding of the parties relationships to each other,the parties relationships to the federal energy regulatory commission ferc,and the precise legal issues before this court.
in the past,single utilities generally controlled electricity generation,transmission,and distribution for a particular region and charged a combined or bundled rate for providing those services.the result was minimal competition among wholesale electricity providers.see new york ferc,d competition among utilities was not prevalent.as technology advanced,however,it became possible for power companies to transmit electric energy over long distances at a low cost,id.at.as a result,robust nationwide competition in the lower costs for more realistic.but without open,nondiscriminatory access to regional transmission facilities to deliver that power from generators to buyers,this potential competitive marketplace was largely unrealized.
in response to the anticompetitive effects of vertically integrated utility monopolies,in the ferc issued order,fundamentally altering the wholesale electricity market.order required public utilities to functionally unbundle their wholesale generation and transmission services by stating separate rates for each service in a single tariff and offering transmission service under that tariff on an,basis.midwest iso,at see promoting wholesale competition through open access transmission services by public utilities,ferc may,hereinafter order.as a result,wholesale energy generators gained open,access to public utilities transmission facilities at rates that the transmission providers are required to file with the ferc under order.
in a further attempt to create a more efficient and competitive electricity market,the ferc encouraged utilities to cede control over their individual transmission facilities to one newly created regional transmission organization operated by an independent system operator iso.as envisioned by ferc,an iso would assume operational not the transmission facilities owned by its member utilities,thereby separating operation of the transmission grid and access to it from economic interests in generation.midwest iso,at quoting order at.the iso then offers service over the regional transmission system at the rates set out in a single,transmission tariff oatt,which applies to all electricity generators seeking to use the regional transmission system to deliver power.see regional transmission organizations,ferc,order describing the benefits of regional transmission organizations.under the fpa,the ferc is vested with exclusive jurisdiction to review the reasonableness of these regional transmission rates.see b,a,a aep.indus.energy consumers,cir the federal power act fpa gives ferc exclusive jurisdiction to regulate the transmission and wholesale sale of electric energy in interstate commerce,cert.denied,d.
appellee midwest independent transmission system operator,miso is one such iso.miso is a public utility that link s up the transmission lines of the member utilities into a single interconnected grid stretching across the northern border of the from michigan to eastern montana,and reaching as far south as kansas city,missouri and louisville,kentucky.midwest iso,at.miso exercises functional control over its members facilities by calculating available transmission capability over the interconnected grid and by receiving,approving,and coordinating requests for wheeling power over the grid.miso members retain ownership of their individual transmission facilities and physically operate those facilities subject to miso overriding direction and functional control.
the change effected by this new regulatory regime was and important,but not unlimited in scope.under f of the fpa,f,governmental entities and electric cooperatives receiving financing under the rural electrification act of are exempt from the fpa and by extension,are outside of the ferc jurisdiction.these entities are considered utilities for purposes of the fpa and are not required to file transmission tariffs with the ferc.the ferc rate and refund jurisdiction under and of the fpa does not apply to utilities.see bonneville power admin.ferc,cir ferc rate jurisdiction under and its refund jurisdiction under expressly apply only to public utilities.emphasis added,cert.denied,d.appellant cipco is one such exempt utility.
cipco,ipl,and the operating and transmission agreement 
cipco is a generation and transmission electrical power cooperative based in cedar rapids,iowa.cipco owns power lines,substations,and related facilities that it uses to provide power and transmission service to its customers.its transmission system is interconnected with the transmission system of interstate power light ipl,a subsidiary of alliant energy this interconnected network is referred to as the integrated transmission system its,and the central factual allegation in these proceedings is that cipco elements of the its have been used without authorization and without compensation by miso,rpgi,and its members.
in,cipco and iowa electric light and power alliant predecessor in interest entered into an operation and transmission agreement o t agreement.the o t agreement governs cipco and alliant operation,maintenance,and use of the its.under of the o t agreement,cipco and alliant each maintain ownership of their own separate and discrete elements of the its,but pursuant to alliant provide s all management,supervision,operating supplies,services and labor for the operation of cipco transmission facilities included in the its.at.under of the agreement,both cipco and alliant may use the its,including the other party facilities,to wheel power for their own customers.no wheeling charge is assessed for one party use of the other party facilities for this purpose.in contrast,of the agreement governs use of the its for the benefit of systems or electric suppliers 
in the event that either cipco or alliant enter into an agreement with a to this agreement to wheel power for such,or to serve customers of said,thereby utilizing the integrated transmission system,the agreement with respect to such transaction shall be approved both by cipco and alliant.any monies paid to cipco or to alliant for such services shall be shared by both in the same proportion as the basis for investment in transmission facilities described in section hereof.
at.under,alliant is entitled to percent of those revenues,leaving percent for cipco.the appellees imply throughout their briefs that the o t agreement establishes a rate for use of the its pursuant to of the agreement.but no party directs us to any portion of the o t agreement identifying such a rate,and our reading of the o t agreement discloses no such rate.moreover,during oral argument,appellee resale power group of iowa rpgi unequivocally stated that the o t agreement contains no such rate.
because alliant is a public utility under the federal power act and subject to the jurisdiction of the ferc,e,it is required to file a rate schedule with the ferc in an oatt for those readers who are at this point suffering from acronym overload,oatt stands for open access transmission tariff,ante,and should not be confused with the o t agreement discussed in this subsection and elsewhere in this opinion.see c.in,well before the ferc issued order,alliant predecessor in interest filed its rate schedule with the ferc and attached the o t agreement to its filing as an exhibit.even though cipco is not a public utility under the fpa and is not subject to the ferc jurisdiction,the o t agreement between the two parties was included because,in the words of alliant predecessor,even though s ome of the agreement arrangements arguably do not involve jurisdictional services they may have some impact on the ultimate pricing of jurisdictional services.at.the ferc accepted the o t agreement for filing.at,ferc letter order,docket no.
miso and the transmission of energy across the its to rpgi members 
in november of,alliant joined miso.shortly thereafter,alliant filed an application with the ferc seeking the ferc approval to grant miso functional control over many of its transmission facilities,including alliant portion of the its.notably,the application listed some cipco facilities as facilities whose functional control would be transferred to miso under the transaction.in response,cipco intervened and objected to the attempted transfer of control over its facilities to miso.in march of,the ferc approved alliant application,but only insofar as alliant transferred control over its own facilities to miso.see alliant energy corporate,ferc,in this order we are only approving the transfer to the miso of the facilities that alliant energy actually owns.see also cent.iowa power.midwest indep.transmission.operator,ferc,i n alliant,the commission emphasized that it was authorizing the transfer of only the jurisdictional facilities that alliant owned.accordingly,miso now functionally controls transmission service over and on alliant transmission system.because miso controls the alliant transmission facilities that are interconnected with cipco facilities in the its,miso allegedly causes electricity to flow over cipco transmission system without authority from cipco and without compensating cipco for the use of cipco lines and related facilities to serve members of rpgi.
in addition to transferring functional control of its transmission facilities but not cipco to miso,in january of,alliant also assigned some of its agreements to miso.alliant assigned to miso a agreement that it had entered into with midamerican energy company midamerican,a wholesale power supplier.the agreement forged before alliant joined miso required alliant to provide transmission service to midamerican from january,to december.midamerican had entered into the agreement with alliant in order to deliver power to the members of rpgi,which are small iowa cities and the small electric utilities owned by iowa municipalities located across the state.from january of to january of,before the assignment of the agreement to miso occurred,alliant had fulfilled its obligation under the agreement with midamerican by using cipco transmission system within the its to deliver energy from midamerican to the rpgi members.after the assignment,from january of to the end of,miso took over alliant obligation and allegedly used cipco system within the its to transmit energy from midamerican to the rpgi members.
in january of,rpgi discontinued its supply agreement with midamerican and agreed to purchase wholesale power for its members from a subsidiary of the ameren corporation.eventually,rpgi came to an independent agreement with miso for transmission of the power it was now purchasing from ameren.pursuant to these agreements,miso delivered energy from using the its and cipco rpgi members from january,to january.in sum,cipco alleges that all of the energy that rpgi purchased from either midamerican or ameren has been delivered to the rpgi members over the its,using cipco elements of the its to accomplish the delivery.
after rpgi elected to change power suppliers from midamerican to ameren,cipco began challenging the delivery of electricity over its facilities within the its.at this stage of the instant litigation,the record before us does not indicate that cipco objected to the same service prior to the change of suppliers from midamerican to ameren,or that cipco was being compensated for this service.nevertheless,cipco asserts that the delivery of power to rpgi members necessarily utilized cipco facilities and that cipco was not being compensated for the use of its transmission system.
proceedings before the ferc and the district court 
in august of after rpgi changed power suppliers from midamerican to ameren,cipco filed a complaint with the ferc under of the fpa,which gives the ferc the authority to review the reasonableness of rates for transmissions or sales subject to its jurisdiction.cipco alleged that miso had failed to pay for miso use of cipco transmission system in violation of miso own oatt,and cipco requested that the ferc require miso to include a separate charge for the use of cipco facilities within miso oatt.alternatively,cipco requested that the ferc state that nothing in its order permits miso to use cipco facilities.cent.iowa power,ferc at.after notice of the administrative complaint was published,alliant intervened in support of cipco,and rpgi intervened in support of miso.
in an order issued in february of,the ferc concluded that because cipco is not a regulated public utility under the fpa,the ferc does not have jurisdiction over cipco provision of transmission service and is consequently without authority to regulate cipco rates.the ferc rejected cipco request for relief,but explained that 
i f the parties were to agree on or a court with jurisdiction were to determine a charge to be paid by miso or alliant and then reflected in a jurisdictional rate,then the jurisdictional entity,whether it be alliant or miso,could file the proposed charge with ferc.ferc has previously held that,if cipco believes that its arrangements with alliant do not properly account for the use of the its and for sharing of revenues from uses,cipco may file a complaint under section of the fpa to modify its arrangements,to modify the o t agreement.
id.at footnote omitted.and while the ferc denied cipco request for relief,it made clear that nothing in its order should be construed as a determination that miso may use cipco facilities without compensation.id.at.
cipco then filed a request for rehearing and for clarification of the record.the ferc denied the request for rehearing and clarified its prior order in part.it again rejected cipco argument that miso was the jurisdictional provider of the transmission service at issue.rather,the ferc determined that the service at issue is transmission service over cipco facilities.cent.iowa power coop.midwest indep.transmission.operator,ferc.the ferc also explained that cipco attaches unwarranted reliance on the fact that the o t agreement is on file with the commission.cipco was not the entity to file the o t agreement with the commission.the o t agreement is jurisdictional with respect to the service provided thereunder by alliant,the jurisdictional public utility that filed it.id.footnote omitted.
in march of,cipco filed a petition against miso,rpgi,and rpgi members in iowa state court,asserting theories of breach of an contract,unjust enrichment,trespass,and conversion.the appellees removed the case to federal court,and cipco moved to remand the case to state court.the district court denied the motion to remand,concluding that the adjudication of cipco state law claims necessarily depended on the resolution of disputed and substantial federal issues.while the motion to remand was pending,miso and rpgi moved to dismiss cipco claims,arguing that the claims were preempted by the fpa.the district court granted the motion.this appeal follows.
first,we address cipco argument that the district court erred by denying its motion to remand.we review the district court exercise of removal jurisdiction and its denial of a motion to remand de novo.phipps fdic,cir.defendants may remove civil actions to federal court only if the claims could have been originally filed in federal court.see b gore trans world airlines,cir.here,the appellees sought to remove cipco suit on the basis of jurisdiction.critically,the party seeking removal has the burden to establish federal subject matter jurisdiction,green ameritrade,cir all doubts about federal jurisdiction must be resolved in favor of remand,dahl reynolds tobacco,cir.
removal based on jurisdiction is governed by the rule,which provides that federal jurisdiction exists only when a federal question is presented on the face of the plaintiff properly pleaded complaint.caterpillar williams,d.because this complaint rule makes the plaintiff the master of the claim,the plaintiff may avoid federal jurisdiction by exclusive reliance on state law.id.defendants are not permitted to inject a federal question into an otherwise claim and thereby transform the action into one arising under federal law.gore,at.it is firmly established that a federal defense,including a preemption defense,does not provide a basis for removal,even if the defense is anticipated in the plaintiff complaint,and even if both parties concede that the federal defense is the only question truly at issue in the case.caterpillar,at.
there is,however,another longstanding,if less frequently encountered,variety of federal arising under jurisdiction,the supreme court having recognized for nearly years that in certain cases jurisdiction will lie over claims that implicate significant federal issues.grable sons metal,darue eng g,d.there is no single,precise,test for jurisdiction over federal issues embedded in claims between nondiverse parties.id.at.internal marks omitted.to determine whether a case fits within th is special and small category,empire healthchoice assurance,mcveigh,d,the question is,does a claim necessarily raise a stated federal issue,actually disputed and substantial,which a federal forum may entertain without disturbing any congressionally approved balance of federal and state judicial responsibilities.grable,at.
here,cipco state court petition does not present a federal issue on its face.but as the preceding legal authority makes clear,cipco characterization of its claim s is not dispositive of whether federal question jurisdiction exists.peters union pac,cir.if cipco right to relief necessarily depends on the resolution of a disputed and substantial question of federal law,then the district court correctly denied cipco motion to remand.grable,at.
in denying cipco motion to remand,the district court concluded that a ll of the state claims advanced by cipco are necessarily based on federal law for two reasons.cipco add.at.the appellees adopt much of the same reasoning in their briefs.we address each reason in turn.
a.the o t agreement 
first,the district court concluded that cipco state law claims are based on federal law because they necessarily depend on the resolution of whether the o t agreement was violated.we agree with the district court and the appellees that generally the o t agreement has the same legal force as a federal regulation because it is part of a tariff.see b defining a tariff as a compilation of rate schedules of a particular public utility id.b defining a r ate schedule as including a statement of rates and charges for or in connection with electric service,and all classifications,practices,rules,regulations or contracts which in any manner affect or relate to such service,rates,and charges emphasis added see also bryan bellsouth commc ns,cir a filed tariff carries the force of federal law,cert.denied,d.but we do not agree that the mere fact that the o t agreement is listed as a grandfathered agreement under an attachment to the miso oatt converts every legal dispute implicating the o t agreement into one over which the ferc exercises exclusive jurisdiction.see in re mirant,cir recognizing that the fpa preempts claims that challenge rates,but also observing that the fpa does not provide ferc with exclusive jurisdiction over the breach of a ferc approved contract to the extent the claimed breach does not challenge the filed rate.if cipco must prove a violation of the o t agreement to recover under its state law claims,and if proving that violation challenges rates,then those claims would raise a federal issue.
but as we explain below,cipco need not establish a violation of the o t agreement to succeed in proving its state law claims.as an initial matter,it is unclear how cipco could demonstrate that the appellees violated the o t agreement given that only cipco and alliant are parties to the agreement even though the o t agreement is on file with the ferc,there is no indication in the record that alliant assigned all of its rights and obligations under the o t agreement to miso,specifically those related to alliant management of cipco portion of the its,when it transferred functional control of its facilities but not cipco as well as certain operating agreements to miso.the appellees conceded at oral argument that miso,rpgi,and its members are not parties to the o t agreement,a private contract,and miso also clearly agreed that it is not an assignee of alliant under the o t agreement.
notwithstanding their status under the o t agreement,the appellees maintain that the o t agreement is relevant and central to cipco state claims.miso br.at rpgi br.at.but relevance is not the operative question here,where no federal question is alleged on the face of cipco state court petition.rather,the question is whether cipco state law claims necessarily depend on a showing that the o t agreement was violated in such a way as to implicate the rates.this inquiry demands precision if the appellees argument is correct,they should be able to point to the specific elements of cipco state law claims that require proof that the o t agreement was violated and explain why that proof is necessary.see grable,at.concluding that w hether grable was given notice within the meaning of the federal statute was an essential element of its quiet title claim.illustratively,none of the appellees even discuss the elements of cipco state law claims in any detail.
our review of the nature and elements of cipco state law implied contract and tort claims convinces us that adjudication of those claims does not require cipco to prove a violation of the o t agreement.any right cipco has to damages for breach of an contract under iowa law is independent of its express contractual right to compensation for use under the o t agreement alliant.see roger backhoe,nichols,iowa describing the showing required to make out an contract claim and relying on the restatement second of contracts.and because it is clear and undisputed that none of the appellees are parties to or assignees of the o t agreement,a court is not required to determine whether the o t agreement was violated to adjudicate cipco claim.state ex rel.palmer unisys,iowa describing the showing required to recover under the theory of unjust enrichment.in sum,we are unconvinced that cipco implied contract claims against the appellees require cipco to prove that the appellees violated an express contract that none of the appellees are a party to in our view,cipco can succeed on its claims independent of the o t agreement.see dixon coburg dairy,cir en banc i f the plaintiff can support his claim with even one theory that does not call for an interpretation of federal law,his claim does not arise under federal law for purposes of.
likewise,none of cipco tort claims require interpretation of the o t agreement.see restatement second of torts,describing the elements of a and claim nichols city of evansdale,iowa applying the restatement to an iowa trespass claim condon auto sales,crick,iowa describing the elements of conversion.the o t agreement has no bearing on whether any of the appellees wrongfully dispossessed cipco of its property under any of the three state law tort claims because none of the appellees were an original party to the agreement.further,none are assignees of alliant,without which,they can gain no possessory interest to cipco system pursuant to the o t agreement.
moreover,insofar as the state court may have occasion to consider the o t agreement in adjudicating cipco state law claims,we do not think that the state court consideration of the agreement disturbs the congressionally approved balance of federal and state judicial responsibilities,grable,at.we are confident in the adjudicating state court ability to analyze the plain language of the private state court issue,see empire healthchoice assurance,at.concluding that the respondent,and nonstatutory reimbursement claim could not be squeezed into the slim category grable exemplifies,and noting that t he state court in which the suit was lodged is competent to apply federal law.
we recognize that cipco state court petition makes several references to the o t that,when read in isolation,tend to support the conclusion that cipco itself has made its state law claims dependent on showing a violation of the o t agreement.but after reviewing the state court petition in its entirety,and considering the legal theories relied on by cipco,we think that the petition references to the o t agreement are best construed as important factual background.nowhere in the petition does cipco make a violation of the o t express legal basis for its and tort claims.cipco references to the o t agreement in its state court petition do not raise a federal question sufficient to establish federal jurisdiction in the federal district court.
b.the miso oatt 
the district court also concluded that cipco state law claims necessarily require the resolution of a substantial federal question because cipco state law claims implicate miso ferc filed and regulated oatt.according to the district court 
cipco claims are founded on miso refusal to pay a rate that is anything but the rate that is set forth in the miso oatt.the conduct that cipco seeks to condemn or the lawfulness of miso conduct is wholly governed by the miso oatt.because miso duties or obligations arise under the miso oatt,any claim asserting that cipco is entitled to a rate that is not provided by the miso oatt is necessarily based on an assumed violation of the miso oatt.cipco action turns entirely upon miso compliance with a federal regulation absent a violation of the miso oatt,no liability could survive 
cipco essentially asks the court to conclude that cipco is entitled to a rate that is not included in,and is in addition to,the current rate that alliant developed for third party use of the its.cipco right to relief requires the court to determine a hypothetical reasonable rate for the transmission service that miso provided over the its,which includes cipco facilities such a determination must be made by ferc.
cipco add.at.
we understand the district court reasoning to be that because the scope of the miso oatt extends to the use of cipco system in the form of rates for the use of the entire its,cipco state law claims seeking compensation for that use implicitly challenge the reasonableness of those rates.claims that require a court to the reasonableness of rates require the resolution of a substantial federal question.see bryan,at concluding that the plaintiff state law claim necessarily raised a substantial question of federal law because it would authorize a court to award damages and effectively alter a filed rate dictated by a federally filed tariff.on the other hand,if the miso oatt does not cover service over cipco lines,then it is clear that the adjudication of cipco state law claims,and the determination of damages for the use of cipco system,would not undermine or implicate the ferc authority in any way.see fax telecommunicaciones v.at t,cir finding no federal question jurisdiction over the plaintiff claim where the basis for the claim was independent of the rate on file with the fcc in re nos commc ns,cir i nsofar as the plaintiffs can prove damages that do not refer to the,its state law claims may proceed.the analysis we must undertake to ascertain whether the scope of miso oatt covers the use of cipco transmission system is akin to the analysis required to apply the filed rate doctrine.see bryan,at observing that while the filed rate doctrine is not coterminous with the scope of federal question jurisdiction i n certain circumstances the inquiries merge see also am.cent.office,d rehnquist,concurring explaining that because t he tariff does not govern the entirety of the relationship between the common carrier and its customers the filed rate doctrine need only those suits that seek to alter the terms and conditions provided for in the tariff iowa network,qwest,cir rejecting a claim that the filed rate doctrine precluded a state utility board from determining whether a filed tariff applied to a particular type of traffic.
the scope of the miso oatt and the provisions of miso service agreements with ameren and rpgi are important to our jurisdictional analysis.but we can not tell from the record whether the miso oatt or the relevant service agreements account for service over cipco transmission system.and the parties do little to clarify the issue.cipco contends that because cipco transmission system was not transferred to miso functional control,and because miso has no authority to provide service over transmission facilities that have not been transferred to its functional control,miso oatt and the applicable service agreements do not account for the use of cipco system.we also note that in a letter in the record,alliant after the initiation of this alliant zonal rate under the miso oatt does not include the costs of cipco facilities,but only recovers the costs of alliant facilities.no cipco revenue requirements are included in the computation of the alliant zonal rate under the miso oatt.at.
the appellees disagree,but do so with ambiguity.miso recognizes that under the miso oatt and the miso transmission owners agreement by which it is bound,miso is without authority to provide transmission service over facilities that have not been transferred to miso functional control on the one hand,miso agrees both that cipco system has not been transferred to miso and that the service agreements by which miso transmits energy to rpgi and its members contemplate no compensation for cipco.miso br.at.on the other hand,miso also disputes that it has engaged in the unauthorized use of cipco system.despite these representations,miso obliquely suggests that cipco state law claims implicate miso oatt and its service agreements with ameren and rpgi.nowhere,however,do we understand miso clearly to take the position that its oatt incorporates a rate for use of the entire its.somewhat more clearly,rpgi contends that cipco gave alliant the exclusive authority to sell service over the its to third parties,and p ursuant to that authority,alliant has developed a rate for use of the its,and has filed that rate now as part of the miso filed tariff at ferc.rpgi br.at.we find that assertion difficult to square with of the o t agreement,ante,which gives both alliant and cipco the right to enter into agreements with third parties to wheel power over the its,subject to the express approval of the other.
neither cipco nor the appellees direct us to the legally operative language in the miso oatt or in the relevant service agreements demonstrating the scope of the oatt and the inclusion of service over cipco system within the rates set out in the miso oatt.while cipco omission in this regard may be understandable because most parties will be hard pressed to demonstrate what they claim to be absent from the record,the appellees reliance on largely unsupported in the complex context of this not.we are unable to invoke jurisdiction based on the appellees less than adequately suppo
