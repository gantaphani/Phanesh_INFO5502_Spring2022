robert and janet perkin together perkins appeal a judgment of dismissal entered following the superior court sustaining san diego gas electric company and sempra energy together sdg e demurrer to the perkins second amended complaint without leave to amend.the superior court found the applicable statute of limitations period,three years,had not been tolled by the pendency of a related class action because the perkins home was outside the fire zone depicted by a map,which served as an exhibit to one of the class action complaints.we conclude that the related class action complaint did not provide sdg e with notice of potential claims as required by our high court in jolly eli lilly cal d jolly and the unique characteristics of the purported class action made clear that the intended class would not be certified.accordingly,we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
from october through early november,seven southern california counties were enduring major wildfires,driven by the notorious santa ana winds and other adverse weather conditions.in san diego county,seven of the eight localized fires burned north of interstate including witch creek witch,guejito,and rice canyon rice,while one more harris burned south of interstate.some of the fires merged with others and were designated by firefighters and responsible agencies as fire complexes.
in response to the spread of the fire complexes,starting october,and extending for days,many evacuation orders were issued by the san diego county sheriff department and other entities,and were lifted at various times.shelter was provided to evacuees by various governmental and nonprofit agencies.after extensive firefighting efforts,the fires were mainly contained by october,but some continued into early november.these three fires the witch,guejito,and rice burned at least homes and caused the evacuation of more than persons.eventually,more than insurance claims were filed by various residents and businesses for property damage and loss of use.
in the aftermath of the fires,starting in late,lawsuits began to be filed against sdg e.some of the first complaints were purported class actions,two of which are relevant here.the first entitled clark san diego gas electric company super.san diego county,cu np ctl clark purported class action was filed november.the second entitled downing san diego gas electric,super.san diego county,cu no ctl downing purported class action also was filed on november.
at the same time,complaints were being filed by over individual plaintiffs who had determined to pursue individual claims,by insurance companies seeking to recover for payments to their insureds for fire losses,and by government entities seeking to recover for response costs,property damage,and other losses.
on october,the superior court issued a case management order requiring that seven master complaints be filed,separating claims by fire and by type of plaintiff.the superior court ordered that plaintiffs file one master complaint for individual claims related to the witch guejito fires,one for individual claims related to the rice fire,a single master complaint for all class action claims,and four additional master complaints for insurance claims and government claims in the and rice fires.under the case management order,all claimants were to file complaints that adopted all or part of a relevant master complaint.
the master liability only class action complaint master class action complaint,based on individuals claims related to the witch and guejito fires,was filed on october.it set forth a new class definition,seeking to certify a liability only class 
all persons and entities who,during the time period of october,through november,i owned,leased,or rented real property in the geographic area or ii had an ownership interest in a commercial enterprise located in the geographic area or iii resided in or worked in the geographic area and who claim property damage or loss of use of property resulting from the witch,guejito,and rice fires.this class does not include personal injury claims.
the geographic area was defined as the area of san diego county,north of interstate,as indicated in the map attached as exhibit a to the master class action complaint.the map attached to the master class action complaint depicted san diego county and included a fire perimeter for the relevant fires.it had individual dots representing structures that were destroyed,moderately damaged,or minimally damaged.labels on the map indicated that it was issued by the county of san diego department of planning and land use and the san diego geographic information service,which make their perimeter data available on the internet.
based on this class definition,class plaintiffs moved for class certification of the class.sdg e opposed class certification on the grounds that the class was not ascertainable,lacked commonality,did not have typical or adequate representatives,and was inferior to individual litigation.oppositions on similar grounds were also filed by a third party defendant added to the class action by sdg e,a group of approximately individual plaintiffs who had filed individual lawsuits,and a large group of insurer plaintiffs.
after hearing oral argument,the superior court denied certification.it found that the proposed class lacked predominance of common issues and was not superior to individual litigation.this court affirmed the superior court order denying class certification.
between the time of the fires late and the superior court denial of class certification june,about individual plaintiffs filed lawsuits against sdg e seeking to recover for losses.after denial of class certification,but before october,more than additional individual plaintiffs filed lawsuits,bringing the total number of plaintiffs who filed within the limitations period to over.in the latter half of october,almost an additional individual plaintiffs filed claims.
there also were several plaintiffs who filed suit after october,more than three years after the subject fires.one such suit is laurie sdg e super.san diego county,cu np ctl laurie adoption which was filed on october.sdg e demurred to that complaint,arguing that the statute of limitations had expired.in that case,the superior court found that the claims in the laurie adoption had been tolled 
in this case,the class action put defendants on notice of the potential claims.although the potential pool of claimants was not as strictly limited as those in becker mcmillin construction d becker,involving a known number of houses in a development,the boundaries of the fire were known.there is no requirement the precise number of claimants be identified.but it is clear sdg e was aware of the vast number of homes and businesses which had suffered damages as a result of the fire.the substantive nature of the claims,property damage due to the fires,was also known.that sdg e did not know the amount of damages is irrelevant,as damages,even in class action,are calculable on an individual basis.
even later than the laurie adoption,the perkins filed suit on september,as a plaintiff in frye sdg e super.san diego county,cu np ctl frye adoption.like the complaint in the laurie adoption,the complaint in the frye adoption incorporated by reference certain allegations from the operative master class action complaint.the perkins claimed damage to their residence that,based on its address,was located outside of the fire boundaries depicted on the map attached to the master class action complaint,but located above interstate.after a couple rounds of demurrers,the perkins filed a second amended complaint,which included causes of action for inverse condemnation,trespass,nuisance,and violation of public utilities code section and again incorporated by reference certain allegations from the operative master class action complaint.this complaint added more specifics regarding damages and included the allegation that the perkins property was within the fire boundaries.sdg e again demurred,arguing that the perkins allegation that the property was within the fire boundaries did not change the address of the property which was alleged in the second amended complaint and was located outside the fire boundaries as depicted on the master class action complaint map.sdg e also argued that the perkins claims were because class action tolling could not apply given that the requirements set forth in jolly,supra,cal d were not satisfied.
the perkins opposed sdg e demurrer,asserting that class action tolling should be permitted for anybody who claimed property damage as a result of the fires,not just for individuals located within the map fire boundaries.sdg e filed a reply.
the superior court overruled the demurrer subject to further submissions as to fire boundaries,concluding that the allegations in the class action complaints were adequate to toll the statute of limitations.however,the superior court instructed the parties to submit proposals suggesting which fire boundaries should provide the limits for class action tolling.after reviewing the parties submissions and hearing further argument,the superior court held that class action tolling was limited to properties within the fire boundaries as depicted on the map attached to the master class action complaint.thus,claims filed after october,relating to properties outside those boundaries,including the perkins claims,were.as a result,the court ultimately sustained sdg e demurrer to the perkins second amended complaint,and judgment was entered dismissing the perkins claims as.the perkins timely appealed.
discussion 
ithe tolling of the statute of limitations 
the parties do not dispute that the applicable statute of limitations is three years from the date of harm.see code civ,subds.b,c,j.the perkins allege their home was damaged in the witch fire,which began on october.they allege their home was damaged because they had to remove soot and ash deposited on various parts of their home and in their pool filter clean ventilation,heating,and air conditioning ducts obstructed by the fire and repair windows and garage doors damaged by the fire.the perkins do not allege precisely when their home was damaged,but because they attribute the damage to the witch fire,their home must have been damaged sometime in late october.the statute of limitations for their claims arising out of the fire therefore would expire no later than the end of october.the perkins,however,did not file suit until january,well over a year after the statute of limitations had expired.as such,their claims are unless they were tolled.
the perkins contend the statute of limitations on their claims were tolled under the rule created by american pipe construction utah american pipe and limited in jolly,supra,cal d.the perkins argue the superior court erred in reaching the opposite conclusion because the original complaints in the clark purported class action and the downing purported class action provided sdg e with notice of the potential claims against them including the perkins claims,and therefore,the statute of limitations was tolled and the superior court improperly relied on the fire boundaries from the map attached as exhibit a to the master class action complaint in determining tolling did not apply.we address the perkins second contention first because,within that argument,they raise the permissible scope of our review here.
a.the map of the fire perimeter 
the superior court based its conclusion that the perkins claims were on its finding that only homes that were within the fire perimeter as shown on the map attached as exhibit a to the master class action complaint could benefit from the tolling of the statute of limitations.the perkins argue this conclusion was improper because it required the court to make a finding of fact,namely the extent of the fire perimeter and whether the perkins home was located within that perimeter.sdg e counters that the court did not have to make any finding of fact,but merely had to determine if the master class action complaint provided sdg e with sufficient notice of the perkins claims.we agree with the perkins to the extent they argue it was improper for the superior court to use the map to determine if tolling applies.
the map with the fire boundaries first appeared as exhibit a to the master class action complaint.that complaint used the map to help define the term geographic area,which in turn,was part of the class definition.the master class action complaint defined the geographic area as the area of san diego county,north of interstate,as indicated in the map attached as exhibit as discussed above,the map,however,was not merely a map of san diego county.instead,it included various fire perimeters,and within those perimeters,the map indicated houses that were destroyed or sustained moderate damage or minimal damage from the various fires.
the parties do not argue that the map was involved in the motion to certify the class.instead,the map appears to have first played a role in any of the cases when the court overruled,in part,sdg e demurrer to the complaint in the laurie adoption because the boundaries of the fire were known and the substantive nature of the claims,property damage due to fires,was also known.therefore,in finding tolling appropriate as to the laurie plaintiffs,the superior court found sdg e knowledge of the boundaries of the fire critical.those fire boundaries are only defined in the map attached as exhibit a to the master class action complaint and incorporated by reference in the perkins complaint.it appears from the record that the court used the fire boundaries from the map because,without the map,the class definition would basically leave sdg e open to claims from plaintiffs across all of southern california,essentially tolling the statute of limitations for almost anyone.in other words,the superior court did not find that the class definition absent the map provided sdg e with the requisite notice to toll the statute of limitations as required by american pipe,supra,and jolly,supra,cal d.
however,in a pragmatic compromise,the court used the map to toll the statute of limitations as to any plaintiff whose property was damaged inside the fire perimeter,but not so for those with property out of it.thus,the statute of limitations on the laurie plaintiffs claims was tolled because their home was located within the fire boundary as indicated by the master class action complaint.because the perkins home was outside the fire perimeter,the court found their claims were not tolled.
we share the superior court concern regarding the proposed class definition in the master class action complaint.it is extremely broad and,if we accept the perkins contentions,would toll the statute of limitations for any person who owns or lives in a home in san diego county above interstate whose property was damaged in some way from the witch or guejito fires.nevertheless,we see no basis for allowing the superior court to use the map to narrow the class definition.indeed,we struggle to understand the definition of geographic area with its reference to the map in the master class action complaint.if the drafters of the master class action complaint had only intended the map to depict the area north of interstate,it begs the question why they would attach a map containing such detailed information like fire perimeters and damaged or destroyed homes.further,we also are puzzled why the drafters felt the need to include any map whatsoever.the complaint was filed in san diego superior court and named defendants based in san diego.it would have been a safe assumption that all parties as well as the court were aware of the area of san diego county above interstate.the master class action complaint inclusion of the map does not help define the geographic area it only obscures the definition.the court and the defendants are left to guess regarding the importance of the information contained in the map,namely the fire perimeters and damaged homes.
we understand why the superior court used the map and do not discount its usefulness in administering the large number of cases arising out of the fires.that said,we find no support in the record that the map was proposed to narrow the class definition or otherwise intended by the plaintiffs to define the class beyond the actual words of the complaint.nor do we see any indication in the record that sdg e relied on the map in challenging the class allegations or otherwise used the map beyond its demurrer to the perkins complaint,which occurred after the court applied the map to find the laurie plaintiffs claims tolled.as such,we do not conclude the map is useful or proper in determining if the perkins causes of action should be tolled.
the scope of this appeal 
even though we conclude the court erred in considering the map in finding the perkins claims were not tolled,our analysis does not end there.in reviewing the sustaining of a demurrer,we review the trial court result for error,and not its legal reasoning.mendoza town of ross th.the perkins argue that by way of this appeal,sdg e seeks to improperly relitigate past issues.specifically,the perkins maintain sdg e is challenging the superior court ruling on the demurrer to the complaint in the laurie adoption because sdg e asserts tolling was not appropriate here in any event,not merely whether tolling is limited to the homes within the fire perimeter found in the map.moreover,the perkins assert if we agree with this argument our opinion could impact several other cases not part of this appeal.however,we only consider matters that are before us.here,we are not reviewing the court minute order in the laurie adoption.nor are we analyzing the tolling as to hundreds of other individual actions filed after the statute of limitations.we are only concerned with the perkins claims within the complaint in the frye adoption.
in the instant matter,we must determine if the superior court correctly sustained sdg e demurrer to the perkins claims.to do so,we must consider whether tolling applies to the perkins claims under american pipe,supra,and jolly,supra,cal d.the parties thoroughly briefed this issue.and sdg e raised this issue in its demurrer to the perkins operative complaint below.we therefore reach the issue of the applicability of the tolling rule created by american pipe and limited in jolly to the perkins claims.see carman alvord cal d,a judgment of dismissal after a demurrer has been sustained without leave to amend will be affirmed if proper on any grounds stated in the demurrer,whether or not the court acted on that ground.
tolling absent the map 
citing american pipe,supra,the perkins contend t he filing of the class action complaints tolled the statute of limitations.however,american pipe does not support a general rule that the mere filing of a class action complaint automatically tolls the statute of limitations for all claims of any potential class member.instead,the rule is more nuanced and was limited by our high court in jolly,supra,cal d.
in american pipe,the supreme court held that the commencement of a class action suspends the applicable statute of limitations as to all asserted members of the class who would have been parties had the suit been permitted to continue as a class action.american pipe,supra,at.in that case,the court balanced the policies served by the class action rule,federal rules of civil procedure,rule,and the policies served by the statute of limitations.the case arose under the sherman antitrust act and was brought as a putative class action.after the district court denied class certification,several class members moved to intervene.although the applicable statute of limitations had run as to the intervenors,the supreme court held that their claims were not because the filing of the putative class action tolled the statute of limitations as to all alleged class members until the district court denied certification,at least where class action status has been denied solely because of failure to demonstrate that the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.american pipe,supra,at.in explaining the purpose of allowing tolling,the supreme court reasoned 
the policies of ensuring essential fairness to defendants and of barring a plaintiff who has slept on his rights,citation are satisfied when,as here,a named plaintiff who is found to be representative of a class commences a suit and thereby notifies the defendants not only of the substantive claims being brought against them,but also of the number and generic identities of the potential plaintiffs who may participate in the judgment.id.at.
prior to the california supreme court addressing the tolling rule from american pipe,supra,a california court of appeal applied the tolling rule to a new set of facts in bangert narmco materials,d bangert.in that case,the court of appeal concluded the filing of a class action complaint for both personal injury and property damage tolled the running of the statute of limitations for all members of the purported class,which consisted of all persons similarly situated who were currently residing within a mile radius of a certain plastic research plant.id.at.these purported class plaintiffs were seeking injunctive relief as well as damages stemming from injuries caused by chemical air and water pollution emanating from a factory over a year period.id.at.individuals sought to file an amended complaint after the statute of limitations had run on their claims and the superior court denied a motion to certify the class.the court of appeal reasoned that applying the tolling rule was the best approach to the problems posed by purported class members who seek to intervene following the denial of class action status.id.at.the court noted that the defendant had the essential information necessary to determine both the subject matter and size of the prospective litigation based on the purported class action complaint.ibid.
in jolly,supra,cal d,our high court considered the tolling rule set forth in american pipe,supra,and applied it to an action filed after the applicable statute of limitations by a plaintiff seeking personal injury caused by an allegedly defective drug.in doing so,the court outlined two major policy considerations that the tolling rule was designed to accommodate.the first was protection of efficiency and economy in litigation as promoted by the class action device so that putative class members would not find it necessary to seek to intervene or to join individually because of fear the class might never be certified.to this end,the california supreme court noted that tolling should apply especially in situations where a court denied class certification because of subtle factors,unforeseeable by class members.jolly,supra,at.
the second policy consideration was effectuation of the purpose of the statute of limitations to protect a defendant from unfair claims.jolly,supra,d at.in support of this policy consideration,the court stressed the importance of the purported class action complaint providing the defendant with notice of the substantive claims being brought against them as well as the number and generic identities of the potential plaintiffs,quoting american pipe,supra,at.
in jolly,supra,cal d at page,our supreme court characterized the holding of bangert,supra,d as an extension of the american pipe reasoning not only denials of certification for lack of numerosity could lead to tolling,but also,after bangert,denials for lack of an adequate community of interest could serve to toll the statute.to analyze the correctness of that extension,the court in jolly reviewed the american pipe rationale and compared the nature of the class action suit on which jolly relied to create tolling sindell abbott laboratories cal d alleging the synthetic drug estrogen diethylstilbestrol des had caused injury to the nature of jolly individual action.in comparing the two actions,the court found inadequate notice to the defendants had been given in the earlier action and disallowed tolling.the discrepancies between the nature of the relief sought in sindell and jolly declaratory relief and damages,respectively and the factual and legal issues in the two actions causation of injury and damages were too great for any notice to be presumed.considerations of protecting the class action device gave way to the stronger consideration under the circumstan
