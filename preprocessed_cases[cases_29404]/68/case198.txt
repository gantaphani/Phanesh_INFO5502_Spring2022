david sanders appeals the grant of summary judgment to his former employer,energy northwest,on his claims of retaliation in violation of the energy reorganization act the act.we have jurisdiction under.we review de novo,keenan allen,cir,and we affirm.
background 
energy northwest is a washington municipal corporation that owns and operates a nuclear power plant in richland,washington.sanders was a maintenance manager whose responsibilities included overseeing maintenance contractors working at the power plant.sanders also administered temporary staffing contracts for energy northwest.energy northwest terminated sanders employment in april,after nineteen years of employment.energy northwest maintains that it terminated sanders after determining that he had improperly approved temporary staffing per diem and travel payments to the father of his daughter child.sanders maintains that he was terminated for protected behavior under the whistleblower retaliation provision of.namely,sanders claims his objection to the severity level designation of an internal condition report constitutes protected activity under the act.
a condition report is a report generated by employees when safety procedures may have been violated.energy northwest,as a nuclear regulatory commission licensee,is required to maintain an internal system for documenting potential safety violations.see requiring the adoption of reporting procedures for noncompliance with safety standards,including evaluation and recordkeeping requirements.employees are encouraged to create condition reports on any issue perceived to pose safety concerns.once a condition report is created,a condition review group meets to determine the severity level of the report.the condition review group is composed of managers in various departments.this group reviews each condition report and assigns a severity level in decreasing order of severity alpha,bravo,charlie,or delta,with alpha requiring the most effort to review and correct.the condition review group has latitude in its designation decisions.after a severity designation is made,the condition report is reviewed in an operational focus meeting to ensure that remediation is properly undertaken.
energy northwest is also required to maintain an access authorization program to regulate access to its nuclear facility.see personnel access authorization requirements for nuclear power plants.certain background checks and assessments are required before a worker is granted unescorted access,and certain procedures are prescribed for cancellation of access privileges once a worker is terminated.a worker who has been granted an unescorted access badge generally must turn in the badge within a prescribed time frame after his employment has been completed.
in october,sanders learned that several contractors working in his maintenance department had completed their employment without turning in their access badges within the required time frame of seven days.the maintenance department was cited in an internal condition report,which was designated as a bravo.sanders wanted his maintenance department to investigate and fix this problem.however,bruce peace,the of the security department,wanted his department to investigate and fix this problem.after a heated discussion during the operational focus meeting,management told pease and sanders to resolve these differences outside the meeting.the next day,sanders told management that he and pease could not agree.management sided with sanders,allowing sanders maintenance group to investigate and remediate this issue.
about two weeks later,the security department received an internal condition report concerning one employee who was terminated without turning in his access badge within the time frame.the condition review group initially designated this condition report as a bravo.during the morning management meeting,pease offered his opinion that this condition report should have a charlie designation,and management agreed.sanders,however,disagreed,and opined that this condition report should be designated a bravo.management again asked pease and sanders to resolve their differences outside the meeting,but they again were unable to reach an agreement.the next day,sanders told the plant manager,well,i do agree with their standards.i believe that they lower standards than what we expecting from the plant.if you guys want to let it go as a charlie,i let it go as a charlie,but i not in agreement.sanders maintains that this objection over the charlie designation constitutes protected activity under the whistleblower protections of the act.
on september,sanders filed a whistleblower complaint with the department of labor.the department of labor failed to issue a final decision within one year,and sanders then filed a complaint in the district court.see b allowing a complainant to bring an action in federal district court if the department of labor has not issued a final decision within one year of filing see also tamosaitis urs,cir explaining the operation of the provision.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of energy northwest on the ground that sanders failed to establish a prima facie case of retaliation because his activity did not rise to the level of protected activity under the act or the associated case law.sanders timely appealed.
ii.retaliation claim under the act 
the whistleblower retaliation provision of the act,protects energy workers who report or otherwise act upon safety concerns.the statute specifically prohibits employers from discharging or otherwise discriminating against employees for several enumerated acts,including notifying an employer of a violation,initiating an enforcement proceeding,or testifying in a safety or enforcement proceeding.see a.the statute also includes a provision protecting employees in any other action to carry out the purposes of this chapter id.at a f.
to establish a prima facie case of retaliation under the act,an employee must show that he engaged in a protected activity the respondent knew or suspected that the employee engaged in the protected activity t he employee suffered an adverse action and t he circumstances were sufficient to raise the inference that the protected activity was a contributing factor in the adverse action.tamosaitis,at alternations in original internal quotation marks omitted.under the act approach to retaliation claims,if an employee shows that his participation in protected activity was a contributing factor in the unfavorable personnel action alleged,the burden shifts to the employer.id.quoting b c.an employer can rebut the employee prima facie case under the act if it introduces clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same unfavorable personnel action in the absence of the employee participation in such behavior.b d.
we have held that the act serves a broad,remedial purpose of protecting workers from retaliation based on their concerns for safety and quality.mackowiak.nuclear,cir.the eleventh circuit has noted that a broad interpretation is appropriate because it promotes the remedial purposes of the statute and avoids the unwitting consequence of preemptive retaliation,which would allow the whistleblowers to be fired or otherwise discriminated against with impunity for internal complaints before they have a chance to bring them before an appropriate agency.bechtel constr.sec y of labor,cir.
in bechtel,an employee carpenter disagreed with his foreman about the safety procedures for measuring the amount of radioactive contamination of the carpentry tools.id.at.the carpenter raised his concerns initially with his foreman,and then with the foreman supervisor.id.at.the eleventh circuit held that the carpenter conduct qualified as protected activity,noting that he did not merely make general inquiries regarding safety but,rather,he raised particular,repeated concerns about safety procedures for handling contaminated tools.id.the court also noted that questioning one supervisor instructions on safety procedures is tantamount to a complaint.id.
the eleventh circuit has also stated that section does not protect every act that
