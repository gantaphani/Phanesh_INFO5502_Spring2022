this case comes to us on petitions for review of a series of orders issued by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc relating to the energy crisis that occurred in california in and.nearly petitions for review of the various ferc orders have been filed in our court.we consolidated these petitions for administrative management 
on november,we issued a consolidated order in this case separating certain issues for decision in two consolidated proceedings,the first of which we termed the jurisdictional cases the second we termed the cases.in the jurisdictional cases,we considered whether ferc refund authority extended to certain governmental entities.we heard oral arguments on jurisdictional cases on april,and issued an opinion concerning the jurisdictional cases on september.bonneville power admin.ferc,cir.
the cases before us here involve numerous questions pertaining to the proper scope of ferc refund orders,including the appropriate temporal reach and the type of transactions properly subject to the refund orders.we heard oral arguments on the cases on april.this opinion covers the issues presented in the cases.
we grant in relief in part and deny relief in part.in general,we hold that all the transactions at issue in this case that occurred within the california power exchange corporation calpx or california independent system operator markets,or as a result of a calpx or transaction,were the proper subject of the refund proceedings instituted by ferc.therefore,we deny the petitions for review that challenge ferc inclusion of such transactions we grant the petitions for review that challenge ferc exclusion of such transactions.
we deny the petitions for review that seek to expand ferc refund proceedings into the bilateral markets beyond the calpx and markets.in particular,we hold that ferc properly excluded from the refund proceedings bilateral transactions between the california energy resources scheduling cers division of the california department of water resources and other entities that occurred outside the calpx and markets.
we hold that ferc properly established october,as the refund effective date for the proceedings,rather than october,as argued by some parties.however,we hold that ferc erred in excluding relief for tariff violations that occurred prior to october.we reserve consideration of all other issues raised in the various petitions for review for the next phase of our appellate proceedings.
the net effect of our decision is to preserve the scope of the existing ferc refund proceedings,but to expand those refund proceedings to include tariff violations that occurred prior to october,transactions in the calpx and markets that occurred outside the period specified by ferc,and energy exchange transactions in the calpx and markets.
parties and claims 
with that brief summary of the issues,we turn to the specific claims of the parties.the state of california and several intervenors collectively,the california parties seek review of a number of ferc decisions,namely ferc denial of relief for sales of electricity made at unjust rates prior to october,the refund effective date set by ferc ferc denial of relief for energy sales in which cers was the purchaser ferc refusal to order relief for energy exchange transactions and ferc refusal to order relief for certain forward market transactions.
a group of energy suppliers and generators called the competitive suppliers group also petitions for review of several of ferc decisions,namely ferc decision to set the refund effective date at october,rather than october,ferc order of refunds for transactions that took place during hours,and ferc inclusion of certain transactions in its refund proceedings.
the port of oakland,along with other petitioners and intervenors,petitions for review of ferc decision to exclude certain bilateral transactions from its refund order.
also before us in this case are the public entities and the bonneville power administration petitions for review of ferc determination that it had authority to order relief for certain transactions known as sleeve and transactions,as well as transactions occurring under c of the federal power act.the california parties have moved to strike,and el paso merchant energy company has moved to defer,consideration of the arguments until the next phase of our consideration of the ferc orders.
factual background 
during the,ferc began examining whether the wholesale electric power industry should have been restructured and deregulated to separate generation,transmission,and distribution functions.generation involves the production of power through a variety of means.transmission generally refers to the conveyance of high voltage electric power from the points of generation to substations for conversion to delivery voltages.distribution refers to the delivery of the converted low voltage energy from substations to individual consumers.the theory behind separating these functions,known as unbundling,was that wholesale power competition would be promoted,and consumers would benefit,if public utilities were required to provide nondiscriminatory,open access,transmission.see promoting wholesale competition through open access transmission services by public utilities.proposed april,codified at et.this examination culminated in the issuance of ferc order in.order,promoting wholesale competition through nondiscriminatory transmission services by public utilities,may,ferc order,on reh g,on reh g,on reh g,aff transmission access policy study group ferc,per curiam,aff sub nom.new york ferc,d.among other provisions,ferc order included a series of regulations that provided for the creation of competitive markets for wholesale electric power,including the creation of independent regional transmission companies that would allow the development of a competitive electric transmission market.
prior to these events,the california electricity market was composed of utilities,whose generation,transmission,and distribution of electricity were vertically integrated and regulated by the california public utilities commission cpuc,the state agency charged with regulating retail electricity rates.cal.pub.the cpuc set retail electrical rates charged by the utilities providing service in exclusive service territories.there are three major utilities in california pacific gas and electric company pg e,southern california edison company edison,and san diego gas and electric company sdg e.
in response to ferc order and energy problems in,the cpuc and the california legislature commenced initiatives to restructure the california electric energy industry.the aim was to convert california,regulated utilities,to a deregulated market,in which the price of electricity would be established by competition,and consumers could select their electrical power supplier.the theory was that competition would lead to better service and a price reduction for consumers.
toward this end,the california legislature enacted assembly bill ab.act of september,cal.legis.serv.codified at cal.pub.the deregulation was to proceed in several phases,beginning with the deregulation of the wholesale electricity market.after a transition period during which the utilities were to recover their stranded costs through fixed prices for electricity,the retail market was to be deregulated 
under ab,the major,vertically integrated utilities were required to divest a substantial portion of their power generation plants,including fossil fuel generation plants but excluding hydroelectric facilities and nuclear power plants,to unregulated,producers.this divestiture was accomplished by a process of market valuation,based on a discount of projected future revenue streams.see order instituting rulemaking on commission proposed policies governing restructuring california electric service industry and reforming regulation,cpuc,wl,cpuc decision.between and,electrical generation plants were sold.
after divesting the bulk of their generation assets,the utilities were required to sell all of their remaining output to calpx,a nonprofit wholesale created by ab.calpx was to provide a centralized auction market for trading electricity.it was deemed a public utility pursuant to the federal power act,see e,and thus subject to regulation by ferc,see b,d.it operated pursuant to a tariff and ferc wholesale rate schedules.pacific gas,ferc at,reh g denied,ferc.the utilities were required to purchase all of electrical energy that they required from the calpx markets and to conduct all of their sales through the calpx market.part of the underlying theory was that the utilities could not exercise market power in a single transparent market,either as a buyer or a seller,because prices would be posted and all market participants would be paid the same price.
calpx commenced operations in.initially,it operated only a single price auction for its spot markets,defined as sales that are hours or less and that are entered into the day of or day prior to delivery.san diego gas,et,ferc at june,order.the price in the calpx spot market was determined by evaluating bids submitted by market participants.as we described the procedure in public utility dist.of snohomish county dynegy power marketing,dynegy,cir 
a seller could submit a series of bids that consisted of pairs representing offers to sell units at each,but units if the price is each.similarly,a buyer could submit a series of bids that consisted of pairs representing offers to buy.the px would then establish aggregate supply and demand curves and set the market clearing price at the intersection of the two curves.
once the market clearing price had been established,every exchange would take place at the market clearing price,even though some buyers had been willing to pay more and some sellers had been willing to sell for less.id.
the calpx spot market,or core market as it is sometimes called,consisted of trading,in which the market clearing price was derived from the sellers and buyers price and quantity determinations for the next day energy transactions and day of or trading,in which calpx would determine on an hourly basis,a single market clearing price which all suppliers would be paid.purchases made in the calpx spot market were deemed by cpuc to be prudent per se.see cpuc decision,wl at.
in practice,the calpx spot market generated considerable price uncertainty.therefore,calpx started a division,termed calpx trading services cts,to operate a block forward market by matching supply and demand bids for long term electricity markets.in,calpx allowed the utilities to purchase only a limited percentage of their combined load in the cts forward market.they were required to purchase the balance of their load in the calpx spot market.
ab created another nonprofit entity,the independent system operator,also subject to ferc jurisdiction,which was to be responsible for managing california electricity transmission grid and balancing electrical supply and demand.although the utilities continued to own the transmission facilities,exercised operational control over the grid.the grid included the transmission systems of pg e,edison,sdg e,and the cities of vernon,anaheim,banning,and riverside,california.to maintain the grid,was authorized to procure both energy needed to balance the grid imbalance energy and operating reserves sometimes referred to as ancillary services.the imbalance energy market is the real time market,in which bids to supply energy were to be made no later than minutes prior to the operating hour.would rank the supply bids and purchase the required energy at the price.would then bill calpx for electricity it required.calpx would,in turn,bill the utilities,who were forced to pay whatever price that paid its suppliers,even though that price might have exceeded what the utilities could have charged their consumers as a consequence of the retail price freeze.
because was responsible for ensuring that all electricity demand was met,was required to buy energy outside the calpx market to make up the energy shortfall if sellers in the calpx market were unable or unwilling to provide enough supply to meet california demand during a particular period.acquired operating reserves,constituting capacity that could be converted to energy and delivered to the grid in response to unexpected events,such as power outages,from ancillary services suppliers who would agree to reserve capacity during the specified period.the ancillary suppliers would agree to supply the required electricity during the specified period on demand from,and were to be paid regardless of whether their capacity was used.all of these operations were to be governed by a tariff and protocols filed with ferc.
as we now know,something happened on the way to the trading forum,and the best laid regulatory plans went astray.the plan to establish a competitive market,while keeping the exercise of monopoly and monopsony power in check,failed to account for energy economics and the sophistication of modern energy trading.as became clear in hindsight,even those who controlled a relatively small percentage of the market had sufficient market power to skew markets artificially.in short,the old assumptions,based on antitrust theory,that market power could not be exercised by those who possessed less than of the market share proved inaccurate in california energy market.
with the new structure,over of the transactions were being made in the spot converse of most other electricity markets,in which more than of transactions are made through long term forward contracts,lending stability to the markets.sellers quickly learned that the california spot markets could be manipulated by withholding power from the market to create scarcity and then demanding extremely high prices when scarcity was probable.the energy market is highly dependent upon weather heat waves or cold snaps inevitably produce demand.thus,it was quickly apparent to sellers that there was little risk and great profit in withholding capacity when high demand was anticipated based on weather forecasts.in addition,traders soon developed other purely artificial means of market manipulation,such as shutting down power plants when electric demand was high in order to destabilize the electric grid,and to increase prices.in order to maximize profit,traders engaged in anomalous bidding practices,including bidding,in which an extremely high price is demanded for a small portion of the market,and round trip trades,in which an entity artificially creates the appearance of increased revenue and demand through continuous sales and purchases.
enron corporation allegedly gamed the california markets with impunity,using manipulative corporate strategies,such as those nicknamed fatboy,get shorty,and death star.under the death star strategy,enron allegedly sought to be paid for moving energy to relieve congestion without actually moving any energy or relieving any congestion.all of the demand was created artificially and fraudulently,creating the appearance of congestion,and then satisfied artificially,without the company providing any energy.fatboy refers to a strategy through which enron allegedly withheld previously deliveries of power to the forward market so that it could sell the energy at a higher price on the spot market.the company would its load supply only enough power to cover the inflated schedule,and thus,leave extra supply in the market,for which would pay the company.via the get shorty strategy,traders were able to fabricate and sell operating reserves to,receive payment,then cancel the schedules and cover their commitments by purchasing through a cheaper market closer to the time of delivery.
the california parties allege that enron was not alone,and criminal charges have been filed against a number of energy traders and executives.for example,the california parties allege that powerex corporation engaged in fraudulent power scheduling to serve false load schedules.the vice president of powerex western trading desk pleaded guilty to wire fraud for submitting false schedules.according to the california parties,executives of reliant energy services,directed traders to engage in manipulative strategies.
beginning in may,energy prices in california began to escalate dramatically.low cost hydroelectric power from the northwest was not available in the volume of previous years,and wholesale electricity prices skyrocketed,particularly in the calpx spot markets.in may,the average prices in the calpx spot market were double those of may.
on june,energy consumers in northern california experienced their first wave of rolling blackouts.the california parties allege that this occurred because of market manipulation.they claim that the data indicates that the large california generators utilized economic or physical withholding strategies of the time during the may through november period.
under its operating procedures,would declare a system emergency when its operating reserves dipped below a predetermined percentage of its projected demand.whenever reserves in california fell below seven percent,the iso declared a stage system emergency.june,order,ferc at.the hours during which declared a emergency are also called reserve deficiency hours.san diego,et,ferc at december,order.during the summer of,high temperatures and lack of supply forced the to declare system emergencies times.see san diego,et,ferc at.
in addition to blackouts,brownouts and system emergencies,the crisis proved enormously expensive to purchasers of retail power,who were unable to pass along the increased cost to their consumers.in june,california spent more on purchasing energy than in the entire summer of.this increase occurred despite the fact that peak demand was lower in than in.the california utilities,who were still subject to the price freeze that was supposed to lock in their profits,lost billions of dollars.cooler weather in the fall did not cool prices.prices continued to escalate throughout the last quarter of.
in august,sdg e filed a complaint under of the federal power act,a,against all sellers of energy and ancillary services in the calpx and markets.sdg e requested that ferc impose a price cap on sales into those markets.other parties,including pg e and the state of california,joined the complaint.
on august,ferc issued an order denying the relief requested by sdg e,but determining that it was appropriate to investigate the justness and reasonableness of the rates for all sales in the calpx and markets.san diego gas,et,ferc august,order.therefore,it established its own investigatory proceeding in ferc docket nos.and the remedy proceedings.the august,order established october,as the refund effective date,which was determined by calculating the date sixty days after publication of notice of the order in the federal register.id.at.
on november,ferc issued an order proposing structural changes to the operation of the calpx and markets.san diego gas,et,ferc november,order.in the november,order,ferc concluded that 
t he electric market structure and market rules for wholesale sales of electric energy in california are seriously flawed and these structures and rules,in conjunction with an imbalance of supply and demand in california,have caused,and continue to have the potential to cause,unjust and unreasonable rates for energy,ancillary services and energy sales under certain conditions.
ferc concluded that there was clear evidence that sellers could exercise market power when supply is tight and produce unjust and unreasonable rates for wholesale power sales.id.at.
the november,order proposed,effective sixty days after the date of the order,to eliminate the requirement that the utilities buy and sell power exclusively through the calpx require market participants to schedule percent of their transactions in the market or be subject to a penalty charge replace the existing calpx and stakeholder boards with independent boards and require the filing of generator interconnection procedures.
in addition to ordering structural and rule changes,ferc ordered an evidentiary hearing to determine the appropriate refund.at the behest of the california parties,ferc changed the refund effective date from october,to october,based on the filing of the sdg e complaint.ferc also limited the refund to and calpx spot market transactions completed during the period from october,through june,hereinafter referred to as the refund period.
emergency conditions continued following the issuance of the november,order,requiring to serve increasingly larger portions of its load through the real time imbalance energy market and depleting operating reserves.as a result,proposed changes to its tariff,which ferc approved in an order dated december.cal.indep.operator,et,ferc.
one provision of this order lifted the price caps,with the goal of attracting more supply into the auction markets.on december,ferc issued an order substantially adopting the remedies proposed in the november,order.san diego gas,et,ferc december,order.the december,order attempted to reduce the reliance on spot markets by terminating calpx wholesale rate schedules,thereby eliminating the requirement that the utilities buy and sell all generation through calpx.calpx sought a writ of mandamus from our court challenging the december,order prohibition of the utilities selling power on a voluntary basis in the calpx market and the termination of the wholesale tariff.the city of san diego also challenged the december,order by writ of mandate,arguing that ferc had unreasonably delayed taking action on the purchasers requests for refunds.we denied those petitions on april.in re cal.power exch,cir.
on december,edison filed a suit against ferc,alleging that it had failed in its responsibility to ensure that wholesale electricity was sold at reasonable rates.
the calpx market began to collapse and the utilities were fast becoming insolvent.on january,the governor of california declared a state of emergency and ordered the california department of water resources to purchase energy on behalf of california consumers to halt the rolling blackouts.subsequently,the california legislature on february,enacted assembly bill of the first extraordinary session authorizing the department of water resources to purchase power until december.cal.water code,et.
following the governor declaration,cers began buying power on january.energy sellers began refusing to sell to,and instead sold directly to the utilities and cers through bilateral contracts.most sales after january,were made directly to cers,rather than through calpx or.calpx ceased market operations on january,and filed for protection under chapter of the bankruptcy code on march.the california parties allege that from january,to june,cers purchased more than billion of energy in the spot market.
on march,the california electricity oversight board filed a motion with ferc,asking ferc to clarify that the remedy proceedings included cers transactions outside of the calpx and markets.the contended that the sellers that had manipulated the markets were now charging the same or higher rates for the cers sales.
on march,ferc issued an order establishing a provisional formula governing refunds during the january period.san diego gas,et,ferc march,order.the order directed wholesale sellers to provide refunds or,alternatively,to justify their charges and costs for transactions made during power emergencies that were above a rate it calculated as appropriate.ferc estimated that approximately million in january electricity sales would be subject to refunds.
on april,pg e filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy pursuant to chapter of the bankruptcy code.although edison and sdg e were in similar financial peril,they avoided bankruptcy filings through arrangements with creditors.
on april,ferc issued an order establishing a prospective mitigation and monitoring plan for wholesale prices through the real time markets operated by.san diego gas,et,ferc april,order.the april,order established a pricing mechanism for sales by california generators made to when reserves fell below seven percent.the order also established conditions,including refund liability,for rate authority with the goal of preventing bidding behavior in the real time market.
on june,ferc issued an order reaffirming that as a result of the seriously flawed electric market structure and rules for wholesale sales of electric energy in california,unjust and unreasonable rates were charged,and could continue to be charged during certain times and under certain conditions,unless certain targeted remedies were implemented.june,order,ferc at.
the june,order imposed price caps on all spot market sales from june,through september,and imposed a obligation on generators to prevent them from withholding supply.the prospective price mitigation plan applied to all sellers that voluntarily sold power into the and other designated spot markets,or that voluntarily used or other interstate transmission facilities subject to ferc jurisdiction.according to the california parties,the effect of the june order was to put an end to the rolling blackouts,catastrophically high prices,and power emergencies.
on july,the administrative law judge alj issued a report and recommendation to ferc regarding a refund methodology to govern sales during the refund period.san diego gas,et,ferc.in response to the report and recommendation,ferc issued an order on july,in the refund proceedings establishing the framework for refunds of past sales in the spot markets operated by calpx and.san diego gas et,ferc july,order.ferc ordered limited refunds for the rates it had determined to be unjust and unreasonable and established a mitigated market clearing price mmcp in an attempt to replicate what it believed to be the just and reasonable rates that an unmanipulated competitive energy market would have produced.under the mmcp methodology,refunds were to be determined by the difference between the market clearing price,which was the price charged by all electricity suppliers at a given time,and the mmcp calculated for each hour of the refund period,subject to certain adjustments.ferc also ordered an evidentiary hearing to calculate the appropriate mmcps for each hour of the refund period and the amount of refunds owed.
however,ferc declined to order refund relief for sales that occurred before the refund period,or for any sales outside of the calpx and markets.ferc also excluded transactions of more than hours in length,even if those sales were made in the calpx and markets within the refund period.the california parties contend that refunds for sales prior to the refund period would total billion in seller overcharges that refunds for emergency purchases made by cers would total billion in seller overcharges and that other improperly excluded transactions would amount to over million in seller overcharges.
on december,enron corporation filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code.
on december,ferc issued another order addressing mitigation of the california spot market prices and conditions.december,order,ferc,et.the order clarified that the price mitigation plans applied to all sales into the spot markets and provided further explanation for why ferc chose october,as the refund effective date.ferc issued an order denying rehearing of the december,order on may.
on february,ferc opened a investigation ferc enforcement proceeding pursuant to et.into seller market manipulation of the energy markets in the western united states.investigation of potential manipulation of natural gas prices,ferc at.ferc noted that allegations had been made in the enron bankruptcy that enron had used its market position to distort electric and natural gas markets.ferc directed its staff to investigate whether any entity,including enron corporation through its affiliates or subsidiaries,manipulated prices in electric energy or natural gas markets in the west or otherwise exercised undue influence over wholesale prices in the west,for the period january,forward.id.
in june,some of the california parties moved this court for permission to present additional evidence of market manipulation in the remedy proceedings.ferc opposed the motion.on august,we directed ferc to allow the parties to present evidence of market manipulation in the remedy proceedings,to reconsider its earlier orders denying relief,and to provide to the court supplemental findings of fact and any recommended modifications to ferc orders on the basis of such new evidence.
on march,the state of california,through its attorney general,filed a complaint alleging that generators and marketers selling power into markets operated by calpx and,as well as those making spot market sales of energy to cers,violated of the federal power act by failing to comply with various filing requirements.the complaint also challenged ferc approval of tariffs.on may,ferc dismissed the complaint as constituting a collateral attack on prior ferc orders and denied the complaint with respect to the allegations that ferc rate filing requirements violated the federal power act as a matter of law.state of california ex rel.lockyer power,et,ferc may,order.california filed a petition for review of the may,order.
in december,the alj determined that suppliers owed approximately billion to and calpx for sales at rates in excess of a just and reasonable rate.san diego gas,et,ferc.ferc adopted in part,and modified in part,the alj proposed findings in an order issued march,order.san diego gas,et,ferc march,order.
in its march,order,ferc stated that it would not alter any of its previous orders in the remedy proceedings concerning the time or transaction limitations in light of the evidence presented to the alj.this position was reaffirmed in subsequent ferc orders on october,which also clarified some refund calculation issues.san diego gas,et,ferc san diego gas,et,ferc.subsequently,ferc issued a number of orders pertaining to calculation of refunds during the refund period.san diego gas,et,ferc san diego gas,et,ferc san diego gas,et,ferc,and san diego gas,et,ferc,order on reh g,ferc.
on september,we granted in part california petition for review challenging the may,order.state of california ex rel.lockyer ferc,cir lockyer.we held that ferc decision to approve tariffs in the wholesale electricity market did not violate the federal power act.id.at.we also held that ferc erred as a matter of law in concluding retroactive refunds were not available under.id.at.we remanded the case to ferc for further proceedings.
before us in the instant case are those portions of the petitions for review that involve the issues.we review ferc orders to determine whether they are arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,unsupported by substantial evidence,or not in accordance with law.cal.dep t of water res.ferc,cir.ferc factual findings are conclusive if supported by substantial evidence.l b bear lake watch,ferc,cir.substantial evidence means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.id.quoting eichler sec,cir.if the evidence is susceptible of more than one rational interpretation,we must uphold ferc findings.id.we review questions of law de novo.am.rivers ferc,cir.we review ferc interpretation of the fpa under the familiar analysis established in chevron,natural res.def.council,d and its progeny.bonneville power,at.
temporal scope of refunds 
under a of the federal power act,ferc may investigate whether a particular rate or charge is just and reasonable.a.if ferc finds a rate unreasonable,it must order the imposition of a just and reasonable rate.id.d.ferc may then order refunds for any period subsequent to the refund effective date,a date ferc establishes that must be at least sixty days after the filing of the complaint.id.b.under the express language of,however,ferc may not order refunds for any period prior to the filing of the complaint.id.section of the federal power act,on the other hand,gives ferc authority to order refunds if it finds violations of the filed tariff and imposes no temporal limitations.consol.edison ferc.
in its august,order,ferc established october,as the refund effective date pursuant to.in its november,order,ferc modified the refund effective date to october.the competitive suppliers group argues that october,was the proper refund effective date.the california parties do not dispute ferc establishment of october,as the refund effective date for the proceedings,but argue that ferc arbitrarily and capriciously refused to order refunds for tariff violations under for periods prior to october.
we conclude that ferc order establishing october,as the refund effective date for the refund proceedings was not arbitrary or capricious,an abuse of discretion,unsupported by substantial evidence,or not in accordance with law.
sdg e filed its initial complaint on august.in its response to sdg e filing,ferc,in its august,order,announced that it would commence its own investigation and set the refund effective date sixty days after ferc published an announcement of the investigation.the notice was published august,therefore,the refund effective date was set as october.
on september,some of the california parties,notably pg e and edison,requested that ferc establish an earlier refund date based on the filing of the sdg e complaint,rather than on ferc commencement of the enforcement proceedings.given sdg e august,filing date,the earliest possible refund effective date was october.in the november,order,ferc granted the request and reset the refund effective date to october.
thus,the question at issue here is whether ferc properly tethered the refund effective date to the sdg e complaint.although ferc denied the remedy sought by sdg e in its complaint,it did not dismiss the sdg e complaint rather,it consolidated the sdg e complaint with its own investigation for purposes of hearing and decision in view of their common issues of law and fact.december,order,ferc at.despite consolidation,ferc made it clear that the august,order established two separate,but related,investigations.id.at.according to ferc,the investigation into the justness and reasonableness of sellers rates in the iso and px markets that resulted in the refund order grew out of sdg e complaint.id.
in addition,ferc noted that its policy is to establish the earliest refund effective date allowed in order to give maximum protection to consumers.id.at.this interpretation is consistent with ferc primary purpose in protecting consumers.lockyer,at.
the competitive suppliers group argues that the sdg e complaint can not form the basis for establishing the refund effective date because sdg e did not seek refunds pursuant to in its complaint,and ferc complaints must specify relief sought.to be sure,a requires complaints to ferc to state the change or changes to be made in the rate,charge,classification,rule,regulation,practice,or contract then in force a.it is also quite true that sdg e did not seek a refund remedy in its initial complaint.sdg e complaint sought an emergency order capping prices in the calpx and markets and a ruling enforcing the cap through limitations on authorizations.
however,the relief sought in the initial complaint is not dispositive of this issue.the key question is whether the sdg e complaint afforded sufficient notice to alert market participants that sales and purchases might be subject to refund.the gravamen of the sdg e complaint was that the rates charges by sellers were unjust and unreasonable.as ferc points out,a complaint challenging the reasonableness of the rates can lead to a refund under,even if a refund remedy is not specifically designated in the initial complaint.ferc is empowered to investigate the reasonableness of a rate either in the context of a complaint or sua sponte.indeed,as we have noted,the federal power act requires ferc to establish a refund effective date whenever it institutes a investigation.b.
further,some of the california parties promptly sought rehearing of ferc initial determination of the refund effective date in its august,order.in short,market participants were quickly apprised that the original refund effective date might be subject to revision.as ferc noted requests for rehearing of the august order raising the refund effective date issue were timely filed.thus,any reliance by sellers on the october refund effective date prior to the issuance of a final order was at their own risk.december,order,ferc at.therefore,because sdg e complaint unquestionably could have led to a ferc refund order,because the original ferc order establishing the refund effective date was not final,and because rehearing petitions were timely filed challenging the refund effective date,sdg e filing of its complaint provided sufficient notice to the market to satisfy.
the fact that two investigations were initiated by ferc does not alter this conclusion.the investigation initiated by sdg e complaint focused on whether the sellers rates in the calpx and markets were just and reasonable the separate ferc investigation focused on whether the calpx and market rules and institutional factors required modification.as ferc noted in its august,order 
while the sdg e has focused on the performance of sellers in the market,the action of sellers may in part be caused by the current market rules and institutional structures.accordingly,we conclude that it is appropriate to investigate not only the justness and reasonableness of public utility sellers rates in the px and iso markets,but also to investigate the tariffs and agreements of the iso and px to determine whether market rules or institutional factors embodied in those tariffs and agreements need to be modified.
in short,ferc launched a investigation into the justness and reasonableness of the rates pursuant to the sdg e complaint and initiated its own investigation into the calpx and tariffs and agreements to determine whether market rules required modification.the competitive suppliers group argues that the investigation became subsumed into the market investigation.however,this contention contradicts the plain language employed by ferc when it established the two investigations and the subsequent treatment of the investigations in later ferc orders.no substantive consolidation was ever ordered.even if the cases had been substantively consolidated,consolidation would not necessarily eviscerate a validly established refund effective date based on the original sdg e complaint.refunds were eventually ordered as a direct result of the sdg e complaint.given all these considerations,we conclude that ferc did not act arbitrarily or capriciously,abuse its discretion,or act in violation of law in setting the refund effective date based on the sdg e complaint.
ferc authority to order refunds for filed rates that are later determined to be unjust,unreasonable,or discriminatory derives from and of the federal power act.ferc also has remedial authority to require that entities violating the federal power act pay restitution for profits gained as a result of a statutory or tariff violation.consol.edison,at towns of concord,norwood wellesley ferc,cal.edison ferc.this authority derives from of the federal power act,which authorizes ferc to perform any and all acts,and to prescribe,issue,make,amend,and rescind such orders,rules,and regulations as it may find necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of this act.unlike refund proceedings commenced under,no time limits apply to remedial actions filed pursuant to.
in its july,order,ferc declined to award any relief pursuant to.the california parties sought review of that decision.we granted the california parties motion for an order requiring ferc to entertain further evidence of market manipulation and tariff violation and to reconsider its orders limiting remedies.after receiving further evidence,ferc ruled that it would not consider further remedies.march,order,ferc at.the california parties petition for review of ferc refusal to consider remedies.
we conclude that ferc decision not to consider a remedy for tariff violations was arbitrary and capricious,an abuse of discretion,and not in accordance with law.on appellate review,ferc must be able to demonstrate that it has made a reasoned decision based upon substantial evidence in the record.states power ferc,internal quotations omitted.ferc must articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.motor vehicle mfrs.of the,state farm mut.ins,d.
in this case,ferc offers several rationales for refusing to grant tariff relief.first,it claims that precludes refunds prior to the refund effective date.second,it contends that no tariff violations occurred.third,it argues that it need not provide remedies to the california parties because it has commenced prosecutorial investigations into the question of whether tariff violations occurred,and those investigations may result in remedies which would make the market whole.none of these justifications is sufficient to sustain ferc decision under the applicable standard of review.
first,ferc claim that it is precluded from ordering period relief under may be quickly dispatched.the relief sought by the california parties in this part of the proceeding is based on,not.although the proceedings seeking refunds because of unjust and unreasonable rates are limited to the refund period,proceedings based on tariff violations are not.ferc apparent conclusion that the time limits applicable to proceedings also apply to proceeding is incorrect as a matter of law.indeed,ferc emphasized as much in its own filings in the investigatory proceedings 
thus,with respect to the period prior to the october,refund effective date,the commission can order disgorgement of monies above the post october,refunds ordered in the california refund proceeding,if it finds violations of the iso and px tariffs and finds that a monetary remedy is appropriate for such violations.further,while refund protection has been in effect for sales in the iso and px energy markets since october,the commission can additionally order additional disgorgement of unjust profits for tariff violations that occurred after october,to june.
enron power,ferc at.to the extent that ferc is claiming that the time limits apply to proceedings,ferc is wrong.
second,ferc alleges there were no tariff violations,contending that there is no basis for finding that the sellers acted inconsistently with tariffs or with specific requirements in their filed rate authorizations.july,order,ferc at.this conclusion is flatly inconsistent with ferc commencement of the ferc enforcement proceeding,which was initiated to investigate and prosecute tariff violations.it contradicts the conclusion of ferc staff,accepted by ferc,that bid prices in the period were excessively elevated solely for the purpose of raising prices in violation of the and calpx rules.investigation of anomalous bidding behavior and practices in the western markets,ferc at.ferc concluded that the remedy for these tariff violations,if found to exist,would be the disgorgement of any unjust profits attributable to these tariff violations.id.at.
ferc assertion in this proceeding that there were no tariff violations prior to the refund period is contravened by its own findings in american electric power service,to wit 
as discussed below,the entities listed in the caption identified entities appear to have participated in activities gaming practices,that constitute gaming anomalous market behavior in violation of the california independent system operator corporation iso and california power exchange px tariffs during the period january,to june,that warrant a monetary remedy of disgorgement of unjust profits and that may warrant other additional,appropriate remedies.these determinations are based on certain of the tariffs provisions,an iso study,a report by commission staff,and evidence and comments submitted by market participants.
ferc at.see also enron power,ferc.
in addition to ferc own conclusions,the california parties also presented significant evidence of pervasive tariff violations during the period.in sum,there is no support for ferc second rationale for denying the california parties request for period relief.
ferc third stated reason for denying the request is that it is pursuing tariff violations in the separate ferc enforcement proceeding.obviously,this rationale contradict ferc second no tariff violations exist.this reason for rejecting the california parties request for relief is also unsupportable.
in explaining its third reason for denying the request,ferc describes at length its broad investigatory and prosecutorial authority under a f and.however,no one disputes this authority.what ferc fails to explain,or support,is how its inherent authority to commence investigations and enforcement proceedings under et.precludes a civil proceeding instituted by third party complaint.
the two types of proceedings are quite distinct.one is investigative and prosecutorial the other is a contested proceeding.ferc enjoys broad discretion in the management of its own prosecutorial investigations.ferc i nvestigations may be formal or preliminary,and public or private.in contrast to an adjudicated,contested proceeding,in a proceeding,ferc may settle claims without review,and need not justify its decision to order refunds,or to decline to order refunds.
because investigations are prosecutorial in nature,third parties do not participate.for example,in this case ferc denied the california parties motion to intervene in the ferc enforcement proceeding,explaining 
the commission intends the proceedings listed in the caption of this order to proceed as investigative and,where appropriate,enforcement proceedings.their purpose is to examine instances of potential wrongdoing and take remedial action where needed.the commission is thus acting in a prosecutorial manner in these matters,rather than strictly as an adjudicator 
this has important implications,particularly with respect to potential intervenors.there are no parties to an investigative proceeding.moreover,only a party can contest a settlement,h another implication of the application is the commission rules governing communications.these rules apply only to contested,proceedings they do not apply to part investigations unless the commission specifically makes an exception to allow formal interventions and party status.c 
consequently,the commission is treating all pending motions for intervention as motions to file comments and,to the extent the commission to date may have erroneously allowed intervention,rescinding those interventions that have heretofore been granted.
investigation of potential market manipulation of natural gas prices,ferc at 
commissioner massey dissented from this decision,writing 
i do not agree that the investigation of anomalous bidding behavior and practices in the western markets should be treated exclusively as an investigation under part and that there should be no parties to the proceeding.much of the evidence supporting the investigation was adduced by parties pursuant to a court order in the california refund proceeding.the california parties are integral to the assessment of and weight to be given the evidence.the commission should not decide,in isolated enforcement proceedings,issues upon which the adduced evidence has a bearing where those that adduced the evidence are not parties and have no appeal rights.
at various times,ferc has stated that it reserves the right to impose inquiries in the ferc enforcement proceedings however,in these proceedings to date,it has only pursued investigations into the actions of various market participants,rather than conducting a inquiry.san diego gas,et,ferc at.ferc itself casts its approach as supplemental to the adjudicative refund proceedings undertaken pursuant to.see,san diego gas,et,ferc at any such disgorgement or other appropriate remedies would be in addition to the refunds associated with the mitigated market clearing prices developed pursuant to this order and could apply to conduct both prior to the refund period and during the refund period.ferc at the payment to be made by reliant will be in addition to any refund ultimately owed by reliant as part of the refund proceeding in docket no,et.
in contrast,the california parties seek a refund remedy for tariff violations pursuant to through its adjudicative filing.the fact that ferc may be seeking similar remedies against specific companies in its investigations does not justify its denial of the california parties request for relief.when parties seek adjudicative relief from an agency,they are entitled to a reasoned response from the agency.here,the california parties filed a cognizable request for relief and tendered credible evidence in support of their request.a party valid request for relief can not be denied purely on the basis that the agency is considering its own enforcement action that may impart a portion of the relief sought.if an aggrieved party tenders sufficient evidence that tariffs have been violated,then it is entitled to have ferc adjudicate whether the tariff has been violated and what relief is appropriate.
in sum,none of the reasons given by ferc for refusing to adjudicate whether tariffs were violated is sustainable.section relief is not limited by.ferc determination that no tariff violations occurred is not supported by the record.ferc can not avoid adjudicating a petition because it may or may not choose to commence a separate enforcement action.for these reasons,we conclude that ferc categorical rejection of the california parties request for relief was arbitrary,capricious,and an abuse of discretion.therefore,we grant the petition for review as it pertains to the california parties challenge to ferc foreclosure of relief for tariff violations.we deny the california parties petition insofar as it calls for us to decide the merits of its request for relief.we do not prejudge how ferc should address the merits or fashion a remedy if appropriate.ferc can not,however,categorically refuse to entertain the application it must address the merits.
out of market spot transactions 
ferc july,order mandated retrospective relief for sales to,including oom transactions.these purchases were made by from sellers outside the single price auction market within hours or less of delivery,and served to stabilize the grid when supply was insufficient to meet demand.because had no choice but to buy energy to ensure grid reliability,potential sellers were in a position to exercise improper market leverage by exploiting the structural flaws in the market.ferc concluded that the oom transactions provided the best opportunity for extracting unjust and unreasonable rates and therefore,made them subject to potential refunds.
the competitive suppliers group petitions for review of ferc decision to include oom sales into the because ferc made no express finding that the rates charged for oom sales were unjust and unreasonable and the remedy proceedings had been limited since their inception to the auction market.we deny this petition for review.
section a of the federal power act requires that before ferc can exercise its remedial power to mitigate an existing rate,it must find an existing rate unjust,unreasonable,unduly discriminatory or preferential.a fed.power comm sierra pac.power.the competitive suppliers group argues that although ferc made a finding that prices within the auction markets were unjust and unreasonable,they never made such a finding with respect to oom sales to.
in its july,order,ferc adopted the mmcp to calculate just and reasonable rates for and calpx.the mmcp was the benchmark for determining the amount of refunds that sellers had to simply looked at their transactions during the refund period then ordered them to pay the difference between the rate and the mmcp.
application of the mmcp was a determination that a rate was unjust and unreasonable.as ferc explains in its brief,
b ecause the conditions under which oom spot transactions were entered into made it likely that the rates for those transactions were unjust and unreasonable,ferc required that all transactions be examined to decide which ones would be subject to refund a mitigation methodology was needed in the and calpx auction markets because systemic dysfunctions caused by structural problems in those markets had the potential to cause unjust and unreasonable rates independent of any conclusive showing of a specific abuse of power.in addition,a showing of market power abuse is not a prerequisite for finding rates are outside the zone of reasonableness and,therefore,unjust and unreasonable.
ferc,citing july,order.
ferc analysis of this issue is correct.the federal power act does not require the detailed individualized finding that competitive suppliers group requests,nor does it require a showing of market power abuses,and no court has held that it does.
ferc found that there was systemic dysfunction in the wholesale energy market and that,during the time that was making oom purchases,it was in an emergency situation,which gave the sellers even greater market power,and thus increased the likelihood that the rates were unjust and unreasonable.these facts constituted a sufficient finding that the rates were unjust and unreasonable.ferc was not required to make an additional individualized finding,in addition to the imposition of the mmcp,that rates for oom transactions were unjust and unreasonable.
contrary to the competitive suppliers group argument,the remedy proceedings were not limited to the and calpx auction markets.first,nothing in the language of the august,complaint or early orders necessarily limited the remedy proceedings to the and calpx transactions.indeed,the sdg e complaint was directed against all sellers in the iso and px markets.ferc did not add the oom transactions to the proceeding.rather,it clarified in its orders that the transactions were encompassed in the scope of the sdg e complaint proceeding.
second,ferc offered a sufficient explanation as to why the oom transactions were subject to refunds,namely that the purchases,like purchases,were made to procure the resources necessary to reliably operate the grid.july,order,ferc at.therefore,there was no meaningful distinction to be drawn between the in and transactions.ferc further noted that the oom transactions were contemplated in the tariff as a backstop to the auction market.
the competitive suppliers group points out that oom transactions made by are fundamentally different from those made in the market.certainly,there are significant differences.the oom transactions at issue here were bilaterally negotiated sales of power at different prices than the market clearing price established in the auction market.however,as ferc points out,these bilateral transactions were closely intertwined with the single price auction spot market because manipulation of the single price auction market could create artificial market forces,making it probable that rates charged in the oom transactions were unjust and unreasonable.although different in form,both the single price auction purchases and oom purchases occurred in the same market,so the structural flaws that allowed unjust and unreasonable prices to be charged in the auction also allowed unjust and unreasonable prices to be charged in the oom transactions.given this structural relationship,it was reasonable for ferc to examine those oom transactions that were affected by the manipulated market conditions and order refunds when appropriate.
it is also significant to note that ferc did not order refunds for all oom transactions.rather,ferc ordered all oom spot transactions to be examined to decide which ones would be subject to potential refund.an agency discretion is at its zenith when it is fashioning policies,remedies and sanctions,including enforcement and voluntary compliance programs in order to arrive at maximum effectuation of congressional objectives.niagara mohawk power fed.power comm n.given this level of deference,coupled with ferc reasoned explanation of its decision,we conclude that ferc did not act arbitrarily,capriciously,or in abuse of its discretion when it included the oom transactions in the remedy proceedings.
hours transactionsa 
in its initial mitigation orders,ferc limited price mitigation only to emergency hours when supply was deficient and suppliers knew that their bids,however high,would be accepted.june,order,ferc at.ferc believed that during hours when there were sufficient energy reserves to ensure that the controlled grid would remain reliable,called hours,suppliers would be motivated to bid competitive prices.ferc reasoned that with excess supplies in the market,suppliers would bid competitively because they ran the risk that their bids would not be accepted.see id.at.
over time,however,ferc observed that because energy supply was generally low,suppliers could count on their bids being accepted in both emergency and hours.so,the incentive to bid high prices was as evident during hours as it was during emergency hours.see december,order,ferc at d uring periods where there were no excess supplies in the market and all suppliers would be dispatched,the incentive to bid high prices remained.although ferc targeted remedies had improved the wholesale power market to some extent,see june,order,ferc at,the market remained generally dysfunctional,id.at.
thus,in an attempt to provide the incentives needed to correct the remaining market dysfunctions,ferc expanded the market monitoring and mitigation plan to address all operating hours.id.at.ferc implemented prospective relief for hours by modifying the formula it had used to set the market clearing price in emergency hours.id.at.recognizing that rates should decrease in hours due to an increase in supply,ferc set the market clearing price for hours at percent of the market clearing price established during the last system emergency.id.at.ferc would permit a higher bid only if justified by the supplier.id.at.ferc intention was to emulate a competitive market,and prevent possible abuses that could lead to unjust and unreasonable rates.id.at.
in its july,order,ferc declined to order refunds because it felt that an evidentiary hearing was necessary to resolve material issues of fact before deciding whether to order a refund.july,order,ferc at.ferc ordered to apply the mmcp to each operating hour and report the data to an alj.id.at.ferc then directed the alj to 
make findings of fact with respect to the mitigated price in each hour of the refund period the amount of refunds owed by each supplier according to the methodology established herein and the amount currently owed to each supplier with separate quantities due from each entity by the iso,the investor owned utilities,and the state of california.
ferc explained that its decision to review rates in all operating hours was based on its original finding of systemic market dysfunction,which was not limited to reserve deficiency periods.december,order,ferc at.referencing the finding in its november,order that the market was structurally flawed,ferc stated we determined that structural problems,which existed in all hours,had the potential to cause market prices to exceed that which one would expect in a competitive market.while our solution requires review for all hours,that does not mean that this will result in refunds for all hours.id.
the competitive suppliers group petitions for review of ferc decision to apply the mmcp to operating hours.it argues that ferc decision to order mitigation for hours was arbitrary and capricious because ferc did not expressly find that rates during hours were unjust and unreasonable.
as we have noted,before ferc can exercise its remedial powers under fpa,it must find that the rate at issue is unjust and unreasonable.a.the competitive suppliers group attacks the adequacy of ferc general finding of systemic market dysfunction,arguing that it did not satisfy the condition precedent to a authority.
the competitive suppliers group claims that ferc was required to make explicit findings that specific rates charged in each operating hour were unjust or unreasonable.however,as we have noted,no such requirement exists.ferc may rely on generic or general findings of a systemic problem to support imposition of an solution.interstate natural gas ass of am.ferc.p roportionality between the identified problem and the remedy is the key.id.
to be sure,if ferc found isolated problems within the wholesale electric energy market,its remedy would have been inappropriate.see gas distribs.ferc,neither wisconsin gas nor any other case of which we are aware supports an solution for a problem that exists only in isolated pockets.in such a case,the disproportion of remedy to ailment would,at least at some point,become arbitrary and capricious.however,faced with a market plagued by structural problems and operating under seriously flawed rules,ferc could have reasonably considered a remedy necessary.
ferc response was proportional to the identified problem it ordered wholesale review of a market that it had identified as wholly dysfunctional.moreover,the method ferc used to review the system resulted in an individualized analysis of the rates charged in each operating hour.ferc explained that its expansion of mitigation measures over time was a reflection of both the rapidly changing circumstances during the refund period and its attempt to balance competing interests while fulfilling its fpa obligations 
in response to its november dysfunctional market findings,the commission has sought to intervene in markets in as limited a manner as possible consistent with its responsibilities to ensure just and reasonable rates under the fpa,to rely on market principles whenever it can,and to balance carefully the need for price relief against the need for price signals to attract critical supply entry.
december,order,ferc at.
given all of these considerations,we can not say that ferc decision to include hours transactions in its market mitigation orders was arbitrary,capricious,or an abuse of discretion.
spot market limitation limit a 
in it july,order,ferc restricted the refund proceedings to spot transactions in the organized markets operated by the iso and px during the refund period.july,order,ferc at.in its june order,it defined the spot market at issue as constituting sales that are hours or less and that are entered into the day of or day prior to delivery.june,order,ferc at.by these two orders,ferc excluded sales made in the and calpx spot markets of greater than hours.although this limitation was made without explanation,it apparently was based on ferc construction of the original sdg e complaint.the california parties petition for review of this limitation 
in order to analyze this issue properly,a brief procedural review is appropriate.in the original complaint,sdg e asked ferc to put a price cap on all sales into the and calpx markets and urged ferc to enter into a full examination of the reasons why the markets are not workably competitive.in its august,order,ferc instituted hearing proceedings to detect and to resolve as expeditiously as possible,any defects in the operation of competitive power markets in california.ferc at.
although ferc mentioned the spot market in the body of its august order,it did not explicitly define spot transactions or limit its investigation to transactions of a certain length.see id.at.ferc did inform interested parties that it may further refine or narrow the focus of the hearing after it reviewed its own staff investigative findings.see id.at.
on november,after ferc staff issued its findings,ferc issued an order identifying serious market flaws that had caused and ha d the potential to cause,unjust and unreasonable rates for energy,ancillary services and energy sales under certain conditions.november,order,ferc at.ferc proposed remedies designed to facilitate forward contracting and discourage an over reliance on spot markets.id.at.
on december,ferc again stressed that high prices were mostly due to on contracts,and encouraged market participants to acquire both and contracts.december,order,ferc at.although market participants expressed concerns that contracts would be affected by the spiraling spot prices from the previous summer,ferc assured them that it would monitor prices in markets and also adopt a benchmark that we will use as a reference point in addressing any complaints regarding the pricing of contracts negotiated over the next year.id.at.
ferc first explicitly limited refunds to spot markets in its july,order,stating,t he commission makes clear that transactions subject to refund are limited to spot transactions in the organized markets operated by the iso and px during the refund period.july,order,ferc at.ferc used the same description for spot market as it had in its june order.id.at.
in contesting this limitation,the california parties offered testimony from economist peter and director of market monitoring and analysis for southern california edison gary stern to support their claim that sellers manipulated both energy markets and forward markets and succeeded in raising rates above just and reasonable levels in both.testified that sellers had purposefully manipulated energy markets to cause an increase in forward rates by withholding supply from the market,forcing to buy necessary energy outside of the spot market at higher prices and for longer contract periods.stern testified that if the mmcp mitigation method were applied to forward contracts,refunds would exceed million.
despite this testimony,ferc continued to limit refunds to spot market transactions as described in its june,order.see march,order,ferc at.the california parties requested rehearing of ferc decision,arguing that after they had submitted additional evidence showing that the sellers insistence on longer duration sales was often an element of the exercise of market power,and that ferc should have reconsidered its decision to exclude forward contracts from the monitoring and mitigation plan.the california parties argued that ferc should include in the remedy proceedings all sales up to one month in duration.ferc responded on october,by rejecting the california parties arguments as being identical to those they have already raised,and stating that it had already thoroughly considered and rejected the same arguments.san diego gas,et,ferc.
ferc primary reason for excluding the forward market transactions is that,in its view,these transactions were not included in the original sdg e complaint.it notes that its refund authority is discretionary and limited to those rates challenged as the subject of a proceeding.thus,ferc argues that it was prevented from mitigating forward transactions because the original complaint limited the scope of the proceeding to only spot market transactions.
the record does not support ferc conclusion.the original complaint explicitly referred to both and forward sales in the and calpx markets.sdg e expressed concern about the,and block forward markets conducted by the px.the complaint clearly challenged rates for forward transactions,asserting that until workable competition is established,supply bids into the california forward and markets should be capped at per mwh.emphasis added.the complaint logically did not reference sales outside the iso and px formal markets because sdg e was,at that time,required to purchase energy through the formal spot markets.however,within that limitation,sdg e cast as wide a net as possible,including challenging those forward transactions it was allowed to enter.the original complaint did not limit ferc section refund authority to only spot market transactions.thus,the primary reason given by ferc for excluding the transactions is without adequate foundation in the record.
ferc does not offer any other justification for excluding the transactions.significantly,even in the face of new evidence concerning forward markets,ferc simply reiterated that the issue was outside the scope of the original complaint.ferc failure to even address the additional evidence is another reason that we reject its exclusion of these transactions.
ferc initially thought spot prices would discipline forward prices,and that more forward contracting was the answer to the market dysfunction.thus,early in the remedy proceedings,ferc focused its mitigation measures on sales and actually encouraged market participants to acquire more forward contracts.see december,order,ferc at.however,later evidence suggested that forward prices had not been reigned in by ferc mitigation of the spot markets,and that sellers had successfully manipulated forward markets to raise prices.
in denying rehearing of its continued exclusion of forward transactions,ferc did not explain why the new evidence had no effect on its decision.see ferc at.ferc merely referenced its previous explanation,from its december,order,in which it found that only the rates in spot markets were potentially unjust and unreasonable.however,ferc issued that order before the california parties had offered additional evidence to support their claim.ferc never explained why the additional evidence did not affect its decision to limit mitigation procedures to only spot market transactions.
we should uphold ferc decision if its path to making that decision may reasonably be discerned.see motor vehicle mfrs.ass n,at.however,it is difficult,if not impossible,to discern ferc analytical path here,particularly when its decision is viewed in light of its simultaneous decision to expand mitigation measures to include other previously excluded categories of transactions.
for instance,ferc expanded its mitigation measures to include hours,even though it had earlier believed that rates in hours would be sufficiently disciplined by its mitigation measures in emergency hours.see december,order,ferc at.ferc later recognized new evidence that refuted its earlier belief and acted accordingly,expanding its mitigation measures to include all operating hours.when sellers argued against this expansion,ferc responded 
as commission orders are not final while subject to rehearing,and rehearing was requested of all orders in this proceeding,the mitigation measures and related procedures implemented in those orders were subject to adjustment or replacement.sellers could not reasonably have expected therefore,that the mitigation measures and related procedures implemented in earlier orders in this proceeding would remain unchanged during the rehearing process.
ferc explanation applies with equal force here.throughout the proceedings,ferc emphasized that it was engaged in a continuing examination of all market forces.its investigation was not static and yet it proffered no reason for rejecting the new evidence that suggested that the forward market was affected by market manipulation that may have produced unjust and unreasonable rates.when faced with a similar situation in which ferc acted differently in two related situations without offering a reasoned explanation,we have granted a petition for review.see cal.dep t of water res.ferc,cir.
ferc decision to foreclose relief in the forward markets can not be sustained.its cramped reading of the original sdg e complaint is not supported by a close examination of the record,and ferc does not offer any other explanation for its decision.in view of the evidence tendered by the california parties that sellers manipulated both the short term and long term spot markets,ferc limitation of remedy without a reasonable explanation was arbitrary,capricious,and an abuse of discretion 
energy exchange transactionsa 
exchange transactions involved two different sellers.the first seller,the exchange seller,agreed to provide with energy in exchange for an return of the same amount of energy plus an additional amount.see march,order,ferc at.then purchased energy from the second seller,the spot seller,on the spot market and used that energy to pay back the exchange seller.in a typical exchange transaction,an exchange seller would provide with one unit of power in exchange for promise to return two units of power at a later time.would use the one unit of power to supply its power grid.then would buy two units of power from a spot seller in order to pay back the exchange seller.exchange transactions had varying return ratios.at times,the parties agreed that must return the energy in like time,for instance in hours.
purchases on the spot market were mitigated when ferc ordered spot sellers to refund amounts they had charged in excess of the mmcp.see id.at.however,ferc declined to include exchange sellers in the refund proceedings.
the california parties and challenge the exclusion of exchange sellers,contending that they also should be liable for refunds because they used exchange transactions to exert market power by demanding exorbitant exchange ratios.the california parties witness,carolyn berry,an independent economic consultant and former ferc economist,testified in support of their claim that exchange sellers had violated the federal power act.berry testified that return ratios were excessively high.she suggested that exchange sellers may have been hoping to avoid refund liability by making sales rather than for explicit monetary payment.berry noted that some of the sellers internal emails supported her conclusion that those sellers were aware that using exchanges was a way for them to avoid ferc scrutiny.
economist peter also testified on behalf of the california parties regarding exchange transactions.he testified that t here is no economic difference to a buyer between paying for a power purchase in dollars and paying for it in a commodity whose price is in dollars in the marketplace thus,there is no economic basis for excluding such transactions from mitigation.
the public entities argue that actually benefitted from exchange transactions because the exchange sellers offered desperately needed flexibility in a crisis situation.in support of their claim,the public entities referred to a wall street journal article in which vice president jim detmers was described as praising exchange transactions because they were a good deal for california and might even have saved the state money because daily peak prices were sometimes more than twice the prices the iso paid for bpa replacement power.
in its march,order,ferc held that it would not subject the exchange sellers to refund liability for exchange transactions.the primary reason given by ferc in excluding exchange sellers from the refund proceedings was the difficulty in calculating a refund.march,order,ferc at.
ferc improperly excluded the exchange sellers from the refund proceeding.there is no doubt that energy exchanges are considered sales,subject to ferc jurisdiction.a.by refusing relief simply because the calculation was difficult,ferc abandoned its duty under the federal power act to ensure just and reasonable rates.see a.as we have previously stated,t he fpa can not be construed to immunize those who overcharge and manipulate markets in violation of the fpa.lockyer,at.ferc is obligated to protect consumers from unjust or unreasonable rates,charges,or classifications,and any rules,regulations,practices,or contracts affecting such rates,charges or classifications.see a.nothing in the federal power act limits its application to those transactions that are easy to value.although multiple variables may make certain transactions difficult to analyze,consumers must still be assured that those transactions are just and reasonable.
ferc approach to the exchange transactions created a loophole through which exchange sellers could exercise market power and manipulate the energy market without being subjected to the requirements of the federal power act.ferc failure to exercise its broad remedial discretion to analyze exchanges of power during the refund period and address any unjust and unreasonable practices was arbitrary and capricious,and an abuse of discretion.
ferc argues that it is impossible to determine whether the exchange sellers demanded unjust and unreasonable exchange ratios because there is no way to assign a monetary value to exchange transactions.ferc claims that,because exchange transactions involved multiple variables like the shortage of generation power in the pacific northwest,it can not determine whether exchange sellers demanded and received value in excess of what would have been just and reasonable under the circumstances.however,ferc did not conduct a specific analysis to conclude that the rates were just and reasonable,given the variables,nor did it make a finding that the variables showed that the rate was just and reasonable.ferc simply concluded that the calculation was too difficult.
the challenge of monetizing the transactions does not give ferc a safe harbor to throw up its hands and say it ca be done.significantly,ferc did not provide a reasoned explanation of impossibility,only a conclusory observation of difficulty.but saying so does make it so.constructing a methodology did not prove too taxing for the california parties,who tendered a mitigation methodology for examining the exchange sellers transactions.ferc rejected the california parties proposed mitigation method because it did not account for all relevant variables.see march,order,ferc at the ca parties request to reform the exchange ratio completely ignores the severe energy shortfall in the pacific northwest,where most of these energy exchange transactions originated,during the time period.
the fact that ferc was dissatisfied with the california parties proposed mitigation method does not justify its decision to exclude exchange sellers from the refund proceeding on a categorical basis.ferc own precedent shows that when parties have failed to propose an acceptable mitigation method,it may fashion a method on its own.see re green mountain power,ferc using the value of a contemporaneous cash sale from the same power unit to value an exchange of capacity for purposes of ordering a refund.
ferc also argues that because the energy exchanges were conducted over periods greater than hours,the transactions can not be considered spot market transactions subject to mitigation.however,we have already rejected this argument as a general matter,so it does not afford ferc a valid basis for excluding the transactions at issue here.
in sum,because ferc did not articulate a valid basis for excluding the energy exchange transactions from the refund proceedings,we conclude that its action was arbitrary,capricious,and an abuse of discretion.
sleeve transactions 
sleeve transactions were used when the utilities were on the brink of insolvency and credit problems began to limit the ability of the utilities to purchase power.as ferc described it 
a sleeve transaction involves three parties a seller,a purchaser and a creditworthy third party sleever or sleeving party who provides the financial underpinnings for the transaction.thus,if either party to a transaction determines that it can not buy from or sell to its commercial counterparty due to concerns about the other party creditworthiness,the sleeving party steps in to provide the necessary financial backing so that the transaction can go forward.
san diego gas,et,ferc at.
to obtain adequate supplies of energy to continue to power the grid,entered into transactions whereby sleeving parties would buy power directly from energy sellers and then resell the power to at a premium to reflect the credit risk.
decided that certain sleeve transactions should not be subject to mitigation,but the alj reached the opposite conclusion.after considering the alj report,ferc determined that the sleeve transactions should be subject to mitigation in other words,those transactions should not be excluded from potential refund liability.ferc concluded that the sleeve transactions were similar to other sales and that the sleeving parties assumed the same risks of making spot energy sales to,including the risk of refund liability.therefore,ferc adopted the alj findings and included the sleeve transactions as part of the refund proceedings.the public entities now petition for review of that decision,arguing that sleeve transactions were individually negotiated transactions outside the scope of the remedy proceedings 
the public entities contend that the sleeve transactions should not be included in the refund proceedings because the sleeving parties merely acted as financial intermediaries and facilitators.in their view,the sleeve transactions were individually negotiated transactions that did not take place in the auction market.ferc contends that the parties saw the sleeve transactions as comprising two sales one from the supplier to the sleeving party and the second from the sleeving party to.in ferc view,the sleeving parties were subject to rules because all sellers in the market had the responsibility to comply with market rules and the tariff.the final transaction of the process occurred,according to ferc,in the market.
the record supports ferc conclusion.all sleeve transactions that are subject to challenge here occurred as spot market transactions in the market.the fact that the sleeving parties received a risk premium does not relieve them from liabilit
