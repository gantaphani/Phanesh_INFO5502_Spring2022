in,the texas legislature amended the public utility regulatory act pura to introduce incentive regulation as an alternative to the traditional scheme for setting telephone rates under incentive regulation,a telephone company must cap its rates for basic network services,set according to rate groups the rate cap is subject to certain statutory exceptions,including one providing that the public utility commission of texas puc shall allow a rate group reclassification that results from access line growth.
under that exception,southwestern bell telephone company sought to reclassify several exchanges into higher rate groups.the puc,instead of reclassifying some of those exchanges,raised the upper boundaries of the respective rate groups,thus leaving the exchanges in the original rate groups and effectively negating much of southwestern bell anticipated revenue growth.the court of appeals held that the puc was required to reclassify southwestern bell exchanges into higher rate groups if southwestern bell established appropriate access line growth,and the puc could not circumvent that requirement by adjusting boundaries we agree with the court of appeals and affirm its judgment.
i.the regulatory framework 
rate setting before incentive regulation 
traditionally,the puc set telephone company rates for basic network services in ratemaking proceedings using principles the puc determined what revenue the telephone company needed to recover a reasonable return on its investment,in addition to its reasonable and necessary expenses this process involved rate design in which the puc distributed the company revenue requirements among the various services it offered the puc set rates by allocating a company costs among ratepayer classes 
in a proceeding using these principles,the puc adopted a system of classifications for southwestern bell.the puc divided southwestern bell exchanges into ten rate groups.the puc classified southwestern bell rate groups according to the number of working telephone lines in each exchange.rates progressively increased from smaller to larger rate groups,so that customers in exchanges with fewer telephone lines paid less than customers in exchanges with more telephone lines.this pricing structure recognized the concept callers in an exchange with a larger number of phone lines could reach more telephones without paying long distance charges than callers in a smaller exchange.
over the years,as a part of its process,the puc periodically adjusted the number and boundaries of southwestern bell rate groups to prevent exchanges with significantly different numbers of telephone lines from being placed in the same rate group.the puc last made boundary adjustments to southwestern bell rate groups in,assigning southwestern bell eight rate groups instead of ten.the puc also periodically moved southwestern bell exchanges into different rate groups based on access line growth.the puc last reclassified southwestern bell exchanges into different rate groups based on access line growth in.
incentive regulation 
the version 
on september,southwestern bell elected to participate in the legislature newly created incentive regulation.at that time,pura section d provided that an electing company was not under any circumstances subject to any complaint,hearing,or determination as to the reasonableness of its rates,its overall revenues,its return on invested capital,or its net income.in return,section a required that an electing company commit to making certain infrastructure improvements and to capping its rates for basic network services for a specified time period 
section provided exceptions to section a rate cap for certain changes in federal communications commission fcc separations affecting intrastate net income having less than five million access lines in the state and rate group reclassification based on access line growth the exception for reclassification,contained in section c,stated 
notwithstanding the commitments made under section of this act,a rate group reclassification occurring as a result of access lines growth shall be allowed by the commission on request of the electing company 
section c required the puc to review any rates adjusted based on access line growth to ensure that the proposed adjustment conforms to the requirements of section c of this act.section e allowed the puc,after review,to issue an order approving,modifying,or rejecting the rate adjustment,depending on whether it was in compliance with the applicable provisions.
section d discussed generally the regulation of basic network services of an electing company.it directed that,to the extent not inconsistent with this subtitle,such regulation be governed by sections and,among other general provisions section required the puc to ensure that all public utility rates were just and reasonable 
it shall be the duty of the commission to insure that every rate made,demanded,or received by any public utility shall be just and reasonable.rates may not be unreasonably preferential,prejudicial,or discriminatory,but shall be sufficient,equitable,and consistent in application to each class of consumers 
section similarly prohibited a public utility from establishing any unreasonable differences as to service rates between localities 
a public utility may not,as to rates or services,make or grant any unreasonable preference or advantage to any corporation or person within any classification or subject any corporation or person within any classification to any unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage.a public utility may not establish and maintain any unreasonable differences as to rates of service either as between localities or as between classes of service 
the codification 
in,the legislature codified the incentive regulation provisions in texas utilities code chapter the legislature stated that this codification,which became effective on september,intended no substantive changes from the original language enacted in the legislature placed the exception allowing an electing company to seek rate group reclassification based on access line growth in section.section states 
notwithstanding subchapter b,the commission,on request of the electing company,shall allow a rate group reclassification that results from access line growth.
subchapter b contains section,which requires an electing company to cap its basic network services rates and make certain infrastructure improvements.it also contains section,which provides that an electing company is not,under any circumstances,subject to any complaint,hearing,or determination regarding the reasonableness of the company rates overall revenues return on invested capital or net income.
under section,placed in subchapter c,an electing company may increase a rate for a basic service network during the rate cap only with puc approval that the proposed change is included in section.section similarly requires puc authorization for any section rate adjustment.section a states the puc may authorize a rate adjustment under section.section g similarly provides that the puc may issue an order approving the adjustment,or if it finds that the adjustment is not authorized under section,it may issue an order modifying or rejecting the adjustment.
the legislature also provided in section a that an electing company basic network services are regulated to the extent not inconsistent with this chapter,in accordance with sections and,among other general statutes.sections and,not contained within the incentive regulation chapter chapter,prohibit a public utility from subjecting a person to an unreasonable disadvantage in providing services and in charging rates.for example,section states,i n providing a service to persons in a classification,a public utility may not grant an unreasonable preference or advantage to a person in the classification or subject a person in the classification to an unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage.section c likewise provides 
a public utility may not grant an unreasonable preference or advantage concerning rates to a person in a classification subject a person in a classification to an unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage concerning rates or establish or maintain an unreasonable difference concerning rates between localities or between classes of service.
ii.this case history 
in december,southwestern bell requested a reclassification from the puc under section.predicated primarily on access line growth experienced in three metropolitan,fort worth,and bell sought to reclassify of its texas exchanges into higher rate groups.southwestern bell request would result in an approximate to million revenue increase.the cities of austin,dallas,fort worth,and hereford cities,the office of public utility counsel opuc,and the general services commission gsc intervened to oppose southwestern bell request.the puc docketed the proceeding as a contested case and referred it to the state office of administrative hearings for an administrative law judge alj to hear.
the alj concluded that the puc had authority to limit or modify a reclassification request under section.the alj relied,in part,on that part of section g providing that the puc may issue an order modifying or rejecting the adjustment.the alj ruled that section g allowed the puc to apply precedent and policy as necessary to protect the public interest,which could result in modifying or rejecting a reclassification request.
the alj also looked to section,which prohibits a public utility from subjecting a person in a classification to an unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage.the alj concluded that the puc authority to oversee rates and prevent unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage among customers extended to reclassification under section.the alj opined that an unreasonable disadvantage would occur if southwestern bell austin and dallas exchanges were moved to the next higher rate group,because they would not realize the same value for the price as other,larger exchanges in those rate groups.the alj accordingly recommended raising the upper boundaries of the rate groups containing those exchanges so that they would not fall into higher rate groups.the puc adopted all of the alj proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law.the puc order concludes,t o put austin in the same rate group as exchanges with considerably more access lines would be a departure from the strategies used by the puc in the past which amended the lower and upper limits of rate groups in order to achieve equitable rates for all customers.the puc also made additional rulings not at issue here.
southwestern bell sought judicial review of the puc order in the district court.the district court concluded that the puc had the authority,as a process of rate design,to adjust rate group boundaries in a proceeding under section.the district court accordingly affirmed the puc order on that issue.
southwestern bell appealed several issues to the court of appeals.the court of appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part the district court judgment pertinent here,the court of appeals held that section required the puc to reclassify exchanges into new rate groups when an electing company proved access line growth the court noted that,in contrast to the puc prior practice,section provides that an electing company is not under any circumstances,subject to complaint,hearing,or determination regarding the reasonableness of its rates the court concluded that,by changing rate group boundaries,the puc was conducting a reasonableness inquiry that section prohibits 
the puc,cities,opuc,and gsc filed petitions for review with this court.we granted the petitions to consider whether the legislature gave the puc power to adjust boundaries as part of a section reclassification request.
iii.the puc general powers 
as a state administrative agency,the puc has those powers that the legislature expressly confers upon it the puc may also have implied powers necessary to accomplish the express duties that the legislature gives to it but the puc may not exercise what is effectively a new power,or a power contrary to a statute,on the theory that such a power is expedient for administrative purposes further,we give weight to how the puc interprets its own powers,but only if that interpretation is reasonable and not inconsistent with the statute 
to determine what powers the legislature conferred on the puc in evaluating section reclassification requests,we first look to the pertinent statutes we begin with the words used we may also consider the object to be attained by the statutes,the circumstances surrounding the statutes enactment,legislative history,former statutory and common law,and the consequences of a particular construction 
in this context,several principles guide us.generally,we will accept the words used according to their ordinary meaning,unless given a specific statutory definition we will not give them an exaggerated,forced,or constrained meaning also,we will presume that the legislature used every word of a statute for a purpose finally,we will try to avoid construing a statutory provision in isolation from the rest of the statute we should consider the act as a whole,and not just single phrases,clauses,or sentences 
iv.the puc has no power to adjust rate group boundaries under section 
petitioners rely on section introductory phrase n otwithstanding subchapter b,puc precedent and policy,and numerous other statutes to argue that the legislature has authorized the puc to adjust boundaries in a section reclassification request.we disagree.we hold that,by adjusting boundaries in this case,the puc exceeded its statutory powers 
section states 
notwithstanding subchapter b the commission,on request of the electing company,shall allow a rate group reclassification that results from access line growth.
section uses the word shall,which we generally construe as mandatory,unless legislative intent suggests otherwise nothing in section language permits the puc to adjust rate group boundaries to prevent the very reclassification that section allows.we agree with the court of appeals that to allow the puc to avoid section mandate in this way would undermine the legislative intent expressed in the statute plain language.
another section,section,supports our conclusion.section states that an electing company is not,under any circumstances,subject to a determination regarding the reasonableness of its rates.thus,the puc could not inquire into the reasonableness of southwestern bell rates in evaluating the reclassification request.but,the puc did precisely that when it adjusted southwestern bell boundaries.as the puc order states,t o put austin in the same rate group as exchanges with considerably more access lines would be a departure from the strategies used by the puc in the past which amended the lower and upper limits of rate groups in order to achieve equitable rates for all customers.though specifically prohibited from doing so,the puc adjusted southwestern bell boundaries to achieve equitable rates.as the court of appeals correctly recognized,the puc actions 
necessarily involved an inquiry into the reasonableness of southwestern bell rates or,the puc refused to move austin and dallas into higher rate groups because it determined that it would be unreasonable to charge the same tariff to customers in cities with significantly different numbers of access lines.section expressly prohibits such a determination of the reasonableness of rates or revenues.
in the court of appeals,petitioners pointed to sections and,arguing that they permit the puc participation in reclassifications.section a provides that an electing company may increase a rate for a basic network service with puc approval that the proposed change is included in section.section a states that the puc may authorize a rate adjustment under section.section g further provides that the puc may issue an order approving the adjustment,or if it finds that the adjustment is not authorized under section,it may issue an order modifying or rejecting the adjustment.
sections and do not give the puc discretion to adjust boundaries to avoid the reclassification authorized by section.rather,those sections give the puc discretion to reject or modify a reclassification request if,for example,the electing company has n
