after instituted this action against pacific gas and electric company pg e for unfair business practices bus,et,violation of public utilities code section,and fraud,we applied the primary jurisdiction doctrine and imposed a stay of judicial proceedings in the trial court,pending an ongoing third party proceeding before the california public utilities commission puc or commission that concerned similar issues,joanne carey pacific gas and electric company 
the puc closed the carey proceedings without conducting a formal investigation of the conduct challenged by the carey complainants.pg e then brought a successful motion for judgment on the pleadings in the instant case on the grounds the trial court had lost subject matter jurisdiction as a result of the puc decision to close its investigation in carey.we will conclude the trial court erred in dismissing appellants action.
background 
may,first amended complainta.alleged facts 
in their first amended,and operative,complaint,plaintiffs alleged generally 
pg e is a utility regulated by the puc that provides gas and electrical services to customers throughout california.it requires puc approval of its rates for electricity and natural gas.
in january,pg e initiated a gas regulator replacement program grrp to replace its old regulators because they were corroding did not contain an internal pressure relief valve irv,making them susceptible to overpressurization,which could result in spontaneous gas leaks.pg e contemplated replacing approximately million domestic and small commercial establishment gas regulators over a period.
at a general rate case proceeding before the puc,pg e represented that to complete the grrp in seven years,it would have to actively categorize and designate all existing regulators and send service personnel to each residence or commercial establishment to replace the premises regulator.pg e also represented that the annual cost of the grrp from to would be million,and the estimated cost from to would exceed million.pg e asked the puc to allow a rate increase to reflect the grrp costs it had already incurred as well as those it would incur between and,representing that it would continue the grrp and would replace approximately regulators per year.based on pg e representations,the puc authorized an increase in pg e rate base to reflect the capital costs pg e represented it would incur to complete the grrp,and pg e retail customers paid a rate for gas service and delivery that included the costs incurred by pg e to carry out the grrp.
in approximately june pg e unilaterally ceased active replacement of the regulators.since then it replaced regulators only if a service call for another problem justified the presence of a pg e technician at a residence or business and the call required shutting off the main gas line leading to the premises.under this new maintenance program,only a nominal volume of old regulators would be replaced.
in subsequent rate proceedings,pg e did not inform the puc of its changes to the grrp or that it was not incurring the costs it had previously represented it would incur.pg e internal documents suggested that its personnel were instructed not to disclose to the puc that it had terminated its active grrp unless puc members specifically asked,and its specific company policy was to withhold information from the puc regarding termination of the grrp.
through,pg e continued to grossly underspend the amount it represented to the puc it would incur and the amount that was in fact reflected in pg e retail gas rates.as a result of its surreptitious termination of the grrp,pg e charged appellants and the general public for services it failed to provide.since,it also continued to charge its ratepayers million annually for the cost of its ongoing maintenance program,even though,as of,it had already charged its ratepayers for replacement of every old regulator in its service area.consequently,each annual charge for the ongoing maintenance program constituted a double recovery by pg 
causes of action 
the first amended complaint contains five causes of action violation of the unfair competition law ucl bus,et and false advertising bus,collectively,the ucl claims violation of public utilities code section by violating the ucl fraud and and misrepresentation.
as to the ucl claims and related cause of action for violation of public utilities code section,appellants seek restitution and disgorgement of any and all monies,including any profits obtained by pg e as a result of its deceptive,unlawful and misleading business acts and practices,including its misrepresentation,misleading statements and acts of concealment made to the puc,and attorney fees code civ.in the common law fraud causes of action appellants seek compensatory and punitive damages.
ii.demurrer 
pg e demurred on the grounds the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because exclusive jurisdiction resided with the puc,and the complaint failed to state a cause of action because relief was barred by the filed rate doctrine.wise i,supra,th at,d.as to the fraud causes of action,pg e also argued that reliance could not be proven,and plaintiffs failed to plead the elements of misrepresentation and reliance.ibid.
opposing the demurrer,plaintiffs argued,pursuant to san diego gas electric superior court cal th,d,covalt,that the puc does not have exclusive subject matter jurisdiction over the action because their action does not contravene an order of the puc,and enforces rather than hinders puc policy.wise i,th at,d.plaintiffs also argued that because their claims do not involve ratemaking,the reasonableness of rates tariffs,or the uniform application of the puc rates or regulatory statutes,the primary jurisdiction doctrine does not apply.id.at,d.they further argued that the public utilities code does not bar a ucl action,the filed rate doctrine was inapposite to this case,and the complaint stated prima facie claims for fraud and misrepresentation.ibid.
the trial court sustained pg e demurrer without leave to amend,and plaintiffs appealed.
iii.wise i 
in wise i,plaintiffs contended that the trial court erroneously ruled that their action lay within the exclusive jurisdiction of the puc.wise i,supra,th at,d.we agreed.citing waters pacific telephone cal d,and covalt,supra,cal th at page,d,we observed that public utilities code section authorizes a court to award damages in an action against a regulated utility for violation of any puc order,but only in those situations in which the award would not hinder or frustrate the puc declared supervisory and regulatory policies or directly contravene a specific puc order or decision.in the latter situations,the matter must be brought before the puc,whose decisions are reviewable only by the appellate court.wise i,supra,at,d.given that plaintiffs action claimed,in essence,that pg e charged for the old failed to deliver,we held that its claim did not impede any supervisory or regulatory puc policy.id.at,d.
however,we also concluded that the primary jurisdiction doctrine was applicable to plaintiffs action.wise i,supra,th at,d.this doctrine applies where a claim is originally cognizable in the courts,and comes into play whenever enforcement of the claim requires the resolution of issues which,under a regulatory scheme,have been placed within the special competence of an administrative body in such a case the judicial process is suspended pending referral of such issues to the administrative body for its views.farmers ins.exchange superior court cal th,d,farmers ins.exchange quoting united states western pac,d,italics omitted.the doctrine does not permanently foreclose judicial action,but it provides the appropriate administrative agency with an opportunity to act if it so chooses.shernoff superior court d.
we concluded the primary jurisdiction doctrine was applicable after we granted pg e request to take judicial notice of carey,supra,cal,wl,a puc opinion and order that was filed after the demurrer in the instant case was sustained.id.at,d.
in the carey puc complaint,carey alleged that a explosion that destroyed an apartment complex undergoing a tented pest control fumigation was caused by the fumigator improper shut off of the main gas valve and a faulty regulator.carey,supra,d at,wl.carey claimed that pg e policy of allowing untrained and inexperienced fumigation personnel,rather than pg e personnel,to terminate the gas service during the fumigation caused the explosion and asked that pg e be ordered to cease this policy immediately.ibid.other tenants of the same apartment complex intervened and alleged that pg e fraudulently terminated the grrp in,and,had the grrp continued,the faulty regulator would not have been in service during the fumigation.id.at,wl.they requested puc to impose a million fine against pg e for unsafe conditions,based on the estimated cost of the grrp and on pg e savings in implementing the fumigation policy by which fumigation employees terminated gas service during fumigations.id.at,wl.
the prehearing scoping memo in the carey case identified the issues to be resolved in the proceeding as did pg e commit unreasonable any unsafe acts in by allowing a pest control fumigation contractor to terminate gas service at the apartment if an unsafe gas practice existed,should pg e make changes to its gas termination or other gas procedures and if so,what changes should pg e be fined million for any proven unsafe practices or imprudent gas termination or other gas procedures followed during the explosion carey,supra,d at,wl.the scoping memo also ruled that,given the allegations and request for relief in the complaint,the parties could place relevant evidence in the record directing the puc consumer services division to consider a future proceeding,to wit,an order instituting investigation oii into pg e gas termination and other gas practices.id.at,wl.
the findings of fact in the puc december opinion in the carey adjudicatory proceeding dealt primarily with pg e policy of having fumigators,not pg e personnel,shut off gas service.carey,supra,d at,wl.however,one finding stated that it was speculation to presume that the faulty valve that caused the explosion would have been replaced had pg e continued the grrp.id.at,wl.in conclusions of law,the carey opinion concluded that pg e had engaged in unreasonable practices regarding its policy of allowing fumigator employees to terminate gas services and imposed a penalty therefor.id.at,wl.
in a part of the carey opinion entitled future proceedings,the puc stated during the grrp during,pg e aggressively replaced inch gas regulators with those with internal relief.the program was ended after five years and replaced by a standard maintenance practice of replacing any size gas regulator with an irv gas regulator whenever it was necessary to turn the main service valve at any customer premise.complainants argue that pg e misled and,in fact,lied to the commission in order to terminate this program.in the scoping memo issued prior to the hearing,we ruled that the matter of fraudulent conduct was outside the scope of the complaint proceeding and more appropriately decided in future proceedings,should staff at a later date recommend the institution of such proceedings.during the hearing,while we denied pg e motion to strike testimony of unethical conduct and misrepresentation to terminate the grrp,we admitted such testimony for the limited purpose of permitting the parties to complete the evidence of their position on the allowable issues and to develop a record on the need for a future investigation into these allegations now that we have heard this evidence and admitted certain relevant documents,the staff will be able to review this and any other evidence to determine whether an investigation of these and further issues should be opened.carey,supra,d at,wl.
the puc ordered that remedies sought in the carey complaint be granted in part,given the puc conclusion that pg e engaged in unsafe practices by not revising policy regarding termination of gas services during fumigations and its assessment of a penalty therefor.carey,supra,d at,wl.the order also directed the puc consumer services division to advise the puc if an oii is needed to determine whether pg e engaged in fraudulent conduct to terminate its grrp and whether this program should be continued consumer services division will make any recommendations to the puc regarding these matters under the normal procedures.id.at,wl.
our wise i opinion,issued in december,concluded that the carey opinion and order indicated that the puc might be commencing the process of formulating a policy concerning the grrp.wise i,supra,th at,d.consequently,we concluded the instant case was appropriate for application of the primary jurisdiction doctrine because a ny action the puc might take in the carey proceeding concerning the grrp will determine whether this action can or should be entertained by the court.wise i,supra,at,d.taking guidance from the supreme court disposition in farmers ins.exchange,supra,cal th,at pages,d,we reversed and remanded with directions to stay judicial proceedings and retain the matter on the court docket pending further puc proceedings relevant to plaintiffs claims and to monitor the progress of the puc proceedings to ensure against unreasonable delay of plaintiffs action.wise i,supra,at,d.
iv.post wise i proceedings 
puc investigation 
pursuant to the directive in the carey order to advise the puc whether an oii was needed on the questions reserved for future proceedings questions of pg e fraudulent conduct in terminating the grrp,its wrongful diversion of revenues from rates for the grrp,and the continued existence of the puc consumer services division engaged a consultant,jbs energy,jbs to assist in the investigation of these questions.
on april,jbs issued its report,following its investigation in which it examined relevant documents and workpapers filed at the puc in pg e rate cases from onward,reviewed evidence presented in prior puc cases and industry periodicals,studied pg e responses to its data requests,interviewed industry representatives,and obtained related governmental reports.based on its examination of financial data,jbs concluded the allegation that pg e underspent ratepayer funding for the grrp was unfounded.pg e did not receive funds significantly in excess of resources provided as to the grrp,and pg e allegation that it overspent on the grrp by million was exaggerated.although it may have spent several million dollars more on the grrp than it received in rates,this result occurred because the grrp consisted of capital additions that were not forecast in advance in the rate case.in essence,said the jbs report,it appears that the question of underspending overspending is approximately a wash,with pg e possibly having spent a few million dollars more on the grrp than it was given in rates.
jbs report also listed four safety issues involving regulators and it had identified during its investigation.
on april,a puc staff attorney informed plaintiffs attorney that the puc had not issued an oii of the grrp,nor,as far as the puc attorney was aware,did puc have any present intention of doing so.
on june,the puc president wrote to pg e that jbs had submitted its report.in furtherance of ascertaining the safety implications presented by termination of the expedited grrp in,the puc president requested pg e to undertake several studies and report the information obtained in these studies,in the form of a compliance filing,to the director of the puc consumer services division,the puc general counsel,and the chief of the puc utilities safety branch,and to make the studies and report available to the public,no later than september.the requested studies were prompted by the four safety issues identified in the jbs report.the puc president copied her letter to the parties in the carey proceedings and to the parties in the instant action.
by letter dated july,the puc general counsel informed the trial court that the puc recently voted to release the enclosed jbs report on pg e grrp this is also to inform the court and the parties to the instant action that the commission does not believe there is good cause to further investigate whether pg e diverted ratepayer funding or profited from its discontinuance of the grrp.the commission investigation into the grrp ratepayer funding issues raised in the carey case is now closed.the general counsel copied his letter to the parties in the instant case and the parties in the carey proceeding.
reinstatement of instant action 
after the court and parties received the general counsel july,letter,the court granted plaintiffs motion to lift the stay on the instant action,made on the grounds the puc,via the july letter,had formally advised all parties that it had closed its investigation into the issues that formed the subject matter of plaintiffs complaint.
judgment on the pleadings 
following reinstatement of the instant action,pg e moved for judgment on the pleadings on the grounds the court lacked jurisdiction to hear the case and that the first amended complaint did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.code civ.proc,subd.c b i ii.it argued that the puc action of closing its investigation of pg e possible diversion of ratepayer funding or profit from discontinuing the grrp was binding on the trial court,given our observation in wise i that a ny action the puc might take concerning the grrp will determine whether this action can or should be entertained by the court.wise i,supra,th at,d.pg e construed the phrase will determine as our charge that the puc,not the court,would resolve the factual issue of whether pg e underspent the rate increase it was granted for costs incurred in carrying out the grrp.
pg e also argued that plaintiffs ucl causes of action are barred because the relief plaintiffs than million in alleged overcharges is for gas service they admit pg e supplied.consequently,there was no money or property to restore to them.
in opposing pg e motion for judgment on the pleadings,plaintiffs argued that the puc decision not to act on the charges raised in their complaint,the puc decision to close its investigation of the grrp,had no res judicata or collateral estoppel effect on their case.they also argued that wise i did not hold that the trial court could dismiss their action if the puc did not act regarding the claims asserted in their complaint.
the court granted pg e motion without explanation and entered judgment in its favor 
discussion 
standard of review 
a motion for judgment on the pleadings is akin to a general demurrer it tests the sufficiency of the complaint to state a cause of action.pang beverly hospital,th,d.the court must assume the truth of all factual allegations in the complaint,along with matters subject to judicial notice.gerawan farming,lyons cal th,d.appellate courts review judgments on the pleadings de novo.stockton newspapers,redevelopment agency d.
i.the puc decision to close its investigation of the grrp ratepayer funding issues raised in the carey case does not preclude the instant action 
the parties agree that the principal issue is the effect on this case of the puc closing of its investigation into the grrp ratepayer issues raised in the carey case after it concluded that no further investigation of whether pg e diverted ratepayer funding or profited from its discontinuance of the grrp was warranted.plaintiffs contend the trial court retained subject matter jurisdiction over their action because the puc took no action regarding the grrp and pg e that would deprive the court from proceeding in the instant action.specifically,they argue that a judicial proceeding in their action would not interfere with or contravene a specific puc order or decision,or undermine a specific puc general supervisory or regulatory policy because the puc did not issue a definitive decision,regulation,or policy,or hold formal administrative hearings regarding the grrp.
pg e does not dispute that,pursuant to wise i,the trial court had jurisdiction to proceed with the instant action after the puc closed its investigation of the grrp ratepayer funding issues raised in the carey case.it contends that the puc closing of the investigation was a decision on the merits that has a binding effect on a collateral judicial proceeding,plaintiffs action.it also appears to contend that,pursuant to wise i,whatever kind of action the puc took regarding the issue of pg e alleged fraudulent termination of the grrp is determinative of plaintiffs claims and would preclude further court action.
neither the parties nor our research have discovered a california court opinion in a case that was reinstated in the trial court after an administrative agency,under the primary jurisdiction doctrine,was accorded the opportunity to deal with issues raised in the complaint.thus,the issue of the effect of an administrative agency action on the reinstated case following application of the doctrine appears to be one of first impression 
given the policy advanced by the of court decisionmaking and efficiency by allowing courts to take advantage of administrative expertise farmers ins.exchange,supra,cal th at,d,the court which exercises its discretion to stay the judicial proceeding,pending agency proceedings,expects to be aided by the agency decision.e ven if ultimate resort to the courts is inevitable citation,the prior administrative proceeding will still promote judicial efficiency by unearthing the relevant evidence and by providing a record which the court may review.id.at,d,quoting westlake community hosp.superior court cal d.under the doctrine,a trial court may avail itself of the specialized expertise of an administrative agency before hearing a agency in effect becomes a kind of special master for the trial court.miller superior court th,d.
however,while cases like farmers ins.exchange,supra,cal th at pages,d,refer to the administrative proceeding that will occur upon application of the primary jurisdiction doctrine,they do not precisely identify the kind of proceeding contemplated by the doctrine.nor do they identify the nature of the administrative decision the doctrine contemplates will inform the subsequent judicial proceeding.we now address those questions.
necessity of administrative ruling 
as farmers ins.exchange,supra,cal th at page,d,observes,the doctrine of primary jurisdiction,sometimes known as the doctrine of prior resort or preliminary jurisdiction,originated in the united states supreme court and has since been developed largely in federal courts.federal cases therefore provide assistance in resolving the issues we confront in this case.
the doctrine of primary jurisdiction is specifically applicable to claims properly cognizable in court that contain some issue within the special competence of an administrative agency.it requires the court to enable a referral to the agency,staying further proceedings so as to give the parties reasonable opportunity to seek an administrative ruling.citations.referral of the issue to the administrative agency does not deprive the court of jurisdiction the court has discretion either to retain jurisdiction or,if the parties would not be unfairly disadvantaged,to dismiss the case without prejudice.citations.reiter cooper,d,fn.omitted reiter.
in reiter,the petitioner,a shipper,sought damages for unreasonable tariff rates charged by a motor common carrier,an action expressly allowed by the interstate commerce act ica.reiter,supra,at.reiter noted that referral to the administrative agency should not be understood in the sense of advisory opinion.referral is sometimes loosely described as a process whereby a court refers an issue to an agency.citation.but the ica like most statutes contains no mechanism whereby a court can on its own authority demand or request a determination from the agency that is left to the adversary system,the court merely staying its proceedings while the shipper files an administrative complaint with the interstate commerce commission use of the term referral to describe this process seems to have originated in united states western pacific,which asserted that,where issues within the special competence of an agency arise,the judicial process is suspended pending referral of such issues to the administrative body for its views.citation.mitchell coal coke pennsylvania.spelled out the actual procedure contemp
