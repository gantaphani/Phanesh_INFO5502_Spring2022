plaintiff rex elder,individually and on behalf of a class of similarly situated individuals,filed this lawsuit seeking relief against defendants pacific bell telephone company hereafter pacific bell and aci billing services,doing business as oan hereafter oan for the inclusion of allegedly unauthorized charges on a subscriber telephone bill,a practice known as cramming,in violation of public utilities code section,subdivision a.we agree with plaintiff that the superior court erred in sustaining defendants demurrers without leave to amend.accordingly,the judgment of dismissal is reversed and the matter is remanded for further proceedings.
factual and procedural background 
law relating to cramming 
in,the legislature added sections and to the public utilities to address cramming,which is the practice of including unauthorized charges on a subscriber telephone bill.see stats,ch,stats,ch,amended by stats,ch,and by stats,ch.in pertinent part,section reads a no person or corporation shall misrepresent its association or affiliation with a telephone carrier when soliciting,inducing,or otherwise implementing the subscriber agreement to purchase the products or services of the person or corporation,and have the charge for the product or service appear on the subscriber telephone bill.in pertinent part,section reads a a telephone bill may only contain charges for products or services,the purchase of which the subscriber has authorized.the statutes also contain provisions addressing billing and dispute procedures regarding cramming.by these statutory enactments,the legislature intended to do all of the following a reduce the inclusion of unauthorized charges on a telephone subscriber bill,a practice known as cramming.b clarify the rights and remedies available to california consumers with regard to telephone billing disputes.c provide california consumers with a consistent,effective,and easily accessible means of resolving disputes over unauthorized,inadvertent,misleading,or fraudulent charges that appear on their telephone bills.d encourage the verification of telephone charges.stats,ch.
in october,plaintiff,on behalf of himself and others similarly situated,sued defendants pacific bell and oan seeking relief for cramming by the first amended complaint,plaintiff sought relief for a class defined as a ll landline telephone subscribers in the state of california who suffered losses or damages as a result of pacific bell billing for oan products or services not authorized by the subscriber provided,however,that the following are excluded from this class i the defendants,and ii any employee of defendants.the pleading set forth causes of action for breach of contract against pacific bell only,tortious interference with a contract and enrichment against oan only,unfair business practices in violation of california unfair competition law bus,et.hereafter ucl against both defendants,and unauthorized telephone charges in violation of section against both defendants in the prayer for relief,plaintiff sought certification of a class and appointment of counsel,declaratory and injunctive relief,actual damages,including prejudgment interest,exemplary damages,costs,and attorney fees.
defendants generally demurred to the entire complaint based on the ground that the public utilities commission hereafter puc had exclusive or primary jurisdiction to resolve the lawsuit code civ,subd.a,and generally demurred to each count based on the failure to allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action code civ,subd.e.oan specifically demurred on the ground that each cause of action against it was uncertain.code civ,subd.f.plaintiff opposed the demurrers.
the superior court granted defendants general demurrers without leave to amend on the ground that the puc had exclusive jurisdiction over this lawsuit.because of its ruling that it lacked jurisdiction,the court did not address defendants alternate argument that this lawsuit should be stayed under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction and the puc should be given the opportunity to rule on plaintiff claims in the first instance.the court also found that a cause of action for tortious interference with a contract against oan failed because the complaint did not allege facts to support a necessary inference that oan knew the charges were unauthorized but nonetheless it forwarded them to pacific bell for inclusion in a subscriber telephone bill.having sustained the demurrers without leave to amend,the court issued a judgment dismissing the lawsuit in its entirety.plaintiff timely appeals.
discussion 
standard of review 
in reviewing the ruling on defendants demurrers,we do not review the validity of the superior court reasoning but only the propriety of the ruling itself.citation.wilner sunset life ins.th.we independently evaluate the complaint,construing it liberally,giving it a reasonable interpretation,reading it as a whole,and viewing its parts in context.citation.treating as true all material facts properly pleaded,we determine de novo whether the factual allegations of the complaint are adequate to state a cause of action under any legal theory,regardless of the title under which the factual basis for relief is stated.citation.burns neiman marcus group,th.each element must be pleaded with particularity so as to apprise the defendant of the specific grounds for the charge and enable the court to determine whether there is any basis for the cause of action,although less specificity is required if the defendant would likely have greater knowledge of the facts than the plaintiff.citation.city of industry city of fillmore th.
ii.application of exclusive jurisdiction doctrine is not warranted in this case 
section,subdivision a hereafter section a,provides that no court,except the supreme court or a court of appeal,has jurisdiction to interfere with the puc performance of its official duties however,section allows an action to be filed in the superior court for damages caused by an allegedly unlawful act of a public utility as the court explained in cundiff gte california,th section and section address different things.section defines and limits the power of the courts to pass judgment on,or interfere with,what the commission does.section,on the other hand,confirms the full power of the courts to pass judgment on what utilities do.section explicitly authorizes california courts to hear claims against public utilities for damages.citation.the similarity between the two statutes is that they both dictate which courts have jurisdiction to engage in these activities.only appellate courts can review decisions of the commission and interfere with its actions,whereas suits for relief against utilities can be brought in the trial court.id.at,italics omitted.
our supreme court has harmonized sections and,by using a test to determine whether a superior court has subject matter jurisdiction to hear a private action against a public utility,or whether such an action would be barred by section a whether the puc had authority to regulate the conduct at issue whether it exercised that authority and whether the superior court action would hinder,frustrate,interfere with,or obstruct that authority.san diego gas electric superior court cal th.as applied to this case specifically,we consider whether the puc had the authority to adopt a regulatory policy on cramming conduct and what steps the utilities should take,if any,to minimize cramming whether the puc had exercised that authority and whether the superior court action would hinder or interfere with the puc exercise of regulatory authority with respect to cramming.hartwell superior court cal th,hartwell.
here,there is no question that the puc has both the constitutional and statutory authority to make rules regarding cramming.cal,art.xii,see,subds.c,d,e,f,i.and,there is no question that the puc has adopted rules governing cramming pursuant to sections and.at issue here is the third plaintiff superior court action against defendants for allegedly engaging in cramming would hinder,frustrate,interfere with,or obstruct the puc performance of its official duties.for the reasons we now discuss,we conclude that plaintiff lawsuit would not hinder,frustrate,interfere with,or obstruct the puc regulatory authority or on cramming as enunciated in its decisions 
contrary to defendants contention,the puc has not undertaken to oversee and regulate all aspects of billing to prevent cramming by entities governed by the puc.in its decision,the puc explicitly stated its adoption of cramming rules,which are based upon the commission authority under the constitution and the public utilities code particularly sections,are not,in fact,intended to insulate public utilities from liability under other statutory schemes such as the unfair competition law.the public utilities code provides that public utilities subject to the commission jurisdiction remain subject to other statutory schemes as well,whether those laws are enforced by the commission or by the courts.cal.interim decision issuing general order,rules governing telecommunications consumer protection may,cal.puc lexis,at,italics added.thus,the puc agreed with those parties who state d that the commission and the courts have concurrent jurisdiction over consumer protection matters,in the sense that public utilities are subject to standards and requirements enforced by the commission and to consumer protection laws enforced by the courts.a business practice that violates the public utilities code and our consumer protection rules for example cramming will likely also constitute an unfair and unlawful business practice under the unfair competition law,and subject the offending utility to possible sanctions under that law.id.at p,fn.omitted,italics in original.the puc further concluded in this rulemaking proceeding we reaffirm the principle that tariffs,and any limitation of liability provisions included in tariffs,are not designed to immunize carriers from liability for willful or fraudulent misconduct and violations of the law.id.at pp.
two years later,in its revised decision,the puc specifically refrained from adopting any preventive measures to be taken by telephone companies or billing agents,such as oan,to prevent cramming.cal.decision general order,market rules to empower telecommunications consumers and to prevent fraud march,cal.lexis at pp.the puc believed it made little sense to micromanage the entities regarding security measures,given that there are a number of security measures a carrier could adopt in order to minimize the risk of cramming.id.at.instead,the puc determined it did not need to impose security measures to prevent cramming because telephone companies and billing agents,such as oan,had strong financial incentives to adopt their own significant security measures to prevent cramming,and consumers would continue to benefit from significant statutory protections in sections and,which forbid placement of unauthorized charges on a telephone bill id.at pp.in promulgating rules governing cramming complaints at that time,the puc explained that its intent was to establish,first and foremost,that t elephone companies may bill subscribers only for authorized charges.public utilities code,subdivision a does not put any qualifications on its statement that a telephone bill may only contain charges.thus a carrier responsibility to avoid placing unauthorized charges on its customers phone bills extends to situations where a charge may originate with a billing agent or third party vendor.this responsibility is the same regardless of whether the charge at issue is or non.id.at pp,fn.omitted.the rules in no way alter the responsibilities of persons or entities that originate charges placed on phone bills third party vendors and billing agents are part of the billing chain and therefore share responsibility for ensuring that only authorized charges are placed on consumers phone bills.this responsibility extends to both and charges.in sum,t hese rules benefit consumers by clarifying that phone companies are ultimately responsible for any unauthorized charges placed on their customers phone bills.placing this responsibility on carriers ensures that they will actively monitor the entities for whom they provide billing and collection services,and will adopt appropriate safeguards to prevent their bills from being used to facilitate illegal cramming.id.at pp.italics added.thus,we reject pacific bell contention made at oral argument that by the decision,the puc determined that telephone companies were not to be held liable for unauthorized charges included on a subscriber telephone bills until after the bills were sent,the subscriber had complained about the bill,and the telephone company failed to resolve the complaint to the subscriber satisfaction.
on december,the puc modified decision,to clarify the applicability of the rules,by noting that its intent in limiting the applicability of the rules was not to foreclose the ability of private individuals from filing claims under section or limit any existing rights.rather,it was to indicate that we believe that all alleged violations of the g.rules should be brought to the commission for resolution as,we have primary jurisdiction over these matters.citation.w e shall be implementing a variety of consumer education programs and developing several initiatives to enhance enforcement of existing statutes and regulations as part of our consumer protection initiative.it is important that the interpretation and application of the rules are consistent with these programs and initiatives.therefore,the commission,and not the courts,should interpret the application of the rules.cal.order modifying decision and denying rehearing of the decision,as modified december,cal.lexis,at.because plaintiff does not seek to enforce the puc cramming rules,we see no merit to pacific bell argument that the puc should resolve this lawsuit because of its expertise in the telecommunications industry,and it knows how resolution of an individual matter may affect its continuing policies and programs.
in its final decision adopting california telephone corporation billing rules,dated october,the puc adopted modifications to general order to ensure that part of go clearly specifies the rules required to ensure that only authorized charges are placed on a subscriber bill,and as reflected in the rules attached to today decision to clarify that,as unambiguously required by the public utilities code,the subscriber must authorize all charges that appear on a california telephone bill.cal.decision issuing general order,final decision adopting california telephone corporation billing rules october,cal.lexis at pp,rehearing denied by order,dated,cal.lexis.in the decision attachment a,revised general order no,part,california telephone corporation billing rules,the puc rewrote the rules to address and report issues.cal.lexis,supra,attachment a at pp.however,the puc repeated that compliance with these rules does not relieve billing telephone corporations of other obligations they may have under their tariffs,other commission general orders and decisions,fcc orders,and state and federal statutes,and these rules shall not be interpreted to abridge or alter a right of action under any other state or federal law.id.at.in pertinent part,the rules now read that billing telephone corporations shall only place charges that have been authorized by the subscriber on the subscriber telephone bill.all charges billed without subscriber authorization are unlawful billing telephone corporations shall bill subscribers only for authorized charges.billing telephone corporations shall adopt protocols which prohibit billing agents and service providers from submitting,directly or indirectly,charges for billing through a billing telephone company that the subscriber has not authorized.billing telephone corporations must monitor or cause to be monitored,either directly or through a billing agent,or other entity,each service provider continuing compliance with this requirement billing telephone corporations are directed to take certain enumerated measures in the rules to ensure only authorized charges are included in a bill but t he billing telephone corporation bears ultimate responsibility for all items presented in a subscriber bill each billing telephone corporation is responsible for monitoring the billings it controls for the purpose of preventing and detecting unauthorized charges,and for the prompt termination of billing services to billing agents and service providers that present unauthorized charges.each billing telephone corporation shall have in place and comply with a protocol for identifying unauthorized charges and suspending or terminating billing services to any billing agent or service providers that has submitted unauthorized charges and nothing herein shall prevent a subscriber from exercising his or her other rights.id.at pp.
by its general order and decisions,the puc has not effectively occupied the field such that all superior court actions raising cramming issues are subject to puc exclusive jurisdiction,as defendants suggest.more specifically,and as pertinent to our discussion,the puc has not approved a general policy of limiting the liability of telephone companies and billing agents for cramming.waters pacific.cal d,italics added waters.nor has the puc stated that compliance with its rules provides a safe harbor against liability for entities that are found to engage in the illegal practice of cramming.hartwell,supra,cal th at.concededly,the puc can redress violations of law or its orders by suit,by mandamus or injunction,by actions to recover penalties,and by contempt proceedings,but these remedies are essentially prospective in nature.they are designed to stop utilities from engaging in current and ongoing violations and do not redress injuries for past wrongs.citation.because the puc can not provide for such relief for past violations,superior court damage actions would not interfere with the puc in implementing its supervisory and regulatory policies to prevent future harm.hartwell,supra,cal th at.
we therefore conclude defendants have not established plaintiff lawsuit would result in a decision that would be contrary to a policy adopted by the puc or interfere with the puc regulation of entities subject to the statutory prohibition against cramming.hartwell,supra,cal th at waters,supra,cal d at award of damages for negligence in providing telephone service would conflict with tariff limiting telephone subscriber to credit allowance for improper service brian pacific bell d,action for damages barred by puc order prohibiting such a remedy for defendant alleged conduct.on the contrary,this lawsuit would be in aid of,rather than in derogation of,the puc jurisdiction.hartwell,supra,cal th at.accordingly,we can not affirm the sustaining of defendants demurrers based on the ground that the puc has exclusive jurisdiction over this lawsuit 
ii.application of primary jurisdiction doctrine is not warranted in this case 
we also conclude that this lawsuit should not be stayed or dismissed under the primary jurisdiction doctrine.primary jurisdiction comes into play whenever enforcement of the claim requires the resolution of issues which,under a regulatory scheme,have been placed within the special competence of an administrative body in such a case the judicial process is suspended pending referral of such issues to the administrative body for its views.farmers ins.exchange superior court cal th,farmers ins.exchange,quoting from united states western pac.t he primary jurisdiction doctrine advances two related policies it enhances court decisionmaking and efficiency by allowing courts to take advantage of administrative expertise,and it helps assure uniform application of regulatory laws.citations.farmers ins.exchange,supra,cal th at.however,n o rigid formula exists for applying the primary jurisdiction doctrine citation.instead,resolution generally hinges on a court determination of the extent to which the policies noted above are implicated in a given case.citations.this discretionary approach leaves courts with considerable flexibility to avoid application of the doctrine in appropriate situations,as required by the interests of justice.id.at,fn.omitted.
in this case,the critical issue to be resolved is whether defendants should be held liable for their allegedly unlawful practice of cramming.to resolve that issue,the superior court will be required to construe section,an inherently judicial function.c ourts are the ultimate arbiters of the construction of a statute.citation.an administrative agency can not alter or enlarge the legislation,and an erroneous administrative construction does not govern the court interpretation of the statute.citation.citation.this case turns on a question of statutory interpretation,a matter with which courts have considerable experience and which does not necessitate deferral to another agency.citation.citation.in this case,neither efficiency nor uniformity would be enhanced by administrative expertise.citations.people ex rel.kennedy beaumont investment,th.
iii.first amended complaint is sufficient and certain to withstand demurrers 
we also see no basis to dismiss this lawsuit on the ground that the allegations in the first amended complaint are insufficient or uncertain.regardless of the titles of the causes of actions,the gravamen of plaintiff complaint is defendants alleged conduct of causing,directly or indirectly,the inclusion of unauthorized charges on a subscriber telephone bill.in evaluating a demurrer,the complaint will be held good,although the facts may not be clearly stated,or may be intermingled with a statement of other facts irrelevant to the cause of action shown,or although the plaintiff may demand relief to which he is not entitled under the facts alleged.citation.gruenberg,supra,cal d at.
under the title of causes of actions based on violations of section and the ucl,plaintiff alleges his telephone bill included a charge that he did not authorize and for which he has not received a full refund.we conclude those facts are sufficient to demonstrate substantive causes of action for violations of section and the ucl.because business and professions code section is written in the disjunctive,it establishes three varieties of unfair competition acts or practices which are unlawful,or unfair,or fraudulent.in other words,a practice is prohibited as unfair or deceptive even if not unlawful and vice versa.citation.cel tech communications,supra,cal th at see mckell,supra,th at a business practice need only meet one of the three criteria to be considered unfair competition under the ucl.by proscribing any unlawful business practice,the ucl borrows violations of other laws and treats them as unlawful practices that the ucl makes independently actionable.citation.cel tech communications,supra,cal th at.because the complaint states a cause of action for a violation of section,we also conclude the complaint states a cause of action for a violation of the ucl under the unlawful prong 
defendants challenges to the causes of the action for violations of section and the ucl appear to equate the inclusion of an unauthorized charge on a subscriber telephone bill with a finding of liability.however,whether the inclusion of an unauthorized charge on a subscriber telephone bill will render defendants liable for monetary relief will require consideration of legal and factual issues to be resolved at a later stage in the litigation.it is an elementary rule that the sole function of a demurrer is to test the sufficiency of the challenged pleading matters of defense not apparent in the pleading are not available upon demurrer.citation.childs state of california d.
for similar reasons,we reject pacific bell challenge to the cause of action for breach of contract.plaintiff alleges,in pertinent part,that plaintiff and the class entered into substantially identical service agreements with pacific bell whereby plaintiff and the class agreed to pay an agreed upon sum in return for defendants activation of plaintiff telephone account and pacific bell provision of communication services to plaintiff and the class pacific bell expressly impliedly agreed to bill plaintiff and the class only for products or services the purchase of which they had authorized and pacific bell breached its contractual obligations
