the dte energy company and the detroit edison company detroit edison petition for review of three orders of the federal energy regulatory commission ruling that certain distribution and interconnection facilities are transmission facilities subject to the commission exclusive jurisdiction.dte petition is not properly before the court because it failed to seek rehearing or petition for review of its aggrieving order.see b.detroit edison petition for review of two orders is properly before the court,and it contends the commission acted arbitrarily and capriciously because the facilities at issue are local facilities and should therefore be subject to the shared jurisdiction of the commission and the state of michigan.ordinarily,this would occasion our review of the commission application of its jurisdictional test adopted in order which the commission asserts it applied here.however,because detroit edison failed to argue in its petition for rehearing that the commission misapplied the test,the court lacks jurisdiction to consider it now.instead,detroit edison raised on rehearing,as it does on appeal,a substantial evidence challenge to the commission factual findings and a collateral attack on the commission approach.accordingly,we deny the petition because the commission findings in support of its jurisdictional conclusion are supported by substantial evidence in the record and its collateral attack is precluded.
section of the federal power act fpa,b,empowers the commission to regulate both wholesale sales of electric energy in interstate commerce and interstate electric energy transmissions,by vesting it with jurisdiction over all facilities for such transmission or sale of electric energy.it also reserves regulatory authority to the states over bundled retail transactions,including the intrastate sale and distribution of electricity through local distribution facilities.id.in transmission access policy study group ferc,taps,the court affirmed order in relevant part,deferring to the commission interpretation of section of the fpa to accommodate new industry practices and conditions.id.at.in order,the commission adopted a jurisdictional test to identify unbundled facilities primarily engaged in local distribution the commission claimed exclusive jurisdiction over all other facilities id.at.thereafter,in new york ferc,d,the supreme court affirmed.by rejecting new york contention that the dividing line between regulatory authority of the states and the commission falls between wholesale and retail markets,id.at.at,the court implicitly approved the commission approach over unbundled facilities,see id.at.at.
accordingly,the commission has applied order test to determine jurisdictional authority over utilities providing unbundled retail services see taps,at.when the commission recently ignored the test to resolve such jurisdictional questions,the court rejected,as contrary to the statute and precedent,the commission attempt to expand its jurisdiction to set rates for all services occurring over facilities used for both retail and wholesale distribution,expressing concern that the orders under review totally ignore order carefully formulated test for distinguishing between local distribution facilities and facilities.detroit edison ferc,detroit edison.
the instant appeal arises in the context of the commission efforts to establish a regional transmission organization rto to integrate the midwest wholesale electricity market.in response to rising energy costs in the midwest,the commission facilitated the development of a midwest rto and the integration of transmission companies to operate under the rto umbrella.see generally pub.util.dist.ferc.after evaluating competing proposals,the commission determined that midwest independent transmission system operator,midwest iso should serve as the foundation for the midwest rto.
detroit edison and international transmission it were both wholly owned subsidiaries of dte energy.detroit edison operates as dte energy public utility,engaged in the generation,transmission,and distribution of energy in michigan.dte energy,wl.dte energy created it with the purpose of acquiring ownership of detroit edison transmission assets as a first effort to divest its transmission business to an entity qualified to join the midwest rto.see id.thus,on may,dte,detroit edison,and it sought and received the commission authorization to transfer detroit edison transmission facilities with voltage ratings of kv and above to it.id.following the january,transfer,it transmission facilities,interconnected with those of michigan electric transmission company,together comprised substantially all of the michigan transmission grid.int l transmission,wl.
pursuant to the commission approval of midwest iso as the regional rto,it applied for and received by order of december,the commission authorization to transfer to midwest iso functional control over it jurisdictional transmission facilities.when it thereafter submitted an updated list of jurisdictional facilities to be transferred to midwest iso,cms marketing,services and trading company cms protested,arguing that the list should include detroit edison facilities interconnecting dearborn industrial generation,llc dig with,the kv line navarre line,the kv line baxter line,and the baxter substation collectively,dig facilities because these are the facilities by which dig sells electric energy to wholesale purchasers,and therefore are commission jurisdictional transmission facilities.int l transmission,wl,may,order.
by order of may,the commission found that the navarre and baxter lines appear to perform a jurisdictional transmission function because they are part of the interconnection facility connecting dig to the transmission grid,and sought additional information from it to inform the commission jurisdictional decision.id.at.the commission found the baxter substation should be included in an updated list of it transmission facilities as it had already been included in the ferc docket no.list of facilities that detroit edison was transferring to it,incorporated into the december,order.id.
detroit edison moved to intervene and responded on july,conceding that the dig facilities are,in part,interconnection facilities used in wholesale sales from the dig plant,but contending they nevertheless were part of detroit edison local distribution system.noting that the baxter and navarre lines had been developed and historically used to provide retail distribution service to electric loads located in or near the rouge industrial complex in dearborn pursuant to retail tariffs and contracts,detroit edison maintained the facilities were and should be subject to the shared jurisdiction of michigan and the commission.concerned that classifying the facilities as transmission rather than local distribution facilities would cause it to incur stranded costs,detroit edison offered alternatively to transfer limited operational control over the dig facilities to midwest iso to the extent necessary to effectuate wholesale sales.cms again protested,arguing the navarre line serves as the primary point of interconnection between dig and it from dig inception,and the baxter line had been reconfigured to serve as a secondary point of interconnection with it it appended an analysis of power flows on the two lines.
then,on october,detroit edison submitted an executed agency agreement between it and midwest iso that sought to transfer limited functional control over the dig facilities to enable midwest iso to ensure the dig generator receives service when using the facilities for wholesale sales.in responding to a deficiency letter from commission staff,detroit edison explained that customers must obtain service over the detroit edison facilities under the state retail access service tariff rast,and that ceding complete operational control to midwest iso would render detroit edison unable to recover its costs under the rast,including the costs of the baxter line.dig and cms protested,arguing that the dig facilities are an integral part of the it system and that points of interconnection from the dig facilities form a kv loop rather than being radial as is most common for local facilities hence,the dig facilities should be subject to the commission exclusive jurisdiction,and the commission should reject the agency agreement.
by order of march,the commission found that the dig facilities perform a transmission,not a local distribution function.detroit edison,wl,march,order.specifically,the commission found that the facilities are facilities that together with the dig ring bus,form a kv loop through which power flows into and out of it interstate transmission facilities.id.at.noting further that michigan has implemented retail access for all customers of michigan utilities,the commission found that retail customers are entitled to receive unbundled retail access pursuant to a tariff.id.additionally,the commission found that dig,interconnected by the dig facilities to it,is selling all its output at wholesale.id.based on these factual findings,the commission concluded that the dig facilities primarily function as transmission facilities,and full operational control should be transferred to midwest iso.id.it noted,however,that detroit edison should be able to collect its rast through charges,and that although in most cases there will be identifiable local distribution facilities subject to state jurisdiction,we also believe that even when there are no identifiable local distribution facilities,states nevertheless have jurisdiction in all circumstances over the service of delivering energy to end users.id.in its april,order,international transmission,wl,april,order,the commission accepted dte and it compliance filing with modifications to reflect transfer of the dig facilities to midwest iso it also affirmed its findings in its march,order.
finally,by order of november,the commission denied,in relevant part,dte and detroit edison petitions for rehearing of the march,and april,orders,stating that both parties had presented the same arguments as before without offering any new evidence.detroit edison,wl,november,rehearing order.in seeking rehearing,detroit edison conceded that the dig facilities are facilities that together with dig ring bus form a kv loop configuration,and that power can flow into and out of the facilities,but it argued that the dig facilities also perform a retail distribution function,which should be subject to state jurisdiction.detroit edison also moved to reopen the record to include a recent michigan public service commission order,which it contended supports its view that the facilities perform a retail distribution function.the commission explained that while local distribution lines may exist,the record demonstrated the dig facilities were not local distribution facilities.this finding,the commission observed,is consistent with the test outlined in order for classifying facilities as transmission or local distribution.id.at.the commission denied detroit edison motion to reopen the record for failure to show an extraordinary change in circumstances outweighing the need for finality and going to the heart of the case.id.at.the commission also noted that deference to a state commission classification was inappropriate here because the michigan public service commission order did not discuss or apply the test or reclassify the dig facilities.id.
on appeal,dte and detroit edison challenge the commission may,and march,orders and the november,rehearing order.we first address two jurisdictional issues.
section a of the fpa provides that a ny person aggrieved by an order issued by the commission may apply for a rehearing,but n o proceeding to review any orders of the commission shall be brought by any person unless such a person shall have made application to the commission for a rehearing thereon.a.a party may only obtain judicial review of an aggrieving order,in accordance with section b,within sixty days after the order of the commission upon the application for rehearing.id.b.neither the court nor the commission has the discretion to ignore this express statutory limitation on the jurisdiction of the court.dep t of water res.ferc,quoting.gas pipeline ferc,granholm ex rel.dep t of natural res.ferc.
dte energy petitions for review of the commission may,order,for which it did not seek rehearing before the commission,but fails to challenge the april,order,by which it is aggrieved.hence,dte energy is not a proper party to these proceedings.in the may order,the commission conditionally accepted the compliance filing by dte energy and it submitted pursuant to the commission december,order,but directed dte energy to submit further information in response to cms protest regarding the exclusion of the navarre and baxter lines as transmission facilities in the filing.it was not until the april order,in which detroit edison intervened,that the commission accepted dte energy compliance filing with modifications directing dte energy,it,and detroit edison to revise their filings to include the dig facilities as jurisdictional transmission facilities to be transferred to midwest iso for operational control.april,order,at.
dte failure to seek rehearing of the may,order is fatal to its challenge of that order in its petition for review.a cal.dep t of water,at.the mandatory requirement of filing a petition for rehearing is designed to afford the commission an opportunity to invoke its expertise or to correct any errors prior to judicial review,and the court can not consider dte challenge to the may order anew.see granholm,at.it is unsurprising,however,that dte energy did not petition for rehearing of the may order because it is the april order,instead,by which it is aggrieved.as the court has explained,a party is aggrieved within the meaning of b if it can establish both the constitutional and prudential requirements for standing.pub.util.dist,at citations omitted.dte energy can show no,see id.citing lujan defenders of wildlife,d,as a result of the may order,because it was conditional,subject to a further compliance filing,and thus was without binding effect on dte energy.cal.dep t of water,at.it was not until the order of april,when the commission accepted the compliance filing,that dte energy could demonstrate actual injury.see.energy power auth.ferc.but while dte energy sought rehearing of the april order,its petition for review by the court challenges only the november,rehearing order.because dte energy failed to identify the aggrieving order in its petition for review,the court can not consider dte challenge to the commission november,rehearing order.city of oconto falls ferc.consequently,only detroit edison petition for review of the march,order and november,rehearing order are properly before the court.
section b of the fpa provides that n o objection to the order of the commission shall be considered by the court unless such objection shall have been urged before the commission in the application for rehearing unless there is reasonable ground for failure to do so.b.this principle is an unusually strict requirement that will not be ignored by the courts,even absent an objection by the commission.wabash valley power ass n,ferc,see also high country res.ferc,cir.
while detroit edison sought rehearing of the march,order,by which it is aggrieved,it did not argue in its petition for rehearing before the commission that the commission misapplied the test.instead,it raises the argument for the first time in its reply brief to the court.detroit edison fails to offer any grounds,let alone reasonable grounds,under section b of the fpa to excuse its failure to raise this argument before the commission on rehearing.see omya,ferc.however,while the commission argues in its brief on appeal that it applied the test in the analysis of the march,order,it did not expressly reference the test until the rehearing order.even then the commission did not state it was applying the test,commenting only that its factual conclusions are consistent with the test.november,rehearing order,at.this language is hardly consistent with the commission statement in order that it will apply its jurisdictional test.order at.nevertheless,detroit edison acknowledged the applicability of th
