midamerican energy company mec appeals the district court ruling on summary judgment that mec contractually owes appellee nebraska public power district nppd current,payments towards the estimated decommissioning costs for a nuclear facility.we reverse and remand.
in,the parties predecessors entered a power sales contract psc the psc obligated nppd to construct and manage a nuclear power facility known as the cooper nuclear station cooper and obligated mec to purchase power therefrom until.the parties originally contemplated a joint venture but,fearful that mec ownership would hinder nppd ability to obtain financing,structured the deal such that nppd would own cooper while mec would pay its share through monthly power costs.
the psc remains in effect until.it requires nppd to inform mec by whether it will decommission or continue operating cooper after.in section,the psc distinguishes between two scenarios.if nppd elects to shut cooper down in,the parties must share decommissioning costs equally.mec does not dispute this liability.however,if nppd continues operating cooper after,the psc terminates both mec continuing obligations arising from cooper and also its right to any refund of excess payments for power and energy theretofore purchased.
the parties agree that at some point between the time they entered into the psc and the start of the present litigation,it became apparent that the costs of decommissioning cooper would greatly exceed those originally anticipated.in,the nuclear regulatory commission adopted a final rule requiring operators of nuclear facilities to file decommissioning plans,and to decommissioning by placing money aside in an external sinking fund.see nuclear regulatory commission final rule,general requirements for decommissioning nuclear facilities.june.since the parties have done so.the psc requires nppd to submit to mec a monthly statement reflecting the prior month monthly power costs.in,nppd added a line item for decommissioning costs to this bill.while the parties neither reached a separate agreement nor amended the psc to address these costs,mec paid these statements without objection.final decommissioning costs are estimated to run as high as.after subtracting amounts recouped through salvage value,the parties joint liability may reach.as of the commencement of this litigation,the parties had each paid in approximately.the parties now dispute the significance of mec payments.
nppd initiated this litigation,seeking a declaratory judgment that the psc requires mec to make current,payments towards estimated decommissioning costs.nppd argues that such payments fall within the definition of monthly power costs,obligating mec to pay them.moreover,nppd argues that they constitute payments for power and energy.if so,in the event of nppd continued operation of cooper after,the psc cuts off mec right to any reimbursement.mec counters that the psc imposes no such obligation.it argues that estimated future decommissioning costs do not fit within the definition of monthly power costs and as such are wholly outside the psc.mec has counterclaimed to establish its right to recover the amounts it has already paid if nppd does continue operating cooper after.the district court found the psc unambiguously supports nppd position.
on appeal,mec argues that the district court did not have the power to hear the case,asserting that the dispute is not yet ripe.on the merits,mec argues that the district court erred as the psc does not require payments of estimated decomissioning costs and unambiguously exempts mec from all decommissioning liability if nppd continues operations after.we take these issues up in turn.
nppd brought this action under,which authorizes the federal courts to issue declaratory judgments in most cases within their jurisdiction.mec urges us to dismiss this matter for lack of jurisdiction on ripeness grounds.the psc requires nppd to inform mec no later than whether it plans to decommission or continue operating cooper after.nppd has not yet made such an election.as mec does not dispute its obligation to pay half of all decommissioning costs in the event nppd does decommission cooper in,mec argues that no actual dispute can arise between the parties until.
the ripeness doctrine flows both from the article iii cases and controversies limitations and also from prudential considerations for refusing to exercise jurisdiction.reno catholic soc,d.its basic rationale is to prevent the courts,through avoidance of premature adjudication,from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements.abbott labs.gardner,d.it requires that before a federal court may address itself to a question,there must exist a real,substantial controversy between parties having adverse legal interests,a dispute definite and concrete,not hypothetical or abstract.babbitt united farm workers union,d quoting railway mail ass corsi.parties may not simply submit questions of general interest or curiosity to the federal court.see,public serv.comm wycoff.
while in theory,judicial ripeness often proves something of a cantaloupe.the difference between an abstract question and a case or controversy is one of degree,of course,and is not discernible by any precise test.babbitt,at.the supreme court has directed that the ripeness inquiry requires examination of both the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.abbott labs.at.pacific gas state energy res.conservation dev.comm n,d.
the fitness for judicial decision inquiry goes to a court ability to visit an issue.in appeals from administrative regulation,the fitness prong questions finality and exhaustion.see,lane usda,cir.more generally,however,it safeguards against judicial review of hypothetical or speculative disagreements.babbitt,at.state of missouri ex rel.missouri highway transp.comm cuffley,cir.while courts shy from settling disputes contingent in part on future possibilities,certain cases may warrant review based on their particular disposition.shalala illinois council on long term care,d.exception may be had where an issue is largely legal in nature,abbott,at,may be resolved without further factual development,pacific gas,at,or where judicial resolution will largely settle the parties dispute,ernst young depositors econ.prot,cir.see also cuffley,at,refusing to address a first amendment challenge to the ku klux klan proposed participation in a state highway sponsorship program where the state sought judicial review prior to actually rejecting the klan application.
in addition to being fit for judicial resolution,an issue must be such that delayed review will result in significant harm.harm includes both the traditional concept of actual or also the heightened uncertainty and resulting behavior modification that may result from delayed resolution.ohio forestry ass n,sierra club,d.for example,in pacific gas,the court stressed the financial impact that delayed adjudication would have on the petitioning utilities and the public by forcing them to gamble millions of dollars on an uncertain state of law.at.accord ernst young,at c ourts should not become mired in the frequently sophistic distinction as to whether refusing declaratory relief will actually impose a hardship or merely fail to confer a benefit.a party need not wait for actual harm to occur.south dakota mining ass lawrence county,cir.however,both the immediacy and the size of the threatened harm impact the ripeness must be significant.
as ripeness combines the constitutional and the prudential,it is unclear whether fitness and significant harm constitute a test or two independent bases for ripeness.some circuits have held that both prongs must be satisfied in order for an issue to be ripe.see,ernst young,at med.ctr.watkins,western oil gas ass sonoma county,cir.other circuits have noted the dispute.see,philadelphia fed of teachers ridge,cir nutritional health alliance shalala,cir.we have not previously addressed the question.
a party seeking judicial relief must necessarily satisfy both prongs to at least a minimal degree.judicial resolution of a legal question fit for judicial review yet portending no immediate hardship would constitute little more than a law review article.conversely,to resolve an issue lacking factual development simply to avoid a threatened harm would be to favor expedition over just resolution.see,cuffley,at refusing to address first amendment arguments prior to state actually taking proposed course of action.such is not to say that we may adjudicate only purely legal issues threatening extravagant injuries.rather,the two prongs must play off each other.ernst young,at acknowledging that the two ripeness branches must operate on a sliding scale.in pacific gas,for example,the court held ripe a preemption challenge to a state statute that barred construction of additional nuclear facilities until development of sufficient spent fuel storage.at.while the challenged statute had yet to be applied,the question presented was purely legal,the nature of the challenge required no further factual development and the resulting legal uncertainty placed millions of dollars in investment at risk.id.somewhere between scylla and charybdis lie cases appropriate to judicial resolution.
mec argues that no actual dispute can arise between the parties until,when nppd elects whether or not to decommission cooper.thus the triggering event for mec payment or remains in the future.the question presented,however,the unambiguous meaning of the psc,is purely legal.even if we must venture beyond the four corners of the psc,unlike cuffley,all facts necessary to the resolution of this case have already been established.additionally,judicial resolution of this matter will largely settle the parties dispute.
the issue raised also threatens substantial hardship resulting from delayed judicial resolution.together,the parties have collected over towards an anticipated exposure of up to in decommissioning costs.the insecurity caused by their contending interpretations of the psc works a definite,tangible and significant future harm,and indeed even works a present harm on their ability to plan and to conduct business operations.delayed judicial resolution would only increase the parties uncertainty,and would require nppd to gamble millions of dollars on an uncertain legal foundation.where the uncertainty resulting from such a situation creates a sufficiently substantial financial risk,or will force parties to modify their behavior significantly,an issue may be ripe.see pacific gas,at.
finally,we note that r ipeness is peculiarly a question of timing and is governed by the situation at the time of review,rather than the situation at the time of the events under review.anderson green,d quotations omitted.here,the parties are but three years from the decommissioning decision.were we to withhold adjudication,they would perforce return here shortly,making precisely the same arguments,with nary a scintilla of additional relevant evidence.withholding adjudication will only work significant hardship on the parties.balancing the foregoing,we rule the question question of the psc for adjudication.
the psc plain meaning 
we now turn to the merits.the district court found that the psc unambiguously obligates mec to make current,payments towards estimated decommissioning costs.the district court also held that mec has forfeited any right to recovery by failing to comply with the psc complaint mechanism.accordingly,the district court awarded nppd summary judgment.mec asks us to reverse this ruling,and to grant its motion for summary judgment.
the parties agree that nebraska law governs the psc.the initial question of whether a contract is ambiguous is a question of law to be determined by the trial court.actonet,allou health beauty care,cir.we review that determination de novo.simeone first bank ass n,cir.
in construing a contract,we look first to see whether it is unambiguous as a matter of law the terms of a contract are to be accorded their plain and ordinary meaning as ordinary,average,or reasonable persons would understand them.daehnke nebraska dep t of soc.moreover,a contract must be interpreted to give effect to the parties intent at the time the contract was drafted.kast life ins.a contract must be construed as a whole,and if possible,effect must be given to every part thereof.isham.a party may not pick and choose those portions that favor its positions.bedrosky hiner.in reading a contract for ambiguity,the specific governs the general.krzycki genoa bank.in determining whether a contract is ambiguous,under nebraska law,a court may look to course of performance evidence.stephens radium petroleum.when so read,a contract is ambiguous if a word,phrase,or provision in the instrument has,or is susceptible of,at least two reasonable but conflicting interpretations or meanings.krzycki,at.a court must determine the meaning of an unambiguous contract without resort to extrinsic evidence.however,if the contract is is,if it may objectively be understood in more than one extrinsic evidence is admissible.rayman american charter fed.sav.loan ass n,cir.finally,that each party asserts the psc unambiguously supports its position does not preclude us from finding unambiguity.mccormack citibank,cir.
applying these rules to the psc,we conclude that on its four corners,it unambiguously makes mec liable for decommissioning costs only in the event that nppd ceases operating cooper in,and does not impose an obligation on mec for current,payments of estimated decommissioning costs.in reaching its conclusion,the district court misconstrued the plain language of the psc and credited inappropriate evidence.
the evidence 
during the contract period,the psc obligates nppd to invoice mec for fifty percent of monthly power costs.section l defines these as all of nppd costs resulting from the ownership,operation and maintenance of and renewals and replacements to cooper.the district court found that accrued,estimated decommissioning costs fell within this definition.if monthly power costs does include estimated decommissioning costs,mec has an unquestioned current obligation to pay them.moreover,the psc would cut off any right to reimbursement in the event that nppd elects to continue operating after.
this reading,however,strains the contract language.the parties anticipated some decommissioning costs and addressed them in section.section b provides that if nppd shuts cooper down in,it must proceed with decommissioning and liquidate all cooper assets.it requires nppd to invoice mec for fifty percent of all decommissioning costs accrued each month that are not satisfied from other sources for which mec must reimburse nppd section a,however,provides that nppd continued operation of cooper after will terminate all of mec rights and obligations under the psc,including those imposed by section b 
nebraska law forbids a party to pick and choose among favorable contract clauses,but rather requires each clause to be read in light of the entire contract.bedrosky,at.section l specifically enumerates various elements of monthly power costs,yet,unlike section,does not reference decommissioning.moreover,the phrase ownership,operation and maintenance of and renewals and replacements in section l most naturally regards only costs associated with the running of cooper as opposed to shutting it down.
section l must also be read in light of section b which requires nppd to provide mec with a detailed estimate of monthly power costs ninety days before the start of each contract year.section c then requires nppd to review that estimate after six months and in the event such estimate does not substantially correspond with actual receipts or expenditures,or if there are at any time during any contract year extraordinary receipts or payments of unusual costs substantially affecting the monthly power costs,to provide mec with a revised estimate.this does not support the suggestion that estimated decommissioning costs,not paid until the contract expires,constitute monthly power costs because the latter can not be compared to current receipts or expenditures.this reading similarly does not square with the language in section b which requires nppd to bill mec for decommissioning payments paid or accrued during the previous month and requires mec to reimburse nppd for those payments,rather than for estimated amounts.
a contract must be construed as a whole and effect must be given to every portion thereof if possible,at.the inclusion of decommissioning as a monthly power cost largely eviscerates section a release of mec from the costs imposed in section b.the district court read section a as merely absolving mec from responsibility for any shortfall between the decommissioning funds and actual decommissioning costs.this reading finds support neither in the text nor in common sense.section a expressly releases mec from the decommissioning costs imposed by section b,and says nothing about a shortfall.moreover,this reading would nullify the benefit mec allegedly bargained for.under the district court reading,mec exchanged sole control over and right to cooper and its generated energy for protection from any possible shortfall.the record,however,established that the parties periodically update their decommissioning cost forecasts,and that those projections become increasingly accurate over time.the district court reading permits nppd to bill mec for fifty percent of any upward adjustment in forecast costs as an accrued operating expense.even though the parties initially underestimated decommissioning costs,permitting nppd to bill mec for all upward adjustments will ultimately render mec benefit nugatory 
t he meaning which arises from a particular portion of an agreement can not control the meaning of the entire agreement where such inference runs counter to the agreement overall scheme or plan.lamb eng g const.nppd,cir quoting rafos outboard marine,cir.the district court reading runs contrary to the psc internal scheme.section i costs of acquisition and construction,section l monthly power costs and section decommissioning costs together define the three stages of cooper life.each stage contains discrete funding sources and protective devices to ensure that each party pays only fifty percent of each stage of cooper costs.including decommissioning as a monthly power cost would upset this scheme.requiring mec to make payments based on estimated decommissioning costs would create the risk that one party will ultimately pay more than fifty percent of decommissioning.additionally,this would require mec to pay of decommissioning costs attributable to any of nppd use.as indicated,nppd does not suggest,nor did the district court find,a contrary design.
nppd argues,and the district court held,that section requires mec to pay equally for decommissioning.section provides that nppd shall make monthly payments,determined on the same basis and in the same manner as mec s payments,for power and energy from cooper.this merely begs the question how are mec costs determined which returns us to sections l and.regardless of whether decommissioning constitutes a monthly power cost,both parties pay the same amount of monthly power costs.and section specifically creates an imbalance regarding the payment of decommissioning costs in the event nppd continues operations in.as the specific governs the general,krzycki,at,section governs.
finally,the district court put much stock in section b list of possible sources of decommissioning funds.the psc uses three similar formulations.first,nppd shall invoice mec for fifty percent of the previous month costs 
i n excess of funds created pursuant to the bond resolution,accumulated revenues from operation of cooper,credits received for fuel or fuel elements remaining as a part of cooper at the time of decommissioning and proceeds and credits from the sale of equipment,machinery,supplies and land associated with cooper or on account of the use of such items by nppd for its other activities,and which are available for payment of said costs and expenses by nppd.
next,mec shall reimburse nppd for decommissioning costs and expenses 
t o the extent that funds,proceeds and credits created,accumulated or realized in connection with construction,operation and decommissioning of cooper are unavailable or inadequate to pay said costs and expenses.
finally,after each year,nppd shall provide mec with a statement detailing all costs 
i n excess of funds and credits available for payment of said costs and expenses from funds created pursuant to the bond resolution,accumulated revenues from operation of cooper,credits received for fuel or fuel elements remaining as a part of cooper at the time of decommissioning and proceeds and credits from the sale of equipment,machinery,supplies and land associated with cooper or on account of the use of such items by nppd for its other activities.
the district court ruled this language clearly shows the parties intended that decommissioning costs would be accumulated from monthly power costs.we disagree.this language certainly permits the parties to collect decommissioning funds during the contract period but in no sense requires.nor does this language dictate that such collections,if made,constitute monthly power costs.finally,as this language appears in section b,which assumes that nppd has shut cooper down in,it does not address what would happen to such accumulated funds were nppd to continue operations.
the psc four corners are unambiguous in not imposing on mec an obligation to make current payments of estimated decommissioning costs.
extrinsic evidence 
in reaching its ruling,the district court gave weight to two additional types of evidence.because we hold that such was error,we specifically address them in turn.
first,the district court looked to sources detailing the modern nuclear industry.these suggest that in modern industry parlance,decommissioning constitutes an operating cost which accrues from the moment a plant comes.the court relied on this evidence to give meaning to monthly power costs.
nebraska law requires a contract to be read to give meaning to the intent of the parties at the time that the contract was made.kast,at.this rule avoids confusion resulting from changes in language and usage over time that might affect a contract plain contemporary meaning.in employing the modern definition of decommissioning costs,the court apparently overlooked this principle and failed to give the contract its meaning at the time it was signed.this rule renders evidence regarding practices the contract signing inapposite.
the district court also relied on cases discussing the principle of equity,which holds that decommissioning costs are properly charged to current consumers rather than levied entirely on those buying electricity when decommissioning occurs.the merits of this principle notwithstanding,neither nppd nor the district court explain why it should trump a binding contract providing otherwise.if mec contracted its way out of decommissioning costs,the principle of equity can not not them.see generally town of boylston ferc.
course of performance evidence 
in addition to the above evidence,the district court also considered the parties conduct in performing under the psc in determining whether the psc was ambiguous.nebraska law conflicts on the point,but suggests that a court may do so.
in bishop buffets,westroads,the nebraska supreme court rejected an attempt to use course of conduct evidence to call into question otherwise unambiguous contractual language.the court held that such evidence aid s in the determination of the intent of the parties where that intent is not otherwise clearly expressed in the document.id.at.moreover,t he practical construction put upon a lease contract can not control the express,unambiguous provisions of the instrument itself.id.see also sky harbor air serv.airport auth.of omaha.
more recent nebraska authority,however,apparently stands opposed.in stephens radium petroleum,the court expressly relied on course of performance evidence in finding an employment contract to be unambiguous.it held that t he interpretation given to a contract by the parties themselves while engaged in the performance of it is one of the best indications of true intent and should be given great,if not controlling,influence.id.see also professional serv.indus,holding t he court
