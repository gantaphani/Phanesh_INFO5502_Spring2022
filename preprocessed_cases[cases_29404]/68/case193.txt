the bonneville power administration bpa is an agency within the department of energy that markets the energy output of federal power projects in the pacific northwest.in two previous decisions,we invalidated three sets of contractual arrangements in which bpa agreed to subsidize certain longtime industrial customers rather than sell them power directly.see pac.nw.coop.bonneville power admin.pngc ii,cir pac.nw.coop.dep t of energy pngc i.we held these subsidy arrangements unreasonable and contrary to bpa statutory authority,as they did not comport with congress mandate that bpa operate in a businesslike manner.see b.
in both cases,we remanded to bpa the question whether it could or should seek refunds of the improper subsidies.on remand,bpa concluded that it was contractually barred from seeking refunds as to some of the invalidated contracts,and that it had no legal or equitable basis for seeking refunds as to the others.moreover,bpa concluded,if it did pursue recovery of the subsidies,it might face counterclaims from the subsidized entities and become mired in counterproductive,protracted litigation over the amount,if any,of refunds owed.as a result,bpa decided not to pursue recovery of the unlawful subsidies invalidated by pngc i and pngc ii.
at issue in this consolidated appeal are challenges by two groups to bpa decision to forgo refunds public utilities and cooperatives that buy power from bpa,and that congress has designated as bpa or preference customers and industrial customers who buy power from public utilities in the pacific northwest and so are of bpa power.the challengers core argument is that their power costs have been impermissibly raised by bpa decision because,if bpa did seek refunds of the subsidies,it could pass along the recovered funds to its customers as lower rates.
background 
bpa is an agency within the department of energy created by congress in to market the power generated by federally owned dams on the columbia river.portland bonneville power admin.pge,cir see.congress has since expanded bpa mandate to include marketing authority over nearly all the electric power generated by federal facilities in the pacific northwest.ass of pub.agency customers,bonneville power admin.apac,cir see.in numerous prior opinions,we have provided extensive background on bpa history and operations.see,pge,at pngc i,at apac,at.here,we summarize only those statutory provisions and recent developments directly relevant to this appeal.
statutory framework 
four statutes govern bpa operations the pacific northwest electric power planning and conservation act of,northwest power act the pacific northwest federal transmission system act of,transmission act the pacific northwest consumer power preference act of,preference act and the bonneville project act of,bonneville project act.as we have noted before,t hese statutes subject bpa to a variety of detailed and potentially conflicting statutory directives,ranging from fiscal to environmental concerns.apac,at.of most direct relevance to this appeal are two sets of statutory directives the guidelines and the sound businesslike principles obligation.
rate setting guidelines 
a complex of statutory provisions dictates how bpa must proceed when selling federal power.first,bpa must give priority,as well as its most favorable rate the pf rate,to publicly owned utilities,cooperatives,and federal agencies,known as preference customers.pngc i,at,pge,at see b,b.preference customers are also the only group whose energy needs bpa is required,as opposed to authorized,to meet.see pngc i,at.after meeting the preference customers needs,bpa may,if it so chooses,sell surplus power directly to certain longstanding industrial customers industrial customers or dsis at a higher but based rate the ip rate,or to anyone else at market rates.id.at,pge,at see c regardless of the type of customer,bpa must charge a rate that,at a minimum,recoups bpa own costs of generating or acquiring the electricity.alcoa,bpa,cir see a.
sound business principles 
in addition to the above guidelines,bpa also must set rates with a view to encouraging the widest possible diversified use of electric power at the lowest possible rates to consumers consistent with sound business principles.emphasis added.a different provision similarly requires that bpa set rates that recover,in accordance with sound business principles,the costs associated with the acquisition,conservation,and transmission of electric power.id.a emphasis added.more generally,congress has directed bpa to implement the northwest power act in a sound and businesslike manner.id.b emphasis added.we have previously explained that bpa business decisions are judicially reviewable for compliance with this overarching sound business principles standard,albeit with great deference to bpa conclusions.see alcoa,at pngc ii,at.
b.the aluminum dsi contracts 
historically,the aluminum manufacturers of the pacific northwest were among bpa largest industrial customers.see pngc i,at.until recently,bpa did not have trouble meeting the needs of its preference customers while also providing abundant power to the aluminum dsis,including alcoa.see id.but,as the pacific northwest has grown,bpa has found itself constrained by competing demands.its preference customers now serve a larger population with greater energy needs,and rising energy prices have made bpa relatively cheap power increasingly attractive to nonpreferential buyers.see id.at.
beginning in,bpa embarked upon a series of attempts to aid the aluminum manufacturers without selling them power directly.see id.
the block contracts pngc i 
in,bpa entered into contracts,effective starting in the fiscal year,between bpa alcoa,and two other aluminum dsis and local public utilities the block contracts or block contracts.the dsis wanted to continue buying physical power from bpa at a rate.instead,bpa agreed to make payments to the aluminum dsis totaling a maximum of million per year for five years in lieu of supplying them with actual electrical power,while retaining the option to sell them physical power instead in the final two years.pngc i,at 
alcoa challenged these contracts,arguing that bpa was required to sell it physical power,sufficient to meet its needs,at a rate.id.at.concurrently,several of bpa preference and other industrial customers challenged the same contracts from the opposite direction,objecting to subsidies or sales to the dsis except for discretionary sales of surplus power.id.at.
we held that,under the relevant statutory provisions,bpa is not required to sell physical power to the dsis.id.at.rather,it is required to meet the power needs only of its preference customers,and has the option to sell to dsis thereafter,if it so chooses.id.however,if bpa does sell to dsis,it must offer them the ip rate,not a market rate.see id.at.we also held that,under appropriate circumstances,bpa may lawfully monetize its energy contracts,so long as the decision to monetize is otherwise consistent with bpa statutory obligations.id.at.but we did not find the block contracts justified under that standard.as the block contracts were effectively a sale of power at a rate below what bpa is statutorily required to offer,the ip rate,and below what it could receive on the open market from customers,the contracts were inconsistent with bpa statutory obligation to fulfill its role consistent with sound business principles.id.consequently,bpa decision to monetize the aluminum dsi contracts amount ed to an impermissible subsidy of those companies operations.id.at.
the question remained whether the aluminum dsis owed bpa a refund for any past subsidy payments.each of the block contracts contained a damages waiver providing,
in the event the ninth circuit court of appeals or other court of competent jurisdiction issues a final order that declares or renders this agreement void or otherwise unenforceable,no party shall be entitled to any damages or restitution of any nature.
id.at.we did not decide in pngc i whether this waiver was applicable,noting that there was no indication in the administrative record of how bpa believe d the damages waiver provision should be construed and,in particular,what effect it was to have if a contract were only partially invalidated.id.instead,we remanded to bpa to determine in the first instance the applicability and construction of several elements of the block contracts,including the damages waiver.id.at.in doing so,we made clear that we were not declaring the block contracts void ab initio.id.at.rather,given that the contracts contained a severability clause and,in addition to the invalidated monetary benefits provision,a possibly valid physical power sale option,they were potentially partially enforceable.see id.at.
the alcoa amendment pngc ii 
as it turned out,the physical power sale option in the block contracts was never exercised.instead,after pngc i,bpa entered into an amended contract with alcoa the alcoa amendment in which it again agreed to subsidize alcoa rather than sell it power directly.specifically,bpa agreed voluntarily to make a nearly million cash benefit payment to alcoa during fiscal year,which alcoa could use to purchase power from one of bpa competitors.pngc ii,at bpa argued that this subsidy was necessary to avoid interruption of alcoa smelter operations would assure the continued existence of the dsi load which had historically benefitted bpa in various ways and was only an interim fix before bpa could carry out the full administrative process needed to respond to the remand issues in pngc id.at.
once again,bpa priority customers filed a legal challenge,and once again we invalidated the subsidy,holding that bpa justifications for this unusual transaction did not demonstrate that the transaction was consistent with sound business principles,as required by bpa governing statutes.id.at.we rejected bpa proffered rationales as irrelevant to bpa statutory mandate,unsupported by record evidence,or illogical.as clarified by pngc i,we stated,bpa has no obligation to contract with alcoa at all,much less to provide a voluntary gift to alcoa that will lead to higher rates for its other customers and effectively subsidize its competitors.id.at.we went on to explain that protecting jobs within the region,however laudable a goal,is not among the purposes that congress has authorized bpa to pursue.id.at.we suggested,however,that a decision to sell physical power to alcoa,as opposed to merely providing monetary benefits,might produce a different result.id.at.
finally,like the earlier pngc i opinion,pngc ii declined to compel bpa to recover any payments it had already made to alcoa.see id.at.instead,in part because the pngc i remand remained pending,we remanded to bpa to determine whether and how it would seek a refund from alcoa.id.
after pngc ii issued,bpa entered into yet another contract with alcoa,one that we upheld.see alcoa,at.although not directly implicated in this appeal,this final alcoa bpa contract merits some brief discussion,to complete the story of bpa efforts to assist the aluminum dsis.
under this latest contract,bpa agreed to sell physical power to alcoa at the ip rate for a modest profit projected at for the contract initial,roughly month period.id.at.bpa preference customers again mounted a challenge,arguing that instead of selling to alcoa at the ip rate,bpa should focus on selling to other customers,whom it can charge higher market rates.id.at.in the preference customers view,bpa failure to maximize its profits demonstrated that it was not acting according to a purpose,but rather was still attempting to subsidiz e alcoa so as to preserve jobs at its smelting plant and the surrounding community.id.at.
in alcoa,we rejected these challenges,explaining that the sound business principles mandate does not mean that bpa is required to maximize its profits.alcoa,at.to the contrary,bpa has wide discretion as to how best to pursue its businesslike role while also complying with other statutory mandates,such as environmental protection.id.applying the high level of deference owed to bpa business decisions,we allowed the most recent alcoa bpa contract to stand,noting that unlike the monetized energy contracts at issue in pngc i and pngc ii,it provided only for physical power sales it was expected to yield some profit to bpa,albeit modest and there was no record evidence to support the preference customers speculation that bpa decision was motivated by concerns about job losses.id.therefore,we concluded,we had to defer to bpa determination that its power sale to alcoa comported with sound business principles.id.
c.the port townsend contracts pngc i 
aside from the block contracts with the aluminum dsis,also at issue in pngc i was an arrangement between bpa and its sole remaining dsi,the port townsend paper company port townsend.under this arrangement,bpa agreed to provide port townsend with its full requirements for power to be supplied through the clallam county public utility clallam.pngc i,at.bpa would sell clallam the power at the pf rate plus the margin typically charged by public utilities to their industrial customers,and clallam would then sell the power to port townsend.id.in effect,therefore,bpa would be selling power to port townsend,via clallam,at a rate below both the market rate and the ip rate,id.at,but not as low as the pf rate.
we invalidated the port townsend arrangement as inconsistent with bpa statutory obligations.id.at.bpa,we explained,is not obligated to sell port townsend power at all,much less at a subsidized rate,and had provided no convincing explanation as to why doing so comported with sound business principles.id.quoting.
bpa decision on remand from pngc i and pngc ii 
the present litigation arises from bpa process on remand from our decisions in pngc i and pngc ii.this process became known within the northwest power community as the lookback.
lookback proceedings 
in june,bpa issued a letter indicating that it would begin addressing the issues remanded to it by pngc 
the lookback was structured as a process first,bpa would answer the contractual questions identified in pngc i the applicability and construction of the severability clause,the damage waiver,and the physical power sale option in light of our holdings in pngc i.at.if it was determined that the contracts barred refunds,then the proceedings would end there.if bpa determined instead that it could seek recovery notwithstanding the damages waiver,it would move on to the second step determining how much money was owed.bpa also considered in the lookback whether it was permitted to seek additional payments directly from port townsend power company or indirectly through the public utility district of clallam county for any undercharges for power delivered to clallam by bpa for the benefit of port townsend,both during the lookback period and subsequently.once pngc ii was decided,bpa expanded the scope of the lookback to include any refunds that might be owed for payments made to alcoa during the period before payments were ceased in compliance with pngc ii.
bpa issued a draft record of decision draft rod in june and invited public comment.the draft rod proposed three sets of conclusions first,as to the block contracts,the draft rod proposed that the invalid rate provisions were severable from the remainder of the contracts that the damages waiver was therefore enforceable and that,as a result,bpa was contractually barred from seeking recovery.bpa also proposed that this conclusion was not inconsistent with its earlier decision to seek repayment under a series of settlement agreements invalidated in pge.
second,as to the alcoa amendment,the draft rod proposed that bpa was not obligated to seek a refund,and that it did not have any contractual basis for doing so.according to the draft rod,alcoa did not breach any obligation to bpa under the amendment,so it is not clear a legal claim for money,in the form of damages or otherwise,could be pursued by bpa under the contract based solely on pngc ii.the draft rod noted,however,that bpa possibly could pursue an or equitable claim for restitution based on an unjust enrichment theory,and specifically invite d the parties to comment on whether such a claim could or should be pursued against alcoa.the draft rod also floated the possibility that bpa could seek to administratively recover payments made to alcoa under the amendment by adding a surcharge to future power sales to alcoa.the draft rod noted,however,that such a surcharge might run into its own legal problems,as bpa is required to set rates pursuant to the strictures of the northwest power act,and bpa may have already recouped some or all of any illegal overpayments under the amendment by withholding payments to alcoa for the final two months of the term of the amendment,after pngc ii was handed down.
finally,as to the port townsend transaction,the draft rod proposed that bpa had no legal or equitable basis for recovering from port townsend directly.while it appears bpa could assert an equitable claim for restitution against port townsend,it is not clear that port townsend was unjustly enriched.moreover,port townsend might have an equitable estoppel defense,although bpa concluded that it lacked sufficient information to evaluate this question.
not surprisingly,alcoa,port townsend,and clallam all agreed with the draft rod proposed findings.alcoa,moreover,threatened that,if bpa were to change its position and conclude that the damages waiver is not enforceable,then alcoa could bring claims of its own against bpa greatly exceeding any amount that bpa could recover from alcoa.specifically,alcoa estimated that it had a potential damages claim against bpa totaling million,based on the difference between alcoa power costs during the time period covered by the monetized contracts and what its power costs would have been had bpa sold it power directly at the ip rate during that time.
the preference customers viewed the draft rod very differently as yet another instance of bpa capitulating to the dsis.both ppc and pngc argued that bpa had not just the legal authority but also the duty to seek repayment of the unlawful subsidies.icnu submitted similar comments.
none of bpa major conclusions changed in its final record of decision the rod,issued february.in the rod,bpa decided not to pursue refunds of any of the subsidies invalidated in pngc i and pngc ii,explaining its reasoning as follows 
as to the block contracts,bpa is contractually prohibited from seeking repayment because the damages waiver in those contracts is applicable and enforceable.
as to the alcoa amendment,which does not contain a damages waiver,while bpa is not contractually prohibited from seeking repayment,it has no reasonable legal or equitable basis for doing so.alcoa fully performed its contractual obligations,leaving bpa without any basis for a contract action,and bpa would be unlikely to prevail in any action.moreover,if bpa sues alcoa,alcoa has indicated that it will bring its own action against bpa,and the low likelihood of success of any bpa suit is not worth the risk even if small of owing a judgment to alcoa.
as to the port townsend contract,bpa has no legal or equitable basis for seeking repayment.because the port townsend contract formally consisted of two separate bilateral contracts bpa clallam and clallam port townsend,bpa had no direct contractual relationship with port townsend,and has no equitable or basis for suing port townsend.while bpa did have a direct contract with clallam,clallam was no more than an intermediary between bpa and port townsend,and therefore was not enriched,unjustly or otherwise,by the contract.even if bpa could recover from clallam,doing so would not be fair or just because it would be nearly impossible for clallam to recover in turn from port townsend.
icnu,ppc,pngc and its members,and the canby utility board filed petitions in this court for review of the rod.port townsend,alcoa,and several utility companies ious intervened to defend the rod.
standard of review 
as petitions for review of bpa decisions are governed by the administrative procedure act,a,w e affirm bpa actions unless they are arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or in excess of statutory authority.pgnc ii,at internal quotation marks omitted.when,as here,we are measuring bpa actions against the sound business principles standard embodied in bpa governing statutes,we are particularly deferential to the agency assessment of whether its actions further bpa business interests consistent with its public mission.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.this deferential standard of review is not,however,toothless.while we do not bpa policy judgments,we do ask whether the agency considered the relevant factors and articulated a rational connection between the facts found and the choices made.alcoa,at internal quotation marks omitted see lands council mcnair,cir en banc 
discussion 
constitutional and statutory arguments 
petitioners argue,first,that bpa has a duty,under either the constitution appropriations clause or bpa governing statutes,to seek all refunds to which it may be entitled.we disagree.bpa decisions not to seek refunds must be evaluated,like all other bpa decisions,applying bpa governing statutes,the apa,and general principles of administrative law.
appropriations clause 
the crux of petitioners appropriations clause argument is that,h aving disbursed funds to the dsis from the treasury without lawful authority,bpa acted in direct violation of the constitution.therefore,it now has a duty to seek recovery of these funds.citations omitted.
viewed as a general challenge to bpa contractual damages waiver provisions,this argument is foreclosed by alcoa,at.alcoa rejected the argument that bpa is constitutionally obligated to sue for any damages to which it is entitled.id.at.in so ruling,alcoa noted that the bpa administrators have statutory authority to compromise or settle claims,and held that a bilateral waiver provision is consistent with that authority,as it balances in advance the risk of being sued for damages against the opportunity to obtain damages from the contracting party.id.at.
viewed as a narrow,challenge,the appropriations clause argument fares no better.any disbursements bpa made under the invalidated monetary benefits provisions likely did not violate the appropriations clause.bpa is funded by a permanent appropriation,or revolving fund,which the bpa administrator has wide latitude in spending.see establishing revolving fund within the treasury for bpa see also general accounting office,principles of federal appropriations law discussing bpa revolving fund and defining revolving funds as permanent appropriations.so there may well have been an adequate appropriation for the subsidies,even though they were later held invalid.
we need not wade further into the largely uncharted area of appropriations clause law,however.dep t of human res.dep t of,cir hall,j,concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.even if the subsidy payments did rise to an appropriations clause violation,petitioners have pointed to no convincing authority establishing that bpa would therefore have a constitutional duty to recover the subsidies.
certainly,the text of the appropriations clause provides no basis for inferring such a duty,nor do the cases relied upon by petitioners.office of personal management richmond,held only that a court can not order an agency to expend funds contrary to statute not that,if an agency has already done so,the appropriations clause requires the agency to get the funds back.certainly agencies are generally permitted to seek recovery of erroneously or illegally disbursed funds.even in the absence of a specific statutory cause of action,t he government by appropriate action can recover funds which its agents have wrongfully,erroneously,or illegally paid,so long as there is no clear statutory barrier to doing so.united states wurts,
but that recovery authority does not suggest that the government has a constitutional duty to seek a refund every time an erroneous or illegal payment has been made.to the contrary,wurts suggested that congress may statutorily preclude agencies from recovering erroneously paid funds so long as it clearly manifest s its intention to do so.at internal quotation marks omitted.if the appropriations clause imposed an affirmative constitutional duty upon agencies to recover erroneously paid funds,congress could not eliminate the duty by statute 
bpa governing statutes 
petitioners next argue,more modestly,that bpa has a statutory duty to seek recovery of unlawfully disbursed funds,relying on the requirement in that bpa provide the lowest possible rates to consumers consistent with sound business principles.we reject the suggestion that bpa has a statutory duty to pursue any potentially available source of income so as to lower its rates.
as this court recently clarified,the sound business principles mandate does not require bpa to maximize its profits or to always charge the lowest possible rates regardless of any other considerations.alcoa,at.rather,congress has given bpa wide latitude to decide how best to further bpa business interests consistent with its public mission.id.internal quotation marks omitted.along these lines,congress has delegated to the bpa administrator broad authority to compromise or settle claims.see f.thus,congress contemplated that bpa may sometimes make a business decision that it is not worth pursuing a particular potential source of income.petitioners argument to the contrary fails.
bpa decision 
although bpa has no general constitutional or statutory duty to seek a refund any time it makes an unlawful payment,an individual decision not to pursue such a refund could be arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.
the aluminum dsi contracts 
with respect to the aluminum dsi contracts,petitioners maintain that bpa rod had several of these faults,because the damages waiver is not enforceable bpa does have available or common law avenues of recovery against the aluminum dsis,such as an unjust enrichment suit and it is not a sound business decision to forgo those avenues entirely because of speculation that its might assert defenses.
after reviewing these challenges,we conclude that we must defer to bpa reasonable interpretation of the block contracts as including a severable,enforceable damages waiver,and so do not disturb bpa decision as to refunds of the block contracts subsidy payments.we grant the petition for review,however,as to the alcoa amendment,as we conclude that the rod reasons for not pursuing refunds for the subsidies proved by that amendment are,as they stand,so insufficiently grounded in the record as to be arbitrary,capricious,or an abuse of discretion.
block contracts 
each of the block contracts included a damages waiver providing that,i n the event the ninth circuit court of appeals issues a final order that declares or renders this agreement void or otherwise unenforceable,no party shall be entitled to any damages or restitution of any nature,in law or equity,from any other party,and each party hereby waives any right to seek such damages.each contract also included a severability clause providing that i f any term of this agreement is found to be invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction,a ll other terms shall remain in force unless that term is determined not to be severable from all other provisions of this agreement by such court.
bpa conclusion that the damages waivers are enforceable was consistent with the statute and otherwise within bpa authority.to begin,the alcoa court enforced a very similar mutual damage waiver in another alcoa bpa contract.its reasons for doing so apply equally here.
contrary to petitioners contention that no entity operating according to sound business principles would agree to a sweeping waiver,alcoa interpreted such a mutual waiver as a valid exercise of bpa general authority.at.noting that such a waiver equally protects bpa against claims brought by the customer,alcoa concluded that i t is not our place to the agency considered judgment regarding the balance of risks embodied in a damage waiver or similar release or settlement provision.id.moreover,the waiver provision is severable from the contracts void subsidy provisions.bpa received consideration in exchange for waiving its rights to seek damages from the aluminum dsis namely,a corresponding waiver providing that the contracting parties could not recover damages from bpa.legal portions of contracts are severable from illegal portions where there is separate legal consideration attributable to the severed portion of the agreement.consul solide,cir.finally,as such a waiver is a valid exercise of bpa power to compromise or settle claims and could likewise protect bpa interests,it can not be contrary to public policy as allowing an unlawful subsidy.
the dissent assertion that this determination is controlled by pge,and not alcoa,is incorrect.pge did not concern provisions in bpa power purchase contracts mutually waiving damages in the event the agreement is invalidated.alcoa did.
pge invalidated a series of settlement agreements bpa had entered into with ious that participated in its residential exchange program rep or exchange program.see pge,at golden nw.aluminum,bonneville power,cir.the exchange program essentially acts as a cash rebate to the ious where the ious power costs exceed those of bpa,but requires that the exchange program costs be covered only by supplemental rate charges assessed on customers,not by passing costs on to preference customers.see pge,at.bpa and certain ious entered into settlement agreements inconsistent with this limitation,maintaining that the limitation did not apply because the costs were settlement costs,pursuant to bpa general authority to make and settle contracts,rather than exchange program costs.we disapproved this approach,holding that bpa could not circumvent the statutory restrictions on power exchanges by calling its actions a settlement when those actions were inextricably intertwined with bpa exchange program authority.id.at.
in short,the exercise of settlement authority at issue in pge concerned the whole of a comprehensive agreement,in which bpa sought directly to avoid the statutory restrictions placed on it.pge did not concern a severable agreement provision allocating among the contracting parties the purely retroactive liability risks that could arise in the event the agreement is otherwise declared invalid a pact,so to speak,covering the past,not the future,and governing relief in the event the agreement is invalidated,rather than the agreement itself.
in contrast,alcoa considered precisely that sort of purely retroactive,partial,and mutual waiver as here,the waiver at issue in alcoa was a bilateral waiver of retroactive damages it gave up both parties rights to seek compensation in the event that a portion of the contract in which it was contained was invalidated in the future.at.in both alcoa and here,the larger agreement of which the waiver was a part was risky for both parties that agreed to the provision,not just for bpa.here,for example,the aluminum dsis gave up their ability to sue bpa to recover any costs associated with purchasing power through other means if the contracts were invalidated,costs that could have been,and that the dsis contend were,extensive.
the fact that the damages waivers significantly benefitted bpa is important.upholding the validity of the waivers here does not preclude a finding in a future case that a damages waiver is invalid,if the waiver at issue in that case does not benefit the agency and is instead designed principally to prevent an unlawful subsidy from being recouped.
despite the large differences between the waiver issue here and the settlement authority question in pge,and despite the close similarity between the waiver approved in alcoa and the one at issue here,the dissent dismisses alcoa as the controlling precedent and relies on pge instead.principally,the dissent relies for this odd choice on the understanding that alcoa upheld the other portions of the agreement in which the waiver appeared,and so was not approving a damages waiver linked to statutorily unlawful contract provisions.
the dissent account mischaracterizes alcoa.as one would expect,the damages waiver in alcoa applied not to valid contractual provisions,but only when a court renders any part of the agreement void or unenforceable in other words,unlawful.at.and,after holding the damages waiver lawful,alcoa went on to decline to decide whether the second period portion of the alcoa contract there at issue was valid,as the question was not yet ripe.id.at.this sequence necessarily left open the possibility that the second period agreement would later be voided and yet,the damages waiver provision that would be contained in that agreement had already been declared valid.
the panel deciding alcoa was entirely cognizant of this possibility.had the second period agreement been similar to,and valid for the same reason as,the agreement covering the initial period,there would be no reason to put off deciding the legality of the second period agreement.and the dissenting opinion in alcoa specifically recognized that the waiver provision was valid and would apply if and when the second period agreement is challenged.alcoa,at,bea,dissenting.the dissent concern was with the majority decision to forego addressing the second period dispute before bpa suffered a monetary loss was that,because of the damages waiver,those losses could not be recovered.id.
alcoa therefore decided essentially the same issue that arises here regarding the enforceability of a bilateral damages waiver in a bpa power agreement.pge covers the predecessor issue was the power agreement there in fact void under such circumstances,we must follow alcoa and uphold the damages waiver.
as bpa properly determined the block contracts waiver provisions were enforceable,its decision not to pursue refunds under those contracts was likewise proper.
alcoa amendment 
as the alcoa amendment does not contain a damage waiver,bpa is not contractually barred from seeking recovery of the subsidies invalidated in pngc ii.bpa nonetheless declined to seek recoupment of subsidies it provided pursuant to the amendment,viewing the chances of succeeding in doing so as slight,and outweighed by the potential recovery costs.
bpa rationales for this conclusion boiled down to two alcoa may have defenses to any equitable or claim,including perhaps an estoppel defense and alcoa may be able to defeat a claim for unjust enrichment,and succeed on a counterclaim against bpa,by showing that,far from being enriched,it obtained less in monetary value than it was entitled to under the governing statutes.we hold both rationales so implausible that they could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.lands council,at.as a result,we can not approve the current rod conclusion as to recovery of the alcoa amendment subsidies.
as to the rod first rationale,the evaluation of the merits of any possible defenses alcoa might assert was far too generous.in particular,bpa prediction that alcoa would have a reasonably good chance of mounting a viable estoppel defense against any claim by bpa,is particularly dubious.
it is unlikely that the dsis could successfully estop the government from recovering a refund if,in fact,a court determined that they had received unlawful overpayments.as richmond emphasized,although the supreme court has never categorically foreclosed estoppel against the government with regard to monetary payments,it has reversed every finding of estoppel that it has reviewed.at.ignoring this history,bpa looked only at this court estoppel cases,concluding the ninth circuit is more receptive to claims of estoppel against the government than some other circuits.whether that vague comparison is correct or not is beside the point.it is of no help in assessing the actual risk of a successful estoppel claim in this case.
what is relevant is our actual standard the party claiming estoppel must show both affirmative misconduct on the part of the government and that the government wrongful act will cause a serious injustice,and the public interest will not suffer undue damage.united states hatcher,cir internal quotation marks omitted.under this standard,we have very occasionally applied estoppel against the government in immigration cases.see,salgado diaz gonzales,cir.but we know of no ninth circuit case estopping the government from recovering an erroneous monetary payment,nor have the parties identified one.heckler cnty.health servs.of crawford.
the rod also reasoned that bpa may not be able successfully to pursue an unjust enrichment claim against alcoa for several reasons.one concern expressed in the rod was that a claim for unjust enrichment can not lie where the relationship between the parties is governed by a valid express contract concerning the particular issue.see sutter home winery,vintage selections,cir.but by the time the rod here challenged issued,this court had already invalidated the relevant portion of the alcoa amendment.see pngc ii,at.that being so,no valid contractual provision stood in the way of an unjust enrichment claim.
the rod second rationale that alcoa may be able to show that it was not enriched,but rather illegally disadvantaged,by the subsidies in the alcoa amendment has more support in the record.the record does establish,at least,that the amount of any damages bpa could actually recover from the aluminum dsis is uncertain and disputed.moreover,if bpa sues,alcoa could well counterclaim,arguing that it actually lost money through the partially invalidated contracts.
had bpa not insisted on a monetized contract,alcoa maintains,bpa could have and,according to bpa,likely would have sold alcoa physical power instead at the ip rate.the rod noted alcoa contention that,as matters turned out,alcoa had to pay a significantly higher rate during the alcoa amendment period than the ip rate because of rising market rates the rod also acknowledged that alcoa had argued previously that it is potentially entitled to recoup those additional payments.alcoa brief to this court elaborates on its overpayment argument,maintaining that,far from receiving overpayments under the block contracts and the alcoa amendment,the company ended up paying million more for power than it would have had bpa sold it power directly,including million during the amendment period.
one major flaw in alcoa argument,and bpa acceptance of it as sufficiently meritorious to constitute a substantial risk in any litigation to recover,is that bpa could under our pngc decisions have refused to sell alcoa power at all,leaving alcoa to buy power at full market rates.but alcoa position is still not entirely implausible.given bpa practices regarding alcoa,it might be hard for bpa to establish as a factual matter that it would have refused to sell alcoa power at the ip rate.and alcoa persistence as to its contention suggests that it would take an equally aggressive litigation position in any collection action bpa might initiate.in that light,as bpa argued,choosing to pursue recovery from alcoa would expose bpa to some risk of a judgment to alcoa under its theory of underpayment.
but the rod did not objectively evaluate the degree of this risk so much as capitulate to alcoa threats.as noted,the above explanation of the possible counterclaim comes largely from alcoa briefs and comments,not the rod.the rod vaguely implies that the costs and risks of litigation would outweigh its possible benefits,citing statutory and regulatory provisions requiring agencies to weigh costs of collection actions against benefits.at the same time,the rod acknowledged,in a conclusory fashion,that alcoa purported claim that it has been underpaid by almost million is dubious,yet nowhere ventured any alternative estimate of a likely litigation outcome,or of the litigation costs likely to be incurred in obtaining that outcome.
in fact,as petitioners point out,bpa never attempted to calculate the actual amounts paid to the aluminum dsis,and so was in no position to determine whether there were or were not net overpayments to alcoa.those gaps are reason enough for skepticism about the rod conclusion that,whatever those amounts are,they are not worth trying to recover.in addition,the final rod evaluated only possible avenues for litigation,not other ways bpa might seek to recover the subsidies,such as offsets from future sales contracts with alcoa.
we may not uphold an agency decision that entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem.lands council,at.bpa assumption that alcoa might succeed in showing that it was not enriched,and could even recover on an affirmative counterclaim,suffers from such a lapse.we therefore remand to bpa to provide a defensible estimate of the amount of the subsidy it provided to alcoa under the alcoa amendment prior to its invalidation to provide some analysis of whether alcoa claim of net underpayment has any fair chance of success to analyze alternative plans for recovery of any overpayment to alcoa and either to adopt one of those plans or to explain why,with respect to each of them,the costs and downside risks justify abandonment of the opportunity to recover any overpayment.
port townsend clallam 
in contrast to its treatment of the alcoa amendment,bpa decision not to seek repayment from port townsend was in no respect unreasonable.whether and how much bpa could recover from port townsend is entirely uncertain,both legally and practically.and,given the small amount of power sold under the port townsend contract,the amount of any recovery would necessarily be quite small,making it unlikely that the costs of litigation would be justified.
first,unlike the aluminum dsi contracts,the port townsend contract involved a sale of power,not a subsidy,though at an unlawfully low rate.so it is unclear exactly what amount,if any,port townsend would owe bpa.perhaps bpa could argue that port townsend owes it the difference between what it paid and what the same amount of power would have cost at the higher ip rate.but port townsend could plausibly counter that,had the rate been higher,it would have purchased less power,or even no power at all,given its struggles to stay open in the face of large financial losses and its reliance on the power prices provided by bpa to do so.
a second,supervening problem with recovering under the port townsend contract,bpa concluded,is that,unlike the aluminum dsi contracts,this arrangement was structured as two separate bilateral contracts one between bpa and clallam,and one between clallam and port townsend.the rod observed that bpa had no direct contract with port townsend,and that,although it could try to clallam,it is far from clear that port townsend would voluntarily remit the amount to clallam in return.
third,the rod noted that port townsend could argue that any claims against it were discharged in port townsend bankruptcy.bpa expressed skepticism about this assessment,noting that port townsend bankruptcy plan was approved in january,while pngc i was not issued until december.thus,bpa could argue that its claims against port townsend were not yet within fair contemplation at the time of the bankruptcy proceedings,and therefore were not discharged.but even if not a legal bar to recovery,port townsend bankruptcy supports the overall reasonableness of bpa decision,as it casts doubt on port townsend practical ability to satisfy any judgment that bpa might secure.
bpa justifications for not pursuing recovery under the port townsend contract are perhaps not as well substantiated as they could be.nevertheless,bpa decision not to pursue recovery from port townsend does have a sufficient reasonable basis,to which this court must defer.see pngc ii,at.
inconsistency with the residential exchange program settlement agreements 
finally,bpa reasonably explained why the refund decisions here challenged were not inconsistent with bpa earlier decision to seek recovery of the different payments that had been declared unlawful by this court in pge.
after we invalidated the settlement agreements in pge,the question then arose whether bpa would seek to recover the improperly payments from the ious.bpa concluded that,after our pge decision,the ious could not legally retain the funds,reasoning that,
because the court held that bpa acted beyond the scope of its statutory authority when it executed the rep settlement agreements and the court did not carve out any exception with respect to the invalidity clause or any other clause,bpa believes the rep settlement agreements are invalid in their entirety.as a result,the invalidity clause is also invalid and can not be used as a shield to prohibit bpa from recovering rep settlement agreement benefits from the ious through the lookback proposal.
supplemental wholesale power rate case final record of decision.
in the rod here challenged,bpa provided two bases for reconciling its decision not to seek repayment in this instance with its contrary decision regarding the exchange program settlement agreement overpayments.first,bpa interpreted pge as a ruling that the rep settlement agreements were void ab initio,whereas pngc i and pngc ii only partially invalidated the contracts at issue.second,bpa characterized the dsi contracts here at issue as exercises of bpa commercial role as a power marketer,and thus distinguishable from the exchange program settlement agreements,which it characterized as exercises of bpa sovereign role as a regulatory administrator of the 
unexplained agency inconsistency is a reason for holding an interpretation to be an arbitrary and capricious change from agency practice under the administrative procedure act.cable telecomms.ass brand x internet,see also a.here,however,bpa has provided a reasoned explanation as to how the two situations vary sufficiently that they may be treated differently.bpa decision not to seek refunds here is therefore not arbitrary or capricious as inconsistent with its contrary conclusion.
conclusion 
we have noted before that bpa governing statutes subject the agency to a variety of potentially conflicting statutory directives.apac,at.bpa peculiarly dual role,as both a federal agency and a power business,can create situations in which it can fulfill neither role very well and so has reasons to test the limits of its statutory authority.pngc ii,at.
in this instance,bpa decisions in most respects sufficiently and reasonably balance its competing obligations to merit our deference,but in one respect,on the current record,do not.we therefore deny the petition for review with regard to the decision not to seek refunds with respect to the block contracts and the port townsend contract.we grant the petition and remand to bpa for further proceedings,consistent with this opinion,with regard to recovery of subsidies paid under the alcoa amendment.
denied in part,and granted and remanded in part.the parties shall bear their own costs on appeal.
i concur in the majority opinion in part,but dissent from section.a which relates to the block contracts.the question in that section is whether bpa may use a contractual damages waiver provision to strip itself of its obligation to seek recovery of to million in funds that it expended not only illegally but contrary to the statutory limits on its authority.the answer to that question is necessarily no.the majority contrary answer allows bpa to violate its statutory limitations at will and to shield itself against taking any measure to remedy its unlawful actions.i would hold that this damages waiver provision,as applied,operates in excess of bpa statutory authority.
in my view,this case is controlled by our holding in portland general electric bonneville power administration pge,cir.in pge,we held that bpa contracting and settlement powers are limited by the constraints of the northwest power act.we explained 
section f grants bpa the power to enter into contracts but it says nothing about the kind of contracts which bpa may sign.we think it obvious,as a matter of general administrative law,that the contracts into which bpa may enter must be grounded in the authority,express or implied,that congress has granted bpa.
id.at.we then went on to list a series of contracts that would clearly lie outside of the authority that congress granted to bpa.for example,we stated that bpa could not enter into a contract to acquire an nba franchise id.so too,as we held in pngc i,it may not enter into a monetization contract that functions as an impermissible subsidy of the aluminum industry.pac.nw.generating coop.dep t of energy pngc i,cir.
admittedly,bpa authority to monetize and thus subsidize its dsi customers presented a closer question in pngc i than the example given in pge in which bpa would acquire the portland trail blazers,and likely rename them the bonneville smelters.nevertheless,in pngc i,we held that bpa monetization of power at subsidized rates was as would be the purchase of the trail blazers inconsistent with bpa authority under the northwest power act.pngc i,at.in other words,bpa decision to giv e a few of its customers million,was so arbitrary and capricious as to violate its statutory obligation.alcoa bonneville power,cir.
bpa argues that it is not permitted to seek recovery of the illegally transferred funds because the contracts contain damages waiver provisions.the majority holds that the contractual waivers are a valid exercise of bpa power to settle claims.op.at.but just as bpa authority to enter into contracts is constrained by its statutory limitations,so too is its authority to settle claims.as we stated in pge,congress could not have made it any clearer that it intended for bpa to exercise its general settlement authority within the confines of the northwest power act.at.that bpa settlement authority is constrained by its statutory limitations in the same manner as is its contracting authority follows necessarily because otherwise bpa could accomplish by settlement precisely what it could not accomplish by contract in the first instance.a settlement provision allowing bpa to retain title to the bonneville smelters and permitting the former owners of the trail blazers to retain the illegally transferred purchase price would,for example,certainly not lie within bpa settlement authority.
here,the majority holding allows bpa to accomplish the very subsidy of the aluminum dsis that we held in pngc i to be unlawful and outside of its statutory authority.because we held in pge that a settlement agreement must not be a means of bypassing congressionally mandated requirements,a damages waiver provision must be interpreted in a manner that forbids such circumvention of the limitations on bpa statutory powers.see at.construing the provision consistently with bpa statutory mandate requires that we hold that the damages waiver provision may not be applied here so as to shield the illegal subsidy and allow the aluminum industry to retain the unlawful payments provided for in the block contracts.unfortunately,the majority fails to acknowledge that pge is the controlling case.
in upholding bpa decision not to seek the return of the illegally transferred funds,the majority relies primarily on our holding in alcoa bonneville power administration that a damages waiver provision similar to the ones at issue here falls within bpa authority.op.at.alcoa does not control this case.alcoa upheld bpa sale of power to a dsi at a rate,concluding that the terms of sale specified in the agreement unlike the unlawful subsidies that are the subject of this case were lawful and valid.at.finding no violation of the agency statutory mandate,we then turned to the petitioners challenge to the agreement damages waiver provision and upheld its inclusion in the contract.id.at in short,the damages waiver provision we upheld in general was included in a contract that did not itself provide for illegal subsidies or otherwise for violations of bpa governing statutes.because we held that the transaction at issue in alcoa was consistent with the statutory limits on bpa authority,we had no occasion to consider whether a damages waiver provision that would allow bpa customers to retain unlawful benefits afforded them contrary to bpa statutory limits lies within bpa settlement authority.the answer appears otherwise.
that alcoa did not address the issue we encounter in this case is evident from bpa brief in alcoa.there,bpa argued that any holding recognizing bpa general authority to waive damages in a contract would have no bearing on a situation like the one we are now presented with,in which the underlying transaction lies beyond bpa statutory authority.bpa explicitly distinguished the case before it from the application of a damages waiver provision under the circumstances present here.its brief told us the alcoa contract involves a sale of power,not a monetized transaction such as those under review in pngc i and ii.therefore,this case does not involve any issue of bpa recouping illegal payments because no such payments will be made.answering br.of resp t bonneville power admin.at,alcoa.this statement makes clear that bpa expressly disclaimed the authority to apply a damages waiver provision to prevent the agency from recouping funds transferred without statutory authority.the fact that the majority has now,on the basis of alcoa,granted bpa the authority it expressly disclaimed is striking but even setting that concern aside,bpa brief to the alcoa court proves that alcoa could not have possibly decided the issue present in this case whether a damages waiver provision which does prevent bpa from recouping funds transferred without statutory authorization is permissible because bpa explicitly distinguished that issue from the one presented in alcoa.
that we did not intend alcoa to authorize the settlements at issue here is further evident from the alcoa court failure to discuss or even mention pge.pge clearly requires bpa to exercise both its contracting and its settlement authority in a manner consistent with its statutory obligations.see at.thus,alcoa did not and could not have authorized bpa,by means of its settlement authority,to surrender its right to seek restitution from the beneficiary of funds transferred to them in excess of bpa statutory authority without creating a direct conflict with the principles that we established in pge.the only reading of alcoa that is consistent with pge is that alcoa approved the general authority of bpa to include damages waiver provisions in its agreements,a conclusion with which i firmly agree.viewed in this light,it is obvious why the alcoa court did not discuss pge we were simply not presented with the unlawful application of a damages waiver provision because we did not rule any part of the agreement at issue invalid.had we done so,and had the damages waiver provision applied,we certainly could not have escaped the requirement expressed in pge that bpa must exercise its contracting and settlement authority within the confines of its governing statutes.
the majority disagrees,reasoning that the damages waiver provisions at issue here and in alcoa look alike,and that alcoa therefore controls.that alcoa did not consider the application of a damages waiver provision to a disbursement of funds in contravention of bpa statutory authority is of no consequence to the majority.to my colleagues,the fact that the provisions are similar ends the inquiry.thus,the necessary consequence of the majority opinion is that alcoa without mentioning pge has blessed not only bpa general authority to include a damages waiver provision in its agreements,but also every application of such a provision 
recognizing that this position is unsustainable,the majority attempts to disclaim such a holding by noting that if a damages waiver does not benefit the agency and is instead designed principally to prevent an unlawful subsidy from being recouped,then such a waiver would be invalid.op.at.however,this case demonstrates why the majority ostensible limit on its decision will have no practical effect.before our court,icnu made the precise argument that the majority claims would be sufficient to invalidate a damages waiver it argued that the waiver was designed to ensure that bpa could circumvent congress goal of prohibiting sales to the dsis at rates lower than the market or legal rate emphasis added.bpa countered that the damages waiver is intended to broadly protect both bpa and alcoa from damages claims that either party could bring against the other.in fact,an agency motive in agreeing to a waiver of damages may well be mixed.there will ordinarily be some potential benefit to it if it is protected against damages.in short,it may very well be true that the damages waiver provisions both protect bpa from potential liability and were designed p
