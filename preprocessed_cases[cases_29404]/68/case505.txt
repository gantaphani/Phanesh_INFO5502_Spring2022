the,the city of burbank,california burbank,seeks review of the final decision by the court of federal claims court of federal claims or trial court dismissing burbank complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.burbank filed suit against the united states,acting by and through the bonneville power administration bpa or bonneville,in the court of federal claims under the tucker act,a,alleging two counts of breach of contract.the trial court dismissed both counts,holding that they fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the court of appeals for the ninth circuit ninth circuit,pursuant to e.city of burbank united states.in the alternative,the trial court held that if it did have jurisdiction,it dismissed burbank claims without prejudice for failing to satisfy the procedural requirements of the contract disputes act of,et.cda.
burbank appeals only that portion of the trial court decision dismissing both counts for lack of jurisdiction.it does not appeal the alternative holding dismissing its claims without prejudice for failure to comply with the cda.we hold that both counts relate to alleged breaches of contract based on facts outside of an administrative record and therefore fall within the court of federal claims tucker act jurisdiction,a,rather than within the exclusive jurisdiction of the ninth circuit under e.accordingly,we reverse the trial court dismissal and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
a.the parties 
the city of burbank is a municipal corporation organized and existing under the constitution and laws of california.it operates a municipal electric system,which involves generating,transmitting,and distributing electric energy within its jurisdiction in california.
the bpa is a,federal administration organized and existing under the bonneville project act,and sections a d and a of the department of energy organization act,a d.the bpa markets,transmits,purchases,exchanges,and sells electric energy in the wholesale market.federal dams in the pacific northwest generate the hydroelectric energy the bpa sells in this market.four statutes primarily govern the bpa at issue in this case is the scope of the jurisdictional grant contained in the pacific northwest electric power planning and conservation act of,u,which is commonly called the northwest power act or the regional act.
congress created the bpa primarily to serve the pacific northwest.see.whenever the bpa generates sufficient electric energy to satisfy the demand of its primary service area,any electric energy above this amount is defined as surplus.c defining surplus energy as electric energy that would otherwise be wasted due to lack of a market in the pacific northwest.the bpa may sell such surplus electric energy outside of the pacific northwest.it must do so,however,pursuant to the authorization and restrictions codified at,and f.thus,when the bpa agrees to sell electric energy to an entity outside the pacific northwest,such as burbank,some of the contractual provisions are mandated by statute.the bpa freely negotiates other provisions,which are not mandated by statute.
b.the contract at issue 
burbank and the bpa executed the contract at issue on january,the contract it has a term of twenty years.the contract initially provided for the sale and exchange of megawatts of electric energy per contract year by the bpa to burbank.on july,the parties executed an amendatory agreement that increased the amount of electric energy to be sold or exchanged to megawatts.
at any given time the contract operates in one of two different,and distinct,modes the power sale mode or the exchange mode.the contract initially operated in power sale mode.
power sale mode versus exchange mode 
the contract operates in the power sale mode when the bpa determines that it is capable of producing surplus electric energy.in the power sale mode,the bpa sells firm amounts of electric energy,which burbank must purchase at rates governed by section a of the contract.sections a and a specify the rates payable in and,respectively.section a of the contract determines the rates payable by burbank beginning on january.these contract rates are determined by applying the adjustment ratio provided in section a to the previously applicable contract rate on the effective date of any firm power rate adjustment by the bpa.the adjustment ratio is calculated with respect to the rates the bpa charges in the pacific northwest,which are established by an administrative proceeding pursuant to i.
if the bpa lacks surplus electric energy,the contract converts to the exchange mode.the terms and conditions of this conversion are mandated by statute.see a any contract for the sale of electric energy outside the pacific northwest will provide that,after notice,the secretary will not deliver electric energy under such contract whenever it can reasonably be foreseen that such delivery would impair his ability to meet the energy requirements of any pacific northwest customer.
upon conversion to exchange mode,the bpa provides burbank with the capacity to generate electric energy at some times.in exchange,burbank must deliver electric energy to the bpa at other times.
the allegedly breached contract provisions 
section c of the contract becomes applicable when the bpa has converted the contract into the exchange mode.section c authorizes the bpa to cause reversion from the exchange mode back to the power sale mode if the bpa determines that it has sufficient surplus electric energy for the ensuing contract year.this reversion back provision is not statutorily mandated.it reads 
after conversion to the exchange,whenever bonneville determines that it has sufficient surplus firm energy to deliver the amounts of surplus firm power specified in subsections a and b for the ensuing contract year,deliveries under this agreement shall revert to the surplus firm power sale pursuant to section,unless burbank has provided written notice to bonneville which describes a contract offer to acquire a resource to replace the energy no longer available from bonneville due to the conversion to the exchange.such notice shall include the amount of energy to be acquired and the term of the proposed acquisition.bonneville shall respond as follows 
bonneville shall,within days of receipt of such notice,notify burbank whether this transaction shall revert to the power sale for the duration of burbank proposed energy acquisition if bonneville elects not to have the transaction revert to the power sale,then bonneville shall waive its right to revert to the power sale for the duration of burbank contractual commitment for the proposed energy acquisition.

the complaint in the court of federal claims 
burbank initiated this action in the court of federal claims,alleging two counts of breach of the contract.count one of the complaint alleges that the bpa breached its implied duty of good faith and fair dealing under the contract by failing to comply with the notice requirements of section c.specifically,burbank alleges that in april,the contract was operating in exchange mode.burbank notified the bpa,via letter dated april,that it had obtained an agreement with the montana power company to replace the energy no longer available from the bpa for the period from july,to june.
burbank contends that the bpa response breached section c.rather than notifying burbank of its election to revert to the power sale mode within the day period,burbank alleges,the bpa took days to reply.burbank states that on may,the bpa sent a letter stating that it was providing notice of reversion to the power sale mode under sections d and a of the contract rather than responding in accordance with section c.burbank alleges that in response to the bpa untimely decision to revert to the power sale mode,burbank terminated its contract with the montana power company,and was subsequently damaged when the bpa failed to maintain the transaction in the power sale mode for the term during which burbank contract with the montana power company would have run.thus,burbank concludes,as a result of the bpa breach of section c,burbank incurred higher costs than it would have incurred had it proceeded with its montana power company contract.
count two of burbank complaint alleges that the bpa materially breached section a of the contract.section a supplies the mechanism for determining the rates payable by burbank for energy and generating capacity delivered after.section a provides for the adjustment of burbank rates on the effective date of any bonneville priority firm power pf rate adjustment,as a function of the ratio of pfnew to pfprev.thus,the new rate charged to burbank after any rate adjustment is equal to the previously applicable rate multiplied by the ratio pfnew over pfprev.
the alleged breach of section a is predicated on a dispute over how the terms pfnew and pfprev are defined.section a provides that if there is more than one applicable new or previous pf rate,the average shall be determined by a weighting based on forecasted sales under such pf rates.on october,the bpa adjusted the pf rates in general,and changed the rate structure such that charges that were formerly bundled into the same rate were calculated pursuant to different rate schedules.this general rate adjustment triggered an adjustment in the rates burbank was obligated to pay under the contract.burbank contends that the bpa improperly adjusted burbank rates because it calculated the average pfnew rate for the adjustment of burbank rates by treating the pf rates as if they were bundled,meaning that the bpa averaged all of the unbundled rates,rather than determining which of the pf rates are of the same class,quality,and type as the type provided in the bpa contract with burbank and including only those rates in the calculation.
c.the court of federal claims determination 
in response to burbank complaint,the bpa moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction on the grounds that burbank claim was subject to the contract disputes act cda and that burbank failed to meet the cda jurisdictional prerequisites.in the alternative,the bpa argued,burbank failed to bring its claim within the otherwise applicable statute of limitations.the trial court,sua sponte,raised the jurisdictional issue now before this court on appeal whether the statutory grant of exclusive jurisdiction to the ninth circuit in e precluded the exercise of tucker act jurisdiction by the court of federal claims.see e.
after considering supplemental briefs in which the parties argued that both counts properly were brought before the court of federal claims,the trial court dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.it held that both counts fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the ninth circuit to review final agency decisions made by the bpa l ooking to the substance of plaintiff claims,both involve defendant administrative decisions made in the execution of a bpa final action,namely the sale of electric power outside the pacific northwest.city of burbank united states.
the trial court reasoned that e carves out an exception to jurisdiction it would otherwise possess under the tucker act.pursuant to e,the ninth circuit has exclusive jurisdiction to review final agency actions taken by the bpa.city of burbank.at citing pac.power light bonneville power,cir.the trial court noted that extraregional sales constitute final actions under e,but did not hold that e vested the ninth circuit with exclusive jurisdiction over burbank claims.id.citing puget sound power light united states,appeal dismissed without.
rather than premising its holding on e,the trial court concluded that the appropriate jurisdictional test is as follows 
the appropriate test is therefore to determine whether a claim is challenging either bpa action taken pursuant to statutory authority,or action that constitutes contractual commitments made outside the statutory requirements of the regional act only when claims are found to be based on actions wholly outside the statutory authority of the regional act will the ninth circuit exclusive jurisdiction fail to encompass such claims.
id.at citing public util.dist.of clark county johnson,cir emphasis added.thus,the trial court explained,a party characterization of its claim as contractual is insufficient.rather,the court must determine whether the contractual provisions themselves were included pursuant to statutory authority and mandate.id.at emphasis added.
under this test,the court of federal claims concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over both counts.it characterized count one,the alleged breach of section c of the contract,as a challenge to the bpa decision to the contract to exchange mode after burbank had cancelled its contract with the montana power company.in the trial court determination,burbank complaint had little to do with breach of contract by deficient notice.although burbank styled count one as an alleged breach due to deficient notice,the trial court reasoned that the crux of burbank complaint was that the bpa the contract to exchange mode,and that this conversion occurred pursuant to statutory mandate,and after the allegedly deficient notice.id.at plaintiff bases its breach of contract claim on this untimely reply,but its challenge does not rest with the late response to its proposed acquisition.instead,plaintiff opposes defendant decision to revert the contract to the power sale mode on may,followed by defendant need to convert the contract to the exchange mode again.thus,the trial court concluded that count one challenges agency action taken pursuant to statutory authority,and therefore that it lies within the ninth circuit exclusive jurisdiction.id.
the court of federal claims also concluded that the ninth circuit had exclusive jurisdiction over the breach of section a alleged in count two.it characterized count two as a challenge solely to the misapplication of rates,and noted that challenges to the rates the bpa charges for electric energy have uniformly been held to fall under the ninth circuit jurisdiction.id.at.it reasoned that burbank contention that the bpa misapplied rates concerns an action that is illustrated in and mandated by the regional act.id.at.the trial court concluded that the contractual provisions concerning the application of rates are based directly on statutory requirements,and that therefore the alleged misapplication constituted a final action subject to the ninth circuit exclusive jurisdiction.id.
the court of federal claims also held that,in the alternative,if it did possess jurisdiction over burbank claims,burbank nevertheless had failed to comply with the requirements of the contract disputes act.id.at.accordingly,the trial court issued an alternative holding dismissing burbank claims without prejudice,allowing burbank to bring them in accordance with the requirements of the contract disputes act.id.at.
on appeal,burbank argues that both counts properly fall within the court of federal claims tucker act jurisdiction because they allege breaches of contractual commitments into which the bpa entered independently of final agency action taken pursuant to statutory mandate or the initiation of administrative proceedings.initially,the bpa agreed with burbank that the court of federal claims possesses jurisdiction over both counts.on appeal,however,the bpa has reversed its position on count two.although it continues to agree with burbank that the trial court erred in its characterization and consequent disposition of count one,the bpa now argues that count two falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the ninth circuit.it reasons that count two challenges a final action or the implementation thereof,and thus falls squarely within the jurisdictional grant of e.the bpa argues that count two challenges a final action because the price burbank pays is a rate,and thus,by making the disputed adjustment,the bpa engaged in a final action albeit one not specifically enumerated in e.in the alternative,the bpa argues that count two challenges the implementation of a final action the bpa determination of the pf rates,which serve as the basis for the contractual adjustment.burbank appealed the trial court judgment to this court.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
