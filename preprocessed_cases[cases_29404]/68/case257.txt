in this appeal,which marks the second time the parties have been before us,we again assess the scope of state action immunity from liability under federal antitrust law.the idaho legislature responded to our prior opinion on state action immunity with legislation.we now assess whether,in light of these statutory changes,the responsibilities of the idaho public utility commission to review and approve certain conduct of pacificorp challenged in this case by the snake river valley electric association snake river or srvea are sufficient to confer state action immunity.
this case regards srvea suit against pacificorp,which alleged antitrust violations due to pacificorp refusal to sell to srvea its electrical system in southeastern idaho to sell wholesale electrical power to srvea and to wheel wholesale electrical power obtained from another wholesale power generator to srvea via pacificorp transmission lines 
snake river is an idaho corporation,organized to deliver retail electricity to its members mostly irrigation farmers at lower rates than pacificorp charged.pacificorp is an electric power company that provides retail electricity to,inter alia,snake river potential customers.pacificorp also sells wholesale electricity nationwide through the wholesale power supply market.
in december,snake river by letter requested wheeling of wholesale electricity to the members of snake river.pacificorp has claimed that this letter,sent to an officer with no responsibility for wheeling requests,gave insufficient information about snake river for pacificorp to evaluate whether it could provide such wheeling service to snake river.pacificorp responded on january,inviting further discussion with pacificorp senior vice president for transmission services and wholesale sales.
snake river did not then contact the senior vice president,and when pacificorp followed up with a telephone call,srvea declined to clarify its request.in a second letter sent february,pacificorp referred snake river to two tariff schedules filed with the federal energy regulatory commission ferc.sending the tariffs was,according to testimony at trial on this issue,a standard operating practice for pacificorp when it received an application to wheel.snake river never filled out an application,nor did it respond to the february letter.so neither negotiations nor other clarifications of srvea request occurred.
instead,snake river filed suit in july in the united states district court for the district of idaho.snake river alleged violations of the antitrust laws from pacificorp refusing to sell to srvea its electrical system in southeastern idaho to sell wholesale power to srvea and to wheel transfer wholesale power obtained from another generator to srvea via pacificorp transmission lines.
pacificorp moved to dismiss the complaint on grounds of state action immunity.on april,the district court denied the motion.the state of idaho moved to intervene on july,and the district court granted that motion.
on september,snake river moved for a preliminary injunction to require pacificorp to wheel the wholesale power snake river had obtained from a contract with enron.responding to the claim of irreparable injury,pacificorp stipulated that if enron cancelled the contract and if pacificorp was found to have violated antitrust law,then pacificorp would step into enron shoes and provide power according to the terms of the contract.in part because of this stipulation,which countered the assertion of risk of irreparable injury,the district court denied snake river request for a preliminary injunction on december.
in january,idaho moved for partial summary judgment on state action immunity grounds,contending that it actively supervised the policies underlying the idaho electric supplier stabilization act essa.former idaho code et.pacificorp supported this motion.the district court granted summary judgment,holding that pacificorp,even if it acted,had state action immunity from federal antitrust law.
snake river appealed and we reversed.see snake river valley ass pacificorp,cir hereinafter snake river i.we held that,though the essa had clearly articulated a policy restraining competition,the statute did not provide for active state supervision because pacificorp was allowed to act in any manner it chose with respect to wheeling and wholesale power sales.for these reasons,we held that pacificorp did not have state action immunity from srvea antitrust law claims.id.at.we reversed the summary judgment and remanded the case to the district court for trial.
responding to our opinion express invitation that idaho situation could be addressed by legislative action providing for supervision,idaho enacted amendments to the essa to require active supervision by the idaho public utilities commission puc of private decisions affecting competition in idaho regulated market for power.see idaho.laws ch.the amendments took effect december.
upon remand,pacificorp and idaho moved for summary judgment on the grounds that the amended essa gave state action immunity and that pacificorp was immune from december,onward.pacificorp moved for summary judgment on the refusal to wheel claim,arguing that pacificorp did not refuse to deal because snake river never made a request for wheeling,pacificorp also argued that summary judgment was appropriate on the refusal to sell wholesale power claim because pacificorp did not have a monopoly in the wholesale power market.
the district court awarded partial summary judgment to pacificorp.the district court held that,after december,the effective date of the essa amendments,pacificorp enjoyed state action immunity from srvea claims.the district court further granted summary judgment to pacificorp on the claim that it had refused to sell power to srvea.finding disputed issues of material fact on the claim of refusal to wheel before december,the district court set the remaining claim of refusal to wheel for trial.
before trial,the district court addressed evidentiary matters on motions in limine.two evidentiary rulings are now relevant to this appeal.first,pacificorp moved to exclude evidence of its conditional stipulation to step in enron shoes,made at the preliminary injunction hearing,if enron cancelled the contract and if pacificorp was found to have violated the antitrust laws.the district court concluded that this stipulation was evidence of pacificorp refusal to wheel,but relevant only to rebut a defense by pacificorp that as of december it has never refused to wheel.because pacificorp had stated that it would not be raising that defense,the district court excluded the evidence.however,the district court explicitly conditioned that its ruling was without prejudice to srvea right to proffer the evidence during trial if the door is opened.
the trial court second evidentiary ruling relevant on this appeal allowed the admission and discussion of the regulations promulgated by the ferc to regulate applications for wheeling.
after srvea had rested its,pacificorp moved to amend its answer to include a regulatory justification defense.snake river objected based on both the timeliness and legal basis for the defense.the district court overruled the objections to the assertion of the defense.
at the close of the trial on the issue of refusal to wheel before december,which was held between october and october,the district court instructed the jury.challenged on this appeal is instruction number,which stated in part 
to prove its claim,srvea must prove each of the following five elements by a preponderance of the evidence third,that srvea requested and pacificorp denied srvea access to pacificorp power lines pacificorp responds to these claims as follows b with regard to element three,srvea never made a proper application to use pacificorp power lines and filed this lawsuit before pacificorp could evaluate srvea request 
although srvea objected to another portion of this instruction,it never objected,on the record,to the quoted portion of instruction or to instruction as a whole.
the jury returned a special verdict form in which the district court had posed seven questions.the jury was instructed to answer the first four questions sequentially as long as the answer was affirmative,but on these questions,which comprised the elements of the essential facilities claim,to stop and return the form if they answered no on any the jury marked no to the third question which had asked did pacificorp deny a request by srvea that it be provided access to pacificorp power lines because the instructions had told the jury to go no further if it answered no to question three,that resolved the verdict against srvea the jury negative response on the third question in its special verdict defeated srvea refusal to wheel claim.
in light of the jury verdict,the district court entered final judgment in favor of pacificorp on october.srvea timely appealed.we have jurisdiction pursuant to and we affirm.
we first address whether the district court correctly ruled that pacificorp enjoyed state action immunity as of december,under the amended essa.as we explained in snake river i,state action immunity derives from principles of federalism certain actions of the state that restrict competition are immunized from federal antitrust law.the test for state action immunity remains the same as outlined in snake river i that the challenged restraint must reflect a clearly articulated state policy that permits the conduct and that the permitted activities are actively supervised by the state.at citing cal.retail liquor dealers ass midcal aluminum,d.
before analyzing whether the amended essa satisfies this test,we describe idaho current regulatory environment to aid understanding of the legal significance of the challenged activities of pacificorp.because srvea waived the claims of its members who are not customers of pacificorp,snake river i,at,all members of srvea whose claims are relevant to this appeal are currently served by pacificorp.the old essa did not have a prohibition on retail wheeling the only provision at question in snake river i was former idaho code.that provision prohibited an entrant electrical supplier here,srvea from servicing the territory or customer of another supplier here,pacificorp without the written consent of the current supplier.stated another way,srvea could not supply power to pacificorp customers without pacificorp written consent.we recognized this fact in snake river i,noting that srvea not only asks pacificorp to wheel power,but also seeks pacificorp consent to provide power to pacificorp customers.at emphasis in original.with that understanding,we analyzed the portion of srvea request that dealt with pacificorp necessary consent to provide power to pacificorp customers under the midcal test because the withholding of consent was the only action covered by state statute,and thus the only action potentially eligible for state action immunity.we held,in snake river i,that the statute,which provided pacificorp the ability to decide when,if ever,it would consent to allow srvea to service some of its territory or customers and provided no method for state regulation of that decision,did not satisfy the active supervision prong of midcal.
in response to our decision,the idaho legislature amended the essa in two ways that are significant for our analysis of state action immunity.first,the legislature added section,which allows an electrical supplier to refuse to wheel if the requested wheeling results in retail wheeling a sham wholesale transaction.idaho code.if an electrical supplier refuses to wheel,that supplier is obligated to petition the public utilities commission puc for a review of whether that supplier actions are consistent with the essa.id.second,section was amended to prohibit an electrical supplier,such as srvea,from serving consumers or former consumers of another electrical supplier,such as pacificorp.there is an exception to this prohibition if the proposed supplier,such as srvea,petitions the idaho puc and the puc issues an order allowing the service.see idaho code.
under this regulatory scheme,srvea faces two obstacles to providing electrical service to pacificorp customers first,srvea needs wheeling of power by pacificorp to get the power to the service area.second,even if power is wheeled,any srvea pirating,within the meaning of the essa,of those who are now or were pacificorp customers,would be prohibited absent an order from the puc granting an exception to section.with these regulatory provisions in mind,we turn to the analysis required by midcal,and will assess whether there was a clearly articulated state policy and active supervision by the state.
snake river i held that the former version of idaho essa satisfied the clearly articulated state policy prong of midcal.at.given our remand and further proceedings,there has been no change on this score.because the prior version of the essa satisfied this prong,and the state of idaho strengthened its articulation of policy in the amendments to essa,we conclude that a fortiori the amended essa satisfies the clearly articulated state policy prong.the state has made abundantly clear that it is advancing a policy that restricts competition in this regulated area.see,idaho code.by contrast,in the normal unregulated context,our general federal antitrust law policy favors open competition between competitors for consumers.we do not normally view the active efforts of one competitor to gain customers from another as pirating to be discouraged.yet here,casting its legislative eye on the regulated markets for retail power supply,the idaho legislature has set a specific policy aimed at restricting competition for customers,maintaining stability,and protecting existing suppliers.id.the state has clearly articulated its policy to stabilize this regulated market for retail electrical suppliers.
the second prong of the midcal test requires that the state exercise ultimate control over the challenged private anticompetitive conduct.snake river i,at citing ftc ticor title ins,d.to satisfy this prong,the private entity must demonstrate both that the state has the power to exercise control over the private anticompetitive conduct and that the state in fact exercise s its power.nugget hydroelectric,pac.gas,cir.the supreme court has established this test.see ftc ticor title ins,at.the active supervision prong of the midcal test requires that state officials have and exercise power to review particular anticompetitive acts of private parties and disapprove those that fail to accord with state policy.emphases added citing patrick burget,d.
the reasons for requiring such active supervision,and exercise of control,are not difficult to discern.a state may not merely establish a private preserve without competition and then leave the area unregulated in fact.as explained by the supreme court in ticor,a ctual state involvement,not deference to private arrangements under the general auspices of state law,is the precondition for immunity from federal law.immunity is conferred out of respect for ongoing regulation by the state,not out of respect for the economics of price restraint.at.similarly,in snake river i,we explained,t his prong ensures that the doctrine will shelter only the particular anticompetitive acts of private parties that,in the judgment of the state,actually further state regulatory policies.in the absence of such review,there is no realistic assurance that a private party anticompetitive conduct promotes state policy,rather than merely the party individual interests.at citing patrick burget,at.internal citation omitted.we reaffirm this appropriate analysis.applying this analysis to the case before us illustrates that,after the essa amendments,the state of idaho has not left unregulated a private preserve without competition.
this conclusion is supported when we address the state role in reviewing pacificorp refusal to wheel pursuant to idaho code.the literal language of the provision makes clear that the state has the power to control whether a refusal to wheel should be approved or reversed.the remaining issue concerns the exercise of that power.on december,the amended essa gave the puc the authority to reverse refusals to wheel that are outside the policies of the essa.because pacificorp did not file its section petition until april,we can not directly see the state exercise of its statutory power before then.here,the party refusing to wheel has the ability to invoke the exercise of state power.see idaho code stating that the electrical supplier declining to furnish wheeling service shall petition the commission for review of its action.although an unreasonable delay between a refusal to wheel and the exercise of state power might be a reason to reject state action immunity until a state had exercised its power,in this case,given the amendments to the essa,we can not say that the delay between the effective date of the amendments and the filing of the petition by pacificorp constitutes an unreasonable delay that would negate the conclusion that state power is being exercised once the petition was filed,the record shows that the puc exercised control by virtue of its proceedings,in which the parties presented briefing and argument accordingly,we hold that pacificorp refusal to wheel is protected by state action immunity.
there is also an additional ground for our decision on state action immunity.under the prior version of the essa,the state did not have the power to review the decision of a public utility whether to allow another supplier to serve the utility customers.see snake river i,at.however,the amended essa explicitly prohibits a new supplier from pirating the customers of a public utility unless the puc grants an exception,permitting the transfer of present or past customers.see idaho code.under the amended essa,a current electrical supplier has no independent power to permit a new supplier to service its existing or former customers.the power to control the division of consumers between current and potential electrical suppliers is controlled entirely by the puc,a power that has not been invoked by srvea in this case.so far as customer transfer or allocation is concerned,this case did not present a challenge to any private conduct for the state to supervise.pacificorp can not be said to have acted in declining to transfer customers because it does not have the power to make such a transfer under section,pacificorp could not allow srvea to serve pacificorp customers,even if pacificorp wanted to.only the puc can decide when a current utility can or must transfer customers to a new electrical supplier.under this analysis,the second prong of midcal is adequately satisfied in the sense that the state exercises ultimate control over transfer of customers because there is no other actor,including the public utility that is or was servicing the customers,with control over whether a new supplier can gain these customers liquor duffy,d suggesting that a statute that fixed a price margin between wholesale and retail prices may amount to active state supervision without actual state supervision over each decision on prices ticor,at.citing approvingly the duffy language snake river i,at noting that the logic behind such a rule is that some state statutes regulate in such a manner that a private actor has no discretion to deviate from the state statute.
we hold that there is state action immunity for pacificorp on its refusal to wheel.moreover,pacificorp refusal to give some of its current or former customers to srvea was required by statute,also shielding pacificorp action from antitrust liability from the effective date of the amended essa,december,
we next address whether summary judgment was appropriate for pacificorp on srvea claim of antitrust violations predicated on pacificorp decision not to sell wholesale power to srvea.srvea cites otter tail power united states,d,for the proposition that refusal to sell wholesale power can constitute a refusal to deal sufficient for antitrust liability.but,as we see it,the key factual predicate for the finding of antitrust liability in otter tail was that the defendant had exploited its strategic dominance in the transmission of power.otter tail,at.otter tail notes that,although the defendant refused to sell wholesale power,the two relevant municipalities had the ability to obtain such power,but that otter tail,with control over the transmission lines,had refused to wheel that power.id.at.it was the refusal to wheel,not the refusal to sell wholesale power,that was the crux of the antitrust violation,because otter tail had monopoly power in the former,not the latter.
here,while there is evidence that pacificorp has monopoly power over transmission,there is no evidence that pacificorp has a monopoly over wholesale energy transactions,in which the market is now highly competitive.srvea contract with enron illustrates that,as the record reflects,there is a vigorous competitive market for wholesale power.this precludes a claim of monopolization under section of the sherman act.see,pac.express,united airlines,cir noting that possession of monopoly power in the relevant market is a necessary element for an antitrust violation under section of the sherman act.srvea own expert testified that there is vigorous competition in the wholesale power market,competition that did not exist at the time of otter tail we hold that,because pacificorp did not have a dominant position or a monopoly in the wholesale electricity generating market as opposed to the transmission market,it can have no liability for refusal to deal by declining to sell power available from many other sellers.the district court did not err in granting summary judgment on this issue.
we now turn to the jury verdict that found that pacificorp had not refused a request from srvea to wheel.if this verdict is sound,then it renders harmless any asserted error regarding the regulatory justification defense because the jury did not even address that question.see,winery gallo winery,cir janich,am.distilling,cir.srvea raises three claims that,in essence,attack the jury verdict.specifically,srvea contests two evidentiary rulings and one instruction to the jury 
srvea first challenges the district court evidentiary ruling in limine preventing srvea from introducing pacificorp stipulation that,if antitrust liability was proven and if enron terminated the contract,pacificorp would step into the shoes of enron,a stipulation offered by pacificorp to negate the element of irreparable harm on the preliminary injunction motion.the district court noted that the evidence of the stipulation was irrelevant at the time of the motion in limine because pacificorp was not going to contest that,after the complaint had been filed,it had refused to wheel.srvea contends,however,that a t the trial,pacificorp claimed that it never denied a request by snake river for wheeling.but if so,then srvea can not prevail on this argument because it did not proffer the evidence of the stipulation after pacificorp made this purported argument.the district court had explicitly conditioned its in limine ruling,specifying that it was without prejudice to srvea right to proffer the evidence during trial if the door is opened.srvea on appeal claims that the door was opened,but our review of the records leads us to conclude that srvea did not proffer the evidence once the door had assertedly been opened.srvea,by its inaction at trial,has waived this issue in the sense that it can not show harm from the district court in limine ruling.see,whittaker execuair,cir.
srvea next objects to the district court admission of evidence of ferc regulatory requirement for a good faith wheeling request.although srvea argues that it was not subject to the specific ferc requirement,the evidence is relevant to pacificorp asserted routine response to all wheeling requests.in other words,the evidence shows the jury what pacificorp did when it received the incomplete request from srvea.this ground for admission provides ample basis for us to conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion.srvea complaints about this evidence,in our view,go to weight,not to admissibility.moreover,it appears that srvea waived its objection to this evidence in that the regulations were used to question one of srvea experts,and srvea declined to object when pacificorp moved to take judicial not
