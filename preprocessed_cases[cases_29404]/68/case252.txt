the plaintiffs collectively verizon appeal the judgment of the district court in favor of the defendants collectively covad.federal question and diversity jurisdiction exist.the district court granted summary judgment to covad,ruling that verizon state law claims against covad were barred by the filed rate doctrine governing the charges of regulated carriers.the district court further denied verizon motion,filed after the judgment,to amend its complaint to sue on the basis of the filed tariffs.
we agree with the district court that the filed rate doctrine prevents the recovery of any charge not specified in the relevant tariff.we hold,however,that there is no barrier to verizon suing to enforce what it has filed.
covad the district court denials of its motions to strike verizon original and first amended complaints.covad also the dismissal of its with prejudice.we affirm the denials of covad motions to strike verizon complaints but hold that summary judgment against covad counterclaims was improper because covad was not given adequate notice that the sufficiency of its claims would be at issue or an opportunity to respond.
the several telephone companies here denominated verizon are the corporate descendants of bell atlantic,a fusion of two former baby bell telephone companies with another company.as an incumbent local exchange carrier or ilec,verizon is required to lease access to its network,on rates,terms,and conditions that are just,reasonable,and nondiscriminatory,to newer market entrants described as competitive local exchange carriers or clecs.telecommunications act of,pub,c d,stat,codified at c d.covad is such a competitor.as required by the telecommunications act,verizon has entered into interconnection agreements ias with covad setting out the rates,terms and conditions.c.each ia is lengthy and detailed the ia governing service in delaware,for example,is pages long and incorporates more than pages of schedules and appendices plus an amendment.as mandated by the telecommunications act,the ias have been approved by the relevant state commissions in the jurisdictions in which verizon and covad operate and filed for public inspection and copying.see e,h.
we take from verizon complaint its clear description of the technical side of the business 
verizon telecommunications network consists of three basic components circuits running from each customer,switches,and circuits between switches for bulk transmissions.the circuits,or interoffice transport facilities,create a network backbone between switches.the switches are located in buildings known as central offices.this part of the network is largely invisible to the public.
from the central offices,more familiar aspects of the network such as overhead lines,poles,and boxes carry individual pairs of copper wires,called loops,a relatively short distance to a customer premises.these loops were designed for voice communications and require costly upgrades to transmit large amounts of data efficiently.
verizon is in the business of providing plain old telephone service over its telecommunications networks.verizon is also in the business of providing internet access using dsl digital subscriber lines technology.dsl works by placing special equipment at each end of the loop.this equipment enhances the basic loop circuit with a signal that dramatically increases the speed at which data can travel the last mile between the central office and the customer premises 
covad provides its service by placing dsl equipment in leased space in verizon central offices,and by leasing verizon loops and circuits to connect end users to isps internet service providers.the practice of placing equipment in leased space in the ilec central office is known as collocation.in each central office in its service area,covad collocates a digital subscriber line access multiplexer.this device connects the loops incoming from end users to the circuits running to isps.
when covad leases loops,the part of the circuit for which verizon is responsible is carefully defined.
it runs from the central office to a network interface device nid at the customer premises.covad or the customer installs and maintains the inside wiring connecting the customer computer and dsl modem to the nid.in homes inside wiring may consist of a series of wires running from the nid along the baseboards to jacks in a few rooms.in office or apartment buildings the situation is much more complex.loops come in to a large box of nids,each of which may be connected to many wires running to different locations.
as internet users know,problems arise with connections.where covad is leasing verizon network elements,a covad customer problem can arise from covad or from verizon equipment and infrastructure.each filed ia stated that covad accepts responsibility for initial trouble isolation and providing verizon with appropriate dispatch information based on its test results.each ia also provided 
if i covad reports to verizon a customer trouble,ii covad requests a dispatch,iii verizon dispatches a technician,and iv such trouble was not caused by verizon facilities or equipment in whole or in part,then covad shall pay verizon a charge set forth in exhibit a for time associated with said dispatch.in addition,this charge also applies when the customer contact as designated by covad is not available at the appointed time.
six of the nine ias in the record further provided 
if as the result of covad instructions,verizon is erroneously requested to dispatch within a verizon central office or to a pot point of termination bay dispatch in,verizon may levy on covad an appropriate charge.if as the result of covad instructions,verizon is erroneously requested to dispatch outside a verizon central office or to a pot bay dispatch out,verizon may levy on covad an appropriate charge.
the remaining agreements provided 
if as the result of covad instructions,verizon is erroneously requested to dispatch within a verizon central office or to a pot point of termination bay dispatch in,a charge set forth in exhibit a will be assessed per occurrence to covad by verizon.if as the result of covad instructions,verizon is erroneously requested to dispatch outside a verizon central office or to a pot bay dispatch out,a charge set forth in exhibit a will be assessed per occurrence to covad by verizon.
each agreement,as amended,contained a detailed schedule of fixed charges for trouble tickets erroneously requesting verizon service.the delaware ia,for example,authorized verizon to charge covad if covad erroneously requested a verizon technician to examine a problem at one of verizon central offices dispatch in and if covad erroneously requested a verizon technician to examine a problem at a covad customer location dispatch out.
all but one of the agreements also incorporated a schedule governing covad right to a billing credit from verizon if verizon service fell below performance standards.trouble reports are factored into the performance metrics.the schedules also provided for an adjustment of performance credit,stating 
the responsibility for authorizing a dispatch resides with covad.reductions will be made in the performance credit if necessary access is not available,or if a dispatch is made and no trouble is found,or if trouble is found to be on the covad customer side of the network demarcation point,in premises wiring or customer premises equipment,at a statistically higher rate than the same performance that verizon experiences for verizon own retail customers.
the facts in the following paragraphs are disputed.for the purposes of deciding this appeal from summary judgment,we assume that verizon presentation,supported by affidavits,is true,leaving actual determination of the facts to such trial as may occur 
in the first quarter of,covad shirked its initial responsibilities and issued numerous false trouble tickets leading verizon to dispatch its technicians to solve problems arising from covad service and equipment.each erroneous trouble ticket included a representation of fact that after conducting internal troubleshooting,covad has determined that the trouble lies with verizon rather than with covad dsl service elements.covad resorted to such conduct because it was racing to meet its quarterly projections for growth in customer base and did not have adequately trained personnel to keep up the pace.moreover,covad directed its technicians to close new orders even if the dsl service was not working and to refer the resulting problems to verizon via trouble tickets.telling customers that trouble tickets to verizon were issued,covad deflected blame onto verizon.verizon incurred needless expense and lost the opportunity to use its resources more profitably.finally,pursuant to what verizon refers to as performance assurance plans paps in effect in various states,which we take to mean the ias provisions on poor performance,verizon gave covad millions of dollars in price reductions induced by covad scheme.
proceedings 
verizon filed this suit in the district court on june.the court dismissed verizon original complaint with leave to amend for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.on december,verizon filed the operative first amended complaint,alleging california state law claims for intentional misrepresentation,negligent misrepresentation,and unfair competition in violation of cal.bus.code.covad sought dismissal of that pleading on several grounds,including the filed rate doctrine.the court denied covad motion to dismiss,without prejudice to a motion for summary judgment based upon the filed rate doctrine.covad then answered the first amended complaint and asserted three state law counterclaims for intentional misrepresentation,negligent misrepresentation,and unfair competition.covad sought summary judgment on verizon claims based upon the filed rate doctrine.verizon moved to dismiss covad claims on a number of grounds.
on verizon allegations,supported by affidavits,the district court gave this opinion minor editorial changes have been made 
the filed rate doctrine,also referred to as the filed tariff doctrine,requires that common carriers and their customers adhere to tariffs filed and approved by appropriate regulatory agencies.brown mci worldcom network servs,cir.accordingly,no party may bring a judicial challenge to the validity of a filed tariff or bring a judicial proceeding to enforce any rate other than the rate established by the filed tariff.id.in sum,the doctrine purpose is to ensure that the filed rates are the exclusive source of the terms and conditions by which the common carrier provides to its customers the services covered by the tariff.id.internal citation and quotation marks omitted.
two principles underlie the filed rate doctrine.first,the doctrine prevents carriers from engaging in price discrimination between customers the strand.fax telecommunicaciones,v.at t,cir.second,the doctrine preserves the exclusive role of regulatory agencies in approving rates and keeping courts,which are far less competent to perform this function,out of the process the nonjusticiability strand.id.the nonjusticiability strand recognizes that legislatively appointed regulatory bodies have institutional competence to address issues courts lack the competence to set rates and the interference of courts in the process would subvert the authority of bodies and undermine the regulatory regime.id.internal citation and quotation marks omitted.
in the instant case,the tariffs at issue are contained in the interconnection agreements ias approved by the regulatory agencies of each state in verizon territory where covad does business.among the rates set forth in these ias are the amounts verizon may charge covad for a customer misdirect.a customer misdirect occurs when covad opens a trouble ticket notifying verizon of a problem with verizon equipment,causing verizon to send a repair truck to the trouble site,and the problem ultimately is found to be with covad equipment rather than verizon.in these circumstances,covad is required to reimburse verizon for the cost of dispatching the repair truck.the ias approved in the relevant states provide expressly the amount of compensation verizon may recover for each misdirect.
covad asserts that because the ias establish the amounts verizon may recover for each trouble ticket,any attempt to vary this amount is barred by the filed rate doctrine.the court agrees.the parties negotiated to the penny the amount verizon may recover for each misdirect.the instant proceeding in effect is an effort to alter this rate by means of state law tort claims.however,as the supreme court has held,t he rights as defined by the tariff can not be varied or enlarged by either contract or tort.am.and.central office telephone,d.
verizon asserts that the filed rate doctrine applies only to claims of customers against carriers,not to claims of carriers such as those presented here.while the vast majority of the cases addressing the filed rate doctrine do involve claims of customers,the supreme court has made clear that the doctrine applies equally to claims of carriers.citing arkansas louisiana gas hall,d 
verizon attempts to distinguish arkansas louisiana gas on the ground that the carrier claims in that case did not sound in tort.however,the decision is couched in extremely broad language,and its rationale appears equally applicable to tort claims.verizon argues that the rationale underlying the filed rate doctrine would not be served by imposing the doctrine upon claims of carriers.however,as noted earlier,an equally important policy underlying the filed rate doctrine is the preservation of the exclusive role of regulatory agencies in approving rates.this policy is served by application of the doctrine to claims of carriers.
verizon argues that even assuming that the filed rate doctrine applies to claims of carriers,the doctrine does not apply in the instant case because covad conduct falls outside the scope of the negotiated customer misdirect rates set forth in the ias.it points to language in the ias requiring covad to isolate the cause of the trouble initially and to issue a trouble ticket to verizon only after confirming that verizon equipment is the source of the problem.it asserts that while it was contemplated that a small number of innocent mistakes would occur,the parties never contemplated that there would be wholesale,deliberate abuse of the trouble ticket system at the time they negotiated the customer misdirect rates.verizon contends that because covad failed to fulfill its initial troubleshooting responsibilities under the ias,the customer misdirect rates set forth in the ias simply do not apply.
even assuming that verizon is correct in its assertion that the misdirect rates set forth in the ias do not apply in light of covad conduct,the court concludes that the filed rate doctrine nonetheless bars verizon claims.boiled down to its essence,verizon argument is that it is entitled to recover a greater amount of money for each customer misdirect arising out of covad alleged scheme than is provided for in the ias.verizon characterizes this greater amount of money as damages,but in effect it is seeking an increased rate for deliberate as opposed to accidental misdirects.
the ias do not address deliberate misdirects specifically,and none of the cases cited by the parties addresses an analogous factual situation.however,all of the published cases addressing the filed rate doctrine hold unequivocally that no one may bring a judicial proceeding to enforce any rate other than the rate established by the filed tariff.brown,at see also am.and,at,d holding that a carrier duly filed rate is the only lawful charge and that deviation from such rate is not permitted upon any pretext fax telecommunicaciones,at holding that c arriers are prohibited from providing communications services except pursuant to a filed tariff,and may not charge,demand,collect or receive a rate other than the rate listed in the applicable tariff wegoland nynex,cir holding that the legal rights between a regulated industry and its customers with respect to rates are controlled by and limited to the rates filed with and approved by the appropriate regulatory agency.in addition to barring suits challenging filed rates a
