this is another in a series of cases arising out of the energy crisis that occurred in california and other western states in and.we are asked to review the decision by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc or commission to deny refunds to wholesale buyers of electricity that purchased energy in the supply market at unusually high prices in the pacific northwest.we are also asked to review ferc decision to exclude from any potential refund those transactions involving energy purchased in the pacific northwest for consumption in california.we conclude that we have jurisdiction over ferc decision to deny refunds,and that ferc abused its discretion in denying potential relief for transactions involving energy that was ultimately consumed in california.we also conclude that in determining whether refunds were warranted,ferc should have considered new evidence of intentional market manipulation submitted by the parties with ferc approval.at this time,we decline to reach all other issues raised by the parties.we grant the petitions for review in part and remand this case to ferc to address the market manipulation evidence,to include the energy in its analysis,and to further consider its refund decision in light of related,intervening opinions of this court.

the effects of this crisis were felt in other areas of the western energy market as well,as dysfunctions in the spot markets operated by the california independent system operator and california power exchange px affected the prices in the pacific northwest,due to the integrated nature of the western markets.puget sound energy,et,ferc at june,order.the pacific northwest is defined as idaho,oregon,and washington,as well as parts of montana,nevada,utah,and wyoming.
prices in the pacific northwest spot market skyrocketed during the energy crisis.other factors,such as an extreme reduction in energy supply due to drought,also contributed to the crisis in the pacific northwest,a region that relies heavily on water flow through hydroelectric dams to generate electricity.puget sound energy,et,ferc at september,alj report.unlike the california spot market,which operated through a centralized power exchange using a central clearing price,the pacific northwest spot market operated through bilateral contracts negotiated independently between buyers and sellers,without a central clearing price.june,order,ferc at.most of these contracts were entered into under the terms of the western systems power pool wspp agreement,a standard form contract for electricity sales.september,alj report,ferc at.

pursuant to the fpa,san diego gas electric sdg e filed a complaint with ferc regarding the skyrocketing energy prices in california.see bpa,at.shortly thereafter,on october,puget sound energy puget one of the parties now supporting ferc a complaint with ferc requesting price caps for sales of capacity or energy into pacific northwest wholesale power markets.puget requested a prospective price cap equal to the lowest cap established by ferc in the california markets.puget complaint alleged that the california and pacific northwest markets were part of the same integrated market of the western interconnection,and that market conditions in california influenced market conditions in the pacific northwest.the complaint also requested that ferc set a refund effective date,to the extent refunds were necessary,sixty days after the filing of the complaint,or december,the earliest possible refund effective date pursuant to b.ferc notice of the puget complaint was published in the federal register on november,stating that t he complaint seeks a refund effective date,to the extent any refund is called for,of sixty days after the filing of the complaint.puget sound energy,et electric rate and corporate regulation filings.
on december,shortly after finding that prices in the california spot markets were unjust and unreasonable,pub.utils.comm n,at san diego gas,et,ferc at,ferc dismissed puget complaint,san diego gas,et,ferc at december,order.puget filed a timely request for rehearing on january.on april,in response to the sdg e complaint,ferc imposed price caps on sales in the california spot markets and instituted a investigation into rates in spot markets outside of california,believing that such rates might be unjust and unreasonable.san diego gas,et,ferc at april,order.then,on june,acknowledging that the california market is integrated with those of other states in the west,ferc adopted a market monitoring and mitigation plan for the western spot markets.san diego gas,et,ferc at june,order.the need for uniform pricing throughout the western region made this plan necessary.id.at.ferc also ordered market participants to engage in settlement discussions,with the goal of settling past accounts.id.at.three days later,ferc clarified that the settlement proceeding was not limited to matters but could also focus on settling past accounts related to sales in the pacific northwest.san diego gas,et,ferc at june,order.
also on june,puget filed a motion to dismiss and a notice that it was withdrawing its complaint,explaining that the june,order instituting price mitigation in the pacific northwest satisfied its complaint.on july,the port of seattle and the city of tacoma filed an answer opposing puget motion,explaining that a dismissal would prejudice other entities in the pacific northwest that relied on puget complaint.on the same day,the city of seattle and the attorney general of washington filed late motions to intervene as well as answers in opposition to puget notice of withdrawal.although it does not normally grant late interventions,ferc granted the late motions to intervene filed by the city of seattle and the attorney general of washington because over the course of the sdg e proceeding,ferc has expanded the scope of its focus from just california to include the entire western interconnect and also to implicate wholesale spot market transactions of utilities.san diego gas,et,ferc at july,order.the next day,july,the port of seattle and the city of tacoma also filed late motions to intervene in the puget proceeding.ferc granted those motions as well.
in its july,order,ferc noted that there had been little time during the california settlement discussions to address issues raised by the pacific northwest parties.id.at.as a result,ferc directed all parties to the puget sound complaint proceeding to participate in a separate preliminary evidentiary proceeding and to focus on settling past accounts related to spot market sales in the pacific northwest.interested parties to the sdg e proceeding may participate at their discretion.id.at.the purpose of the separate preliminary evidentiary proceeding,ferc explained,would be to facilitate development of a factual record on whether there may have been unjust and unreasonable charges for spot market bilateral sales in the pacific northwest for the period beginning december,through june.id.at.
the preliminary evidentiary proceeding took place from august,to september.the administrative law judge alj expedited the proceeding by limiting discovery responses to four business days,prohibiting depositions,and conducting a hearing in which was frequently waived.september,alj report,ferc at.the alj found that although prices in the california energy markets affected prices in the pacific northwest,this was not the only thing driving up the prices there.id.at.the alj also found no evidence of the exercise of market power in the pacific northwest,id.at,and found that the pacific northwest spot market performed as a competitive market during the relevant period,id.at.as a result,the alj determined that prices were not unjust or unreasonable and that refunds were unwarranted.id.at.the alj also determined that transactions in the pacific northwest spot market involving energy that was consumed in california could not be refunded in the pacific northwest proceeding because such transactions were beyond the scope of the puget complaint.id.at.
on may,ferc released on its website documents relating to enron manipulation of the california energy markets.according to the parties seeking refunds,this new evidence also reflected on market manipulation in the pacific northwest because some of enron tactics relied on the import and export of electricity to and from california and the pacific northwest.the parties seeking refunds also allege that enron relied on counterpart energy sellers in the pacific northwest to carry out its manipulative strategies.
in response to this evidence of enron intentional market manipulation,some of the parties filed motions to reopen the evidentiary record in the puget complaint.on december,ferc agreed to reopen the evidentiary record,giving the parties until february,to submit additional evidence concerning potential refunds for spot market bilateral sales transactions in the pacific northwest for the period january,through june,and proposed new modified findings of fact.puget sound energy,et,ferc at december,order.ferc later extended the deadline for submitting additional evidence to march.puget sound energy,et,ferc at.
after receiving the new evidence and holding oral argument,ferc ruled on the alj findings.a divided panel agreed with the alj,denying the request for refunds for energy purchases in the pacific northwest spot market.june,order,ferc at puget sound energy,et,ferc november,order.ferc did not,however,respond to or take into account the new evidence of enron market manipulation submitted with ferc approval.ferc also declined to make an explicit finding as to whether spot market prices in the pacific northwest were unjust or unreasonable,instead concluding that even if prices were unreasonable,the balance of factors tipped against ordering refunds.june,order,ferc at.these equitable factors included,inter alia,the presence in the pacific northwest market of governmental entities not subject to ferc jurisdiction and thus not liable for refunds,the unfairness of awarding refunds to parties that imprudently relied on the spot market for their energy needs,the adverse consequences refunds might have on the market,and the time and effort required to calculate refunds in the pacific northwest bilateral spot market.id.at.ferc also affirmed the recommendation of the alj to exclude from the refund proceeding transactions involving energy that was ultimately consumed in california.november,order,ferc at puget sound energy,et,ferc at february,order.commissioner massey dissented,stating that he would order refunds from the refund effective date,december,through june.june,order,ferc at.

as a threshold matter,we must determine whether we have jurisdiction to review ferc decision to deny refunds for energy transactions in the pacific northwest.ferc contends that we lack jurisdiction to review its denial of refunds because this decision is committed to agency discretion by law.
we lack jurisdiction to review an agency decision not to prosecute or enforce,whether through civil or criminal process.heckler chaney,d a.this is because an agency decision not to enforce often involves a complicated balancing of a number of factors which are peculiarly within its expertise,such as questions about the best use of the agency resources.heckler,at.the supreme court has cautioned,however,that this exception to judicial review is a narrow one,id.at.citizens to preserve overton park,volpe,d,overruled on other grounds by califano sanders,d,limited to those situations in which there is no meaningful standard against which to judge an agency decision not to act,heckler,at.in those situations,the concern is that courts should not intrude upon an agency prerogative to pick and choose its priorities,and allocate its resources accordingly,by demanding that an agency prosecute or enforce.thus,heckler limited the presumption of unreview ability to agency refusals to institute investigative or enforcement proceedings.id.at.emphasis added.when an agency has instituted proceedings,meaningful standards exist to review what the agency has done when an agency does act to enforce,that action itself provides a focus for judicial review,inasmuch as the agency must have exercised its power in some manner.the action at least can be reviewed to determine whether the agency exceeded its statutory powers.id.at.emphasis in original.see also mci telecomms.fcc,it is one thing for the fcc to decline to investigate a tariff in the first place that decision is entrusted to its unreviewable discretion.it is quite another for it to note the importance of a question concerning a tariff,request and take evidence from the parties,and hold a hearing on the matter.accordingly,where ferc has made a determination to adjudicate a dispute or take steps towards enforcing a violation of the law,the outcome it chooses is subject to judicial review under the standards of review set forth in the administrative procedure act apa.cal.dep t of water,at.
that is the case here.ferc has already made a decision to commit resources to an examination of whether refunds are warranted for certain energy transactions in the pacific northwest for a period of time in and.in response to the filing of a complaint,ferc has held hearings and taken evidence to adjudicate a dispute between the parties as to whether refunds should be awarded.although the steps ferc has taken do not require ferc to find that refunds are appropriate,ferc decision regarding the propriety of awarding refunds is reviewable by this court.indeed,we regularly exercise judicial review over ferc decision to grant or deny refunds,pub.utils.comm n,reviewing decision to grant refunds lockyer,reviewing decision to deny refunds consol.edison of,ferc,reviewing decision to deny refunds,and we do so here.
we also must decide whether ferc erred in finding that puget original complaint,which launched the pacific northwest refund proceeding,was not withdrawn as a matter of law in july.if ferc erred and the opinion was withdrawn,the entire pacific northwest evidentiary proceeding before the alj,as well as ferc subsequent decision to deny refunds,would be procedurally barred.if,on the other hand,we determine that puget complaint was not withdrawn,we must decide whether the puget complaint failed to set a refund effective date,which is a statutory requirement for seeking refunds.in other words,puget and the refund opponents ask us to affirm the outcome below on procedural grounds,rather than reach the merits.this we decline to do.
as a threshold matter,we conclude that puget has standing to assert this challenge,even though it was the prevailing party before the agency.the fpa limits judicial review to those parties who have been aggrieved by an order issued by the commission.b.in addition,l ike all parties seeking access to the federal courts,puget is held to the constitutional requirement of standing.shell oil ferc.the circuit has held that both aggrievement and standing require that petitioners establish,at a minimum,injury in fact to a protected interest.id.interpreting the similar aggrievement requirement of.

puget undoubtedly prevailed before the agency indeed,it argues that ferc reached the correct result in not granting refunds.puget has standing,however,because,while not technically bringing a,it essentially finds itself in the position of a who lost a collateral issue below but ultimately prevailed.with the refund proponents appealing ferc denial of refunds,ferc collateral refusal to let puget withdraw its complaint would expose puget to greater refund liability should we reverse.accordingly,under hilton,the risk that puget might become aggrieved upon reversal allows it to bring this appeal.
although it has standing to raise them,puget procedural arguments are unavailing.on june,ferc extended price mitigation beyond california to the rest of the western states,including the pacific northwest.june,order,ferc at.the june,order also required public utility sellers and buyers to engage in settlement discussions to determine the amount of refunds owed.id.at.three days later,on june,ferc clarified that the settlement discussions should not be limited to california entities but may also focus on settling past accounts related to sales in the pacific northwest.june,order,ferc at.on the same day,puget filed a motion to dismiss its complaint and notice of withdrawal.
puget contends that its notice of withdrawal of the complaint upon which the pacific northwest refund proceeding is based became effective as a matter of law fifteen days after puget filed the notice,nullifying the entire refund proceeding at issue in this case.puget argument is that although some refund proponents filed motions in opposition to puget notice,these motions in opposition could not have prevented puget withdrawal from going into effect because the refund proponents were not,at that time,parties to the proceeding.because we must defer to ferc interpretation of its own regulation so long as the interpretation is not plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation,entergy,ferc,internal quotation marks omitted,we disagree.
ferc regulations provide that a withdrawal of any pleading is effective at the end of days from the date of filing if no motion in opposition to the notice of withdrawal is filed within that period and the decisional authority does not issue an order disallowing the withdrawal within that period.b.if,on the other hand,a motion in opposition to a notice of withdrawal is filed within the day period,the withdrawal is not effective until the decisional authority issues an order accepting the withdrawal.id.b.puget contends that although the refund proponents opposed puget notice,this opposition was not effective because another regulation states that motions may be filed only by a participant or a person who has filed a timely motion to intervene which has not been denied.id.a.the regulations in turn define participant as any party or any employee of the commission.id.b.a party is one who has filed the complaint,is a respondent to the proceeding,or who has effectively intervened.id.c.the process of intervening,not particularly relevant here,is laid out at.
ferc has interpreted b as placing no limitation on who may oppose a party notice of withdrawal.june,order,ferc at.in the alternative,ferc also interpreted the regulations as permitting a to oppose the withdrawal of a complaint by simultaneously filing a motion in opposition to withdrawal as well as a motion to intervene.november,order,ferc at.in that situation,according to ferc,even if ferc did not grant the motion to intervene until a later date,it could have granted the motion to intervene on the day both motions were filed,thus making the an intervening party capable of filing a motion in opposition under a.june,order,ferc at november,order,ferc at.accordingly,because the attorney general of washington and the city of seattle filed,on july,simultaneous motions to intervene and motions in opposition to the withdrawal,november,order,ferc at,ferc rejected puget argument that its complaint had been withdrawn as a matter of law fifteen days after puget filed its notice of withdrawal,id.at 
we see no error in ferc interpretation of its own regulations.the regulation addressing notices of withdrawal does not explicitly state that opposition to such notices may be made only by formal parties to the proceeding.b.ferc did not err in treating the attorney general of washington and the city of seattle as intervenors for purposes of opposing puget notice of withdrawal.we also find support for ferc decision in the fact that ferc granted the city of tacoma and the port of seattle party status in the california refund proceeding on july.see domtar maine ferc,permitting retroactive grant of intervention.given the extremely close ties between the california proceeding and the pacific northwest proceeding,and ferc frequent treatment of the two refund proceedings as one and the same,see,june,order,ferc at using the sdg e heading and clarifying that all parties to the sdg e complaint proceeding may also focus on settling past accounts related to sales in the pacific northwest,ferc could also have accepted the opposition motions of tacoma and the port of seattle as filed by parties to the proceeding.for these reasons,we hold that the withdrawal of puget complaint did not become effective as a matter of law,and ferc may use the complaint as a basis for awarding refunds in the pacific northwest.
the refund opponents supporting puget further argue the pacific northwest proceeding was procedurally doomed because puget complaint did not request a required refund effective date,thus stripping ferc of any authority to order refunds for electricity purchases in the pacific northwest.we reject this argument as well.
congress has provided that w henever ferc institutes a proceeding under this section,ferc shall establish a refund effective date.b.this refund effective date may not be earlier than sixty days after the filing of a complaint or the filing of a notice by ferc that it intends to investigate rates sua sponte id.the refund effective date is important because any refunds ordered by ferc are limited to the period following the refund effective date.id.without a refund effective date,the entire pacific northwest proceeding would have been moot because ferc would have been powerless to order refunds for the period sought by the refund proponents.
the refund opponents argue that puget complaint never requested refunds or the setting of a refund effective date.to the contrary,puget complaint clearly stated that puget requests that any refunds ordered by the commission reflect the prospective nature of the relief sought.if and to the extent any refund is called for in response to puget petition,puget respectfully requests that the refund effective date be set sixty days after the date of filing of this complaint.
in the alternative,the refund opponents argue that because ferc dismissed puget complaint on december,december,order,ferc at,ferc prevented the establishment of a refund effective date even though puget filed a petition for rehearing on january.in other words,they argue that buyers and sellers in the pacific northwest spot market could not have been on notice that december,may serve as the effective date for refunds because the complaint requesting that date was dismissed prior to december.this argument fails for two reasons.first,market participants in the pacific northwest were notified prior to ferc dismissal of the complaint that puget had requested a refund effective date of december.ferc itself created a notice of complaint,which stated that puget complaint seeks a refund effective date,to the extent any refund is called for,of sixty days after the filing of the complaint.ferc notice also explained that c opies of this filing were served upon parties to the wspp,and transmitted electronically to the wspp for posting on its website www.wspp.org and for electronic distribution to all parties to the wspp agreement.in addition,this notice was published in the federal register on november.
second,the fpa does not support the contention of the refund opponents.on the one hand,the fpa provides that if ferc does not respond to an application for rehearing within thirty days after filing,the application may be deemed to have been denied.a emphasis added.ferc regulations make this denial automatic,stating that u nless ferc acts upon a request for rehearing within days after the request is filed,the request is denied.f.on the other hand,the statute also states that until the record is filed with the court of appeals,ferc may at any time,with reasonable notice,modify or set aside any finding or order it has made.a.thus,even if puget rehearing request was denied as a matter of law thirty days after it was filed,this denial did not strip ferc of its ability to change its mind and modify its decision in the june,order.
moreover,we have already explained that petitions for rehearing keep market participants on notice that an alternative refund effective date,once rejected by ferc,might in the future be made the refund effective date.pub.utils.comm n,at further,some of the california parties promptly sought rehearing of ferc initial determination of the refund effective date in its august,order.in short,market participants were quickly apprised that the original refund effective date might be subject to revision.here,puget filed a petition for rehearing challenging ferc order dismissing its complaint.thus,sellers in the pacific were already on notice of puget complaint requesting a refund effective sufficiently on notice that puget complaint and its attendant refund effective date were still potentially viable because puget filed a petition for rehearing.any reliance by sellers on the lack of a refund effective date prior to the issuance of a final order was at their own risk.id.quoting december,order,ferc at.
finally,the refund opponents argue that ferc was required to set a refund effective date,if at all,before instituting a refund proceeding.ferc acknowledges in its brief that t he commission never established an fpa b refund effective date for this matter however,the plain language of the fpa does not place any restriction on when ferc may set the refund effective date.hertzberg dignity partners,cir where the meaning of a statute is clear from the text,we need look no further.rather,the statute states that w henever the commission institutes a proceeding under this section,the commission shall establish a refund effective date.b.the statute mandates the establishment of an effective date,but it does not mandate when ferc must establish it.to the extent the word institutes is ambiguous,connoting both that the date shall be established at the time the proceeding begins and that the date shall be established anytime ferc is involved in such a proceeding,we owe deference to ferc interpretation of the ambiguous language.chevron,at.ferc made clear its interpretation when it announced that the statute would permit ferc to set the refund effective date at december.june,order,ferc at.
ferc interpretation,which would permit it to set the refund effective date at any time,is consistent with the overall framework of the statute,which indicates the primary concern of congress was to afford notice to market participants of the period of time during which they may be liable for refunds.the rule provides notice to the market that if ferc ever decides to order refunds based on a given complaint,those refunds could cover a period beginning sixty days after the filing of that complaint,and no earlier.this is a permissible construction of the statute,and is supported by our prior decision regarding the california proceeding,in which we found that the key question is whether the sdg e complaint afforded sufficient notice to alert market participants that sales and purchases might be subject to refund.pub.utils.comm n,at.that opinion made clear that ferc has some discretion in setting the earliest refund effective date allowed in order to give maximum protection to consumers,id.quoting december,order,ferc at,as long as that protection is balanced against fairness to market participants by providing them with the notice necessary to change their practices prior to the date refunds might start to accrue.
in sum,we reject the procedural challenges raised by the refund opponents and hold that puget complaint requested a refund effective date,ferc dismissal of puget complaint did not disturb ferc ability to set the refund effective date,and ferc was not required to formally set the refund effective date prior to instituting a refund proceeding.we also hold that puget complaint was not withdrawn as a matter of law because the refund proponents timely opposed puget notice of withdrawal.accordingly,ferc had the authority to order refunds for transactions in the pacific northwest spot market during the permissible time period,although it declined
