introduction 
a worker for an unlicensed contractor hired by homeowners to trim trees at their residence was electrocuted when his polesaw came in contact with an overhead high voltage line.the decedent heirs brought this wrongful death action against the homeowners,alleging they negligently failed to keep their property in a reasonably safe condition,and failed to warn the contractor or his workers,including the decedent,about the hazardous condition presented by the high voltage power lines adjacent to their trees.
plaintiffs further identified a statute,penal code section,subdivision b section b,that makes it a misdemeanor for any person,either personally or through an employee ibid,to move any tool or equipment within six feet of a high voltage overhead line.plaintiffs argued section b sets forth a special duty of care with regard to the use of tools or equipment in close proximity to high voltage lines that such duty was violated here given that the decedent polesaw came in contact with the power lines,causing his electrocution and that if the decedent is found to have been the homeowners employee b at the time of the fatal accident,the homeowners are vicariously liable for breach of that duty under the express terms of the statute,giving rise to a presumption of negligence under evidence code section plaintiffs then argued the decedent was the homeowners employee by operation of law under the penultimate paragraph of labor code section,as construed in state compensation ins.fund workers comp.appeals bd.cal d,state compensation.in state compensation,this court interpreted section to mean that unlicensed contractors who become injured on the job are not independent contractors in the eyes of the law,but are instead,by operation of law,employees of the party who hired them for purposes of establishing workers compensation benefit eligibility.state compensation,at.
the trial court disagreed with both prongs of plaintiffs negligence per se theory of the case and submitted the matter to the jury on standard negligence instructions.the jury returned a verdict for defendant homeowners.the court of appeal reversed and remanded,concluding a violation of the duty of care embodied in section b would support plaintiffs negligence per se theory of liability if the decedent was shown to be the homeowners employee,and that under the penultimate paragraph of labor code section,the decedent was the homeowners employee at law,requiring jury instructions on section b and the resulting presumption of negligence.
we granted review to address both questions of statutory interpretation implicated in the court of appeal holding.first,does section b set forth a statutory duty of care owed by these homeowners to the decedent in the first instance,such that plaintiffs case should have been submitted to the jury on a negligence per se theory of liability pursuant to evidence code section second,if section b does indeed establish such a duty of care as between these parties,then was the decedent the homeowners employee by operation of law under labor code section,for purposes of establishing defendants vicarious liability under section b for breach of that duty 
we conclude the court of appeal erred in finding section b sets forth a special duty of care owed by these homeowners to the decedent.the court of appeal rationale effectively makes defendant homeowners vicariously liable in tort for the worker own negligent acts or omissions which themselves violated the statute and proximately caused his fatal injuries.as will be explained,the fatally injured worker who,through his own conduct,breached the duty of care embodied in section b,was not one of the class of persons for whose protection the statute was adopted,subd.a.we find the jury was properly instructed under plaintiffs common law negligence theory,and that the trial court properly refused to further instruct on section b and plaintiffs negligence per se theory of the case.accordingly,the judgment of the court of appeal to the contrary will be reversed.
in light of our conclusion that section b can not serve to support negligence per se instructions within the meaning of evidence code section,we have no occasion to reach or address plaintiffs further claim that the decedent was the homeowners employee at law under labor code section,as interpreted in state compensation.
statement of facts and procedural background 
maria dolores ramirez and martin flores plaintiffs are the parents of the decedent,luis flores.
thomas and vivian nelson are homeowners.their backyard has a number of trees,including a eucalyptus tree over feet in height.every two or three years,southern california edison has the eucalyptus tree trimmed so that its branches do not reach the high voltage electrical lines that run above the tree.the electrical lines are openly visible to everyone.
on january,southern california edison tree trimmers gave the nelsons notice they would trim the eucalyptus tree the next day,but they did not do so.several weeks later,the nelsons orally contracted with julian rodriguez,the sole proprietor of julian rodriguez landscape and tree service,to top and trim several trees in their backyard.the nelsons had used rodriguez four or five times in the past to top and trim the trees.their neighbor had used him for many years.the nelsons believed rodriguez did professional work trimming trees,and left it to his good judgment as to how,or to what height,to top and trim their trees.
rodriguez arrived at the nelsons home on february.he had a crew of four men,including the decedent luis flores.flores worked on the eucalyptus tree while other crew members worked on other trees in the nelsons backyard.the nelsons neither supervised the trimming,nor did they furnish the tools for the job.
vivian nelson could see flores working about halfway up in the eucalyptus tree from her kitchen window.he was working above his shoulders with a polesaw.she could not tell from her kitchen window of what material the polesaw was made.
around noon,vivian nelson heard men shouting in spanish.she looked out the kitchen window,and saw men running to the eucalyptus tree.she went out onto her deck,and saw flores hanging in the eucalyptus tree from his safety harness.she called her husband,who called.
flores had been killed by electrocution.no one saw the accident happen.after the accident,vivian nelson noticed that the polesaw flores had been using was made of aluminum and wood.
plaintiffs,the decedent family,filed a first amended complaint against the nelsons alleging negligence and wrongful death.the general negligence theory alleged and ultimately argued to the jury was that the nelsons knew the high voltage lines constituted a dangerous condition on their property,knew the utility company responsible for the power lines in the past had trimmed the tree on which the decedent was working when electrocuted,knew or should have known rodriguez and his workers were unlicensed contractors,and nonetheless negligently failed to warn or act as would reasonable homeowners under the circumstances in contracting with rodriguez to trim the tree in question.
plaintiffs complaint further alleged there were in effect at the time of the decedent death regulations enacted pursuant to the california occupational safety and health act of see,tit,governing operating procedures for work on or in proximity to overhead high voltage lines that the homeowners were statutory employers of the decedent within the meaning of the workers compensation laws and that in that legal capacity they became liable for violations of the regulations,proximately causing the worker death,as well as for failing to secure the payment of workers compensation benefits for their employee.
during the hearing of pretrial motions it became apparent to the trial court and parties that the workers compensation laws were inapplicable to this case for two reasons.first,the nelsons had hired contractor rodriguez and his workers to perform noncommercial tree trimming services,which category of work,as a matter of law,constitutes household domestic service not subject to regulation under,subd.b fern
