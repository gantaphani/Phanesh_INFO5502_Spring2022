petitioners,publicly owned utilities puds operating in the pacific northwest challenge contract amendments entered into in may collectively amendments between the bonneville power administration bpa and several utilities ious arguing that they violate provisions of the northwest power act nwpa.the amendments at issue modify various provisions of several rep settlement agreements bpa entered into with ious in october and additionally implement a reduction of risk or litigation penalty implemented in agreements between bpa and two ious,pacificorp and puget sound energy,in may and june of.in a previously issued opinion,we held that bpa was bound by the power exchange requirements of the northwest power act and exercised its settlement authority contrary to those requirements when it entered into the rep settlement agreements.portland bpa,cir.because bpa has not had an opportunity to determine the continued validity of the amendments,we remand to the agency to determine in the first instance how to treat the amendments in light of our prior decision and this opinion.
background 
our prior opinion in pge provides a thorough explanation of the underlying regulatory framework,bpa operations,and background on the rep settlement agreements which form the basis of the amendments at issue here.see at.additionally,several other of our opinions chronicle the history of bpa and describe its complicated regulatory framework.see,golden nw.aluminum,bpa,cir pub.power council,bpa,cir pub.power agency bpa,cir as amended ass of pub.agency customers,bpa,cir.we only repeat facts necessary for the disposition of this case and refer the reader to our prior opinions for a more comprehensive explanation.
a.the load reduction agreements 
in,while the pge litigation was pending,the pacific northwest experienced a severe drought.lower precipitation throughout the region coupled with prior bpa decisions and contracts including the rep settlement agreements which were at issue in pge,put the agency in a position where it could not generate enough power to meet its contractual obligations.bpa administrator warned in a public speech that rate increases of percent or more were possible since bpa obligations added up to approximately megawatts more than its current generating resources could provide on a firm basis.the administrator advised that the only way to avoid massive rate increases was for bpa to reduce its megawatt short position.in response,bpa developed a load reduction program involving conservation by consumers,reduction in power demand by utilities,and load curtailments by its direct service industrial customers.after negotiating several load reduction agreements with various customers,bpa was able to announce that the effort was absolutely a stunning success and that it only had to impose a rate increase of,instead of a much higher anticipated increase.
as part of its load reduction plan,bpa entered into load reduction agreements with pacificorp and puget sound energy pse on may,and june,respectively collectively lras.the lras eliminated bpas obligation to deliver virtually all power to pacificorp and pse for the fy time period in exchange for cash payments one of the provisions in the lras provided that bpa would reduce the payments to pacificorp and pse from per mwh of foregone power to per mwh if by december,pacificorp and pse were able to negotiate and enter into litigation settlement agreements with the puds and other of bpa preference customers.if the puds did not enter into agreements by the specified date,the clause would expire and bpa would make cash payments to pacificorp and pse based on the rate for the fy period.this to as the litigation penalty by the puds and a reduction of risk discount by bpa operated as a strong incentive for the puds to settle their ongoing litigation including litigation over the rep settlement agreements with bpa.if the puds settled,the cash payments bpa was obligated to make to pacificorp and pse would be reduced by approximately.if the puds refused to settle,they would in effect have to pay an additional to acquire bpa power,as bpa announced it would recover the through its wholesale power rates which would affect all of its customers,including the puds.
b.the deferral agreements and the failed global settlement 
when none of the puds or other of bpa preference customers entered into settlement agreements by the december,deadline,bpa deferred payment of the litigation penalty and entered into renewed settlement talks.in anticipation of a broad settlement,pacificorp and pse executed conditional deferral agreements cdas in june with bpa.under the cdas,pacificorp and pse agreed to defer payment of the beginning october,while settlement discussions progressed.the payments would be automatically deferred for continuing six month periods unless pacificorp or pse elected to terminate the deferral period.bpa agreed to pay the companies percent interest on the during the deferral period.in,bpa proposed a global litigation settlement which called for the preference customers to agree to a new formula for iou benefits for fy dismiss all their pending ninth circuit litigation,including challenges to the rep settlement agreements and enter covenants not to sue regarding future claims.in exchange,the ious would waive payment of the litigation penalty.in a record of decision published october,rod,bpa made it clear that if the settlement failed,it would raise rates in order to pay the litigation penalty to pacificorp and pse 
bpa failed to garner the required unanimous support for its settlement proposal by the january,deadline.a day later,bpa issued a press release announcing that the agreement had failed and giving notice that it was implementing the litigation penalty h ad the proposal succeeded,bpa wholesale power rates would have dropped by nearly percent,retroactive to,the proposed rate decrease would have been possible largely due to elimination of the million in payments to utilities.in the absence of a settlement,bpa will continue to implement its existing power contracts.
bpa rod and contract amendments 
after the global litigation settlement failed,bpa announced in a record of decision on may,rod,that it had implemented several contract amendments collectively the amendments modifying the rep settlement agreements and establishing iou benefits for fy.the amendments include provisions that specified that bpa elected to provide payments,not physical power,pursuant to the rep settlement agreements and the lras during fy replaced the established rate case price forecast,which was used to calculate the cash payments bpa would make to the ious,with a methodology obligated bpa not to reduce iou benefits even if a reduction was required by section b of the nwpa establish an annual guaranteed floor and a cap on the financial benefits provided to the ious for fy even if section b required reduction of iou benefits below modify the time allowed the ious to pass monetary benefits of the rep settlement agreement through to their residential and consumers and implement of the litigation penalty embedded in the lras through rate increases for fy 
finally,the amendments provided that if any of its provisions were held void,then the underlying agreement in effect prior to the amendments would apply and the provisions of the amendments would have no further force or effect unless the parties could negotiate mutually acceptable replacement terms.these amendments form the basis of the instant litigation.
litigation over the rep settlement agreements 
in,several preference customers challenged the rep settlement agreements.in pge,we held that bpa broad settlement authority under f of the nwpa,f,did not give it license to create an exchange program divorced from the stringent requirements imposed by congress in c and b of the nwpa,c b.the agreements bpa entered into conflicted with its governing statutes and,consequently,were not in accordance with law.a.we held that the rep settlement agreements which created this new benefit system were inconsistent with the nwpa and exceeded the authority delegated to bpa by congress.accordingly,we granted the petitions for review.see pge,at.in a companion case dealing with the wholesale power rates set by bpa,we held,among other things,that bpa violated the nwpa when it allocated to its preference customers part of the cost of the rep settlement.see golden,at.
ii.jurisdiction and judicial review 
we have original subject matter jurisdiction over bpa final actions and decisions or the implementation of such final actions taken pursuant to the nwpa.e.we have previously identified four types of suits for which we have jurisdiction 
s uits challenging the constitutionality of the act the constitutionality of any action taken pursuant to the act statutory authority final actions or other decisions by bpa taken pursuant to the act statutory authority and the implementation of final actions by bpa taken pursuant to the authority of any of four enumerated federal power statutes.
pac.power light bpa,cir.here,in deciding whether we have jurisdiction,we must determine first whether bpa challenged action was either a final agency action or the implementation of an action and second,whether the challenge to the action was timely filed within days of either a final action or implementation of a final action.e.
the nwpa identifies eight final actions which are expressly subject to judicial review 
a adoption of the plan or amendments thereto by the northwest power planning council under section of this title,adoption of the program by the council,and any determination by the council under section h of this title 
b sales,exchanges,and purchases of electric power under section of this title 
c the administrator acquisition of resources under section of this title 
d implementation of conservation measures under section of this title 
e execution of contracts for assistance to sponsors under section f of this title 
f granting of credits under section h of this title 
g final rate determinations under section of this title and 
h any rule prescribed by the administrator under m of this title.
e.additionally,the act provides a jurisdictional for other final actions nothing in this section shall be construed to preclude judicial review of other final actions and decisions by the council or administrator.e.we have interpreted this provision to extend only to actions based on the record developed before the agency,and expressly to exclude any causes of action arising from actions divorced from and unrelated to an administrative record.see pub.util.dist.of clark county johnson,cir declining to exercise jurisdiction over contract and tort claims against bpa.
the amendments arguably come within the enumerated actions as a sale,exchange or purchase of electric power however,because they modify provisions of existing agreements,including the rep settlement agreements which were entered into pursuant to e and e b,we think they are more properly analyzed under the provision.we only have jurisdiction under the provision if an agency action was final.the act does not specify what constitutes a final agency action,so we have looked to the more general doctrine of finality in administrative agency law.see puget sound energy,united states,cir.the primary inquiry is concerned with whether the initial decisionmaker has arrived at a definitive position on the issue that inflicts an actual,concrete injury.darby cisneros,d internal quotation marks omitted see also franklin massachusetts,d.
in bennett spear,d,the supreme court held that an agency action is final when two conditions are met first,the action must mark the consummation of the agency decisionmaking must not be of a merely tentative or interlocutory nature.id.at.citations omitted.second,the action must be one by which rights or obligations have been determined,or from which legal consequences will flow.id.at.citations omitted.applying this test,we have found that certain factors provide an indicia of finality,such as whether the action amounts to a definitive statement of the agency position,whether the action has a direct and immediate effect on the operations of the party seeking review,and whether immediate compliance with the terms is expected.indus.customers of nw.utils.bpa,cir quoting cal.dep t of water res.ferc,cir citations omitted.
applying the bennett factors,we conclude that we have jurisdiction to review the amendments,as they are final actions of bpa.after holding the standard notice and comment period,bpa announced its adoption of the amendments in a record of decision.the rod is the consummation of bpa decision making process and expression of bpa final decision on an issue.it is not merely a intermediate step.see ass of pub.agency customers,at treating the date of execution of the rod as the date on which the decision becomes final.three days after bpa issued the rod,it executed agreements implementing the rod with the six ious,avista,idaho power,pacificorp,portland general electric,northwestern energy,and puget sound energy,further proof that it had reached a final decision.
the amendments also satisfy the second prong of the test they fix specific rights from which legal consequences flow.for example,in altering the panoply of benefits bpa was giving to the ious,the rod notes,among other things,that the amendments will result in a short term rate decrease of six percent for fy,and a projected rate increase of one percent for fy over the projected rate.additionally,in the contracts with pacificorp and pse,in exchange for a waiver of of the litigation penalty,bpa agreed to apply the remaining with the costs to be recouped through its fy rates.alterations and changes to existing contracts clearly have legal consequences if they directly result in rate changes to bpa customers.
the amendments did not merely change the implementation of a prior agreement.rather they created new benefits and obligations bpa customers and,as such,constitute a final agency action.therefore,we conclude that the amendments meet both prongs of the bennett test and their adoption is a reviewable agency action.petitioners timely filed their challenge to the rod within days of its adoption,see e,and we have jurisdiction to review their petition.
iii.standard of review 
the administrative procedure act apa,governs our review of bpa actions.see e incorporating the scope of review provisions of the apa.accordingly,we may set aside bpa decisions only if they are arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.see pge,at pub.power council,at.
iv.analysis 
the challenged rod and subsequent contracts implementing the rod alter three groups of prior agreements the vast majority of the provisions amend contract provisions implementing the rep settlement agreements the remaining provisions modify and implement various provisions of the cdas and the lra agreements with pacificorp and pse dealing with the litigation penalty.
in pge,we concluded that bpa settlement authority under f of the bonneville project act is subject to and constrained by the rep requirements in c and the rate ceiling in b of the nwpa,and we held that bpa broad reading of its settlement authority is contrary to a plain reading of its organic statutes,and it is inconsistent with general principles of administrative law.at.we further held that bpa was operating from a faulty legal premise and ignored the exchange program that congress created in the nwpa and that bpa has implemented through its regulations,instead creating a new residential exchange benefit system under f.id.at.this we held was not in accordance with law.a.
specifically,we held that bpa violated congressional mandate when it implemented the rep settlement agreements and abandoned its traditional asc methodology in favor of a new calculation which took into account legal challenges and future fluctuations in the energy market.this change served to enlarge the group of ious eligible for the settlement and to increase the benefits of those already qualified for the rep and altered the allocation of the settlement benefits.pge,at.we concluded that bpa had i n effect settled the rep program as if it had changed its regulations,which it had not.id.at.in addition,bpa erre
