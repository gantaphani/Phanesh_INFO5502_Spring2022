joshua jackson suffered serious injuries when he attempted to dislodge a kite from a power line maintained by pacific gas electric company pg e on the property of eve prince.the parties do not dispute that pg e is immune from direct liability to jackson under civil code section,which provides with certain exceptions that a property owner owes no duty of care to keep the premises safe for entry or use by others for any recreational purpose.the question here is whether prince,who might be liable to jackson under one of the statutory exceptions,may recover on her alleging pg e is liable for implied contractual indemnity based on its breach of a contractual duty owed to her to maintain its power line easement in repair.
we conclude that,even assuming a claim for implied contractual indemnity may be predicated on an alleged breach of an easement duty,pg e immunity from liability to jackson under section nonetheless bars prince from recovering indemnification as a matter of law.we therefore reverse the judgment of the court of appeal and remand the matter to that court with directions to enter judgment in favor of pg 
factual and procedural background 
the underlying facts are undisputed.joshua jackson was flying a kite in his friend backyard and suffered serious injuries when he used an aluminum pole to try to dislodge the kite from an electrical power line that traversed the neighboring property owned by the friend grandmother,eve prince.see jackson pacific gas electric th,d jackson.
a guardian ad litem filed an action on jackson behalf against pg e,which owned an easement to erect and maintain electrical power lines across the prince property.in that action,the court of appeal upheld the trial court determination that pg e was immune from liability to jackson under section,the recreational use immunity statute.jackson,supra,th at,d.the court concluded that based on the undisputed facts,jackson attempted retrieval of the kite was,as a matter of law,a recreational use of property within the contemplation of section and there were no facts supporting application of section enumerated exceptions to immunity.jackson,at,d.the decision in that action became final in.id.at,d.
jackson guardian ad litem subsequently filed a premises liability action against prince.the complaint alleges that jackson was expressly invited to use prince property,and that prince knew or should have known that the lines hanging low over her property were high voltage power lines that posed a hazard to her guests.it further alleges that prince used a foot inch aluminum pole to shake nut trees,that she left it under or near the low hanging power lines,and that she created a foreseeable risk of injury or death should the metal pole be raised near the lines for any purpose.
prince,in turn,filed a against pg e.as relevant here,she alleges that,based on the easement granted to pg e and on a statute that requires owners of easements to maintain them in repair,pg e breached a contractual duty owed to her to maintain its power lines in repair and thereby proximately caused jackson injury.prince seeks indemnity on the ground that pg e alleged breach of duty has forced her to defend against jackson action and to be potentially liable for his damages.
pg e filed a motion for summary judgment,contending prince is barred from recovery because the gravamen of her is equitable indemnity,as opposed to express contractual indemnity.relying on the undisputed evidence that jackson was injured while engaged in a recreational use of its easement,pg e argued its immunity under section affords a complete defense to equitable indemnity.the trial court granted the motion,concluding that equitable indemnity is at issue and that pg e showing negating joint and several liability to jackson entitled it to judgment as a matter of law.
the court of appeal reversed,finding that the indemnity prince seeks is implied from pg e contractual obligations under the recorded easement documents,and is not based on any alleged breach of duty owed to jackson.in the court of appeal words,pg e has contractual duties to prince that are separate and distinct from the general duty of care to jackson that is the subject of section.prince claim for implied contractual indemnification does not rely on,or seek to enforce,the duty that is limited by section,but instead relies on duties arising from the easement.the court concluded that,because joint and several liability to the injured plaintiff is not a requirement of implied contractual indemnity,pge statutory immunity from suit by jackson does not preclude prince indemnity claim.
we granted pg e petition for review.
discussion 
this case presents two issues whether a claim for implied contractual indemnity may rest on the documents granting pg e a power line easement and on section,which generally requires an easement holder to maintain its easement in repair and if so,whether pg e immunity from liability to jackson under section nonetheless bars prince from recovering on an implied contractual indemnity theory.
a.the obligation of indemnity 
in general,indemnity refers to the obligation resting on one party to make good a loss or damage another party has incurred.rossmoor sanitation,pylon,cal d.historically,the obligation of indemnity took three forms indemnity expressly provided for by contract express indemnity indemnity implied from a contract not specifically mentioning indemnity implied contractual indemnity and indemnity arising from the equities of particular circumstances traditional equitable indemnity see ppg industries,transamerica ins.cal th,d.
although the foregoing categories of indemnity were once regarded as distinct,we now recognize there are only two basic types of indemnity express indemnity and equitable indemnity.see bay development,superior court cal d,fn,bay development.though not extinguished,implied contractual indemnity is now viewed simply as a form of equitable indemnity.id.at,see white,city of huntington beach cal d.
we briefly review all three historic forms of indemnity,so as to provide context to prince claim of a right to implied contractual indemnity.
express indemnity refers to an obligation that arises by virtue of express contractual language establishing a duty in one party to save another harmless upon the occurrence of specified circumstances.bay development,supra,cal d at.express indemnity generally is not subject to equitable considerations or a joint legal obligation to the injured party rather,it is enforced in accordance with the terms of the contracting parties agreement.markley beagle cal d.in the context of noninsurance indemnity agreements,if a party seeks to be indemnified for its own active negligence,or regardless of the indemnitor fault,the contractual language on the point must be particularly clear and explicit,and will be construed strictly against the indemnitee.crawford weather shield cal th,d,see also white,supra,cal d at.in this sense,express indemnity allows contracting parties great freedom to allocate indemnification responsibilities as they see fit,and to agree to protections beyond those afforded by the doctrines of implied or equitable indemnity.crawford weather shield,supra,cal th at,d.prince makes no claim that pg e expressly contracted to indemnify her for the type of damages alleged here.
unlike express indemnity,traditional equitable indemnity requires no contractual relationship between an indemnitor and an indemnitee.such indemnity is premised on a joint legal obligation to another for damages,but it does not invariably follow fault.western steamship lines,san pedro peninsula hospital cal th,d,western steamship.although traditional equitable indemnity once operated to shift the entire loss upon the one bound to indemnify,the doctrine is now subject to allocation of fault principles and comparative equitable apportionment of loss.bay development,supra,cal d at,fn,american motorcycle superior court cal d,american motorcycle.
a key restrictive feature of traditional equitable indemnity is that,on matters of substantive law,the doctrine is wholly derivative and subject to whatever immunities or other limitations on liability would otherwise be available against the injured party.western steamship,supra,cal th at,d,children hospital sedgwick th,d children hospital as against the indemnitee,the indemnitor may invoke any substantive defense to liability that is available against the injured party.this rule is often expressed in the shorthand phrase there can be no indemnity without liability.children hospital,supra,th at,d.prince acknowledges she can not recover traditional equitable indemnity because,under section,pg e owed no duty of care to jackson to keep its easement safe for his recreational entry or use.
that leaves implied contractual indemnity as prince sole potential basis for seeking indemnity from pg historically,this type of indemnity was available when two parties in a contractual relationship were both responsible for injuring a third party recovery rested on the theory that a contract under which the indemnitor undertook to do work or perform services necessarily implied an obligation to do the work involved in a proper manner and to discharge foreseeable damages resulting from improper performance absent any participation by the indemnitee in the wrongful act precluding recovery.great western furniture porter d,italics added great western,unified sch.dist.cal.d,unified.now,however,implied contractual indemnity,like traditional equitable indemnity,is subject to comparative equitable apportionment of loss.bay development,supra,cal d at,fn.
pg e argues its immunity under section shields it from liability for implied contractual indemnity.pg e additionally contends there is no basis here for implying a right of contractual indemnity because prince and pg e were not in a contractual relationship with each other and because pg e owed no contractual duty to prince under the easement grant.
we need not resolve pg e latter contentions because,even assuming the existence of a sufficient contractual relationship and duty,pg e immunity from liability to jackson bars prince from recovering implied contractual indemnity in any event.
b.the effect of pg e recreational use immunity 
section provides in pertinent part an owner of any estate or any other interest in real property,whether possessory or nonpossessory,owes no duty of care to keep the premises safe for entry or use by others for any recreational purpose or to give any warning of hazardous conditions,uses of,structures,or activities on such premises to persons entering for such purpose,except as provided in this section,par.by its own terms,however,section does not limit the liability which otherwise exists when there has been a willful or malicious failure to guard or warn against a dangerous condition,use,use,structure,or activity permission to enter the premises was granted in exchange for consideration or the injured person was expressly invited rather than merely permitted to enter the premises,subds.a c.section was enacted to constrain the growing tendency of private landowners to bar public access to their land for recreational uses out of fear of incurring tort liability.hubbard brown cal d.the immunity clearly extends to easement owners,given the statute exceptionally broad and singularly unambiguous definition of protected property interests.miller weitzen th,d finding section protected holders of an encroachment permit see also hubbard brown,supra,cal d at,holder of a permit to graze livestock on federal lands.
for purposes of our analysis,we emphasize the parties do not dispute that pg e owed no duty of care to jackson,who was injured while engaging in a recreational use of pg e easement.nor do they dispute that pg e is therefore immune from liability to jackson under section.however,jackson premises liability action against prince remains pending due to triable issues of material fact regarding the applicability of section express invitation exception to immunity and the existence of a duty of care 
as indicated above,traditional equitable indemnity differs significantly from express contractual indemnity,in that the former is not available in the absence of a joint legal obligation to the injured party.children hospital,supra,th at,d see ante,fn.consequently,as to matters of substantive law one may defend against a traditional equitable indemnity action by relying on whatever immunities or other limitations on liability would otherwise be available against the injured party western steamship,supra,cal th at,d.the principal question for us is whether or not a requirement of a joint legal obligation also applies when implied contractual indemnity is at issue.we conclude the answer is yes,based on the underlying rationale of this common law doctrine and the case law that has developed over the years.
unified,supra,d,the seminal case validating the implied contractual indemnity doctrine in california,makes it abundantly clear the doctrine originated as a means to equitably shift the risk of loss from one joint tortfeasor to another when both were deemed liable to the injured party.in unified,the plaintiff school district had entered a contract with the defendant maintenance company for window washing in certain city schools.the contract required the defendant use of stepladders in washing the windows i n all schools that have hauser window sashes and provided the defendant is held responsible for payment of any and all damages resulting from his operations.id.at.the defendant employee was injured while washing a hauser window at a school,and it was shown that,at the time of the accident,the defendant was not following the contractually mandated stepladder procedure for cleaning a hauser window.ibid.the injured employee successfully sued the school district on the ground it had not provided him with a safe place to work.after satisfying the judgment,the school district sued the defendant for indemnity.the trial court granted a nonsuit,and the court of appeal reversed.id.at.
in determining whether the trial court correctly held,as a matter of law,that the defendant maintenance company was not liable for the damages the plaintiff school district paid to the injured party,the court of appeal started by commenting there was no doubt that the school district and the defendant were joint tortfeasors with respect to the injuries of the defendant employee.unified,supra,d at.the court next observed that the common law rule governing at the time of the accident generally barred any right of contribution between joint tortfeasors.id.at.in assessing whether the case presented any basis for an exception to the rule of noncontribution,the court of appeal sought guidance from american law reports,which contained an annotation on the subject contribution or indemnity between joint where injury to third person results from violation of a duty which one owes to other.unified,at.
according to that annotation,the courts in a few cases have added another exception to the general rule of noncontribution to the effect that where the injury which resulted to a third person,as to whom both of the parties were negligent or guilty of a wrongful act,arose from a violation by the defendant of a duty owing by him to the plaintiff,or that where the defendant was a wrongdoer to the plaintiff but the plaintiff was not a wrongdoer to the defendant,although both were liable to the person injured,the plaintiff may recover contribution or indemnity,as the case may be,from the defendant notwithstanding the fact that his negligence also contributed to the third person injury.citations.unified,supra,d at,italics added.the court of appeal in unified reviewed the cases cited in support of the exception,and quoted one of the decisions reasoning that,even when joint tortfeasors were equally culpable and equally liable to the injured party,as between themselves,the plaintiff seeking indemnity was entitled to rely upon the defendants to discharge the duty because of their contractual relations,and the former could only be deprived of the right of indemnity by proof that it did in fact participate in some manner in the omission,beyond its mere failure to perform the duty imposed on both by the law.id.at,quoting phoenix bridge creem.the other decisions supporting the exception were to the same effect,otis elevator maryland casualty,seaboard air line ry.american district electric protective,so.busch latta paint woermann const,in all cases where one party creates the condition which causes the injury,and the other does not join therein,but is exposed to liability,and suffers damages on account of it,the rule that one of two joint can not maintain an action against the other for indemnity does not apply.accord,weyerhaeuser nacirema,d ryan.finding the reasoning of the foregoing cases quite convincing,the court of appeal found it appropriate to adopt an implied contractual indemnity exception to the common law rule of noncontribution between joint tortfeasors.unified,supra,d at.
decisions subsequent to unified,supra,d,emphasized that implied contractual indemnity and traditional equitable indemnity developed as related exceptions to the rule of noncontribution.in cahill,clementina d,the court of appeal summarized the basic principles of implied indemnity,now commonly referred to as equitable indemnity,as follows.the right to implied indemnity,while relatively recent in the law of california,is now well established.citations.the distilled essence of these cases is that where each of two persons is made responsible by law to an injured party the one to whom the right of indemnity inures is entitled to shift the entire liability for the loss to the other party.accordingly,a right of implied indemnification may arise as a result of contract or equitable considerations.id.at,italics added great western,supra,d at.citing same.as cahill,clementina indicated,however,where the right of implied or equitable indemnity was based on a contractual relationship,it was not necessary to evaluate the primary or secondary liability of those made responsible by the law to the injured party.id.at,italics omitted american motorcycle,supra,cal d at,where no contractual relationship existed,a passively or secondarily negligent tortfeasor could shift its liability completely to a more directly culpable tortfeasor.
significantly,while early decisions appeared to recognize the sometimes vague and imprecise standard of recovery governing equitable indemnity,the restitutionary nature of indemnification clearly emerged as a common thread.western steamship,supra,cal th at,d.that is,t he basis for indemnity is restitution,and the concept that one person is unjustly enriched at the expense of another when the other discharges liability that it should be his responsibility to pay.ibid.
as originally conceived,equitable indemnity was a doctrine that sought to prevent a more culpable tortfeasor from escaping liability altogether when a less culpable tortfeasor was involved.as an rule,however,at times it operated to shift the entire loss to a party who was simply slightly more culpable than another.american motorcycle,supra,cal d at.recognizing this inequity,american motorcycle modified the equitable indemnity rule to permit a concurrent tortfeasor to obtain partial indemnity from other cotortfeasors on a comparative fault basis.id.at.
after american motorcycle,this court emphasized that,although the change from a shifting of loss to an apportionment of damages was a significant development,it did not affect the essential restitutionary character of equitable indemnity.western steamship,supra,cal th at,d.as we shall demonstrate below,the analyses in our motorcycle decisions,consistent with the earlier cases validating and applying the doctrine,support the conclusion that a party may defeat a claim for implied contractual indemnity by relying on an immunity otherwise available against the injured party.
in white,supra,cal d,we recognized that,notwithstanding the three separately identified forms of indemnity,the obligation of indemnity arises only from either of two general sources.id.at.first,it may arise by virtue of express contractual language establishing a duty in one party to save another harmless upon the occurrence of specified circumstances.ibid.second,it may find its source in equitable considerations brought into play either by contractual language not specifically dealing with indemnification or by the equities of the particular case.id.at,italics added.although a claim of implied contractual indemnity was not at issue in white,we relied on the distinction between express contractual indemnity and equitable indemnity to hold that the latter might still apply to apportion responsibility for a loss where an express indemnity agreement between the joint tortfeasors is found inapplicable to the injury.id.at.
relying on the analysis in white,supra,cal d,our decision in bay development,supra,cal d,also distinguished between express contractual indemnity,on the one hand,and the two forms of equitably based indemnity,on the other,and rejected the contention that a claim for implied contractual indemnity should be equated with a claim for express contractual indemnity.id.at.in particular,we observed that equating implied contractual indemnity with express indemnity could,anomalously,accord an indemnitee greater rights than it would have under an express indemnification contract,because in an implied indemnity situation a court could not apply the rules requiring specificity in express indemnification clauses.id.at,see generally crawford weather shield,supra,cal th at,d,contract language must be particularly clear and explicit to afford protection beyond that available under doctrines of implied or equitable indemnity,indemnification regardless of the indemnitor fault white,supra,cal d at.
that consideration,as well as our observation that equitable considerations have always played an integral role in defining the scope of the implied contractual indemnity doctrine bay development,supra,at,fn,supported our conclusion that a claim for implied contractual indemnity is a form of equitable indemnity subject to the rules governing equitable indemnity claims id.at,fn.omitted.in particular,we recognized that an implied contractual indemnity claim,like a traditional equitable indemnity claim,is subject to the american motorcycle rule that a party liability for equitable indemnity is based on its proportional share of responsibility for the damages to the injured party.bay development,supra,cal d at.
based on the foregoing,we ultimately held in bay development that,notwithstanding a different rule for express indemnity claims,an implied contractual indemnity claim may not be pursued against a party who has entered into a good faith settlement pursuant to code of civil procedure section,subdivision c bay development,supra,cal d at,peck contractors superior court d.thus,in evaluating a settling defendant potential proportionate liability to the injured party for purposes of the good faith settlement determination,the trial court must take into account any contractual relationship between the settling and nonsettling defendants,and must consider how each party performance of its contractual obligations relates to its share of liability.bay development,supra,cal d at,italics added.
guided by the rationale driving the doctrine and the logical force and consistency of the analyses in unified,supra,d,white,supra,cal d,and bay development,supra,cal d,we conclude that implied contractual indemnity has always been subject to the rule that there can be no indemnity without liability.children hospital,supra,th at,d.application of this rule here compels the conclusion that pg e immunity from liability to jackson under section bars prince from recovering on an implied contractual indemnity theory.
the court of appeal below relied on bear creek planning com.title ins.trust d.to find that joint liability is not required because the implied contractual indemnity doctrine is grounded upon the indemnitor failure to properly perform contractual duties owed to the indemnitee.as the court of appeal acknowledged,however,bay development disapproved bear creek to the extent it erroneously assumed that a claim for implied contractual indemnity is not a form of equitable indemnity and is not subject to comparative indemnity principles.see bay development,supra,cal d at fn.furthermore,while bear creek correctly observed that the implied contractual indemnity doctrine is grounded upon the indemnitor failure to properly perform contractual duties owed to the indemnitee,the decision was flawed to the extent it viewed the doctrine as akin or analogous to express contractual indemnity.express indemnity has never required joint liability,and as indicated,equating the two doctrines would lead to anomalous results.bay development,supra,cal d at.
more importantly,bear creek failed to appreciate that implied contractual indemnity is and always has been restitutionary in nature,meaning it is intended to address the situation where one person is unjustly enriched at the expense of another when the other discharges liability that it should be his responsibility to pay.western steamship,supra,cal th at,d.indeed,our recognition that a claim for implied contractual indemnity is a form of equitable indemnity subject to the rules governing equitable indemnity claims bay development,supra,cal d at,fn.omitted corrects any misimpression that joint liability is not a component of such claims 
prince relies on unified,supra,d,ryan,supra,and weyerhaeuser nacirema,supra,d,to argue that implied contractual indemnity is properly available even when the alleged indemnitor is immune from direct liability to the injured party.in those cases,the courts either held or recognized that a worker compensation law did not preclude an entity from seeking implied contractual indemnity from a contractor for damages paid to an injured party,where the contractor was also the employer of the injured party.unified,supra,d at,workmen compensation act ryan,supra,at.longshoremen and harbor workers compensation act see weyerhaeuser nacirema,supra,d following ryan.we are not convinced.
as pg e points out,the compensation laws in those cases were not comparable to section and the recreational use immunity it affords.under section,an easement holder owes no duty of care to keep the premises safe for entry or use by others for any recreational purpose.because pg e owed no such duty to jackson,there is no question that pg e is immune from liability to jackson.by contrast,the compensation laws did not operate to shield the employers from liability to their injured employees or otherwise negate any duty of care owing from employers to employees.to the contrary,those laws reflected compensation bargains,pursuant to which employers were held to assume liability for all industrial injuries,regardless of fault,in exchange for a limitation on the amount of that liability in light of the obvious differences between section and the compensation laws,as well as the balance of the legal analysis appearing in unified,supra,d at pages,these cases are not persuasive authority for disregarding the rule.
prince asserts that another decision,great western,supra,d,directly supports her position that the indemnitor could be liable as a matter of contract even if it had been exonerated in a tort action by the injured person.great western involved an assault on a victim nizuk by an employee gorges of a thrift club that was managed and supervised by the indemnitor porter but located within a furniture store owned by the indemnitee great western.in a previous action,nizuk had sued porter and great western,but porter obtained a summary judgment and a dismissal while great western eventually settled the action during the trial.great western then successfully sued porter for implied contractual indemnity after demonstrating that,pursuant to a contract between the two of them,porter,not great western,had complete charge of the entire thrift club operation,including the employment,management,and supervision of all its personnel,including gorges.great western,supra,d at.
prince reliance on great western is misplaced.first,the decision made clear that porter successful defense of nizuk action was not res judicata on the issue of liability in the great western indemnity action.great western,supra,d at.second,it observed that nizuk had failed to even assert the basis of liability against porter that great western relied on in the indemnity action,and arguably suggested that,had nizuk done so,he might have prevailed.id.at.thus,the issue of the indemnitor liability was litigated and resolved against the indemnitor in the great western indemnity action,while here it is conceded that the alleged indemnitor pg e had no duty or liability to the injured party jackson.great western presents no parallel to this case.
finally,prince contends equitable considerations support her claim for implied contractual indemnity because the extraordinary hazard of electricity emphasizes the need to give utilities strong incentive to maintain easements in safe condition,the typical liability limits of homeowners insurance of typical servient tenement owners are unlikely to compensate the injured person,and the public benefits of electric power counsel that the rate paying public should pay for both public safety and injured persons compensation through power rates.although equitable considerations are properly considered when assessing the awarding of indemnity in individual cases,at least two of the identified concerns essentially amount to policy arguments for excluding utilities from the protective scope of section,and are more appropriately directed to the legislature in any event,prince indemnity claim fails because she can not make the required showing that pg e bears some legal responsibility for jackson injuries.
in sum,we conclude,as a matter of law,that pg e immunity under section bars prince claim for implied contractual indemnity.contrary to prince assertions,there is nothing inequitable about this outcome.it is undisputed that prince,like pg e,may defend against jackson suit by claiming the benefit of the recreational use immunity provided in section.in fact,prince herself relies on section as an affirmative defense,and the only reason jackson case against her remains pending is that a disputed issue of material fact exists as to whether prince expressly invited jackson onto her property,so as to trigger a statutorily listed exception to immunity.see,subd.c.if that issue is ultimately resolved in jackson favor,then there is no question that prince ability to claim the statutory immunity,and to avoid the damages for which she seeks indemnity,her costs in defending the action and her potential liability for jackson damages,will have been defeated by her own conduct.under these circumstances,considerations of equity and fairness fail to support prince unilateral efforts to partially or completely shift responsibility for her loss to pg e,which did nothing to except either prince or itself from the statutory immunity.
that prince has no recourse for indemnification against pg e does not contravene the equitable premise of the indemnity doctrine.as we have recognized,i nevitably,whenever one concurrent tortfeasor is insolvent or immunized,either partially or completely,from liability,the remaining tortfeasors must pay more than an amount measured by their proportional responsibility for the injury.citations.citation.such are the realities,if not the vagaries,of litigation.western steamship,supra,cal th at,d.
disposition 
we reverse the judgment of the court of appeal,and direct that court to enter judgment in favor of pg 
i concur in the majority opinion.i write separately to address what i perceive to be a general misperception about the nature of implied contractual indemnity and to express my belief that irrespective of its nature,the doctrine no longer exists in california.
as the majority observes,implied contractual indemnity and equitable indemnity developed as related exceptions to the rule of noncontribution existing in this state before american motorcycle superior court cal d,ante,d at,at.equitable indemnity rests on the concept that one person is unjustly enriched at the expense of another when the other discharges liability that it should be his responsibility to pay.western steamship lines,san pedro peninsula hospital cal th,d.for that
