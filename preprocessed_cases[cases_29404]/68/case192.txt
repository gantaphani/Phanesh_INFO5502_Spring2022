petitioners,the people of the state of california through their attorney general kamala harris,the california public utilities commission,pacific gas electric company,and southern california edison the california parties,seek review of a series of orders issued by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc or the commission on remand following our decision in california ex rel.lockyer ferc lockyer,cir.there,we held that ferc may authorize energy tariffs,so long as that regulatory framework incorporates both an ex ante market power analysis and enforceable transaction reporting.id.at.we remanded the case because ferc had not appropriately implemented the tariff.id.at.
in this case,the california parties petition for review of ferc actions after our remand,claiming that ferc failed to follow lockyer and violated the federal power act fpa by requiring proof of excessive market share as a necessary condition for relief for transaction reporting violations.
we conclude that ferc structured the remand proceedings in a manner contrary to the terms of our lockyer decision.enforceable transaction reporting is a necessary ingredient of a lawful tariff.id.by insisting on proof of market concentration under its test as a precondition to any relief for reporting deficiencies,ferc omitted a necessary component of the tariff approved in lockyer.reliance on the market share measure alone immunizes sellers from any consequence for failure to report market transactions and ignores the agency statutory charge under of the fpa to determine whether sellers charged a just and reasonable rate.a.we therefore grant the petition for judicial review and remand to the agency for further proceedings.
the essence of the california parties complaint is presented in some detail at the outset of our lockyer decision.see at.a summary of our lockyer decision and an exposition of events that transpired before ferc on remand follows.
in lockyer,we denied the california parties facial challenge to ratemaking.id.at.we held that the agency segmented approach,which requires an ex ante finding of an absence of market power coupled with regular transaction reports,does not per se violate the fpa.id.at.however,we granted the california parties challenge,holding that ferc enforcement and review of rates during the california energy crisis was unlawful.id.at.we held that ferc abdicated its regulatory responsibility by summarily dismissing electricity wholesalers failure to comply with reporting requirements.id.at.b ecause the reporting requirements are an integral part of a tariff that pass es legal muster,ferc can not dismiss the requirements as mere punctilio.id.at.we remanded to ferc to reconsider the california parties claim for a refund of the amount sellers charged in excess of just and reasonable rates during the crisis.id.at.
on remand,ferc ordered 
a hearing before an alj to make findings of fact regarding whether,based on the facts and circumstances associated with each individual seller,that seller improper or untimely filing of its quarterly transaction reports masked an accumulation of market power such that the market rates were unjust and unreasonable,during the relevant period 
california ex rel.lockyer power exch,order,ferc.ferc defined the threshold issue for the alj proceeding as whether sellers accumulated market power and set parameters for the alj to use in conducting that inquiry.id.at.specifically,ferc limited the market power assessment to whether a seller,under the test,did or did not gain an increased generation market share sufficient to give it the ability to exercise market power and cause rates to be unjust and unreasonable as a result.id.at.other claims of tariff violations,such as gaming and anomalous bidding behavior,were off the table.id.at.the commission reserved determination of the remedy for violations by each particular seller,if any.id.at.
the california parties urged ferc to reconsider its definition of the objective of the alj proceeding,claiming that the commission decision to focus on identifying sellers market power based on market share levels stood contrary to the fpa,our remand instructions in lockyer,and agency precedent.see,order,ferc.the state claimed that ferc initial order on remand unjustifiably collapsed the approach approved in lockyer by conflating the ex ante market power determination and the ex post reporting requirement.id.it identified ferc decisions holding that the purpose of rate quarterly transaction reporting is to meet the filed rate requirements of the fpa,evaluate the reasonableness of rates,and monitor sellers market power on an ongoing basis.id.furthermore,the california parties argued that the test prescribed by the agency was an inadequate screen for market power.id.
ferc denied rehearing.id.the commission declared the state claims an impermissible collateral attack on the market power analysis ferc used at the time of the transactions and explained that the purpose of quarterly reports is not to the commission market power screens,but rather to monitor and evaluate market concentration on an ongoing basis.id.at.ferc rejected the state suggestion that the test was an inappropriate screen for market power,claiming that it must use only those standards in effect at the time of the reviewed transactions.id.at.
the california parties also argued that ferc erred in its march,order by excluding evidence of other tariff violations and market manipulation from the alj proceeding.id.at.the california parties sought to introduce evidence of alternative analyses of market power and market function,based on information presented in sellers reports,to show a nexus between deficient reporting,market function,and market power.id.ferc denied rehearing on this issue because other potential seller misconduct,such as gaming and anomalous bidding,was the subject of another proceeding before the agency,which it determined should remain distinct and separate.id.
shortly thereafter,the california parties again requested rehearing regarding the evidentiary basis for its reporting allegations,order,ferc.the california parties again sought to introduce evidence of market manipulation and tariff violations,explaining that these concerns were not adequately addressed by other proceedings before ferc.id.ferc denied the request as an impermissible request for rehearing of an order denying rehearing.id.the commission also reasoned that the california parties argument about the scope of evidence in the remand proceeding was incongruous with evidence of deficient reporting presented in the original complaint.id.at.the commission definitively limited the allegations to be considered in the alj proceedings to the california parties reporting and market power claims,not allegations of market manipulation or other measures of market power.id.
after briefing and submission of written testimony,but without hearing argument,the alj granted sellers motions for summary disposition in an initial decision issued march.ferc.after crediting the california parties evidence of reporting violations,the alj ruled in the sellers favor because the state did not demonstrate that sellers accumulated market power under the test.id.at.the alj reasoned that a bsent a showing by the california parties in their direct testimony that each seller possessed generation market power under the commission test,no material factual issues remain for hearing on the central issue in this proceeding.id.at.the alj set aside the california parties seller misconduct and alternative market power analyses as outside the scope of the proceeding and contrary to sellers due process right to notice.id.at.
in a may,order,the commission affirmed the alj decision.ferc.the commission rested on its previous rulings on the california parties exceptions and objections.id.at.ferc reasoned,g iven that the issue of whether suppliers accumulated market power was the threshold issue in this proceeding,and given the california parties failure to offer any evidence to demonstrate the accumulation of market power under the standard,summary disposition was appropriate.id.at.the commission later deni
