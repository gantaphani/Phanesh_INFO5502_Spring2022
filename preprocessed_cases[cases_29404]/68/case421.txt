advanced communications corporation acc appeals from an order of the federal communications commission fcc denying the company petition to reopen the record in a proceeding closed nearly a decade ago.because we conclude that the commission did not abuse its discretion in declining to reopen,we affirm the decision below.
the history of the commission earlier acc proceeding is set forth in detail in our previous opinion involving this dispute,and we therefore provide only the necessary background here.see advanced communications fcc,wl.may,unpublished table decision advanced i.
in,the fcc awarded acc a conditional construction permit to provide direct broadcast satellite dbs service.in the interest of ensur ing the prompt use of dbs spectrum resources,id.at,fcc rules required acc to satisfy two due diligence requirements applicable to all dbs permittees.first,acc had to begin construction or complete contracting for construction within one year of receiving the permit.id.quoting b.second,acc had to commence operating its system within six years of receiving the construction permit.id.the company fulfilled the first requirement,and in it was assigned channels at two orbital locations.despite a extension,however,acc failed to meet the second requirement.in april,the fcc international bureau denied acc request for a second extension to construct,launch,and operate a dbs system,and it cancelled acc construction permit.
on october,the commission affirmed the denial of the extension and the cancellation of acc permit.in re advanced communications,fcc rcd,wl hereinafter order.commissioners quello and barrett dissented.id.at.in a notice of proposed rulemaking published shortly thereafter,the commission proposed to reassign the reclaimed channels and orbital locations hereinafter collectively referred to as spectrum by auction.in the matter of revision of rules and policies for the direct broadcast satellite service,fcc rcd,wl.commissioner barrett again dissented.id.at.the proposal was ultimately adopted,and mci communications and echostar communications won the subsequent auction for a total price of more than million.mci later assigned its spectrum to echostar,which currently provides dbs service to millions of customers nationwide.
acc appealed the order to this court,making three arguments the fcc decision constituted an arbitrary departure from the agency precedents the fcc failed to provide a reasoned explanation for its decision and in deciding to deny acc requested extension,the fcc improperly considered the revenues that would be gained from the auction of acc spectrum.advanced i,wl,at.the last argument,of particular importance here,was based on a claim that consideration of revenues by the fcc would violate section j a of the communications act,which provides 
in making a decision pursuant to section c of this title to assign a band of frequencies to a use for which licenses or permits will be issued pursuant to this subsection,the commission may not base a finding of public interest,convenience,and necessity on the expectation of federal revenues from the use of a system of competitive bidding under this subsection.
on may,this court rejected acc appeal.we concluded that the fcc decision was consistent with its precedents,and that it included a reasoned explanation for the disposition.advanced i,wl,at.we also found that,w hile the commission was aware that substantial sums could be realized from the sale of any orbital slots and channels recovered from acc,the order d id not base its denial of acc renewal application on the expectation of such revenues.id.at internal citation omitted.rather,we said,the commission decision was predicated on acc failure to achieve any concrete progress toward the actual construction of its dbs system during its first extension period.id.internal quotation marks omitted.and we concluded that acc had pointed to nothing in the record that is sufficient to overcome the strong presumption of agency regularity.id.in light of that conclusion,we found it unnecessary to decide whether the commission was in fact barred by law from taking into account the expected impact on federal revenues.id.
acc continued to pursue its case in other fora.in,acc sued mci in arkansas federal court,alleging tortious interference with contract and again claiming that the fcc had denied acc request for an extension because of the revenues that an auction would bring.the district court held that advanced i collaterally estopped acc from relitigating the revenues issue,advanced communications mci communications,d,and the eighth circuit affirmed,cir.in october,acc petitioned this court for a writ of mandamus directing the fcc to invalidate the order in light of two affidavits that it had recently obtained from by then former commissioners barrett and quello.we denied the petition,declaring that it provided no justification for the extraordinary remedy of mandamus.in re advanced communications,wl,at.
in april,advanced petitioned the commission to reopen the record for further proceedings based on what it contended was new evidence that the order had been the product of improper considerations.the new evidence consisted of the aforementioned affidavits by the two commissioners who had dissented from the order.the identically worded affidavits,signed in october,declared the affiants view that at least one of the commissioners in the majority based his or her decision in the advanced order on the expectation of federal revenues that would result from the reassignment by auction of the channels and orbital locations previously assigned to acc.affidavit of james quello affidavit of andrew barrett.the fcc denied acc petition to reopen the record,concluding that the new evidence that advanced submits is nothing more than another attempt to the issue that it has presented in numerous prior court proceedings.advanced communications,fcc rcd,wl hereinafter order.the affidavits,the fcc said,failed to meet the strong showing of sufficiency of evidence required to overcome the public interest in orderly and final agency action.id.at.
before proceeding to the merits,we must say a few words about the standards of review applied by this court and the fcc.
a petition seeking review of an agency decision not to reopen a proceeding is not reviewable unless the petition is based upon new evidence or changed circumstances.southwestern bell.fcc.where,as in this case,the petition is based on a claim of new evidence,we do have jurisdiction to review,but we may reverse only upon a showing of the clearest abuse of discretion.interstate commerce comm brotherhood of locomotive eng rs,d internal quotation marks omitted.
additional considerations further confirm the need for a deferential standard of review.where,as here,the petition for reopening comes not before judicial review but after,and not immediately after but long after,we are loathe to overturn settled expectations.see greater boston television fcc,noting that investments may be made in reliance on such an order,and that at some point the public interest in finality is dominant over the public interest in possibly improving the administrative result on further consideration.moreover,where,as here,the petition seeks an inquiry into the motives of decisionmakers whose decision is reflected in official findings,there must be a strong showing of bad faith or improper behavior before a court will permit such an inquiry.citizens to preserve overton park,volpe,d see checkosky sec,declaring that a gency opinions,like judicial opinions,speak for themselves see also plmrs narrowband fcc,san luis obispo mothers for peace nrc,
the fcc own standard for reopening a closed proceeding reflects many of these same considerations.as the fcc explained,u nder ordinary circumstances,an applicant seeking to reopen a proceeding after the close of the record must show 
that it relies on new or newly discovered evidence that could not,through the exercise of due diligence,have been discovered earlier that the new evidence,if proven,would raise a substantial and material question of fact affecting the ultimate outcome of the proceedin
