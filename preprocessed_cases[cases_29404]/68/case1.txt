for decades,indianapolis city funded sewer projects using indiana barrett law,which permitted cities to apportion a public improvement project costs equally among all abutting lots.under that system,a city would create an initial assessment,dividing the total estimated cost by the number of lots and making any necessary adjustments.upon a project completion,the city would issue a final assessment.lot owners could elect to pay the assessment in a lump sum or over time in installments.
after the city completed the sanitary sewers project,it sent affected homeowners formal notice of their payment obligations.of the affected homeowners,elected to pay the lump sum.the following year,the city abandoned barrett law financing and adopted the septic tank elimination program step,which financed projects in part through bonds,thereby lowering individual owner costs.in implementing step,the city board of public works enacted a resolution forgiving all assessment amounts still owed pursuant to barrett law financing.homeowners who had paid the project lump sum received no refund,while homeowners who had elected to pay in installments were under no obligation to make further payments.
the homeowners who paid the lump sum asked the city for a refund,but the city denied the request.of these homeowners brought suit in indiana state court claiming,in relevant part,that the city refusal violated the federal equal protection clause.the trial court granted summary judgment to the homeowners,and the state court of appeals affirmed.the indiana supreme court reversed,holding that the city distinction between those who had already paid and those who had not was rationally related to its legitimate interests in reducing administrative costs,providing financial hardship relief to homeowners,transitioning from the barrett law system to step,and preserving its limited resources.
held the city had a rational basis for its distinction and thus did not violate the equal protection clause.
a the city classification does not involve a fundamental right or suspect classification.see heller doe.its subject matter is local,economic,social,and commercial.see united states carolene products.it is a tax classification.see regan taxation with representation of.and no one claims that the city has discriminated against commerce or new residents.hooper bernalillo county assessor.hence,the city distinction does not violate the equal protection clause as long as there is any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification,fcc beach communications,and the burden is on the one attacking the classification to negative every conceivable basis which might support it,heller,supra,at.
b administrative concerns can ordinarily justify a distinction,see,carmichael southern coal coke,and the city decision to stop collecting outstanding barrett law debts finds rational support in the city administrative concerns.after the city switched to the step system,any decision to continue barrett law debt collection could have proved complex and expensive.it would have meant maintaining an administrative system for years to come to collect debts arising out of different construction projects built over the course of a decade,involving monthly payments as low as per household,with the possible need to maintain credibility by tracking down defaulting debtors and bringing legal action.the rationality of the city distinction draws further support from the nature of the choices that confronted it.to have added refunds to forgiveness would have meant adding further administrative costs,namely the cost of processing refunds.and limiting refunds only to homeowners would have led to complaints of unfairness,while expanding refunds to the apparently thousands of other barrett law project homeowners would have involved an even greater administrative burden.finally,the rationality of the distinction draws support from the fact that the line that the city drew distinguishing past payments from future obligations is well known to the law.see,a e.
c petitioners contrary arguments are unpersuasive.whether financial hardship is a factor supporting rationality need not be considered here,since the city administrative concerns are sufficient to show a rational basis for its distinction.petitioners propose other forgiveness systems that they argue are superior to the city system,but the constitution only requires that the line actually drawn by the city be rational.petitioners further argue that administrative considerations alone should not justify a tax distinction lest a city justify an unfair system through insubstantial administrative considerations.here it was rational for the city to draw a line that avoided the administrative burden of both collecting and paying out small sums for years to come.petitioners have not shown that the administrative concerns are too insubstantial to justify the classification.finally,petitioners argue that precedent makes it more difficult for the city to show a rational basis,but the cases to which they refer involve discrimination based on residence or length of residence.the one exception,allegheny pittsburgh coal commission of webster,is distinguishable.

on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of indiana 
justice breyer delivered the opinion of the court.
for many years,an indiana statute,the barrett law,authorized indiana cities to impose upon benefited lot owners the cost of sewer improvement projects.the law also permitted those lot owners to pay either immediately in the form of a lump sum or over time in installments.in,the city of indianapolis city adopted a new assessment and payment method,the step plan,and it forgave any barrett law installments that lot owners had not yet paid.
a group of lot owners who had already paid their entire barrett law assessment in a lump sum believe that the city should have provided them with equivalent refunds.and we must decide whether the city refusal to do so unconstitutionally discriminates against them in violation of the equal protection clause,amdt.we hold that the city had a rational basis for distinguishing between those lot owners who had already paid their share of project costs and those who had not.and we conclude that there is no equal protection violation.
beginning in indiana barrett law permitted cities to pay for public improvements,such as sewage projects,by apportion ing the costs of a project equally among all abutting lands or lots.code b see town council of new harmony parker,project beneficiaries pay its costs.when a city built a barrett law project,the city public works board would create an initial assessment by dividing the estimated total cost of the sewage works by the total number of lots.a.it might then adjust an individual assessment downward if the lot would benefit less than would others.b.upon completion of the project,the board would issue a final assessment.
the law permitted lot owners to pay the assessment either in a single lump sum or over time in installment payments with interest.the city would collect installment payments in the same manner as other taxes.the law authorized,or installment plans.a.until fully paid,an assessment would constitute a lien against the property,permitting the city to initiate foreclosure proceedings in case of a default.b.
for several decades,indianapolis used the barrett law system to fund sewer projects.see,conley brummit.app,in banc.but in,the city adopted a new system,called the septic tank elimination program step,which financed projects in part through bonds,thereby lowering individual lot owners costs.by that time,the city had constructed more than barrett law projects.app.to pet.for cert.we are told that lot owners still owed money in respect to of those projects.see reply brief for petitioners,citing city response to plaintiff brief on damages,record in cox indianapolis,sd,doc.exh.a.in respect to of the,some installment payments had not yet fallen due in respect to the other,those who owed money were in default.reply brief for petitioners.
this case concerns one of the barrett law projects,namely the sanitary sewers project.the project began in.it connected about homes to the city sewage system.construction was completed in.the indianapolis board of public works held an assessment hearing in june.and in july the board sent the affected homeowners a formal notice of their payment obligations.
the notice made clear that each homeowner could pay the entire assessment per property in a lump sum or in installments,which would include interest at a annual rate.under an installment plan,payments would amount to per month for years per month for years or per month for years.in the event,homeowners chose to pay up front chose the plan chose the plan and chose the plan.and in the first year each homeowner paid the amount due upfront under the plan under the plan,or under the plan.app.to pet.for cert.
the next year,however,the city decided to abandon the barrett law method of financing.it thought that the barrett law payments had become too burdensome for many homeowners to pay,discouraging changes from less healthy septic tanks to healthier sewer systems.see,at.for example,homes helped by the project,at a cost of more than each,were then valued at to.app.the city new step method of financing would charge each connecting lot owner a flat fee and make up the difference by floating bonds eventually paid for by all lot owners citywide.see app.to pet.for cert.
on october,the city enacted an ordinance implementing its decision.in december,the city board of public works enacted a further resolution,resolution,which,as part of the transition,would forgive all assessment amounts established pursuant to the barrett law funding for municipal sewer programs due and owing from the date of november,forward.app.emphasis added.in its preamble,the resolution said that the barrett law may present financial hardships on many middle to lower income participants who most need sanitary sewer service in lieu of failing septic systems it pointed out that the city was transitioning to the new step method of financing and it said that the step method was based upon a financial model that had considered the current assessments being made by participants in active barrett law projects as well as future projects,at.the upshot was that those who still owed barrett law assessments would not have to make further payments but those who had already paid their assessments would not receive refunds.this meant that homeowners who had paid the full brisbane manning project assessment in a lump sum the preceding year would receive no refund,while homeowners who had elected to pay the assessment in installments,and had paid a total of,or,would be under no obligation to make further payments.
in february,the homeowners who had paid the full project assessment asked the city for a partial refund in an amount equal to the smallest forgiven installment debt,apparently.the city denied the request in part because r efunding payments made in your project area,or any portion of the payments,would establish a precedent of unfair and inequitable treatment to all other property owners who have also paid barrett law assessments and while the november,cutoff date might seem arbitrary to you,it is essential for the city to establish this date and move forward with the new funding approach.at.
of the project homeowners brought this lawsuit in indiana state court seeking a refund of about each.they claimed in relevant part that the city refusal to provide them with refunds at the same time that the city forgave the outstanding project debts of other homeowners violated the federal constitution equal protection clause,amdt,see also stat.the trial court granted summary judgment in their favor.the state court of appeals affirmed that judgment.but the indiana supreme court reversed.in its view,the city distinction between those who had already paid their barrett law assessments and those who had not was rationally related to its legitimate interests in reducing its administrative costs,providing relief for property owners experiencing financial hardship,establishing a clear transition from the barrett law to step,and preserving its limited resources.app.to pet.for cert.we granted certiorari to consider the equal protection question.and we now affirm the indiana supreme court.
as long as the city distinction has a rational basis,that distinction does not violate the equal protection clause.this court has long held that a classification neither involving fundamental rights nor proceeding along suspect lines can not run afoul of the equal protection clause if there is a rational relationship between the disparity of treatment and some legitimate governmental purpose.heller doe,gulf,ellis.we have made clear in analogous contexts that,where ordinary commercial transactions are at issue,rational basis review requires deference to reasonable underlying legislative judgments.united states carolene products,due process see also new orleans dukes,per curiam equal protection.and we have repeatedly pointed out that l egislatures have especially broad latitude in creating classifications and distinctions in tax statutes.regan taxation with representation of,see also fitzgerald racing of central iowa,nordlinger hahn,lehnhausen lake shore auto parts,madden kentucky,citizens telephone of grand rapids fuller.
indianapolis classification involves neither a fundamental right nor a suspect classification.its subject matter is local,economic,social,and commercial.it is a tax classification.and no one here claims that indianapolis has discriminated against commerce or new residents.hooper bernalillo county assessor,williams vermont,metropolitan life ins.ward,zobel williams.hence,this case falls directly within the scope of our precedents holding such a law constitutionally valid if there is a plausible policy reason for the classification,the legislative facts on which the classification is apparently based rationally may have been considered to be true by the governmental decisionmaker,and the relationship of the classification to its goal is not so attenuated as to render the distinction arbitrary or irrational.nordlinger,supra,at citations omitted.and it falls within the scope of our precedents holding that there is such a plausible reason if there is any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification.fcc beach communications,see also lindsley natural carbonic gas.
moreover,analogous precedent warns us that we are not to pronounc e this classification unconstitutional unless in the light of the facts made known or generally assumed it is of such a character as to preclude the assumption that it rests upon some rational basis within the knowledge and experience of the legislators.carolene products,supra,at due process claim.further,because the classification is presumed constitutional,the burden is on the one attacking the legislative arrangement to negative every conceivable basis which might support it.heller,supra,at quoting lehnhausen,supra,at.
in our view,indianapolis classification has a rational basis.ordinarily,administrative considerations can justify a distinction.see,carmichael southern coal coke,tax exemption for businesses with fewer than eight employees rational in light of the a dministrative convenience and expense involved see also lehnhausen,supra,at comparing administrative cost of taxing corporations versus individuals madden,supra,at comparing administrative cost of taxing deposits in local banks versus those elsewhere.and the city decision to stop collecting outstanding barrett law debts finds rational support in related administrative concerns.
the city had decided to switch to the step system.after that change,to continue barrett law collection could have proved complex and expensive.it would have meant maintaining an administrative system that for years to come would have had to collect debts arising out of different construction projects built over the course of a decade,involving monthly payments as low as per household,with the possible need to maintain credibility by tracking down defaulting debtors and bringing legal action.the city,for example,would have had to maintain its barrett law operation within the city controller office,keep files on old,small,debts,and a city official says possibly spend hundreds of thousands of dollars keeping computerized systems current.see brief for international management association et as amici curiae,citing affidavit of charles white,record in cox,doc.unlike the collection system prior to abandonment,the city would not have added any new barrett law debtors.and that fact means that it would have had to spread the fixed administrative costs of collection over an number of debtors,thereby continuously increasing the cost of collection.
consistent with these facts,the director of the city department of public works later explained that the city decided to forgive outstanding debt in part because t he administrative costs to service and process remaining balances on barrett law accounts long past the transition to the step program would not benefit the taxpayers and would defeat the purpose of the transition.app.the four other members of the city board of public works have said the same.see affidavit of gregory taylor,record in cox,doc.affidavit of kipper tew,ibid.doc.affidavit of susan schalk,ibid.doc.affidavit of roger brown,ibid.doc.
the rationality of the city distinction draws further support from the nature of the choices that confronted it.to have added refunds to forgiveness would have meant adding yet further administrative costs,namely the cost of processing refunds.at the same time,to have tried to limit the city costs and lost revenues by limiting forgiveness or refund rules to homeowners alone would have led those involved in other barrett law projects to have justifiably complained about unfairness.yet to have granted refunds as well as providing forgiveness to all those involved in all barrett law projects there were more than projects or in all open projects there were more than would have involved even greater administrative burden.the city could not just cut checks,post,at roberts,dissenting,without taking funding from other programs or finding additional revenue.if,instead,the city had tried to keep the amount of revenue it lost constant a rational goal but spread it evenly among the apparently thousands of homeowners involved in any of the barrett laws projects,the result would have been yet smaller individual payments,even more likely to have been too small to justify the administrative expense.
finally,the rationality of the distinction draws support from the fact that the line that the city drew distinguishing past payments from future obligations is a line well known to the law.sometimes such a line takes the form of an amnesty program,involving,say,mortgage payments,taxes,or parking tickets,a e,supp.iv federal income tax provision allowing homeowners to omit from gross income newly forgiven home mortgage debt united states martin,tax amnesty program whereby state newly forgave penalties and liabilities if taxpayer satisfied debt horn chicago,city parking ticket amnesty program whereby outstanding tickets could be newly settled for a fraction of amount specified.this kind of line is consistent with the distinction that the law often makes between actions previously taken and those yet to come.
petitioners contrary arguments are not sufficient to change our conclusion.petitioners point out that the indiana supreme court also listed a different consideration,namely financial hardship,as one of the factors supporting rationality.app.to pet.for cert.they refer to the city resolution that said that the barrett law may present financial hardships on many middle to lower income participants who most need sanitary sewer service in lieu of failing septic systems.app.and they argue that the tax distinction before us would not necessarily favor homeowners.
we need not consider this argument,however,for the administrative considerations we have mentioned are sufficient to show a rational basis for the city distinction.the indiana supreme court wrote that the city classification was rationally related in part to its legitimate interests in reducing its administrative costs.app.to pet.for cert.emphasis added.the record of the city proceedings is consistent with that determination.see app.when developing transition,the city considered the current assessments being made by participants in active barrett law projects in any event,a legislature need not actually articulate at any time the purpose or rationale supporting its classification.nordlinger,at see also fitzgerald,at similar.rather,the burden is on the one attacking the legislative arrangement to negative every conceivable basis which might support it.madden,at see heller,at same lehnhausen,at same see also allied stores of ohio,bowers,upholding state tax classification resting upon a state of facts that reasonably can be conceived as creating a rational distinction.petitioners have not negative d the indiana supreme court first listed justification,namely the administrative concerns we have discussed.
petitioners go on to propose various other forgiveness systems that would have included refunds for at least some of those who had already paid in full.they argue that those systems are superior to the system that the city chose.we have discussed those,and other possible,systems earlier.supra,at.each has advantages and disadvantages.but even if petitioners have found a superior system,the constitution does not require the city to draw the perfect line nor even to draw a line superior to some other line it might have drawn.it requires only that the line actually drawn be a rational line.and for the reasons we have set forth in part,supra,we believe that the line the city drew here is rational.
petitioners further argue that administrative considerations alone should not justify a tax distinction,lest a city arbitrarily allocate taxes among a few citizens while forgiving many similarly situated citizens on the ground that it is cheaper and easier to collect taxes from a few people than from many.brief for petitioners.petitioners are right that administrative considerations could not justify such an unfair system.but that is not because administrative considerations can never justify tax differences any more than they can always do so.the question is whether reducing those expenses,in the particular circumstances,provides a rational basis justifying the tax difference in question.
in this case,in the light of the facts made known or generally assumed,carolene products,at,it is reasonable to believe that to graft a refund system onto the city forgiveness decision could have for example imposed an administrative burden of both collecting and paying out small sums say,per month for years.as we have said,supra,at,it is rational for the city to draw a line that avoids that burden.petitioners,who are the ones attacking the legislative arrangement,have the burden of showing that the circumstances are otherwise,that the administrative burden is too insubstantial to justify the classification.that they have not done.
finally,petitioners point to precedent that in their view makes it more difficult than we have said for the city to show a rational basis.with but one exception,however,the cases to which they refer involve discrimination based on residence or length of residence,hooper bernalillo county assessor,state tax preference distinguishing between and resident veterans williams vermont,state use tax that burdened car buyers who moved metropolitan life ins.ward,state law that taxed insurance companies a
