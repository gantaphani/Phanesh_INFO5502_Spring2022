opinion for the court filed by circuit judge dyk.
dissenting opinion filed by circuit judge newman.
pacific gas and electric company,southern california edison company,san diego gas electric company,and the state of california collectively,appellants,brought suit against the united states claiming that two federal government agencies selling electricity the western area power administration and the bonneville power administration collectively,the government overcharged appellants for electricity.
the united states court of federal claims the claims court dismissed their breach of contract action for lack of standing.appellants appeal.we conclude that appellants lack privity of contract or any other relationship with the government that would confer standing.because appellants lack standing,we affirm.this does not,however,suggest that appellants were without a remedy for the alleged overcharges against the parties with whom they are in contractual privity two california electricity exchanges or that the exchanges lacked a breach of contract remedy for overcharges against the government agencies that sold them electric power.
background 
under the tucker act,the claims court has jurisdiction over contract cases in which the government is a party.see a gonzales gonzales bonds ins.agency of homeland,fed.cir.normally,a contract between the plaintiff and the united states is required to establish standing to sue the government on a contract claim.cal.fed.sav.loan ass united states,fed.cir.a plaintiff must be in privity with the united states to have standing to sue the sovereign on a contract claim.
this case involves the purchase and sale of electricity in the california market.appellants contend that they were overcharged for electricity during the period from october,to june,the period,and seek to recover the overcharges from the united states based on sales by two federal government agencies the western area power administration wapa and the bonneville power administration bpa.two exchanges were involved in these transactions the california power exchange and the california independent system operator.these exchanges were responsible for acquiring and distributing electricity between producers and consumers in california and setting prices for the electricity.the basic question is whether purchase and sale contracts existed between the exchanges,on the one hand,and the appellants and defendant government agencies,on the other,or whether the contracts were between the appellants and the government agencies the consumers and producers of electric power.if the contracts were between the exchanges and market participants individually,appellants remedy is against the exchanges.if the contracts were between the consumers and producers of electricity,appellants remedy is against the government producers.
appellants contend that a contract existed between two groups one group consisting of all consumers of electricity including appellants and the other group consisting of all producers of electricity including the government agencies in california.under appellants theory,appellants and all other power consumers are in privity of contract with all producers in the california markets,including the government sellers.the government,on the other hand,contends that the contracts were only between the middleman entities that facilitated and operated the california electricity markets and and the consumers and producers individually.under the government theory,appellants are in privity of contract with and,and the government is also in privity of contract with and,but appellants are not in privity with the government.
on the face of it,the only contracts here were between the exchanges and and individual market participants the consumers and producers.both of these exchanges entered into individual contracts with each of the consumers and producers of electricity.the basis for appellants alternative theory requires some understanding of the background.
in the late,california restructured and deregulated its energy market.in,california established two organizations to acquire and distribute electricity and to otherwise organize and supervise all of the wholesale energy transactions in the state.one nonprofit,was designed to facilitate and conduct all wholesale electric power transactions for the state of california.responsibilities included,inter alia,collecting supply and demand bids from sellers and buyers of wholesale electricity respectively,processing those bids to develop aggregate supply and demand curves from the total pool of bids received,setting a market clearing price based on the intersection point of the aggregate supply and demand curves,preparing financial settlements by issuing statements to all market participants,establishing a calendar for payment,and settling payment individually with each market participant by debiting or crediting its account.was also responsible for determining the proper distribution of funds in the event of an overpayment,collecting the overpaid funds from the overpaid participants,and remitting those funds to the market participants who overpaid.
the other exchange,was established to assume operational control over all of california electric transmission facilities and ensure supply and demand on a basis.was responsible for,inter alia,operating the transmission grid,ensuring the necessary supply of energy,maintaining nondiscriminatory access to the grid,purchasing and providing ancillary services,and maintaining a spot market for electricity to balance out any disparities between supply and demand in the market.in this regard,operated as a to the primary market for wholesale energy.
and filed tariffs with the federal energy regulatory commission ferc,the independent federal agency with regulatory authority over the interstate sale of all wholesale electricity and transmission service.the tariffs tariff and tariff,respectively established the terms and conditions of service and rates for the california markets.the tariff and the tariff both contained clauses known in the industry as memphis clauses,which preserved the ability of consumers and producers in the california markets to exercise their rights under the federal power act fpa to petition ferc for a change in the terms or rates of the tariffs.
all consumers and producers of wholesale energy in the california markets entered into individual agreements with and,known as participation agreements.every participation agreement incorporated the tariff,and every participation agreement incorporated the tariff.none of the consumers and producers of wholesale energy purported to contract directly with one another rather,all participants in the california markets executed separate participation agreements with and only.indeed,individual contracts between consumers and producers were not feasible since electricity is fungible,and purchases and sales of electricity could not be traced to particular consumers and producers in the california markets.
appellants entered into participation agreements with and shortly after california deregulated the market to purchase electricity.wapa and bpa,the defendant federal administrations,also executed participation agreements with and.no agreements were executed between appellants and the federal agencies.in,the government agencies began selling energy into the california markets through and,along with many other sellers.appellants were among the many consumers of that energy.
to transact energy in california,potential consumers and producers submitted bids to to buy or sell wholesale electric power.based on all of the bids received,compiled supply and demand curves to calculate a market price that it then applied uniformly to all transactions within a given market.consumers paid,which organized and disbursed the funds to sellers in proportion to the amount of energy each supplied.consumers never paid producers directly.operated in a similar fashion.in this way,and served as exchanges or centralized clearinghouses,acquiring electric power from producers and distributing it to consumers and otherwise facilitating wholesale energy transactions for market participants pursuant to the conditions and constraints imposed by the governing tariffs.
as a result of the method of pricing in the california energy market,appellants contend that they and each of the many other consumers were overcharged for purchases during the period,allegedly as a result of improper pricing mechanisms.set prices on an hourly basis to satisfy demand for spot markets.while also set prices over a larger period for or forward contract markets,most purchases and sales were in the spot markets.pac.gas united states,fed.cl.appellants and other consumers became subject to unstable spot market purchases.sellers quickly learned that the california spot markets could be manipulated by withholding power to create scarcity and then demanding extremely high prices when scarcity was probable.pub.utilities comm of cal.ferc,cir.by may,the price of wholesale power in the california markets doubled.blackouts rolled across the state as it descended into an energy crisis.
by august,appellants and all other consumers were charged prices three to four times greater than the market rates of less than a year earlier.appellants believed the rates established by the exchanges were unjust and unreasonable.appellants sought relief by filing a complaint with ferc,which,with respect to entities,has the authority to set an effective date,determine whether rates charged after that date are unjust and unreasonable,and order refunds for rates charged after that date if it determines that they are unjust and unreasonable.here,ferc set an effective date of october,determined that rates charged after that date were unjust and unreasonable,and ordered that refunds be paid by all sellers in the california market.
a series of appeals to the ninth circuit ensued.as is relevant here,the ninth circuit held that ferc lacked jurisdiction to order the government to pay refunds,bonneville power admin.ferc,cir,a determination that is not now contested.this was so because government agencies are not subject to ferc jurisdiction,as f of the federal power act makes clear no provision of this subchapter shall apply to the united states or any agency,authority,or instrumentality thereof.f see also bonneville,at.although ferc lacked the authority to order the government to pay refunds,the ninth circuit upheld ferc ability to find the rates charged by all sellers,including the government agencies,to be unjust and unreasonable.see city of redding ferc,cir.explaining that to the extent that ferc revised or reset the market rate for the period,this was within ferc authority,as it necessarily involved reevaluating the price previously charged by all market participants because the market clearing price was the same for all of them.
since ferc lacked jurisdiction to order refunds by the government appellants brought this breach of contract action in the claims court,alleging that the government producers had breached agreements between the consumers and producers by overcharging appellants and all other consumers and by failing to pay a refund for unjust and unreasonable prices charged during the period.
after a trial,judge smith found in favor of appellants.see pac.gas united states,fed.cl.judge smith held that the facts at trial showed that the agencies contracted with and owe contract obligations to appellants.id.at.in his view,and were entities or clearinghouses only,and he therefore concluded that the payment obligations were between the buyer consumer and seller producer.id.at.judge smith further held that the government had breached its contract with appellants by failing to pay refunds.see id.at.
before the proceedings began,judge smith retired from the bench.his successor,judge braden,vacated judge smith opinions and dismissed the case for,inter alia,lack of standing.pacific gas,fed.cl.at.judge braden held that while appellants were in privity of contract with the exchanges,they lacked privity with the government.see id.at.judge braden further held that appellants failed to demonstrate the existence of an agency relationship between the government and the exchanges,see id.at,and failed to demonstrate that appellants were beneficiaries of the government contracts with the exchanges,see id.at this appeal followed.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
appellants first contend that judge braden violated the law of the case doctrine by vacating judge smith rulings.
according to appellants,the law of the case doctrine counsels particular caution when one judge is asked or,as here,decides sua sponte to reconsider her predecessor decisions.br.of appellants at.appellants assert that this case should be remanded because judge braden decision to reconsider judge smith decisions constituted an abuse of discretion.
but the dispositive issue addressed on reconsideration here standing is a pure issue of law,which we review de novo.see cal.fed.sav.loan ass n,fed.cir.and the question of standing here depends on contract interpretation,which also is a question of law that we review de novo.see,nuclear operating united states,fed.cir.indeed,appellants agree that judge braden specific errors in interpreting the contracts and the ninth circuit decisions were purely legal,and are therefore subject to plenary review.br.of appellants at.judge smith contract interpretation was also legal in character.judge smith made no relevant findings of fact with respect to interpretation of the contract provisions at issue see,thatcher kohl stores,fed.cir.accordingly,even if appellants could demonstrate that judge braden erred in reconsidering judge smith interlocutory decisions,they have suffered no prejudice,since our review of both decisions of the claims court is de novo.we thus proceed to consider the issue of standing.cal.fed.sav.loan ass n,at.
as noted above,typically t o have standing to sue the sovereign on a contract claim,a plaintiff must be in privity of contract with the united states,anderson united states,fed.cir,and s tanding is a threshold jurisdictional issue that implicates article iii of the constitution.cal.fed.sav.loan ass n,at.not only is privity a fundamental requirement of contract law,but it takes on even greater significance in cases such as this,because the government consents to be sued only by those with whom it has privity of contract.id.quoting erickson air crane of united states,fed.cir.the effect of finding privity of contract between a party and the united states is to find a waiver of sovereign immunity.cienega gardens united states,fed.cir.we do not lightly presume that the government actions give rise to contractual obligations when the government is not a named party to the contract in dispute.see united states algoma lumber.
limited exceptions to the privity requirement have been recognized when a party standing outside of privity by contractual obligation stands in the shoes of a party within privity,such as when a party can demonstrate that it was an intended beneficiary under the contract,see,first hartford.pension plan tr.united states,fed.cir,or when a party can demonstrate that a prime contractor acted as purchasing agent on behalf of the government in contracting with a subcontractor.see leased hous.ass united states,fed.cir.united states johnson controls,fed.cir.
we first address the issue of contractual privity,addressing later in this opinion appellants alternative theories of agency and beneficiary.the government argues that the only contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity here were between each market participant and the exchanges.we agree.there is no question that each of the many buyers and sellers entered into contracts with the exchanges.each individual participant in the california markets executed a contract with one or both exchanges incorporating the relevant tariff.each contract described the parties as being the individual participant and the exchange only.for example,bpa contract with explicitly provided that this agreement is entered into,by and between bonneville power administration and the california power exchange corporation.no parties other than the individual participant and the relevant exchange were listed on any contract.
while the uniform commercial code ucc does not apply directly to government contracts,see,gaf united states,fed.cir,the ucc provides useful guidance in applying general contract principles,hughes commc ns galaxy,united states,fed.cir.see also diversified energy.valley,cir.tech.assistance int l,united states,fed.cir.the parties appear to agree that the provision of electricity involves the sale of a good which would invoke the ucc.see,br.of appellants at here the agencies sold the power itself which is personal property under a.indeed,we would lack jurisdiction under the contract disputes act if the contracts were interpreted as involving the provision of services rather than goods.see a.under the supreme court decision in united states eurodif,the fact that electricity is fungible suggests that the exchanges bought from and sold electricity to market participants,rather than merely facilitating a transfer between producers and consumers.see,explaining that a transaction involving a fungible product is more likely to be viewed as the sale of a good as opposed to the sale of a service 
on the face of the agreements,the exchanges were performing a typical middleman function with respect to transactions in goods as described in commentary on the ucc.see lary lawrence,lawrence anderson on the uniform commercial code,ed.under typical middleman contracts,courts will treat as a buyer and seller a middleman who contracts for the sale of goods to be delivered to a third person.lawrence,at see also id.at.though the title to the electricity passes directly from producers to consumers,the ucc makes quite clear that this is not inconsistent with a middleman contract for purchase and sale.a middleman making a contract is a seller for the purpose of article,even though the middleman does not have,nor will ever have,title to the goods,as title is to pass directly from the supplier to the customer of the middleman.id.at.
the incorporated tariffs confirm this reading.on their face the tariffs contemplate that the exchanges will acquire energy from the producers and transfer it to the consumers.see,shall allocate to px participants costs incurred by the px under this tariff and the iso tariff in buying or selling energy emphasis added the px shall settle with each px participant for energy traded each px seller shall be credited with an amount equal to its scheduled sales of energy each px buyer shall be debited by the px with an amount equal to its scheduled purchase of energy emphasis added shall purchase ancillary services capacity.emphasis added unstructured imbalance energy attributable to each market participant for each settlement period in the relevant zone shall be deemed to be sold or purchased,as the case may be,by the iso emphasis added.
the tariffs do not just contemplate that the exchanges will provide and distribute electric power rather,they also contemplate that the exchanges will set the price of the electricity itself.see.the tariffs were also clear that in the event of an overcharge by the producers the allegation here,the producers were obligated to make payment to the exchange,not the consumers directly.see,each px participant acknowledges that it incurs separate financial obligations to the px in respect to its px core market transactions all px participants shall honor their obligations to pay all of the amounts owed to the px in a timely manner.emphasis added if for any reason a px creditor receives on any payment date more than the amount to which it is entitled under the px tariff,it shall forthwith pay the excess amount into a px account specified by the px.emphasis added if for any reason a market participant receives an overpayment it shall forthwith pay the overpayment into an iso account specified by the iso.the iso shall be responsible for payment to those entitled to the sum which has been overpaid.
this arrangement is confirmed by other provisions of the tariffs concerning settlement obligations.with respect to payment,for example,the tariff explains that t he px shall settle with each px participant for energy traded in the px markets in the manner set forth in schedule.emphasis added.neither tariff contemplates direct payment from consumers to producers,or vice versa indeed,such payment would be impossible because specific buyers were never matched with and could not be identified by specific sellers.instead,allocated payment and energy in proportion to the bids submitted by each participant.was responsible for calculating,collecting,and disbursing all payments for energy on the market.the px shall calculate the prices at which trades in energy are transacted in the px markets,settle trades in energy between px participants,allocate to px participants costs incurred by the px under this tariff and prepare and distribute to px participants invoices.the same was true with respect to.
appellants argue that these contracts nonetheless should not be interpreted as contracts for the purchase and sale of goods because of two types of provisions appearing in the tariffs.first,there is a provision in the tariff which purports to limit the exchange role in the energy transactions will not be,and shall not be deemed to be,a counterparty to any trade transacted through the px markets.the meaning of this provision in the tariff is unclear.counterparty is defined as the party with whom one is consummating a contract.counterparty,black law dictionary ed.but it is undisputed here that contracted directly with each market participant.in saying that the exchange is not a counterparty to any trade,the above provision appears only to provide that did not take title to any of the energy transferred.as described,this is consistent with role as a middleman.see lawrence,at.
in any event,the counterparty provision can not be read to bar the existence of a purchase and sale contract between the exchanges and each individual market participant,because such a provision would directly conflict with all of the provisions discussed above which clearly contemplate that,as middleman,contracted for the purchase and sale of electricity.when there is an apparent conflict between contractual provisions,we enforce the clause s relatively more important or principal to the contract.williston on contracts ed.thus,for example,in oleson bergwell,the court held that a contract containing many provisions contemplating the outright sale of stock should be construed to provide for a sale even though the agreement stated that it shall be deemed and considered by the parties as an option to purchase.id.at emphasis added.because the principal purpose of this contract was to effectuate a sale,id.at,the court treated the contract as a sales contract.see see also nicholas acoustics specialty h m constr,cir.enforcing the dominant of two conflicting contract provisions by considering the tenor of the agreement as a whole.
here,the lone provision cited by appellants purporting to limit role is vastly outweighed in both number and significance by the other provisions of the tariff,which clearly establish role as a middleman purchasing and selling electricity.accordingly,we do not read the counterparty provision as disclaiming the existence of a middleman contract for the purchase and sale of electricity.there is,moreover,no similar provision in the tariff.
second,appellants rely on provisions that appear to contemplate that suits may be brought by one participant against another.significantly,as described below,these provisions do not suggest that the groups of all consumers and producers are collectively liable to each other,as appellants contend.in any case,these provisions hardly suggest that suits may not be brought by participants against the exchanges or that there are no purchase and sale contracts between the market participants and the exchanges.indeed,as described below,the tariffs make clear that the exchanges had remedies against defaulting participants 
we conclude that the contracts between the exchanges and the participants are middleman contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity.
appellants nonetheless contend that the above events should be construed as involving contracts directly between the groups of purchasers and consumers of electricity in the california markets.appellants concede that there are no individual agreements between consumers and producers.the only documents that purport to be contractual agreements are the agreements between the exchanges and the consumers and producers of electricity.as discussed,those agreements on their face are agreements between a particular consumer or producer and each exchange.appellants theory is instead that the agreement of each of the consumers and producers to abide by the tariff creates an agreement between all consumers,on the one hand,and all producers,on the other.no written document purports to be such an agreement,and the various provisions on which appellants rely can not be read to create such an agreement.
appellants originally argued that the memphis clauses in the and tariffs incorporated into each individual contract somehow established a contractual obligation by the government agencies to pay refunds in accordance with the ferc order to appellants.appellants have now abandoned this argument,and wisely so.the memphis clauses simply provide that n othing contained in this tariff or any service or participation agreement shall be construed as affecting,in any way,the ability of any px participant receiving service under this tariff to exercise its rights under section of the fpa and pursuant to ferc rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.see also tariff.while the memphis clauses preserve the market participants rights to petition ferc to limit unjust and unreasonable rates pursuant to the fpa,such rights do not extend from one market participant to another,and can not be construed as the source of any contractual obligation between market participants.
instead of relying on the memphis clauses,appellants now primarily rely on the overpayment provisions.see the px shall be responsible for ascertaining the identity of those px participants entitled to receive amounts overpaid to another px participant and for disbursing those funds to the persons entitled to them promptly after they are returned in accordance with section above.the iso shall be responsible for payment to those entitled to the sum which has been overpaid.but such provisions provide that a payment obligation exists only between the market participants and the exchanges,not between consumers and producers directly.as discussed above,if a market participant learned that it had received excess payment,the tariffs make clear that it was obligated to return those funds into a px account specified by the px.see also tariff.in other words,excesses owed were to be paid back to or,not to the parties directly.thus,it was the exchanges that were responsible for ascertaining the identity of those px participants entitled to receive amounts overpaid and for disbursing those funds to the persons entitled to them,not the other market participants,see also tariff.and were solely responsible for collecting from the overpaid participant and remitting proportionately to all owed participants.contrary to appellants characterization,this arrangement creates no obligations directly between buyers and sellers.
nor do the provisions of the tariffs concerning possible legal action between market participants suffice to create a contract.at most there are provisions in the tariff which contemplate suit between market participants.see each iso creditor shall give notice to the iso before instituting any action or proceedings in any court against an iso debtor to enforce payments due to it.the iso shall,on request,certify in writing the amounts owed by an iso debtor that remain unpaid and the iso creditors to whom such amounts are owed and shall provide a certificate which may be used as prima facie evidence of the amount due by an iso debtor to iso creditors in any legal proceedings.the tariff contains no such provision,but provides that will identify a defaulting market participant to other affected participants.see will identify the defaulting participant to all other affected px participants by the most expeditious means available.these provisions do not purport to create a right of action by one market participant against another,nor do they create any payment obligation between market participants.these provisions do not support appellants theory of collective liability,and fall well short of creating obligations between consumers and producers.
finally,the tariffs explicitly grant the exchanges remedies against a defaulting participant.if the px participant fails to pay any sum or to perform any other obligation to the px when due,then the px may,in its sole discretion and without further notice to the defaulting px participant or regard to formalities of any kind,pursue all remedies under this section,emphasis added,including the right to recoup,and apply any amount to which any defaulting px participant is entitled towards satisfaction of any of that px participant debts.see also tariff.the tariffs provide that and px participants may be parties to a dispute in arbitration arising under the contracts,arbitration being the specified dispute resolution mechanism.see also.accordingly,these provisions concerning possible legal action between consumers and producers do not create a contract between groups of consumers and producers.
quite apart from the lack of any written document reflecting an agreement between buyers and sellers,the alleged agreements can not satisfy the requirement of reasonable certainty applicable to the essential terms of all contracts.see restatement second of contracts am.law.inst.a contract within the statute of frauds must state with reasonable certainty the essential terms of the unperformed promises in the contract,and the parties must be reasonably identified williston on contracts,a contract must contain the essential or material terms including the parties,the subject matter,a description of the property or goods affected,and in at least some jurisdictions,the price or consideration and an indication that the parties have mutually assented to the terms of the agreement see also am.law inst.unif.law comm a contract for the sale of goods is not enforceable unless there is some writing sufficient to indicate that a contract for sale has been made between the parties and signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought.although under the ucc an omitted term does not necessarily render a sales contract unenforceable,see,it is still necessary for the person claiming the benefit of the contract to establish that,in fact,there was a contract and to establish its terms,lawrence.there is no basis here for determining the groups that are supposed parties to the contracts at any particular time or the particular obligations that each group owes to the other.nor is there any basis for determining the duration or other material terms of the alleged agreement s.the certainty required for the existence of a contract is simply lacking.
appellants additionally argue by analogy to the law of stock exchanges that participants in an exchange may assert claims against one another based on provisions of the governing contract.br.of appellants at.the two cases upon which appellants rely,muh newburger,loeb,cir,and coenen pressprich,cir,do not support such a broad proposition.in muh,the ninth circuit held that the arbitration provision of a stock exchange constitution was binding in a lawsuit brought by one member of the exchange against another member for breach of a separate contract.muh,at.there was no dispute in muh that the members were in privity of contract with respect to the contract involved in the action for breach.see id.at.similarly,in coenen the second circuit held that an arbitration provision of a stock exchange constitution applied to a lawsuit brought by one member against another for refusal to allow the transfer of certain shares of stock under a separate agreement.coenen,at.there was also no dispute in coenen that the members were in privity with respect to the separate agreement.see id.thus in neither case was the constitution of the stock exchange itself the source of privity between the parties in suit.rather the courts simply read into the explicit separate contracts between exchange members a clause of the exchanges governing constitutions.
it is that the constitution of a stock exchange does not automatically confer privity upon all those who transact in the exchange.in the analogous context of suits brought by purchasers of stock against insider traders,courts have recognized that there is no direct privity of contract in the traditional sense between buyers and sellers on the exchange.see,william painter,inside information growing pains for the development of federal corporation law under rule,colum,see also cochran channing,supp,joseph farnsworth radio television,supp,aff,cir.it was for this very reason that the implied private right of action under section b of the securities exchange act was fashioned to avoid any requirement of traditional privity to bring suit.see veronica dougherty,a dis semblance of privity criticizing the contemporaneous trader requirement in insider trading.of.because there is no private right of action upon which appellants can rely here,appellants argument by analogy to the law of stock exchanges is unavailing.
appellants also rely on one court decision holding a contracting party liable as a result of the incorporation of a tariff into a separate contract.see alliant energy.pub.power,cir.alliant energy does not lend support to the notion that buyers and sellers in an energy exchange are in contractual privity.in that case,there was a contract for the provision of services between parties to an energy exchange.see alliant energy.pub.power,wl,at.a tariff governed the terms of those services.see id.at.the court held that a ferc finding that the rates charged for those services were discriminatory required a refund under the contract.see alliant energy,at when a contract provides that its terms are subject to a regulatory body,all parties to that contract are bound by the actions of the regulatory body.emphasis added.the court in alliant energy did not find privity in the absence of an explicit contract.
nor is this a situation in which appellants are entitled to step into the shoes of the exchanges and sue the government directly.indeed,appellants make no such argument.it is that a party can not step into the shoes of another party to pursue a contract claim absent explicit assignment of the claim or assignment by operation of law under equitable subrogation.see,lumbermens mut.cas.united states,fed.cir.there has been no suggestion here that the contracts between the exchanges and market participants were assigned or that appellants are subrogated to the rights of the and.nor could there be.we have held that equitable subrogation is a narrow exception to the traditional privity requirement,and we have only found equitable subrogation in the surety context.see ins.of the united states,fed.cir.admiralty,dalton,fed.cir.
significantly,both ferc and the ninth circuit understood that the contracts between individual market participants and the exchanges were middleman contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity,and that no contractual privity existed between market participants.in a related proceeding,ferc explained that i n these circumstances,we believe it is reasonable to construe both the bidding participants and the px to be engaged in sales of electric energy.accordingly,we conclude that the bidding px participants will be engaged in sales of electric energy at wholesale to the px,who will then resell that energy to wholesale and retail customer participants.cal.edison,ferc,emphasis added.ferc described that will be the intermediary that contracts with the entities that sell into the px as well as with the wholesale and retail customers that purchase from the px.id.emphasis added.similarly,in a related proceeding,ferc held that there are no sales contracts between sellers and buyers of electricity sold into the px.cal.edison,ferc at emphasis added.ferc further explained,i n this proceeding,we are faced with a new market institution in which sellers and buyers of electric energy will not contract directly with one another,as has been traditionally done in the industry,but instead will contract with the px.id.emphasis added.indeed,ferc understood that,as a consequence of this lack of privity between buyers and sellers,any refunds due as a result of a ferc refund order would be paid to the exchanges,not directly to the underpaid market participants.see san diego gas sellers of energy ancillary,ferc.these interpretations were echoed by the ninth circuit.see cal.edison lynch,cir.holding that market participant socal edison is in privity with the california power exchange corporation,not with other market participants.
finally,appellants argue that it would be unfair to deny appellants a remedy for the government overcharges and to allow the government to retain the windfall profits.appellants assert that,without a finding of privity between consumers and producers here,the government is wholly immunized from public or private accountability.br.of appellants at.but the absence of an agreement between consumers and producers hardly suggests the lack of a remedy.it may well be that the producers of electric power would have been liable to the exchanges for any overcharges,and that the exchanges in turn would have been liable to the appellant consumers.the procedural mechanisms for such suits clearly exist under the tariffs.
although interpleader,which is ordinarily the remedy for a party in appellants position,is not available here because the government is a party,see gonzales,at,appellants could have sought recovery from the exchanges,with which they are in direct privity of contract,as is clearly contemplated by the arbitration dispute resolution procedures established by the tariffs.see.the exchanges in turn could have sought contribution from the government under the same arbitration procedures,which may have provided for a mechanism similar to traditional interpleader appellants failed to pursue this course,however,and instead would have us manufacture privity among all buyers and sellers in the california markets where there is none.this we decline to do.
alternatively,appellants contend that they have standing under an agency theory.appellants argue that,even if the only contracts are between the exchanges and market participants,the exchanges acted as agents for all consumers and producers in the california markets in every energy transaction.under certain circumstances,an entity not in direct contractual privity with another party may nevertheless sue if it contracted with a third entity,and an agency relationship is demonstrated between that third entity and the defendant.see leased hous.ass united states,fed.cir.united states johnson controls,fed.cir.
the relationship of principal and agent is created by a manifestation of assent by both parties.williston on contracts ed.the consent of both principal and agent is necessary to create an agency.id.t he principal must intend for the agent to act for the principal,and the agent must intend to accept the authority and act on it and the intention of the parties must find expression either in words or other conduct between them.id.as a general rule,the party asserting the agency has the burden of proving both the existence of the relationship and the authority of the agent.williston on contracts at see also restatement third of agency d am.law inst.the party asserting that a relationship of agency exists generally has the burden in litigation of establishing its existence.
here,appellants rely on two provisions of the tariffs that they argue created an agency relationship between all consumers on the one hand and all producers on the other,with the exchanges acting as agent for both groups.appellants cite the tariff,which provides that the px acts as an agent for the px participants and its inclusion in a payment flow does not infer that it is a principal in the financial transaction,and the tariff,which provides that i n contracting for ancillary services and imbalance energy the iso will not act as principal but as agent for and on behalf of the relevant market participants,
even if those provisions are read to address an agency relationship for the purchase and sale of electricity,it is well established that parties statements in a contract are not dispositive as to the existence of an agency relationship.whether a relationship is characterized as agency in an agreement between parties or in the context of industry or popular usage is not controlling.restatement third of agency see also,matter of carolin paxson,cir.the key to the existence of an agency relationship is not any characterization in a contract but rather is set forth in section of the restatement of agency.an agency relationship arises when one person a principal manifests assent to another person an agent that the agent shall act on the principal behalf and subject to the principal control,and the agent manifests assent or otherwise consents to so act.restatement third of agency.agency thus requires control by the principal.see hollingsworth perry,an essential element of agency is the principal right to control the agent actions.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.t he principal right to control the agent differentiates agency relationships from nonagency relationships.restatement third of agency cmt.e.here the requisite control is clearly deficient.
a relationship is not one of agency within the definition unless the agent consents to act on behalf of the principal,and the principal has the right throughout the duration of the relationship to control the agent acts.id.at cmt.c emphasis added.it is for this reason that a mere middleman is not typically an agent.id.at cmt.h.the control necessary to demonstrate an agency relationship requires that a principal have the right to give interim instructions or directions to the agent once their relationship is established.id.at cmt.f see also clackamas gastroenterology,wells.
judge braden recognized that,notwithstanding the provisions purporting to create an agency relationship,no agency relationship exists because,inter alia,the government lacked sufficient control over the exchanges.see pacific gas,fed.cl.at.we agree 
here,the alleged principals the buyers and sellers lack any meaningful control over the exchanges.the tariffs provide that the exchanges have plenary control over,inter alia,setting prices charging,collecting,and remitting payments ensuring the transfer of the appropriate amount of energy from each transaction and collecting and remitting money in the event of overpayment.indeed it is the exchanges that are explicitly empowered with the ability to issue instructions,detailing,inter alia,settlement and payment obligations to the buyers and sellers,not the other way around.appellants point to no provision of the tariffs that affords the government meaningful control over the exchanges.without such evidence of the alleged principal control over the alleged agent,there can be no agency relationship 
nothing in this court decisions contemplating an agency exception to the privity requirement suggest that control is not required for agency.indeed,those cases,which have been limited to the context,hold that a subcontractor can not sue the government directly unless,inter alia,there is an explicit provision in the contract which provides that the government will be directly liable to the vendors for the purchase price.leased housing,at quoting johnson controls,at.even assuming that this situation was comparable to the context,it is undisputed that there is no such provision in the contracts here.
we conclude that the agreements can not be interpreted as creating agency relationships.
finally,appellants contend that they have standing to sue the government because they are beneficiaries of the government contracts with and.one of the l imited exceptions to the general privity requirement for standing is when the plaintiff can demonstrate that it was an intended beneficiary under the contract.cal.fed.sav.loan ass n,at first hartford,at.
third party beneficiary status is an exceptional privilege,glass united states,fed.cir.quoting german all.ins.home water supply,and the requirements to demonstrate beneficiary status are stringent,anderson,at.before a stranger can avail himself of the exceptional privilege of suing for a breach of an agreement to which he is not a party,he must,at least,show that it was intended for his direct benefit.german,at.to demonstrate beneficiary status,therefore,a party must prove that the contract not only reflects the express or implied intention to benefit the party,but that it reflects an intention to benefit the party directly.flexfab,united states,fed.cir.quoting glass,at.beneficiary status is not established merely because a contract would benefit a party.fed.deposit ins.united states,fed.cir.
as the restatement makes clear,typical beneficiary situations arise when,for example,one party promises another to pay a debt to a third party.in such circumstances,the third party is a beneficiary with standing to sue on the contract.restatement second of contracts illus.am.law inst.while a beneficiary need not always be named explicitly in the contract,have the direct right to compensation,or the power to enforce that right against the promisor,the contract must demonstrate a clear intent to benefit a beneficiary personally,independent of his or her status as a member of a group generally benefited by a contract performance.anderson,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted see also castle united states,fed.cir.in other words,at a minimum there must be a particular,identifiable benefit that was clearly intended to flow to the third party.
anderson united states is instructive.in anderson we held that two individuals were not beneficiaries of an alleged contract with the government simply because they were named beneficiaries of a trust which was owed certain contractual obligations from the government.see at.we explained that,u nder the contract,every promise the government allegedly failed to keep pertains to the regulatory treatment of the trust.nothing suggests that the government made any promises expressly intended to benefit the individuals personally,independently of their status as beneficiaries of the trust.id.at.similarly,in glass united states we held that shareholders of a corporation were not beneficiaries of a contract between the corporation and the government because the contract manifested no intent to benefit the shareholders individually,independent of their status as shareholders.at.
here appellants contend that they are beneficiaries based on the overpayment provisions of the tariffs.but,as discussed,the overpayment provisions create obligations and remedies for and,not the market participants.contrary to appellants assertion that these provisions gave appellants an explicit contractual right to a refund by sellers of any overpayments appellants made when purchasing electricity,br.of appellants at,the very text quoted by appellants reveals that the overpayment procedures hold and solely responsible for collecting and disbursing overpayments.the px shall be responsible for ascertaining the identity of those px participants entitled to receive amounts overpaid to another px participant and for disbursing those funds to the persons entitled to them promptly.see also tariff.there is no specific,identifiable benefit that flows directly from producer to consumer under the tariffs.
the only opinion appellants cite in which we have recognized beneficiary standing is allen orchards united states,fed.cir.in allen,the plaintiffs were farmers in the state of washington who were members of associations.see allen orchards united states,cl.those associations contracted with the federal government regarding a federal water project.see id.in,a federal district court entered a consent decree setting forth the allotment of water from the federal project to the associations.id.the plaintiff farmers later brought suit against the federal government for an alleged breach of the consent decree.allen orchards,at.the claims court held that plaintiffs lacked standing to sue the government.id.on appeal,we disagreed.see id.at.we explained that the associations act ed as a surrogate for the aggregation of farmers.id.the farmers themselves held a property right in the water to the extent of their beneficial use thereof,and a specific,identifiable benefit flowed from the government to each farmer under the consent decree.id.accordingly,we held that the farmers were the true parties in interest to sue under the decree.id.
here there is no identifiable benefit flowing from the particular government agencies to the particular appellants.appellants were simply some of the many participants on the of the california wholesale energy market,and it is impossible to trace the transfer of electric power from producers to consumers.appellants can not demonstrate any particular benefit flowing to them from the government agencies,let alone that the exchanges contracts with the government intended to benefit them specifically,independent of all other market participants.accordingly,appellants fail to establish the stringent requirements to demonstrate the exceptional privilege of beneficiary status.anderson,at glass,at.as such,appellants lack beneficiary standing.
because appellants are not in direct privity of contract with the government,fail to demonstrate an agency relationship,and do not qualify as beneficiaries on the contract,appellants lack standing to sue the government on the contract claims asserted here.accordingly,we affirm the decision of the claims court dismissing appellants suit for lack of standing.
costs to the united states.
the united states does not dispute that it overcharged the plaintiffs for electric power,and that it is required to repay the overcharge in accordance with the ferc rate schedule and the governing federal statutes.nonetheless,the united states position is that it will not comply with this law,for nobody can sue it to enforce the law.we agree that ferc,a federal agency,can not order a refund of the overages charged by the united states,but that does not insulate the united states from suit by the overcharged buyers of electric power from the united states.my colleagues on this panel strain to find a remedy,by announcing that maybe these buyers can recover something from the exchanges that brokered the overcharged transactions but my colleagues hold that there is no other remedy for the government refusal to comply with the statute that the government admits to have violated.
the first assigned judge of the court of federal claims rejected this position,on proceedings that lasted seven years.however,the successor judge of that court discarded the prior adjudication,and held that the court is helpless to act.the federal circuit now agrees.i respectfully dissent.

our court is reminded of this high obligation by these watchwords of the nation duty to citizens,carved on the wall of this courthouse,welcoming those who seek justice in suit against the government 
it is as much the duty of government to render prompt justice against itself,in favor of citizens,as it is to administer the same between private individuals.

the overcharge and the statutory refund obligation are not disputed 
the overcharge is not disputed the plaintiffs paid money to the federal power agencies at prices set by auction markets,and the federal sellers of power and others made windfall profits.ferc then required that these profits be refunded,on the basis of just and reasonable market clearing prices.all of the refunds to the affected purchasers have been paid by the obligated entities,with the exception of the federal agencies the bonneville power administration bpa and the western area power administration wapa collectively,the power administrators 
both the bpa and the wapa had agreed,as a condition of participating in the california power market calpx and iso to accept tariffs.however,bpa and wapa have refused to make the designated repayments in accordance with the retroactive market clearing prices,which,as the ninth circuit held,reach the entirety of the market,not just a portion of the market transactions.city of redding ferc,cir.my colleagues hold that the courts can not require such compliance with law.this can not be,for compliance with law is the judicial role,and federal compliance is assigned to the court of federal claims and the federal circuit.
the power administrators acknowledge the overcharges,and do not disagree that the statute requires them to refund the overcharges.the overpayment is not disputed by the government.the panel majority provides details,see by august,appellants and all other consumers were charged prices three to four times greater than the market rates of less than a year earlier ferc ordered that refunds be paid by all sellers in the california market.
the ninth circuit upheld ferc authority to find the rates charged by all sellers,including the federal agencies,to be unjust and unreasonable.city of redding,at ferc july order reset the market clearing prices in the calpx and iso spot markets during the refund period to just and reasonable levels for the purpose of calculating the amount of refund due from entities.this calculation necessarily involved reevaluating the price previously charged by all market participants because the market clearing price was the same for all of them.
it is not disputed that the overage charges are able to be determined,and the refunds properly allocated.the charges,overages,refund allocations,and the like have already been litigated,settled,or otherwise disposed of via ferc california refund proceeding and related litigation,much of which has received judicial review in the ninth circuit.see,in summary,federal energy regulatory commission,the commission response to the california electricity crisis and timeline for distribution of refunds available at see also,ferc establishing a mitigated market clearing price mmcp.under the mmcp methodology,refunds were to be determined by the difference between the market clearing price,which was the price charged by all electricity suppliers at a given time,and the mmcp calculated for each hour of the refund period,subject to certain adjustments.puc ferc,cir.
yet the bpa and the wapa refuse to make the refunds,stating that neither ferc nor the courts have jurisdiction to force them to meet these obligations.br.at ferc has no jurisdiction over the agencies.id.at the court of federal claims does not possess jurisdiction.id.at court of federal claims had no jurisdiction.however,that is incorrect.jurisdiction is indeed possessed by the court of federal claims and this court.
the constitution and the tucker act provide remedy,whether on a theory of contract or taking of property 
my colleagues hold that no court or agency possesses authority to enforce payment of the refunds due from the united states to the appellants.the court refuses to apply the standard that ferc requires and enforces of private actors in the same position.all power generators and power purchasers affected by the rates that ferc corrected on the california energy markets are bound by this standard.the tucker act formalizes the judicial authority whereby this standard is enforced a
