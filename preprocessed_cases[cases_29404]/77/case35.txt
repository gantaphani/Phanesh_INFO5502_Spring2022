the question presented is whether the criminal forfeiture imposed on benjamin viloski viloski violates the excessive fines clause of the eighth amendment.viloski argues that the united states district court for the northern district of new york david hurd,judge erred when it declined to consider viloski age,health,and financial condition in determining whether its previously issued forfeiture order of was unconstitutionally excessive.viloski also argues that even if the district court properly ignored his personal circumstances,the forfeiture is nonetheless unconstitutional in light of the four factors described in united states bajakajian,d.
we hold that a court reviewing a criminal forfeiture under the excessive fines clause may consider as part of the proportionality determination required by bajakajian whether the forfeiture would deprive the defendant of his future ability to earn a living.we further hold,however,that courts should not consider a defendant personal circumstances as a distinct factor.applying these conclusions to the present case,we determine that the challenged forfeiture is constitutional because it is not grossly disproportional to the gravity of viloski offenses.we therefore affirm the october,order of the district court.
background 
viloski was a lawyer and broker who worked with dick sporting goods dsg on a number of development projects from through,he participated in a kickback scheme involving the construction of new dsg stores,in which developers or landlords paid consulting fees sometimes in exchange for work never performed to viloski in his capacity as dsg broker.viloski passed all or part of each payment to codefendant joseph queri,queri,a senior dsg executive,who took the payments without dsg knowledge.viloski sometimes paid queri through a company owned by codefendant gary gosson gosson.
in,viloski was charged in a indictment related to these activities.after a trial,a jury convicted him of one count of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud,two substantive counts of mail fraud,one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering,three counts of aiding and abetting money laundering,one count of aiding and abetting transactions in criminally derived property,and one count of making false statements.he was acquitted on the remaining counts.
on january,the district court sentenced viloski principally to a term of five years imprisonment and a term of supervised release.the court also ordered viloski to pay a total of in restitution to two developers and most relevant here to forfeit,which equaled the amount of funds viloski had acquired from landlords and developers,laundered through two entities he controlled,and passed on to queri the district court ordered forfeiture pursuant to a,the criminal forfeiture statute a c,the civil forfeiture statute and c,which integrate s a c into criminal proceedings,united states contorinis,cir.
viloski appealed to this court,which affirmed his conviction and sentence but remanded the case to the district court to determine whether its forfeiture order violated the excessive fines clause,const.amend.viii united states viloski,app x,cir viloski i.we specifically directed the district court to evaluate the forfeiture in light of bajakajian,at.
on remand,the district court interpreted bajakajian as requiring courts to consider the following four factors,known as the bajakajian factors,in determining whether a challenged forfeiture violates the excessive fines clause 
the essence of the crime and its relation to other criminal activity whether the defendant fits into the class of persons for whom the statute was principally designed the maximum sentence and fine that could have been imposed and the nature of the harm caused by the defendant conduct.
united states viloski,d.
viloski agreed that these factors were relevant but argued that the court should also consider his age,poor health,physical and civic disabilities,and inability to pay the forfeiture.id.at.viloski also emphasized his lack of culpability and lack of profit from the scheme compared to queri.id.although the district court expressed sympathy for some of these considerations,it declared them irrelevant,because t he supreme court had limited the inquiry to the four bajakajian factors.id.accordingly,after considering only those factors,the district court concluded that the forfeiture did not violate the eighth amendment.id.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
the supreme court first applied the excessive fines clause in united states bajakajian,d,which established a inquiry for determining whether a financial penalty is excessive under the eighth amendment at the first stage,we determine whether the excessive fines clause applies at all.id.at.if we conclude that it does,we proceed to the second step and determine whether the challenged forfeiture is unconstitutionally excessive.id.in applying bajakajian,we determine de novo whether a fine is constitutionally excessive,although we must accept the district court factual findings unless clearly erroneous.id.at.the burden rests on the defendant to show the unconstitutionality of the forfeiture.united states castello,cir 
step one does the excessive fines clause apply 
legal framework 
first,we must determine whether the forfeiture at issue constitutes a fine within the meaning of the excessive fines clause.bajakajian,at.that clause applies only to those forfeitures that may be characterized,at least in part,as punitive,forfeitures for which a defendant is personally liable.id.at see also united states v.an antique platter of gold,cir describing as punitive those forfeitures imposed at the culmination of a criminal proceeding that required a conviction of the underlying felony and could not have been imposed upon an innocent party.in contrast,purely remedial forfeitures,those in rem forfeitures intended not to punish the defendant but to compensate the government for a loss or to restore property to its rightful owner fall outside the scope of the excessive fines clause.bajakajian,at see also paroline united states,d the primary goal of restitution is remedial or compensatory,but it also serves punitive purposes.that may be sufficient to bring it within the purview of the excessive fines clause.internal quotation marks,citations,and alteration omitted.
application 
as we concluded in viloski i,the excessive fines clause applies here.see app x at.the challenged forfeiture which the district court expressly linked to specific offenses fits easily within the definition of punitive forfeitures we just expounded it was imposed at the culmination of a criminal proceeding that required a conviction of the underlying felony,and it could not have been imposed upon an innocent party.platter of gold,at 
step two is the forfeiture unconstitutionally excessive 
legal framework 
if we determine that a forfeiture is punitive,we must proceed to step two,which asks whether the forfeiture is unconstitutionally excessive.a forfeiture is unconstitutionally excessive if it is grossly disproportional to the gravity of a defendant offense.bajakajian,at.although bajakajian did not provide a test for gross disproportionality,we have interpreted that decision as requiring us to consider the following four factors,which have become known as the bajakajian factors 
the essence of the crime of the defendant and its relation to other criminal activity,whether the defendant fits into the class of persons for whom the statute was principally designed,the maximum sentence and fine that could have been imposed,and the nature of the harm caused by the defendant conduct.
united states george,cir quoting castello,at.
the principal question in this appeal is whether these factors are exhaustive a question we have never addressed directly.our cases interpreting bajakajian have neither added to the four factors nor described them as comprehensive.see,george,at consistent with bajakajian,this court has identified the following factors as relevant to the proportionality assessment castello,at four factors,distilled from bajakajian,guide our analysis.in some cases,however,we have implicitly cautioned agains
