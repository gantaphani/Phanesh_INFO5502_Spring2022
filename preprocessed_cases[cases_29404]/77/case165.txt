during dorroh meeting with bottoms at office suites plus on july,dorroh began inspecting the mail being held for amerenue billing company.at trial tr.at.he suspected that one letter contained the debit card that suntrust bank had sent to the office suites plus address,because,as he testified at trial,he could feel the debit card in there.at trial tr.at.dorroh testified that he then left office suites plus for a short period of time in order to acquire assistance from fellow law enforcement agents.at trial tr.at.he soon returned to office suites plus,sat down in the lobby and pretended to be a customer.id.dorroh testified that he then observed jordan enter office suites plus,holding a check in an awkward manner,which dorroh believed was intended to prevent leaving fingerprints on the check.at trial tr.at.dorroh further testified that jordan approached the receptionist and said,i am here to pay for the ameren account.at trial tr.at.after seeing bottoms take jordan back to her office,dorroh then exited the building and waited outside.id.bottoms testified that identifying himself as thomas gordon made a payment of then left the office.at trial tr.at.

procedural background 
on july,the district court appointed counsel from the federal public defender office to represent jordan.at appointment of federal public defender.on july,a magistrate judge held a probable cause and detention hearing and ordered jordan detained pending trial.at order of detention.upon appeal of the magistrate judge detention order,on august,the district court ordered jordan to remain detained because he posed a risk of flight and a danger to the community.at appeal of detention order order.

ii.analysis 
speedy trial act 
we review de novo a district court legal interpretation of the speedy trial act,and review for clear error the factual findings supporting a district court ruling.united states dejohn,cir,cert.denied,d.
the speedy trial act act provides that a ny indictment charging an individual with the commission of an offense shall be filed within thirty days from the date on which such individual was arrested or served with a summons in connection with such charges.b.but the act also contains various statutory exclusions under which certain periods of delay are not counted toward the clock.see h.as relevant here,the act excludes from the clock a ny period of delay resulting from other proceedings concerning the defendant,including but not limited to several enumerated types of delays,h,including delay resulting from any pretrial motion,from the filing of the motion through the conclusion of the hearing on,or other prompt disposition of,such motion,h f.the act also provides for a continuance.see h a.this provision permits a district court to grant a continuance that excludes from the clock the resulting delay when the court makes findings that the ends of justice served by taking such action outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial,and sets forth,in the record of the case,either orally or in writing,its reasons for these findings.h a.these findings must be put on the record by the time a district court rules on a defendant motion to dismiss under a.zedner united states,d.
jordan argues that he was entitled to dismissal of the charges against him because more than thirty countable days elapsed between jordan initial arrest on july,and his indictment on september.jordan concedes that the following periods are properly excluded from the clock july initial appearance july preliminary hearing august pendency of government motion.however,jordan disputes the most important exclusion claimed by the continuance granted by the district court under h a on august.if this continuance was properly granted by the district court,less than thirty days elapsed on the clock,and there was no violation of the speedy trial act.if it was not properly granted,more than thirty days elapsed,and therefore jordan was entitled to dismissal of the charges against him.
the continuance at issue was granted by a magistrate judge in a sealed order on august,giving the government until september to indict jordan.at sealed order.on august,the government filed a motion requesting leave to file a sealed document.at.leave was evidently granted,because also on august the government filed a sealed ex parte motion requesting a continuance under h a.at ex parte motion in support of the continuance,the government cited the complexity of jordan scheme,outstanding grand jury subpoenas to banks and telephone companies,and the possibility that jordan had engaged in similar schemes in south carolina and nevada.id.in the sealed order granting the continuance,the magistrate judge made the following findings 
the court finds that the ends of justice served by the extension outweigh the best interests of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial in that the failure to grant such an extension would result in a miscarriage of justice and the arrest in this case precedes indictment,and the facts upon which the grand jury must base its determination are unusual or complex and the failure to grant such an extension would deny the attorney for the government reasonable time necessary for effective preparation,taking into account the exercise of due diligence.
at sealed order.
when a district court grants such an continuance,it must set forth,in the record of the case,either orally or in writing,its reasons for finding that the ends of justice served by the granting of such continuance outweigh the best interests of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.h a.we conclude that the district court met these requirements of h a in granting the continuance.first,the magistrate judge tracked the language of the statute in the sealed order,indicating that he was aware of the statutory requirements.see h b listing factors which a judge shall consider in determining whether to grant a continuance under h a.second,sufficient facts to satisfy those requirements were set forth in the government ex parte motion,including the fact that a grand jury investigation into jordan activities was ongoing and that the grand jury was awaiting returns on subpoenas from various banks and telephone companies.
nonetheless,we must also address a serious procedural issue raised by jordan counsel for the first time at oral argument.there,jordan appellate counsel asserted that neither he nor jordan had previously been notified of the continuance granted by the district court on august.according to jordan current began representing jordan after conviction but before first became aware of the continuance upon receiving the government appellate brief in this case.indeed,nothing in the record before us demonstrates that either jordan or his current or former counsel were furnished,prior to this appeal,with the government ex parte motion for a continuance or the sealed order of the district court granting that motion.when pressed on this issue at oral argument,the assistant attorney ausa recalled discussing the continuance with jordan counsel at the time.but the record before us contains nothing that would indicate the existence or content of any communication regarding the continuance.
we begin by noting that ex parte actions under h a are red flag signals to an appellate court.united states mitchell,st cir,abrogated on other grounds by henderson united states,d.although there is nothing in h a specifically requiring a district court to hold a hearing before granting a continuance,we caution that ex parte action should be the exception rather than the rule.see mitchell,at.as a general matter,ex parte contacts between a party and the trial court in criminal trials are nearly always problematic in light of the sixth amendment guarantee of a public trial.united states madori,cir.these concerns are heightened in the context of a motion for a continuance under h.as the supreme court has explained,t he strategy of h is to counteract substantive openendedness with procedural strictness.zedner,at.emphasis added.to this end,the district court must make findings explaining the reasons for granting an continuance.id.at.we believe that in order to assure that the district court adequately considers whether the outweigh the public and defendant interests in a speedy trial,the district court should also generally hold an adversarial hearing in which both sides participate without the participation of the defendant,the district court is less likely to give full and adequate consideration to the defendant countervailing interests in a speedy trial.
furthermore,we take exception to the undue secrecy here surrounding the government ex parte motion and the district court order granting the continuance.both documents were entered under seal.it is unclear on the record before us when,or even if,they were unsealed and provided to jordan or jordan counsel in the court below.as noted previously,jordan counsel complained at oral argument that he was not aware that a continuance had even been granted until he received the government appellate brief.
the government stated reason for filing its motion for a continuance under without serving jordan to protect the secrecy of the grand jury proceedings pursuant to rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure.at.the magistrate judge,meanwhile,offered no explanation for sealing the august order granting the continuance.we believe that the level of secrecy exercised here by both the government and the district court was unjustified.we acknowledge that the government may,in the proper case,justifiably keep secret the details of a grand jury investigation in a motion for a h a continuance.here,however,the only arguably revealing details contained in the government sealed motion were that the grand jury had outstanding subpoenas for the records of banks and telephone companies,and that investigators were looking into whether jordan was involved in similar utility fraud schemes in both south carolina and nevada.at.these facts could easily have been redacted so that the motion revealed nothing beyond the mere existence of a grand jury investigation.
the sealing of the magistrate judge order was even less necessary.federal rule of criminal procedure e requires that r ecords,orders,and subpoenas relating to proceedings must be kept under seal to the extent and as long as necessary to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of a matter occurring before a grand jury.e.but the magistrate judge order merely recited the statutory factors in the course of finding that the ends of justice outweighed the public and defendant interests in a speedy trial.nothing in the sealed order related to secret matters.consequently,the district court should not have sealed this order and should have immediately provided the order to jordan or his counsel.
notwithstanding our concerns that the continuance was granted ex parte and surrounded by unnecessary secrecy,we conclude that the continuance was effective to stop the clock.the district court order met the requirement of h a that the court make findings that the ends of justice outweigh the public and defendant interests in a speedy trial.further,by tracking the language of the statutory factors,see h b,the magistrate judge signaled that he considered the proper requirements for granting a continuance.finally,we can not say that the court clearly erred in finding that the facts set forth in the government outstanding subpoenas to banks and telephone sufficient to meet those requirements.
because the continuance granted by the district court did not violate jordan rights under the speedy trial act,the entire period after entry of the continuance on august is excludable from jordan clock.additionally,jordan concedes that seven other days are properly excluded from the clock.excluding those seven days and the entire period following entry of the august continuance,there were only countable days toward a speedy trial act violation because the maximum delay provided in b was not exceeded,we conclude that there was no violation of the speedy trial act.
taint of illegal seizure 
for the first time on appeal,jordan argues that the evidence seized from his vehicle was obtained incident to an arrest that was without probable cause in violation of the fourth amendment.under rule e of the federal rules of criminal procedure,a party waives any pretrial objection or defense that is not raised before the trial court deadline.e.rule e allows the court to grant relief from waiver for good cause.id.but this court has held that when a defendant completely fails to file a pretrial motion to suppress evidence,we are categorically without jurisdiction to hear appeals of suppression issues raised for the first time on appeal.united states crismon,cir see also united states,cir.
here,jordan not only completely failed to file a pretrial motion to suppress evidence based on his arrest and search,but also affirmatively waived the issue on the record by declining to file a motion to suppress after being urged to do so by former counsel and questioned by the district court about his failure to heed counsel advice.at the status conference on november at which jordan obtained the court permission to represent himself,michael flanagan,who had just been relieved from his representation of jordan,told the court that he was concerned about jordan decision not to file a motion to suppress the evidence seized in jordan initial arrest.at status conference tr.at.the district judge confirmed with jordan that he had discussed the matter with his former counsel and that he had chosen to not file a motion to suppress.at status conference tr.at.when asked why he would not file a motion to suppress,jordan replied,it just time for me to go to trial.at status conference tr.at.the judge then asked,even though you may have a valid motion to suppress that would suppress evidence that is damaging to you jordan replied,that correct.id.
in conclusion,because jordan refused to file a pretrial motion to suppress,he conclusively waived any challenge on appeal to the evidence seized incident to his arrest.
denial of standby counsel 
jordan argues that the district court erred in refusing to appoint standby counsel to assist him at trial after jordan obtained removal of his second appointed counsel,michael flanagan,eight days before trial.it is undisputed that jordan knowingly and voluntarily exercised his sixth amendment right to represent himself pursuant to faretta california,d.after jordan requested removal of flanagan on november,the court held a hearing on november,and permitted jordan to represent himself.at status conference tr.at.after granting that request,the court informed jordan that he could choose either to proceed to trial as scheduled eight days later without standby counsel,or alternatively accept a continuance of the trial date to allow standby counsel adequate time to become familiar with the case.id.after explaining the options,the court asked jordan,do you want to postpone the trial and have standby counsel,or do you want to have a trial next tuesday id.jordan replied,i would rather have the trial next tuesday.id.
clearly,if jordan had accepted the district court reasonable offer of a continuance,the court would have appointed standby counsel.we conclude,therefore,that jordan voluntarily waived any right he might have had to standby counsel by refusing the district court offer to grant a continuance giving standby counsel adequate time to become familiar with the case.
discovery violations under rule 
we review a district court decisions under rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure for abuse of discretion.united states muhammad,cir,cert.denied,d.rule provides that the government,upon request by a defendant,must permit the defendant to inspect and to copy or photograph papers or tangible objects if the item is within the government possession,custody,or control and is material to preparing the defense,intended for use in the government case in chief,or was obtained from or belongs to the defendant.a e.if the district court finds that a violation of rule has occurred,it has discretion to impose a number of sanctions,including ordering discovery,granting a continuance,excluding the undisclosed evidence,or granting any other order that is just under the circumstances.d.
jordan argues that the district court erred in not granting,sua sponte,a continuance of the trial date upon learning at the pretrial conference on november that jordan had not been provided with certain documents that the government intended to introduce into evidence.at the pretrial conference on november,jordan asserted that he had not been provided copies of phone and debit card records that the government intended to introduce as business records.at pretrial conference tr.at.but the court found that these documents had previously been made available to jordan former counsel,michael flanagan,in a timely manner,and that only the certifications attached thereto were newly produced.at pretrial conference tr.at.flanagan apparently did not make copies of these documents,and therefore the packet that he provided to jordan did not contain them.id.the court offered jordan a continuance to give him time to review the documents,but jordan refused and decided to proceed to trial the next day.at pretrial conference tr.at.later in the hearing,jordan asked for a continuance,but when told that this would entail delay of his trial,jordan again chose to proceed to trial the next day.at pretrial conference tr.at.
jordan now complains on appeal that the district court erred in forcing him to choose between either accepting a continuance or proceeding promptly to trial.specifically,jordan argues that the district court improperly sought to force him to sign a speedy trial waiver before it would grant a continuance.jordan br.at.but the district court here sought no such waiver.instead,it merely sought to accommodate a pro se defendant on the eve of trial by offering him a continuance that would have given him more time to familiarize himself with the government evidence.consistent with rule,the district court jordan remedy that was just under the circumstances.d d.
jordan also argues that the district court erred in admitting into evidence several documents that jordan claims the government failed timely to provide during discovery.specifically,jordan asserts that he did not receive seven documents prior to,and that the district court failed to fashion appropriate relief pursuant to rule.the government responds,first,that there was no rule violation because all of these documents were promptly provided to either jordan or jordan former counsel,flanagan,who had the opportunity to photocopy any documents he thought necessary.in the alternative,the government argues that,even if there were discovery violations for documents,the district judge fashioned appropriate remedies pursuant to rule d,including offering jordan continuances and ordering prompt provision of documents to jordan.
first,there is no indication in the record that the district court admitted into evidence any document that was not promptly disclosed to either jordan or his former counsel.before the jury was brought in on the second day of trial,the court reviewed each of the seven documents that jordan had not previously received.the district court excluded exhibit and a portion of exhibit that had been provided late.trial tr.at.the government never offered exhibit into evidence.the court found that exhibit check from ameren ue billing for the virtual office at office suites been provided to former counsel flanagan well in advance of trial.at trial tr.at.with respect to both exhibit an email from gerald hurt to sarah bottoms of office suites plus and exhibit another fraudulent flyer,sent to a bmw dealership,the court accepted the government explanations as to why the documents had been obtained late by the government and therefore provided late to jordan.at trial tr.at.finally,inspector dorroh testified that he had previously provided a copy of exhibit a money order used to pay the original fees at office suites plus to jordan former counsel flanagan.at trial tr.at.
even assuming that one or more of these documents were not timely disclosed to jordan,the district court repeatedly sought to accommodate jordan using the discretionary relief authorized by rule d,including offering continuances,granting an early recess on the first day of trial,and ordering the government to provide additional photocopies to jordan of documents that he did not have.as discussed above,at the pretrial conference on november when jordan informed the court that certain documents had not been disclosed,the court offered jordan a continuance to give him time to review the documents,which jordan refused.at pretrial conference tr.at.on the first day of trial before the jury was empaneled,the court again offered jordan a continuance to review the government documents,which jordan again refused.trial tr.at.later in the first day of trial,after jordan asserted that he had not received several documents,the district judge ordered the government to provide jordan with marked copies of every document it intended to introduce,at trial tr.at,and then ordered an early recess to give jordan additional time to review the documents,at trial tr.at.
in sum,even assuming arguendo that there were discovery violations,the district court did not abuse its discretion in fashioning relief under rule for any violations that may have occurred.
notice under federal rule of evidence 
jordan argues that the government failed to provide timely notice under federal rule of evidence of its intent to offer phone records corresponding to the phone found in jordan car.rule provides that a party seeking to introduce a business record into evidence 
must provide written notice of that intention to all adverse parties,and must make the record and declaration available for inspection sufficiently in advance of their offer into evidence to provide an adverse party with a fair opportunity to challenge them.
on the first day of trial,jordan objected that he had received a notice of the government intention with respect to records for the number,but had received no records for that number and instead had received records for.at trial tr.at.the district court concluded that this was due to a typographical error in the notice provided to jordan and ordered the government to file a corrected notice with the proper phone number.at trial tr.at.on the second day of trial,jordan objected that he had not yet received the corrected notice.at trial tr.at.the ausa explained that he had filed the corrected notice after trial was recessed on the first day,but had no way of serving jordan electronically in jail.at trial tr.at.the court then admonished the ausa,well,then you serve him the minute you see him you do wait for the court to instruct you to serve him with something that you filed in the
