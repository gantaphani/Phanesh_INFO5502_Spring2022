opinion of the court 
this appeal requires us to consider a bankruptcy ability to invoke the discovery rule to toll the statutes of limitations on the debtor claims arising out of its lawyer embezzlement of estate funds.the bankruptcy and district courts here found that despite the lawyer embezzlement and of such embezzlement to his client,the debtor,the debtor could not,as a matter of law,establish that it acted with reasonable diligence in ferreting out the embezzlement that formed the basis of its causes of action.
because we believe that the decisions below establish a policy that fosters lawyers abuse of their fiduciary relationships with their clients,and fail adequately to protect the justifiable reliance of clients on their lawyers probity and trustworthiness,we will reverse and remand for further proceedings concerning the applicability of the discovery rule to the debtor claims against its lawyer law firm and the law firm individual shareholders.we will affirm the grant of summary judgment in continental bank favor,however,on the alternative ground that pennsylvania uniform fiduciaries act,which immunizes banks from liability arising out of good faith transfers of funds,shields continental from liability because it transferred the eventually embezzled funds in good faith to an authorized recipient,the debtor lawyer.we will also affirm the grant of summary judgment in favor of continental and the debtor law firm on the breach of fiduciary duty claims under erisa.
background 
the claims in this appeal arise out of the embezzlement of funds belonging to the bankruptcy estates of mushroom transportation company,mtc and related debtor companies,robbey realty,penn york realty company,trux enterprises,and leazit,collectively mushroom by jonathan ganz,legal counsel to the bankruptcy estates.mushroom,through its trustee,and various pension plans and their administrators the pension plan plaintiffs together with the trustee,appellants,instituted claims in two adversary proceedings against continental bank pincus,verlin,hahn reich,pvhr the law firm with which ganz was a partner,and various of pvhr individual shareholder lawyers collectively defendants and appellees,seeking to hold them liable for the consequences of ganz embezzlement.
mtc and its related subsidiaries and entities filed petitions under chapter of the bankruptcy code on june.the bankruptcy court ordered that the petitions of the related entities be jointly administered.by virtue of the chapter petitions,mushroom became the,and remained such until december,when the bankruptcy was converted to a chapter proceeding.the events relevant to this appeal occurred during the chapter bankruptcy,prior to the chapter conversion.
mushroom retained the services of pvhr,through ganz,to provide legal representation during the course of the bankruptcy proceedings.within six months of the filing of the chapter petitions,mushroom ceased operations and began to liquidate assets.on february,the bankruptcy court appointed michael arnold,mtc executive vice president,special liquidation consultant to assist in the liquidation,and mushroom proceeded under his leadership to liquidate a significant portion of assets.
mushroom allocated a large percentage of the liquidation proceeds to satisfying a substantial debt owed to continental,a secured creditor who held a perfected security interest in all of mushroom assets.on june,following repayment of some of the debt to continental,the bankruptcy court,with the consent of the parties,authorized the opening of an escrow account at continental to hold the balance of proceeds generated from the sale of mushroom assets not yet paid to continental.
in a letter to ganz dated february,arnold informed ganz that he arnold and robert cutaiar,mtc president,were handling the operations of the debtors.the letter requested an accounting of the proceeds of one of mushroom realty sales and a report of mushroom assets held by continental,and informed ganz that arnold anticipated a further reduction in his arnold involvement in the bankruptcy proceedings by march of.ganz responded to arnold letter by correspondence dated february,which stated that continental held approximately in various escrow accounts,and that pvhr held additional funds for the final real estate settlements in escrow accounts.
in june,continental and pvhr,as counsel to mushroom,entered into a bankruptcy payment stipulation the stipulation,which ganz signed on behalf of pvhr as counsel to debtors.the stipulation provided for the repayment of the balance of the debt owed to continental from the funds held in the escrow account at continental.once mushroom satisfied its debt to continental,the stipulation required continental to turn over any remaining funds in the escrow account to pvhr,to be held in escrow for the benefit of the debtor estate in september,at ganz urging,the bankruptcy court excused mushroom from the statutory requirement to file monthly operating statements.
pursuant to the stipulation,and following satisfaction of the debt owed to it,continental issued a treasurer check dated july,payable to ganz,council sic for debtor in possession.on august,continental deposited the remaining balance into an escrow account at continental that had been opened by ganz under the name of mtc,with jonathan ganz,pvhr,as escrow agent for mushroom.
between august,and april,ganz misappropriated more than million dollars of the transferred funds.in the interim,arnold had contacted ganz on several occasions inquiring about the transferred funds.in late or early,arnold requested from ganz an accounting of the mushroom estate assets.ganz responded by sending arnold a copy of the stipulation in a february,correspondence.arnold replied on february,writing that ganz sending a copy of the stipulation did not clear up the problem of how much is being held and by whom.arnold correspondence also set forth his estimates of the assets remaining based on mushroom records and other numbers,and asked ganz to confirm the numbers.
there appears to have been some oral communication between arnold and ganz following the february,correspondence in which ganz assured arnold that the assets were invested in passbook certificates of deposit at various banks ganz testified that in this communication,he told arnold that there were funds in an approximate would recall the exact they were in cds and we were holding them.i was holding them.it is undisputed that arnold failed to request written confirmation of,or otherwise attempt to verify,ganz representations about the amount and location of the funds.
in january,the bankruptcy court approved the substantive consolidation of mtc and its related entities,at which time arnold was prepared to distribute the proceeds from the sale of mushroom assets.arnold called ganz to request that ganz start liquidating the certificates of deposit and escrow accounts he had said were held on behalf of mushroom by pvhr,but received no response.at the end of february,the united states trustee advised arnold that ganz was reportedly involved in the defalcation of other bankruptcy estates he had served as legal counsel.acting upon this information,arnold subsequently learned that ganz had absconded with the mushroom funds under ganz control.
ii.the adversary actions 
on october,arnold,by now the trustee hereinafter the trustee following mushroom conversion to chapter bankruptcy,filed adversary action the first adversary action on behalf of mushroom against ganz and pvhr.arnold later moved to amend his complaint to add continental as a defendant the bankruptcy court granted the motion,but refused to relate the amendment back to the date of the original complaint.the bankruptcy court also denied arnold motion to add pvhr individual shareholders as defendants,and refused to allow the pension plan plaintiffs to join the action as plaintiffs arnold,joined by the pension plan plaintiffs who had been prohibited from joining as plaintiffs in the first adversary action,filed a second adversary action,the second adversary action,on january.
together,the virtually identical complaints in the two adversary actions advanced eight claims against ganz,pvhr,pvhr individual shareholders,and continental,of which are the subject of this appeal count i by the trustee against pvhr and ganz,seeking turnover of estate property count ii by the trustee against pvhr,alleging breach of fiduciary duty as escrow agent counts iii and v by the trustee against continental,alleging breach of fiduciary duty for releasing property to ganz,and wrongful conversion of estate property count vi by the trustee against pvhr and continental,alleging breach of contract for violating the stipulation count vii by the trustee against pvhr individual shareholders,alleging negligent failure to ensure preservation of client assets and count viii by the trustee and pension plan plaintiffs against pvhr and continental,alleging breach of fiduciary duty under a of erisa as custodians of plan assets.
defendants moved for summary judgment on all counts in both adversary actions.defendants argued that all of the claims were barred by the applicable statutes of limitations and laches,and continental and pvhr argued that the erisa claim was legally insufficient because neither was a fiduciary within the meaning of the relevant erisa provision,a.
in separate opinions dated august,and october,the bankruptcy court granted summary judgment in favor of all defendants.the bankruptcy court found that the applicable statutes of limitations and laches principles under pennsylvania law barred the trustee turnover and common law claims,and that mushroom had failed to exercise reasonable diligence in uncovering these claims so as to toll the statutes of limitations and preclude laches.moreover,the bankruptcy court concluded,neither continental nor pvhr were fiduciaries susceptible to suit under erisa.
on appeal,the district court affirmed on essentially the same bases relied upon by the bankruptcy court.
iii.appellate jurisdiction 
continental suggests that we lack appellate jurisdiction over the district court disposition of appellants appeal in the second adversary action because appellants failed to specify in their notice the district court order supposedly disposing of the second adversary action.there is no question that appellants notice of appeal does not unmistakably indicate an intention to appeal from both of the district court orders affirming the bankruptcy court disposition of the two adversary actions.the notice specifies only the district court order dated september,and entered by the clerk on september,which affirmed the bankruptcy court august order the notice fails to specify the district court order dated september,and entered by the clerk on september,which affirmed the bankruptcy court october order.
when an appeal is taken from a specified judgment only or from a part of a specified judgment,the court of appeals acquires thereby no jurisdiction to review other judgments or portions thereof not so specified or otherwise fairly to be inferred from the notice as intended to be presented for review on the appeal.lusardi xerox,cir quoting elfman motors,chrysler,cir.but we may exercise appellate jurisdiction over an order not specified in a notice of appeal where there is a connection between the specified and unspecified order,the intention to appeal the unspecified order is apparent and the opposing party is not prejudiced and has a full opportunity to brief the issues.id.citation omitted.in determining whether a notice encompasses an unspecified order,we follow a policy of liberal construction of notices of appeal where the intent to appeal an unmentioned or mislabeled ruling is apparent and there is no prejudice to the adverse party.nationwide mut.ins.cosenza,cir citations omitted.
despite the notice failure to specify the order entered september,we will exercise appellate jurisdiction over both orders for several reasons.first,the caption of the notice references the bankruptcy court docket numbers for both adversary actions,reflecting an intent to appeal the district court disposition of the bankruptcy court rulings in both actions.moreover,the body of the notice identifies all plaintiffs and defendants in both of the adversary actions as appellants and appellees,respectively.because the claims in both adversary actions are virtually identical,and were disposed of by the district court based on the same reasoning,appellees can not contend that they are prejudiced by having to address an appeal concerning the district court order entered september.
guided by our liberal policy in construing notices of appeal,we conclude that the notice of appeal adequately communicates appellants intent to appeal the district court order entered september,and find no prejudice to appellees from an exercise of our jurisdiction over that order.we will therefore exercise appellate jurisdiction over both of the district court orders entered in this matter.
iv.standards of review 
we apply plenary review to a district court grant of summary judgment and assess the record using the same standards for summary judgment employed by the district court.farrell planters lifesavers,cir citation omitted.summary judgment is appropriate where the moving party can demonstrate that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the,draw ing all reasonable inferences in favor of the party.fields thompson printing,cir citation omitted.
discussion 
a.what law supplies the statutes of limitations applicable to the common law claims 
as a preliminary matter,the trustee submits that because the estate claims arise out of the wrongful transfer and subsequent embezzlement of a bankruptcy estate escrowed funds,they are governed by a federal common law of bankruptcy.the bankruptcy court noted that whether or not the trustee claims were state or federal in nature was unimportant because even if the claims were federal,state law would supply the applicable statutes of limitations pursuant to the supreme court directive that when congress has failed to provide a statute of limitations for a federal cause of action,a court borrows or absorbs the local time limitation most analogous to the case at hand.lampf,pleva,lipkind,prupis petigrow gilbertson,d citations omitted.this borrowing principle applies equally to federal common law actions.oneida county,oneida indian nation of new york state,d.along with state statutes of limitations,a borrowing court must also borrow from state law the relevant tolling principles.island insteel systems,waters,cir citations omitted.
the court in oneida indian nation pointed out that borrowing would be impermissible where the borrowed state limitations period interfered with federal policies.oneida indian nation,at.see also island insteel systems,at if borrowing an analogous statute of limitations from state law would frustrate or interfere with the implementation of national policies,courts must look to federal law for an analogous limitations period citations omitted.the trustee directs us to no authority suggesting that application of state statutes of limitations to the common law claims law claims asserted petition and based on any national policy in effecting the administration and reorganization of a bankruptcy estate.to the contrary,the bankruptcy code itself imposes a limitations period on claims seeking to avoid transfers of property of the bankruptcy estate.see d.thus,the suggestion that imposing limitations periods of two or more years on common law claims asserted,and based on misconduct,interferes with federal bankruptcy the bankruptcy code itself imposes a limitations period on certain claims based on simply without merit.we therefore agree with the bankruptcy and district courts that state law,specifically pennsylvania law supplies the statutes of limitations applicable to the trustee common law claims.
b.the applicable statutes of limitations and laches principles 
having determined that the bankruptcy and district courts correctly chose to apply or borrow pennsylvania statutes of limitations,we must assess the accuracy of those which they applied.in short,the bankruptcy and district courts correctly held that various statutes of limitations governed counts ii and iii breach of fiduciary duty,v wrongful conversion and vii negligence in each adversary proceeding,and that a statute of limitations period governed count vi breach of contract maillie greater delaware valley health care,breach of fiduciary duty bednar marino,conversion.citation omitted negligence.a breach of contract.
the bankruptcy and district courts also correctly determined the laches principles governing the turnover claim.the turnover claim set forth in count i arises under and the bankruptcy code does not impose a statute of limitations on turnover claims arising under these provisions.in re midway airlines,bankruptcy code does not contain a statute of limitations for turnover actions pursuant to in re bookout holsteins,same in re de berry,same.because turnover claims are equitable in nature,see walker weese,turnover claim fairly characterized as an equitable claim in re warmus,turnover claims,firmly rooted in protecting and preserving property of the estate,are clearly and uniquely equitable claims under the bankruptcy code citations omitted in re kabler,turnover is an equitable remedy,they are subject to laches.algrant evergreen valley nurseries.partnership,cir an action brought in equity is governed by the doctrine of laches.citing russell todd.see also erkins bryan,cir policies underlying the creation of federal equitable claims are not well served by applying rigid limitations therefore,federal courts considering federal equitable claims should rely on equitable principles.citing holmberg armbrecht.
the party asserting laches as a defensive bar must establish an inexcusable delay in bringing the action and prejudice.united states fire ins.asbestospray,cir citations omitted.to establish prejudice,the party raising laches must demonstrate that the delay caused a disadvantage in asserting and establishing a claimed right or defense the mere loss of what one would have otherwise kept does not establish prejudice.id.citation omitted.while statutes of limitations do not directly apply to equitable claims such as the turnover claim,a limitations period on an analogous claim for legal relief is highly relevant to a laches analysis.as we said in great atlantic pacific tea,cir,i f a statutory limitations period that would bar legal relief has expired,then the defendant in an action for equitable relief enjoys the benefit of a presumption of inexcusable delay and prejudice.in that case,the burden shifts to the plaintiff to justify its delay and negate prejudice.at citations omitted.
the bankruptcy and district courts concluded that the claim at law analogous to the trustee turnover claim arises under a,which creates a cause of action in a trustee to avoid an unauthorized transfer of estate property.section a claims are subject to d,which provides that a claims may not be commenced after the earlier of two years after the date of the transfer sought to be avoided or the time the case is closed or dismissed.d.the trustee turnover claim targets a transfer of funds by continental to ganz.section a expressly creates a cause of action by which to seek avoidance of transfers,a cause of action clearly analogous to the turnover claim here.consequently,great atlantic pacific tea dictates that we consult the statute of limitations applicable to a a period set forth in d in determining whether to shift to the trustee the burden of proving excusable delay and the absence of prejudice.
c.did mushroom fail as a matter of law to exercise reasonable diligence in uncovering ganz embezzlement 
the bankruptcy and district courts correctly found that,absent application of tolling principles,the common law tort and contract claims accrued no later than august of,when continental completed the transfer of funds to ganz per the stipulation.the bankruptcy and district courts further concluded correctly that the limitations period on the claim at law analogous to the turnover to a laches analysis under great atlantic pacific tea to run no later than april,the date on which ganz completed his embezzlement of the transferred funds.
the trustee primary against the application of the statutes of limitations and laches is that the discovery rule equitable tolling suspended the running of the statutes of limitations and thereby precluded the onset of laches until,when arnold and mushroom first discovered ganz defalcation of the funds.the bankruptcy and district courts held that,as a matter of law,mushroom through arnold and cutaiar failed to exercise due diligence in superintending ganz oversight of the funds,and therefore could not invoke either the discovery rule or equitable tolling to preserve its claims against all defendants.for the reasons that follow,we find that there are genuine issues of material fact concerning mushroom reasonable diligence for the to determine.
under pennsylvania discovery rule,the statute of limitations will not begin to run until the plaintiff reasonably knows,or reasonably should know that he has been injured,and that his injury has been caused by another party conduct.in re tmi,cir quoting cathcart keene indus.insulation,internal quotation marks omitted.the discovery rule will only toll the statute of limitations where the plaintiff shows that he or she has exercised reasonable diligence in ascertaining the existence of the injury and its cause.bohus beloff,cir.
similarly,equitable tolling will suspend the running of the statute of limitations where the defendant has actively misled the plaintiff respecting the plaintiff cause of action where the plaintiff in some extraordinary way has been prevented from asserting his or her rights or where the plaintiff has timely asserted his or her rights mistakenly in the wrong forum.oshiver levin,fishbein,sedran berman,cir citations omitted.like the discovery rule,equitable tolling requires the plaintiff to demonstrate that he or she could not,by the exercise of reasonable diligence,have discovered essential information bearing on his or her claim.id.at citation omitted.
in assessing the finding that mushroom failed as a matter of law to exercise reasonable diligence for purposes of the discovery rule and equitable tolling,we are guided by the general rule that such determinations are typically within the jury province unless the facts are so clear that reasonable minds can not differ melley pioneer bank,citation omitted.during the time of ganz defalcations,mushroom was in chapter bankruptcy,and was therefore a.see.as we recently pointed out,i n chapter cases where no trustee is appointed,a provides that the,the debtor management,enjoys the powers that would otherwise vest in the bankruptcy trustee.along with those powers,of course,comes the trustee fiduciary duty to maximize the value of the bankruptcy estate.official committee of unsecured creditors of cybergenics chinery,cir en banc.the fiduciary duty to maximize includes the duty to protect and conserve property in its possession for the benefit of creditors.in re marvel entertainment,cir citation omitted.thus,there is no question that mushroom,acting through its representatives arnold and cutaiar,had a fiduciary duty to protect and maximize the estate assets.
this duty formed the foundation for the bankruptcy and district courts reasonable diligence analysis.indeed,the bankruptcy and district courts essentially equated the fiduciary duty to safeguard assets with the duty of reasonable diligence and,finding a breach of the former,therefore found a breach of the latter.moreover,the courts held,mushroom could not escape the statutory fiduciary duty to protect and maximize by delegating such duty to legal counsel,where the delegation amounted to an abdication of that duty.the district court explained its distinction between permissible delegation and impermissible abdication 
although delegation of duties is one thing,abdication of responsibility is quite another.in this case,the debtors not only delegated to ganz the duty to collect the funds generated from the sale of assets,deposit them into the escrow account pursuant to an order of the court,and transfer the funds to the law firm account to be maintained pending further order of the bankruptcy court,but rather they surrendered totally their obligation to oversee the liquidation of the estate or to supervise,even in the most relaxed fashion,the activities of a retained professional.the bankruptcy code commands the debtor in possession or the trustee to be the captain of the debtor ship.see.while the debtor in possession may assign to others specific duties,it may not surrender the helm and let the debtor ship sail under someone else captaincy.
burtch ganz in re mushroom transp,footnote omitted.because mushroom abdicated its statutory duty to preserve the estate assets,the bankruptcy and district courts held,it could not possibly demonstrate reasonable diligence for purposes of the discovery rule.id.
in burtch security pacific bank oregon in re mushroom transp,a related case involving the same facts respecting ganz embezzlement and mushroom oversight,judge reed of the district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania reached a conclusion on reasonable diligence and the statute of limitations directly contrary to the one reached by the bankruptcy and district courts here.there,the trustee filed various claims against one of the banks that had allegedly received some of the funds embezzled by ganz.the district court found that summary judgment in the bank favor on the issue of reasonable diligence and the statute of limitations was inappropriate for several reasons.first,the court noted,delegation of debtor those performed,or intended to be performed,by ganz perfectly appropriate under,and indeed encouraged by,the bankruptcy code.accordingly,a reasonable debtor in possession would,in certain circumstances,entrust the care of liquid assets to a lawyer.id.at citation omitted.therefore,there is no legal basis to conclude that the delegation of core trustee duties to counsel for the estate by a debtor in possession is per se sufficient to show that the debtors in possession failed to exercise due diligence.id.
the district court then reviewed the record and found that in light of the fact that reliance on counsel is inherent in the bankruptcy code,the bankruptcy court invaded the province of the fact finder by depreciating the evidence that could persuade a trier of fact that a reasonable person in the circumstances of the mushroom debtors in possession would have relied on counsel and consequently failed to discover the thefts by ganz until a later date.id.at.several aspects of the record led the court to this conclusion.first,the distribution of estate assets was not an issue from early through august when ganz had completed his embezzlement because the bankruptcy proceedings were focused on motions to consolidate.rather,arnold and cutaiar devoted their energies to priority claims,which,according to arnold,were the source of major uncertainty concerning mushroom financial condition.second,arnold inquiries to ganz in february could have led a reasonable trier of fact to conclude that arnold efforts went beyond abdication of the debtor duty to preserve the estate assets and in fact constituted reasonable diligence for purposes of the discovery rule.finally,the bankruptcy court two orders in june and september provided ganz with nearly exclusive control over mushroom assets and removed any mechanism by which the court could monitor use of those funds.in the district court,a reasonable could find that a reasonably diligent person in these circumstances would have acted precisely as mushroom and its trustee did here.
we find much of judge reed analysis persuasive.first,the bankruptcy code contemplates and encourages the retention of professionals by debtors to facilitate a chapter reorganization.section states that the trustee and,therefore,the debtor in possession,with the court approval,may employ one or more attorneys to represent or assist the trustee in carrying out the trustee duties under this title.a.the code also provides for the compensation of such attorneys.these provisions reflect congress desire to encourage trustees to delegate their duties where such delegation would lower costs of administration.boldt united states trustee in re jenkins,cir citations and internal quotation marks omitted.a could thus conclude that mushroom decision to entrust its lawyer,ganz,with the task of safeguarding its assets was within the bounds of reasonableness.
still further,the bankruptcy court had issued two orders in june and september of entrusting mushroom assets to ganz.the june order approved the stipulation pursuant to which mushroom assets were to be turned over to ganz to hold in escrow.in arnold view,the june order prompted him to believe that mushroom assets were being invested in accordance with the special rules applicable to bankruptcy.the september order granted ganz motion to excuse mushroom from filing operating reports otherwise required by the bankruptcy code.in arnold view,the september order gave him no reason to expect that the absence of such reporting indicated that a lawyer had absconded with escrow funds just as they in fact appeared to lead arnold to believe that the assets were safe and there was no need to monitor them closely,these orders could have led a reasonable person to believe that there was no need to monitor them on his or her own.
in addition to these aspects of judge reed analysis,and perhaps most importantly,we find highly relevant the fact that the genesis of this action is ganz abuse of his fiduciary,relationship with mushroom,an abuse which very well could have caused mushroom to relax its vigilance in overseeing the execution of the duties it delegated to ganz.neither judge robreno nor judge reed expressly mentioned the principle manifesting itself in decisions from courts in this circuit and numerous other state and federal courts that where the wrongdoing underlying causes of action has been perpetrated by a fiduciary to the detriment of its principal,this fact militates strongly against summary judgment on the issue of whether the principal here mushroom exercised reasonable diligence in failing to discover the fiduciary malfeasance within the applicable statutes of limitations.
many judges in this circuit have recognized the impact of a fiduciary relationship,and abuse of that relationship by the fiduciary,on a discovery rule analysis.in schwartz pierucci,the trustee asserted claims against a bank in an effort to recover funds improperly drawn by principals and officers of the debtor from the debtor account at the bank.the district court denied the bank motion for summary judgment,rejecting its contention that the statute of limitations barred certain of the claims against it.specifically,the court found that the officers wrongful conduct tolled the applicable limitations period,reasoning that 
where a fiduciary commits an act of fraud against his principal,the statute of limitations will be tolled,since the very position the fiduciary is in prohibits the principal from uncovering the fraud.furthermore,the fiduciary,because of his position of trust,would have an affirmative duty to the principal to disclose the fraud.absent a disclosure,the fiduciary commits an act of continual covering up of the fraud.
id.at.the court noted that letters sent by counsel for the creditors to the trustee urging the trustee to investigate matters pertaining to the purloined funds might have imposed a duty to inquire upon the trustee,but whether or not the letters imposed a duty upon the trustee to investigate is a question of fact,which must be resolved by a trier of fact.id.
the district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania subsequently addressed schwartz in gurfein sovereign group.plaintiffs,investors and partners in real estate limited partnerships,brought fraud,breach of fiduciary duty and related claims against some of their general partners and related entities.in response to defendants statute of limitations defense,plaintiffs argued that because defendants were plaintiffs fiduciaries,plaintiffs causes of action did not accrue until they acquired actual knowledge of their injury.the district court found that we had not yet recognized an exception to the discovery rule in the context.id.at.nonetheless,he acknowledged that t he existence of a fiduciary relationship is relevant to the question of when a cause of action accrued.because of a fiduciary unique position of trust,the presence of a fiduciary relationship would be pertinent to the question of when a plaintiff duty to investigate arose.id.at citing,inter alia,schwartz.
the eastern district recognized the relevance of a fiduciary relationship to a discovery diligence analysis in rubin quinn moss heaney patterson,kennel.the plaintiff law firm sued one of its partners who had misappropriated client funds.the defendant asserted a limitations defense to plaintiff breach of fiduciary duty claim.the district court held that the discovery rule preserved the breach of fiduciary duty claim largely because of the fiduciary relationship existing between the firm and its partners.the court concluded that 
given defendant position as a fiduciary of the firm,and the complexity of the real estate transactions which gave rise to the real estate accounts,the court concludes that plaintiff did exercise due diligence in its oversight of defendant management of the accounts first as an employee,and later as a partner,defendant sought and was accorded in return the trust of the firm partners.ironically,it is this type of very special relationship that enables a wayward fiduciary to engage in acts of concealment that cause the principal to relax vigilance or deviate from the right of inquiry.to require a principal to engage in aggressive oversight of its fiduciary conduct is to deny the very essence of a fiduciary relationship.
id.at citation omitted and first two alterations and emphasis supplied 
we should stress that we do not hold here that the existence of a fiduciary,relationship between ganz and mushroom,and ganz abuse of that relationship,alone preclude judgment as a matter of law in pvhr and its shareholders favor but as the district court noted in gurfein,the presence of a fiduciary relationship would be pertinent to the question of when a plaintiff duty to investigate arose.at citation omitted.ganz was no stranger to mushroom and was mushroom lawyer,bound by professional rules of ethics to the highest duties of honesty and probity in his dealings with his client.as the cases discussed above illustrate,the existence of a fiduciary relationship is relevant to a discovery rule analysis precisely because it entails such a presumptive level of trust in the fiduciary by the principal that it may take a smoking gun to excite searching inquiry on the principal part into its fiduciary behavior.
here,mushroom,through arnold,questioned ganz directly concerning the whereabouts of the transferred funds.arnold letter to ganz set forth estimates of mushroom assets based on mushroom records and other numbers.according to arnold,ganz responded to ganz letter that the assets were invested in passbook certificates of deposit at various banks ganz himself testified that he told arnold that there was a certain amount of assets under his supervision,though he could not recall the exact number he conveyed to arnold.
we do not suggest that arnold inquiries should serve as a model of vigilance for similarly situated.however,we believe that the facts the bankruptcy code encouragement that retain lawyers and other professionals to assist in their reorganization,and the existence of a relationship which ganz employed to conceal his defalcations at his client and its creditors genuine factual issues for the concerning whether arnold and mushroom exercised reasonable diligence in uncovering ganz embezzlement we therefore,with the exception of continental will reverse the grant of summary judgment in appellees favor on the claims and remand with instructions to the district court to remand the claims to the bankruptcy court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
is continental entitled to summary judgment on the alternative ground that pennsylvania uniform fiduciaries act shields it from liability 
while pvhr and its shareholders have advanced no arguments in support of affirmance beyond the statutes of limitations and laches,continental has asserted numerous alternative grounds supporting affirmance.of course,we may affirm the district court on grounds different from those relied on by the district court.kabakjian united states,cir citation omitted.and we will affirm summary judgment in continental favor because pennsylvania uniform fiduciaries act ufa immunizes continental from any liability flowing from its transfer of funds to ganz.
continental bases its argument on of the ufa,which provides that 
a person who,in good faith,pays or transfers to a fiduciary any money or other property,which the fiduciary as such is authorized to receive,is not responsible for the proper application thereof by the fiduciary,and any right or title acquired from the fiduciary in consideration of such payment or transfer is not invalid in consequence of a misapplication by the fiduciary.
a payment or transfer of money is done in good faith,within the meaning of this act,when it is in fact done honestly,whether it be done negligently or not.id.
in the leading case on,the supreme court of pennsylvania held that a bank in virtually the same position as continental could not be liable on a breach of contract theory.see robinson protective alarm bolger picker.there,a law firm opened an escrow account in its name on behalf of its client,robinson protective alarm.three partners of the law firm executed the signature card for the account.one of these partners eventually embezzled hundreds of thousands of dollars from the account.after compensating robinson for the embezzled funds,the law firm brought an action for indemnity or contribution against the bank.
the court of common pleas of philadelphia county and the pennsylvania superior court both held that the bank,by not obtaining endorsements prior to redeeming certificates relating to the account,had violated the redemption provisions set forth on the certificates,and had thereby committed a breach of contract.the pennsylvania supreme court reversed,finding that shielded the bank from liability because it disbursed funds from the account to the embezzling lawyer in good faith.the court began its analysis by distinguishing good faith in this context from bad faith 
even a failure to inquire under suspicious circumstances will not negate good faith,unless the failure to do so is due to a deliberate desire to evade knowledge because of a belief or fear that inquiry would disclose a vice or defect in the transaction.conversely,if a bank has knowledge that a fiduciary intends to appropriate trust funds to his own use,and that to release funds to him will aid a breach of trust,then the bank will be held to have acted in bad faith.
id.at citations omitted.
applying this view,the court noted that the embezzling lawyer was a fiduciary as to the escrow funds in question,and was empowered to receive them from the bank.after setting forth the purpose of to facilitate banking transactions by relieving a depositary of the responsibility of seeing that an authorized fiduciary will use entrusted funds for proper purposes the court concluded that t o apply a theory which would hold a payor liable for a minuscule and irrelevant departure from the prescribed procedure,where he has acted honestly in releasing money to a known authorized fiduciary,without knowledge of the latter intent to subsequently embezzle those funds,would clearly not contribute to the smooth flow of commerce sought to be achieved by the ufa.id.indeed,the court continued,in the absence of contrary knowledge on the depositary part,it the bank is entitled,if not bound,to presume that a fiduciary will properly apply funds released to him.id.at citations omitted.
here,the trustee has not directed us to any evidence in the record demonstrating that continental acted in bad faith in transferring the funds to ganz,nor could we locate any on our own.the trustee does suggest,however,that continental is not entitled to
