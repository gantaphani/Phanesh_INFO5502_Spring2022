held the clock in begins to tick when the fraud occurs,not when it is discovered.
a this is the most natural reading of the statute.in common parlance a right accrues when it comes into existence.united states lindsay.the standard rule is that a claim accrues when the plaintiff has a complete and present cause of action.wallace kato.such an understanding appears in cases and dictionaries from the century,when the predecessor to was enacted.and this reading sets a fixed date when exposure to the specified government enforcement efforts ends,advancing the basic policies of all limitations provisions repose,elimination of stale claims,and certainty about a plaintiff opportunity for recovery and a defendant potential liabilities.rotella wood.
b the government nonetheless argues that the discovery rule should apply here.that doctrine is an exception to the standard rule,and delays accrual until a plaintiff has discovered his cause of action.merck reynolds.it arose from the recognition that something different was needed in the case of fraud,where a defendant deceptive conduct may prevent a plaintiff from even knowing that he or she has been defrauded.ibid.thus where a plaintiff has been injured by fraud and remains in ignorance of it without any fault or want of diligence or care on his part,the bar of the statute does not begin to run until the fraud is discovered.holmberg armbrecht.this court,however,has never applied the discovery rule in this context,where the plaintiff is not a defrauded victim seeking recompense,but is instead the government bringing an enforcement action for civil penalties.the government case is not saved by exploration united states.there,the discovery rule was applied in favor of the government,but the government was itself a victim it had been defrauded and was suing to recover its loss.it was not bringing an enforcement action for penalties.
there are good reasons why the fraud discovery rule has not been extended to government civil penalty enforcement actions.the discovery rule exists in part to preserve the claims of parties who have no reason to suspect fraud.the government is a different kind of plaintiff.the sec very purpose,for example,is to root out fraud,and it has many legal tools at hand to aid in that pursuit.the government in these types of cases also seeks a different type of relief.the discovery rule helps to ensure that the injured receive recompense,but civil penalties go beyond compensation,are intended to punish,and label defendants wrongdoers.emphasizing the importance of time limits on penalty actions,chief justice marshall admonished that it would be utterly repugnant to the genius of our laws if actions for penalties could be brought at any distance of time.adams woods,cranch.yet grafting the discovery rule onto would raise similar concerns.it would leave defendants exposed to government enforcement action not only for five years after their misdeeds,but for an additional uncertain period into the future.and repose would hinge on speculation about what the government knew,when it knew it,and when it should have known it.deciding when the government knew or reasonably should have known of a fraud would also present particular challenges for the courts,such as determining who the relevant actor is in assessing government knowledge,whether and how to consider agency priorities and resource constraints in deciding when the government reasonably should have known of a fraud,and so on.applying a discovery rule to government penalty actions is far more challenging than applying the rule to suits by defrauded victims,and the court declines to do so.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit 
chief justice roberts delivered the opinion of the court.
the investment advisers act makes it illegal for investment advisers to defraud their clients,and authorizes the securities and exchange commission to seek civil penalties from advisers who do so.under the general statute of limitations for civil penalty actions,the sec has five years to seek such penalties.the question is whether the clock begins to tick when the fraud is complete or when the fraud is discovered.
