in july,ssa notified hayes by mail that it had approved her application for benefits.the agency paid hayes in retroactive benefit payments and awarded her prospective monthly payments of.

ssa special agents subsequently engaged in an undercover operation during which different agents visited eglash and hayes coffee shop eight times.the agents engaged in conversation with eglash and hayes and recorded their interactions.the agents observed eglash and hayes prepare and serve meals and drinks to customers without any sign of disability.they noted that eglash movements were fluid and normal with no indication of discomfort,and hayes was personable,gregarious,and very pleasant.on the agent undercover video,eglash claims that he walks everywhere,enjoys long bike rides,and sometimes plays basketball.he also says that he works at the coffee shop every day from am to pm and boasts about how he was the most efficient volunteer to paint a local church.and contrary to eglash claim to ssa that hayes could not drive or go outside alone,the video shows hayes walking out of the coffee shop alone while telling eglash that she was about to drive to a business meeting.

there are two elements in mail fraud having devised or intending to devise a scheme to defraud or to perform specified fraudulent acts,and use of the mail for the purpose of executing,or attempting to execute,the scheme or specified fraudulent acts.schmuck united states.the relevant question at all times is whether the mailing is part of the execution of the scheme as conceived by the perpetrator at the time,regardless of whether the mailing later,through hindsight,may prove to have been counterproductive and return to haunt the perpetrator of the fraud.id.at.we have held that where the execution of the scheme as conceived by the defendant depended on a mailing,that mailing constitutes an essential step of the scheme and offers sufficient basis for a mail fraud conviction.united states jinian,cir quoting schmuck,at.
we recently revisited this framework in united states brown,cir.brown concerned a scheme in which the defendant bankruptcy petition falsely claimed little or no income in recent years,underreported assets,and listed a fictitious loan for million.id.at.as a result of the false claims in the petition,the bankruptcy trustee abandoned efforts to recover debts owed to creditors and the defendant received a discharge.id.we relied on schmuck and observed that the government had introduced evidence establishing notice of discharge is essential to the bankruptcy process and a discharge is the golden ring that people want in a bankruptcy.it a declaration that all debts that are dischargeable are discharged and the debtor no longer personally owned any of the debt.id.at.in light of this evidence,we concluded t here was sufficient evidence of the mailings importance to the bankruptcy fraud scheme and the court mailing of the bankruptcy notices was incident to an essential part of the scheme,or a step in the plot.id.quoting schmuck,at.
in the instant case,count arises from the notice of disability award that ssa mailed to hayes.that mailing informed hayes that the agency had determined that she was entitled to monthly disability benefits beginning november.it also indicated that hayes would receive prospective monthly payments and retroactive payments for qualifying past months.hayes and eglash designed their scheme in the hope of defrauding the government into paying them disability benefits,and eglash offered false statements to support hayes application and perpetuate the scheme.the result here is compelled by our decision in brown.the notice of discharge in brown was the penultimate step in the fraudulent scheme because the notice enabled the defendant to evade his debts to his creditors,which was his ultimate goal.similarly,the notice of disability award marked the last step before hayes would receive disability benefit payments,the goal of her fraudulent plan with eglash.although the government,not the defendant,mailed the notice of discharge in brown and the noti
