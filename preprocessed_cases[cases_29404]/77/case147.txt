having been convicted for fraud,toby wayne goss contests only the loss calculation used in determining his advisory guidelines sentencing range for his scheme.at issue is whether,when computing that range,the fair market value of the collateral for each of the loans involved in the scheme should have been credited against loss to the victim.applying a rule,the district court,except for goss loan,did not permit such deduction.affirmed in part vacated and remanded in part.
from about to,goss,a mortgage lender,conspired with others to commit mail and wire fraud by preparing and submitting false documents to induce lenders to make loans totaling over million to borrowers who may not have been qualified for them otherwise.goss and his created false verifications of deposit and rent,irs forms,and social security benefit letters and provided them to lenders to obtain the mortgages.
additionally,they conspired to launder money by converting some of the proceeds for their own use and benefit.an unindicted issued checks to fictitious creditors for some of the fraudulently obtained loans and forwarded them to goss.goss also received fees for each fraudulently obtained loan.
goss was indicted on counts of fraud in the process.the charges included conspiracy to commit mail wire fraud,in violation of wire fraud,in violation of conspiracy,under h promotion,in violation of a a i engaging in financial transactions involving proceeds from a specified unlawful activity,in violation of and a count,under.he pled guilty to counts one through in march.
goss was sentenced under the version of the sentencing guidelines.under guideline,the advisory calculation is dependent upon the amount of financial loss to the victims here,the lenders.the calculated loss is to be the greater of actual or intended loss,app.a application note a in the current version of the guidelines.
on october,well in advance of the august sentencing hearing,the district court granted the government oral motion for the court to rule on issues regarding the appropriate method for calculating goss sentence.the government asserted,inter alia the intended loss was more than the actual loss and,for the intended loss,pursuant to united states morrow,cir,the court should use the full value of the subject loans,excepting for goss loan,rather than deduct the value of the collateral.
in morrow,the defendants had engaged in a scheme similar to the instant appeal,but that scheme involved loans to owners.our court held it was not clear error for the district court to find the defendants were consciously indifferent or reckless concerning repayment of the loans and,therefore,it was appropriate for the intended loss to include the full amount of the loans.id.at.
accordingly,for goss sentencing,the government contended in district court that our circuit precedent recognizes that,when a defendant has no ownership interest in or control over collateral,the amount of the collateral need not be subtracted from the loan amount.united states sanders,cir.goss countered morrow was distinguishable because it involved mobile homes,a type of collateral that is movable and depreciates quickly on the other hand,the loans linked to goss involved secure,immovable real property,known to appreciate in value even if a borrower were to default,the lender would still own the collateral and,in such a situation,the sentencing guidelines provided clear direction,stating that,i n a case involving collateral pledged or otherwise provided by the defendant,loss shall be reduced by the fair market value of the collateral at the time of sentencing.app.e emphasis added.
in support,goss pointed to the federal sentencing guidelines handbook to contend that collateral pledged or otherwise provided by the defendant was not to be interpreted as limiting credits to collateral for which the defendant himself is pledgor.roger haines,et,federal sentencing guidelines handbook text and analysis ed.hereinafter handbook.goss further distinguished morrow by again pointing to the handbook,which states i mmovable collateral such as real estate properly pledged to the victim will virtually always be credited against loss id.at emphasis added.
as a result,goss asserted the loan amount represented neither actual nor intended loss the intended loss was zero and,as such,an calculation should be employed.therefore,goss maintained,the correct valuation would be to subtract the collateral amount from the value of the loans and hold the difference to be the actual loss.and,according to goss,because most of the loans were,the actual loss would ultimately be only the broker fees and improper payments goss received.
at a hearing in july,both sides urged their positions on the appropriate method of calculating loss amount.afterward,the district court rejected goss position and agreed with the government that the intended loss was the full value of the loans,except for goss personal loan.
on august,goss was sentenced,inter alia,to months imprisonment as to each of counts one through,to run concurrently.the basis for this sentence was reflected in the district court august order that the entire amount of the fraudulent loans was the appropriate amount of intended loss,applying a credit solely for the one loan for which goss was also the borrower.it concluded the full amount of the loans was the financial risk engendered by goss conduct and,as such,the law of this circuit counseled intended loss was the appropriate calculation.it further determined that,other than his loan,goss had no ownership interest or control over the collateral and,in such situations,circuit precedent compelled a ruling that no credit or offset for the value of the collateral was available.
although,the sentencing guidelines are advisory only,and an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an standard,the district court must still properly calculate the guideline sentencing range for use in deciding on the sentence to impose.gall united states,d.in that respect,its application of the guidelines is reviewed de novo its factual findings,only for clear error,united states,cir united states villegas,cir.
goss contends the district court erred by not deducting the collateral value in its calculation,resulting in an inflated loss amount for the mail and wire fraud charges group one,and thus an inflated offense level.additionally,he asserts the inflated loss amount for the charges resulted in an inflated offense level for his charges group two,because the offense level for the charges was dependent upon a proper calculation of the offense level.a.
goss does not premise his challenge on the district court factual findings instead,he challenges its ruling that the collateral value of the loans should not be deducted for its loss calculation.because goss contentions are based upon the court application of the guidelines,our review is de novo,at.
in reviewing de novo the district court application of the advisory guidelines,the issue at hand is whether,for each loan,the collateral value should be deducted from the loan total value.in making this determination,we must first decide whether an actual or framework is appropriate for calculating the victims losses.
as noted,the guidelines direct that,when assessing the financial losses suffered,the amount to be used should be the greater of actual loss or intended loss.app.a.actual loss is the reasonably foreseeable pecuniary harm that resulted from the offense.a i.intended loss,on the other hand,i means the pecuniary harm that was intended to result from the offense and ii includes intended pecuniary harm that would have been impossible or unlikely to occur,as in a government sting operation,or an insurance fraud in which the claim exceeded the insured value.a ii.moreover,to determine intended loss,actual,not constructive,intent is considered.morrow,at.
section of the advisory guidelines provides the starting point in determining the appropriate loss calculation.see.for the applicable version of the guidelines,the following is provided by that section application note e ii which,as noted supra,has since been application note e ii in a case involv
