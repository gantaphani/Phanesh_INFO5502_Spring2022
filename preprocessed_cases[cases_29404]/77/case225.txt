background 
farrington formed converge now,llc in august,as a wireless internet service provider for the midwestern united states.farrington represented that converge now had an agreement with american tower company to lease tower space from dozens of towers to transmit converge now wireless signal throughout the relevant coverage area.converge now advertised its services in the des moines register and with various radio stations in des moines,iowa,and louis,missouri in late and expanded its advertising into radio markets in oklahoma city,kansas city,dallas,and chicago in early potential customers were told that converge now subscribers would begin receiving wireless internet service within days after payment of a equipment installation fee of and the first month service fee of were paid.
converge now accepted payment from hundreds of subscribers,mostly by credit card,but later only two customers that actually received wireless service could be confirmed.in fact,converge now had never obtained a tower lease agreement with american tower company,or any other tower company,and was incapable of providing the services it advertised.moreover,converge now double or many subscribers credit cards for the undelivered wireless services.after complaints,some subscribers received refunds from converge now,and others received a or reimbursement to their credit cards by the merchant account holders that processed converge now credit card transactions.but,many subscribers never recouped their subscription and service fees.in addition,converge now merchant account holders sustained losses as a result of farrington failure or refusal to reimburse them for the subscriber.
converge now billed approximately customers for wireless internet service that it never provided additionally,the government presented evidence that converge now failed to pay certain equipment suppliers and radio advertisers.the government brought charges on behalf of of the individual converge now subscribers whose credit cards had been charged multiple times for unprovided services.the grand jury indicted farrington on counts of wire fraud,in violation of.after a six day trial,the jury found farrington guilty on of the counts.
at sentencing,the district court set farrington base offense level at,then applied four guidelines enhancements,raising the offense level to.specifically,the court added a enhancement under b g because the loss was between and a enhancement under b b because the offense involved or more victims a enhancement under b c because the offense involved sophisticated means and a adjustment under for obstruction of justice because farrington committed perjury during his trial.with a total offense level of and a criminal history category i,farrington guidelines range was months.the court sentenced farrington to months imprisonment and ordered him to pay in restitution.
on appeal,farrington makes three arguments for reversal.he argues that the district court erred in allowing prejudicial evidence outside the scope of the indictment in calculating the loss and restitution amounts and in imposing an unreasonable sentence.
ii.discussion 
prejudicial evidence 
farrington contends that the district court erred in admitting evidence of unpaid vendors and certain unauthorized credit card charges.farrington argued to the district court that the evidence pertained to uncharged conduct and was unfairly prejudicial.the district court overruled farrington objection under rule of the federal rules of evidence,finding that the evidence was relevant to the issues of knowledge and intent and that the evidence tended to show that farrington could not provide the services he promised to provide in exchange for customer fees.the court determined that any prejudice created by the evidence was outweighed by its probative value.
federal rule of evidence defines relevant evidence as evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.relevant evidence is admissible but may be excluded under rule if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice,confusion of the issues,or misleading the jury.evidence is not unfairly prejudicial because it tends to prove guilt,but because it tends to encourage the jury to find guilt from improper reasoning.whether there was unfair prejudice depends on whether there was an undue tendency to suggest decision on an improper basis.united states looking cloud,cir quoting united states sills,cir citations omitted.simply because evidence is prejudicial does not mean that it must be excluded and great deference is given to the district court balancing of the probative value and prejudicial impact of the evidence.united states ruiz,cir internal citation omitted.we review the district court decision to admit evidence for abuse of discretion.looking cloud,at.
farrington was charged with counts of wire fraud.the essential elements of wire fraud are a scheme to defraud,the use of interstate wires incident to the scheme,and an intent to cause harm.united states edelmann,cir.intent to defraud may be inferred from all the facts and circumstances surrounding the defendant actions.united states schumacher,cir.consequently,the challenged evidence was admissible as it tended to show that farrington used converge now as a scheme to defraud and that farrington had the necessary intent to commit wire fraud.accordingly,giving deference to the district court balancing of the probative value and prejudicial impact of the evidence,ruiz,at,we hold that the court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the challenged evidence.see schumacher,at the mere fact that the evidence was unfavorable,is by no means so unfairly prejudicial as to be misleading and not aid and assist the jury in making a material determination in the case.internal quotations and citation omitted.
amount of loss enhancement 
farrington also contends that the district court erred in enhancing his offense level based upon the amount of loss.the district court determined that the loss from the fraudulent scheme totaled between and.farrington avers that the court miscalculated the loss because it should have only used the amount of loss specifically listed in the indictment for the counts for which he was convicted.we review the district court fraud loss findings for clear error as long as the determination is plausible in light of the record as a whole,clear error does not exist.united states coon,cir quoting united states jackson,cir.we note that under the advisory guidelines scheme,sentencing judges are only required to find facts by a preponderance of the evidence.united states scott,cir.
guidelines a establishes a base offense level of for farrington convictions,but b g mandates a enhancement if the loss is between and.the district court loss determination does not have to be precise the court only has to make a reasonable estimate of the loss.united states agboola,cir scott,at,cmt.c.w e accord particular deference to the loss determination because of the district court unique ability to assess the evidence and estimate the loss.scott,at.
the loss estimate may be based on the approximate number of victims multiplied by the average loss to each victim,cmt.c agboola,at.also,the loss may be based on more general factors,such as the scope and duration of the fraud and the revenues generated by similar operations.id.or,if the amount of loss can not reasonably be determined,the court may use the offender gain from committing the fraud as an alternative estimate.id.the amount of fraud loss for sentencing purposes is the greater of the loss the defendant i
