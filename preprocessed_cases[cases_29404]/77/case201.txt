jeffrey schroeder pleaded guilty to one count of tax preparer fraud and was sentenced to months imprisonment.schroeder appeals,arguing that the district court deprived him of his due process right to a fair sentencing hearing,used the wrong burden of proof in applying a sentencing enhancement based on relevant conduct and did not give adequate consideration to his argument for a sentence pursuant to a.because schroeder sentencing hearing was marred by several serious errors,we vacate his sentence and remand,noting that this marks the second time we have sent schroeder case back to the district court for resentencing.
background 
schroeder operated a tax preparation business out of his illinois home.in he was indicted and charged with counts of tax preparer fraud in violation of.in january,he pleaded guilty to one count of tax preparer fraud that caused a tax loss to the united states treasury of.in his plea agreement,schroeder admitted to preparing tax returns that included information he knew to be false about his clients itemized deductions.itemized deductions are listed on federal income tax form schedule by fraudulently overstating his clients schedule a deductions,schroeder was able to decrease his clients reported taxable income,yielding greater refunds than they were in fact entitled to.schroeder also admitted that he had assisted in the preparation of at least fraudulent tax returns for tax years,and.he also admitted that the false tax returns resulted in a total loss to the united states treasury of at least.but at his change of plea hearing,he asserted that the tax loss figure in the plea agreement was incorrect.the district court determined that the actual amount of loss would be determined at sentencing.
in april,the united states probation office prepared a investigation report psr,which assigned schroeder a criminal history category of iii.the psr based schroeder offense level in part on a tax loss of that was included in the plea agreement as well as an additional loss of.this additional amount was based on internal revenue service irs correspondence audits of of schroeder clients.the irs concluded that schroeder had overstated or misrepresented deductions on tax returns prepared on behalf of the audited clients,resulting in a tax loss of.the results of the audits were summarized in a spreadsheet that was provided to the probation office.the spreadsheet included the initials of the taxpayers,the year of the challenged return,the type of fraudulent itemized deduction,the amount of the fraudulently increased refund and the adjustment amount associated with the fraudulent itemized deductions.
the tax table in provides that a tax loss of over corresponds to an offense level of.the amount of loss that was originally included in the plea agreement corresponds to an offense level of.the psr increased schroeder base offense level due to specific offense characteristics and reduced it due to schroeder cooperation and acceptance of responsibility.after accounting for these adjustments,the psr concluded that the total offense level was.an offense level of and a criminal history category of iii yielded a sentencing range of to months.
schroeder filed a sentencing memorandum challenging the inclusion of the additional in the amount of loss calculation on the grounds that the materials supporting the additional tax loss had not been made available to the defense.he argued that his base offense level should be based on a tax loss of.after accounting for adjustments,using the lower tax loss amount would result in a total offense level of and a sentencing range of to months.he also asserted that his family circumstances justified a sentence below the guideline sentencing range.in particular,he claimed that his incarceration would impose a hardship on his adopted daughter,who was born with various medical problems arising from her biological mother drug abuse.the government filed a response to schroeder sentencing memorandum in which it asserted that although the individual tax returns underlying the additional tax loss had not been provided to defense counsel,the spreadsheet had been given to the defense.
at schroeder sentencing,the district court heard testimony from irs special agent zagota,who testified that,in the course of the criminal investigation,he had interviewed witnesses to determine the original tax loss of.although special agent zagota was not involved in the civil audits,he explained that the additional tax loss was ascertained via correspondence audits,in which the irs sent letters to schroeder clients inviting them to provide documentation supporting the itemized deductions on their tax returns.if they could not justify their deductions,their tax returns were adjusted accordingly.special agent zagota also opined that the total amount of loss was a conservative figure given that schroeder had prepared thousands of tax returns in and and that over percent of those returns claimed refunds.the court accepted the additional tax loss amount,declined to impose a sentence based on schroeder family situation and sentenced schroeder to months imprisonment and one year supervised release.
schroeder filed a notice of appeal on november,but a few months later,he and the government submitted a joint motion for summary reversal and remand based on the fact that the sentence imposed by the district court exceeded the statutory maximum of months.the motion stated 
the parties agree that it would be a waste of their resources and of the court resources to proceed through briefing and consideration of an appeal for a case that must be reversed and remanded for resentencing.
wherefore,it is respectfully requested that the judgment in this case be reversed and that the case be remanded to the district court for resentencing.
we granted the motion in a brief order,summarily reversing and remanding the case for the limited purpose of resentencing.
on remand,schroeder moved for an order requiring the government to produce the tax returns on which the additional amount of loss was based and for an order authorizing defense counsel to obtain expert services for the resentencing hearing.these motions were granted and the defense reviewed the underlying documents with expert assistance.in june,schroeder submitted a supplemental sentencing memorandum challenging the additional tax loss on the grounds that the civil audits did not represent a reliable method of assigning criminal liability.schroeder argued that the purpose of the civil audit was to collect unpaid taxes and that it was not designed to attribute responsibility for the improper deductions.some taxpayers did not respond to the irs invitation to defend their deductions and in those cases,he asserted,the irs assumed that schroeder was probably responsible for the false information.he pointed out that one taxpayer admitted that she had overstated her business expenses but that the government included the full amount of the liability resulting from her misrepresentation in calculating schroeder amount of loss.in addition,schroeder again argued that his unique family circumstances weighed in favor of a lower sentence.he informed the court that he had been the primary caregiver for his adopted daughter while his wife worked outside the home.he stated that after his incarceration,his daughter had to be placed in daycare.being in daycare is a risky proposition for the child because she has a weak immune system that makes her more vulnerable to infection than most children.in support of this argument for leniency,schroeder submitted a letter from his daughter pediatrician stating that she should not be placed in daycare.
schroeder resentencing hearing was held on november,and his tax loss and family circumstances arguments did not fare any better the second time around.at the commencement of the hearing,the judge stated that he had reviewed the memoranda submitted by the parties and determined that the amount is based on information that is of sufficient reliability that can properly be considered under the guideline provisions and thus,the total amount of loss was.schroeder attorney argued that many taxpayers who were the subject of a civil audit did not contest the deductions challenged by the irs and that the audits were performed to collect unpaid taxes,not to assign liability for the improper deductions.the court rejected schroeder argument and maintained its initial tax loss determination.addressing schroeder family circumstances argument,the court stated that because schroeder criminal acts caused his difficult family situation,family circumstances did not constitute a valid basis for imposing a lower sentence.after reviewing the factors set forth in a,the court imposed a sentence of months imprisonment.
ii.analysis 
before we reach the merits of schroeder challenges to his sentence,we briefly address the government contention that the district court committed plain error in considering schroeder arguments on the amount of loss issue and his family circumstances on remand.it is the government position that schroeder waived these issues by moving to remand his original sentence based solely on the fact that it exceeded the statutory maximum.the government argues that the issues schroeder now raises fall outside the scope of our remand and the district court should not have considered them.because the government did not object to the district court reopening of the sentencing issues on remand,it asserts that we should review the court decision to revisit these issues for plain error.plain error exists when there is an error which is clear or obvious and which affects substantial rights.united states otis,cir.an error affects substantial rights if it seriously affect s the fairness,integrity or public reputation of the proceedings.united states van allen,cir quoting united states jumah,cir alteration in original.
we are unpersuaded by the government plain error argument.first,it was not erroneous for the court to consider the amount of loss or family circumstances issue on remand.schroeder case was not subject to either of the primary limitations on the scope of a remand.the first limitation is that any issue that could have been but was not raised on appeal is waived and thus not remanded.united states husband,cir.when we granted the parties joint motion for summary reversal,schroeder first appeal was truncated before he had the opportunity to challenge the sentencing court rulings on the issues he now raises.this fact distinguishes his case from others where we have declined to allow a defendant to use the accident of a remand to raise in a second appeal an issue that he could just as well have raised in the first appeal.united states parker,cir see also united states swanson,cir,cert.denied,d same.
the second major limitation on the scope of a remand is that any issue conclusively decided by this court on the first appeal is not remanded.husband,at.in their joint motion to this court,the parties stipulated that it would be a waste of the court time to proceed through briefing and argument when the case obviously had to be remanded for resentencing.in response to the parties motion,we issued a brief order that neither explicitly nor implicitly constrained the district court authority to address contested issues at resentencing.in the absence of a mandate limiting the scope of resentencing,it was reasonable for the district court to revisit disputed sentencing issues.see parker,at t he scope of the remand is determined not by formula,but by inference from the opinion as a whole.united states polland,cir where our ruling specifically limited mandate on resentencing to particular sentencing issue,the district court was precluded from revisiting other sentencing issues on remand.moreover,even if we assume that the district court erred in reopening sentencing issues following our remand,the government has not established that any substantial rights were affected.thus,we take up schroeder arguments confident that considering them will not cast serious doubts on the integrity of these proceedings.
amount of loss 
schroeder appeals the district court determination that he was responsible for a total tax loss of,arguing that the court deprived him of his right to a fair sentencing hearing and did not hold the government to its burden of proof.amount of loss must be determined on the basis of the conduct of conviction and relevant conduct.united states frith,cir.r elevant conduct must be criminal or unlawful conduct id.the government has the burden of proving losses attributable to relevant conduct by a preponderance of the evidence.id.in this case,the government bore the burden of proving,by a preponderance of the evidence,that the unpaid taxes discovered through the civil audit were attributable to schroeder criminal or unlawful conduct.the amount of tax loss need not be determined with precision and a reasonable estimate will suffice.cmt.see also frith,at discussing amount of loss determination for offenses involving fraud or deceit.in considering relevant conduct,a district court may consider relevant information without regard to its admissibility under the rules of evidence applicable at trial,provided that the information has sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy.a.this rule applies to facts asserted in the psr as well,which a court may adopt as support for its findings and conclusions if they bear sufficient indicia of reliability to support their probable accuracy.united states taylor,cir quoting united states salinas,cir.
schroeder resentencing hearing was flawed from the outset.the district court commenced the hearing by announcing its findings on the amount of loss before allowing schroeder attorney to present any argument.the court stated that after reviewing the materials submitted by schroeder and the government,including the psr and sentencing memoranda submitted by schroeder attorney 
i do find that the additional amount,the amount,is based on information that is of sufficient reliability that can properly be considered under the guideline provisions.
so i find that the total amount of loss is as set out in the presentence investigation report.
although a district court is not always required to provide an evidentiary hearing in which the parties can argue sentencing issues,united states cantero,cir,the court is required to allow the parties attorneys to comment on the probation officer determinations and other matters relating to an appropriate sentence.i c.the district court announced its findings as to the amount of tax critical sentencing schroeder attorney had an opportunity to comment on the issue.schroeder attorney had to interrupt the court recitation of its loss findings to indicate that he intended to present testimony and argument disputing the amount of loss.although the court allowed him to offer evidence in the form of an offer of proof,whether the court gave the defense arguments the due consideration they deserved is questionable to say the least in light of the court conclusive pronouncement of its findings at the beginning of the hearing.indeed,the sentencing transcript suggests the court impatience with the defense challenges to the alleged tax loss.although due process does not guarantee a perfect sentencing hearing,it does guarantee a fair one.united states agyemang,cir.here,the fact that the district court prejudged the tax loss issue undermined the fairness of schroeder hearing.
that the district judge appears to have commenced resentencing with his mind made up about the tax loss issue may explain his apparent unwillingness or inability to understand defense counsel attempt to clear up serious confusion regarding the government burden of proof.the court statements at resentencing strongly suggest that it confused the standard for the admissibility of evidence at sentencing with that for proving relevant conduct,a very serious error.as we have already noted,it is well established that the government must prove amount of loss by a preponderance of the evidence.see united states omole,cir.the preponderance of the evidence standard requires that the believe that the existence of a fact is more probable than the of that fact.united states smith.in determining whether t
