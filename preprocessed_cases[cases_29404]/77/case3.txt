the securities and exchange commission sec or commission possesses authority to investigate violations of federal securities laws and to commence enforcement actions in federal district court if its investigations uncover evidence of wrongdoing.initially,the commission statutory authority in enforcement actions was limited to seeking an injunction barring future violations.beginning in the,federal district courts,at the request of the commission,began ordering disgorgement in sec enforcement proceedings.although congress has since authorized the commission to seek monetary civil penalties,the commission has continued to seek disgorgement.this court has held that,which establishes a limitations period for an action,suit or proceeding for the enforcement of any civil fine,penalty,or forfeiture,applies when the commission seeks monetary civil penalties.see gabelli sec.
in,the commission brought an enforcement action,alleging that petitioner charles kokesh violated various securities laws by concealing the misappropriation of million from four companies from to.the commission sought monetary civil penalties,disgorgement,and an injunction barring kokesh from future violations.after a jury found that kokesh actions violated several securities laws,the district court determined that limitations period applied to the monetary civil penalties.with respect to the million disgorgement judgment,however,the court concluded that did not apply because disgorgement is not a penalty within the meaning of the statute.the tenth circuit affirmed,holding that disgorgement was neither a penalty nor a forfeiture.

a the definition of penalty as a punishment,whether corporal or pecuniary,imposed and enforced by the state,for a crime or offen s e against its laws,huntington attrill,gives rise to two principles.first,whether a sanction represents a penalty turns in part on whether the wrong sought to be redressed is a wrong to the public,or a wrong to the individual.at.second,a pecuniary sanction operates as a penalty if it is sought for the purpose of punishment,and to deter others from offending in like manner rather than to compensate victims.ibid.this court has applied these principles in construing the term penalty,holding,that a statute providing a compensatory remedy for a private wrong did not impose a penalty,brady daly.
b the application of these principles here readily demonstrates that sec disgorgement constitutes a penalty within the meaning of.first,sec disgorgement is imposed by the courts as a consequence for violating public laws,a violation committed against the united states rather than an aggrieved individual.second,sec disgorgement is imposed for punitive purposes.sanctions imposed for the purpose of deterring infractions of public laws are inherently punitive because deterrence is not a legitimate nonpunitive governmental objectiv e.bell wolfish.finally,sec disgorgement is often not compensatory.disgorged profits are paid to the district courts,which have discretion to determine how the money will be distributed.they may distribute the funds to victims,but no statute commands them to do so.when an individual is made to pay a noncompensatory sanction to the government as a consequence of a legal violation,the payment operates as a penalty.see porter warner holding.
c the government responds that sec disgorgement is not punitive but a remedial sanction that operates to restore the status quo.it is not clear,however,that disgorgement simply returns the defendant to the place he would have occupied had he not broken the law.it sometimes exceeds the profits gained as a result of the violation.and,as demonstrated here,sec disgorgement may be ordered without consideration of a defendant expenses that reduced the amount of illegal profit.in such cases,disgorgement does not simply restore the status quo it leaves the defendant worse off and is therefore punitive.although disgorgement may serve compensatory goals in some cases,sanctions frequently serve more than one purpose.austin united states.because they go beyond compensation,are intended to punish,and label defendants wrongdoers as a consequence of violating public laws,gabelli,at,disgorgement orders represent a penalty and fall within limitations period.
