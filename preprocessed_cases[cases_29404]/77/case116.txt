luis flores was convicted by a jury of one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering in violation of,three counts of money laundering in violation of,and one count of conspiracy to structure currency transactions in violation of.the united states district court for the district of new jersey sentenced flores to a term of imprisonment.he timely appeals and,for the reasons provided below,we affirm 
factual and procedural background 
flores is an attorney who,after graduating from fordham law school,opened his own solo practice in the queens borough of new york city.in,he was visited in his office by german osvaldo altamirano.altamirano presented himself as an ecuadorian businessman eager to establish his flower,fruit,and seafood business in the united states.according to flores,a naturalized american citizen and native of chile,he was persuaded that altamirano was who he purported to be.flores had recently finished work on a matter for the republic of argentina,and was interested in developing a practice assisting south american businessmen.
over the next several years,flores opened several corporations for altamirano,ultimately naming himself as the nominal president of those companies.he also established several business checking accounts for each of the corporations at different banks,signed myriad blank checks drawn on those accounts,and authorized numerous from the accounts to various foreign and domestic recipients.ultimately,altamirano,flores and others were indicted for conspiracy to commit money laundering and other offenses.altamirano cooperated with the government and testified at flores trial.the government theory of the case was that flores was willfully blind to altamirano unlawful activities.the defense,on the other hand,argued that altamirano had deceived flores into believing that he was a legitimate businessman and that flores was altamirano unknowing victim and not his.
the following evidence was presented at trial.flores assisted altamirano in incorporating nine companies between december and june,and opening bank accounts on behalf of those corporations.in january,flores attempted to obtain tax identification numbers for three corporations using first one and then another social security number provided by altamirano,but in each instance flores was informed that the numbers were false.he warned altamirano about the unlawfulness of using invalid social security numbers,and offered to take steps to obtain valid numbers.instead,altamirano removed the corporate books from flores and gave them to victoria hernandez.altamirano paid hernandez per week to open corporations and manage his relationships with the banks.in april,altamirano learned that hernandez had been stealing from him.altamirano thus decided to return the books to flores,who agreed to open and oversee bank accounts for the corporations in exchange for the weekly salary that hernandez had received.flores was paid the each week in cash.
in early may,flores arranged for the incorporation of three new companies and opened an account for each of them at four banks republic national bank,european american bank,chase manhattan bank,and citibank.as noted previously,flores held himself out as the president of these corporations,and was the only person authorized to sign checks,transfer money,and act on behalf of the entities.for each checkbook,flores signed about to blank checks altamirano retained two or three of these checks to make transfers from one account to another,and sent the remaining checks to columbia.as soon as the accounts were opened,multiple cash deposits were made and money began to be wired in and out of the accounts and between accounts.individual deposits were always less than,but on any given day the aggregate amount deposited in any account could exceed.
just weeks after he had opened the new accounts,flores received a letter from republic national bank explaining what structured transactions are and why they are illegal,and informing him that when an account receives a large incoming wire transfer of money and immediately sends an outgoing wire or wires for approximately the same amount,without apparent commercial justification,it mirrors the activity of an account opened by money launderers.flores and altamirano were asked to attend an meeting at republic national bank in late may,at which they were expected to supply documentation of the source of the funds in the bank accounts.when they failed to do so,a bank employee requested they speak with the bank manager,thomas grippa.in response to grippa questions concerning the number of accounts and seemingly structured cash transactions,altamirano stated that he maintained multiple accounts to create the appearance for his ecuadorian suppliers that he had many profitable businesses and to get certain credits from the government of ecuador.he also explained that he was paid in cash by a customer at the hunts point produce market and that he had lost a lot of money after a hurricane delayed his ship and a large shipment of food spoiled.grippa testified that he did not accept any of these excuses.ultimately,both republic national bank and european american bank closed the accounts.flores told altamirano that he felt more comfortable working with citibank and chase,where he had personal contacts.
flores accountant,israel rivera,who was hired to perform work for altamirano in april due to the increasing difficulty of balancing altamirano books,testified that he asked flores for copies of invoices to document the source of funds in the accounts.he also reported that he had voiced concern to flores about large payments to european companies that bore no apparent relationship to the of fruit,flowers,and fish from ecuador.according to rivera,he received neither an explanation nor copies of invoices in response to his requests.
flores remained the sole signor and receiver of the companies multiple account statements for several additional months,during which approximately passed through the companies remaining bank accounts.it is undisputed that the cash was transferred via checks and wire transfers signed by flores to recipients in brokerage houses on the black market peso exchange.as a result of these activities,the government charged flores with conspiracy to launder money,money laundering,and conspiracy to structure currency transactions.a jury convicted flores on all counts.before the jury was discharged,the parties entered into a stipulation limiting the issues presented for the district court determination at sentencing.moreover,flores filed a motion for acquittal a new trial,which was denied.in january the district court sentenced flores to a term of imprisonment.this appeal followed.
was the evidence produced by the government at trial sufficient to prove that flores was willfully blind to the money laundering scheme 
we review the grant or denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal de novo,applying the same standard as the district court.united states brodie,cir.we must sustain the verdict if there is substantial evidence,viewed in the light most favorable to the government,to uphold the jury decision.united states gambone,cir.as we have made clear,a court must be ever vigilant in the context of.not to usurp the role of the jury by weighing credibility and assigning weight to the evidence,or by substituting its judgment for that of the jury.brodie,at see also united states jannotti,cir en banc trial court usurped jury function by deciding contested issues of fact.
flores argues that the government failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he knew or was willfully blind to the fact that the money laundered by altamirano either represent ed the proceeds of some form of illegal activity,a,or was criminally derived property,a.according to flores,t he only form of unlawful activity identified at trial was drug trafficking.yet the evidence the government presented was wholly insufficient to establish his knowledge of,or willful blindness to,the fact that the funds originated in drug trafficking or any other crime.
to prove conspiracy to commit money laundering,the government was required to show,inter alia,that flores consorted with others in a money laundering scheme,
knowing that the property involved in a financial transaction represent ed the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity and conduct ed or attempt ed to conduct such a financial transaction which in fact involves the proceeds of specified unlawful activity.
a.it is undisputed that the financial transactions flores conducted on behalf of altamirano in fact involve d the proceeds of specified unlawful activity,to wit,narcotics trafficking.thus,the only question is whether the government produced evidence that flores knew of or was willfully blind to the fact that the funds originated in some form of unlawful activity,sufficient to obtain a conviction under h.see c stating that it is sufficient if the person knew the property involved in the transaction represented proceeds from some form,though not necessarily which form,of activity that constitutes a felony under state,federal,or foreign law emphasis added.accordingly,the defense argument that the government needed to prove that flores knew of,or was willfully blind to,the fact that the funds originated in drug trafficking is off point.
to prove money laundering,the government was required to show that flores,
knowingly engage d or attempt ed to engage in a monetary transaction in criminally derived property of a value greater than and is derived from specified unlawful activity.
a.again,because the monetary transactions that flores conducted on behalf of altamirano were derived from specified unlawful activity,the only question is whether the government produced sufficient evidence that flores knew that the monetary transactions represented the proceeds of criminally derived property.for the same reasons provided above,the defense the government needed to prove that flores knew of,or was willfully blind to,the fact that the funds originated in drug trafficking to obtain a money laundering.see c t he government is not required to prove that the defendant knew that the offense from which the criminally derived property was derived was specified unlawful activity.
our remaining task is to determine whether there is substantial evidence in the record,viewed in the light most favorable to the government,that flores knew that the property involved in the financial transactions represented the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity criminally derived property.knowledge may be demonstrated by showing that a defendant either had actual knowledge or deliberately closed his eyes to what otherwise would have been obvious to him concerning the fact in question.united states stewart,cir.the government establishes willful blindness by proving that a defendant was objectively aware of the high probability of the fact in question,brodie,at citation omitted,and could have recognized the likelihood of illicit acts yet deliberately avoided learning the true facts.stewart,at.
here,the jury reasonably concluded that flores participated in the money laundering conspiracy either knowingly or with willful blindness.the following record evidence,inter alia,created in flores objective awareness of the high probability that altamirano was involved in money laundering one of flores initial interactions with altamirano involved the supply of two false social security numbers as soon as flores opened multiple bank accounts for the corporations,large amounts of cash began flowing in and out of the accounts,despite the fact that the corporations had just opened for business and had no physical location other than flores own offices flores received a letter from the republic national bank explaining what structured transactions are and why they are illegal,and informing him that when an account receives a large incoming wire and immediately sends an outgoing wire or wires for approximately the same amount,without apparent commercial justification,it mirrors the activity of an account opened by money launderers the manager of republic national bank disbelieved altamirano explanation concerning his numerous accounts and financial transactions and told altamirano and flores that the accounts were evidently being used for money laundering flores accountant,rivera,testified that he had sought invoices documenting the source of the funds but never received the documentation he requested and rivera also questioned flores about why the funds were being sent to foreign companies with no apparent relationship to the ecuadorian fruit,fish or flower trade.
in response to the substantial evidence that altamirano was involved in some sort of illegal activity,flores willfully blinded himself to the truth.he never requested any proof of the legitimacy of the transactions from altamirano or even any further explanation addressing either the bank manager or accountant concerns.that flores did not ask the natural question s to determine the source of those funds could reasonably be considered by a jury to be evidence of willful blindness.united states,cir.indeed,when faced with the evidence,instead of making obvious inquiries,flores engaged in additional money laundering transactions.for example,he continued to sign checks and wire transfers and to receive account statements documenting the flow of over through the accounts.moreover,flores dissuaded altamirano from discontinuing suspicious financial transactions after the meeting with republic national,and instead opened accounts at other banks,stating that he needed the per week he was being paid in cash to oversee the bank accounts.thus,the jury could have inferred that flores was motivated to avoid learning the truth because the money laundering operation was profitable to him.see brodie,at.
in sum,the jury verdict reflects that it reasonably concluded,based on the evidence before it,that flores was willfully blind to the illegal source and disposition of the funds in the accounts of the corporations he formed.this is not to say that flores did not proffer alternative explanations,but the verdict indicates that the jury did not credit them.because substantial evidence supports that verdict,we should not second guess that decision,at.
b.did the district court properly instruct the jury on the law of willful blindness 
we generally exercise plenary review in determinating whether the jury instructions stated the proper legal standard,and review the refusal to give a particular instruction or the wording of instructions for abuse of discretion.united states khorozian,cir internal quotation omitted.here,however,flores failed to raise his objection to the willful blindness instruction at trial.as a result,his claim can be reviewed only for plain error.see.providing that n o party may assign as error any portion of the charge or omission therefrom unless he objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict,stating distinctly the matter to which he objects and the grounds of his objection gov t of the virgin islands knight,cir without a clearly articulated objection,a trial judge is not appraised sufficiently of the contested issue and the need to cure a potential error to avoid a new trial.
under the plain error standard,before an appellate court can correct an error not raised at trial,it must find an error that is plain and that affected substantial rights.united states olano,d united states davis,cir en banc united states syme,cir.if all three conditions are met,we may in our discretion grant relief,but only if the error seriously affects the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.united states haywood,cir quoting johnson united states,d.
flores argues that the district court willful blindness instruction erroneously failed to require a jury finding that he was willfully blind to the specific money laundering and structuring activity charged in the indictment,as opposed to some other uncharged or unspecified illegal activity or something amiss,and shifted the burden to him of proving that he actually believed that altamirano was not engaged in any money laundering or structuring activity when,as a matter of due process,it was the government burden to disprove that contingency beyond a reasonable doubt.in response,the government submits that the language stating that flores needed to know that illegal activity was going on,or that something was amiss,is standard language of a willful blindness charge and,in any event,there was no other illegal activity in which flores was accused of participating besides money laundering and structuring currency transactions.the government further maintains that the fact that the district court substituted if the defendant shows for if the evidence shows in its oral charge did not affect the jury deliberations because the written jury instruction,read by the jurors and used by them in their deliberations,includes the correct language and the instruction made clear,both in general and with respect to willful blindness,that the government bore the burden of proof.
the government arguments are persuasive.jury instructions must be read as a whole,and the jury in this case was specifically charged to do just that.of health and soc,cir.it is uncontested that the jury was properly charged as to all of the essential elements of the money laundering and currency structuring counts.those counts required the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt the elements that the defendant knowingly committed or conspired to commit money laundering and currency structuring.moreover,the district court repeatedly and expressly referred to money laundering and money structuring within the willful blindness instruction.considered with the totality of the relevant instructions,the court instruction only permitted a finding of flores guilty knowledge if that finding was based on his willful blindness that he was engaged in money laundering and structuring,and not some other illegal activity.the instruction also makes clear that the only purpose of applying willful blindness to a fact is if the government had a burden of proving the element of knowledge of that fact.
as indicated at the beginning of this section,flores further contends that the district court instruction on willful blindness impermissibly shifted the burden to him of show ing that he actually believed that altamirano was not engaged or that flores positively did not know he was involving himself in money laundering or structuring activity.although the district court properly stated the burden of proof in its written jury instruction,it orally charged the jury as follows 
if the defendant shows you that he actually believed that money laundering was not taking place,he can not be convicted however,a defendant knowledge of a fact may be inferred from willful blindness to the existence of facts which indicate that there is a high probability that illegal activity is going on.
to repeat,again,if the evidence shows that he positively did not know he was involving himself in money laundering or money structuring,then,of course,he must be acquitted but,if the evidence shows that there was a high probability that he knew something was amiss and that he failed to take steps to investigate,to find out whether that was true or not,then you may find that he had the guilty knowledge which must be shown for the conviction of the offense of money laundering or structuring currency transactions.
emphasis added.
on the one hand,flores is correct that,contrary to the district court instruction,he was not required to demonstrate,in order to avoid conviction,that he actually believed that money laundering and structuring were not taking place.rather,it was the government alone that was required to disprove that fact beyond a reasonable doubt.see united states simon,cir reversing conviction where district court instruction on alibi may have shifted burden to defendant,who need only raise a reasonable doubt in the jurors minds as to whether he was present at the scene of the charged offense at the time the offense was committed.on the other hand,given that the correct burden of proof was articulated by the district court in its written jury instructions to which the jurors referred during deliberations,it is apparent that the substitution of defendant for evidence was merely a slip of the tongue on the part of the district judge in her oral charge.in any event,this is where defense counsel failure to object contemporaneously becomes the mistake could have been resolved immediately.indeed,counsel failure to object leaves us with the impression that the misstatement in the oral charge was hardly noticeable.
moreover,as the government points out,the district court gave general instructions regarding the government burden of proof,specific detailed instructions regarding the government burden of proof with respect to each element of the crime,and specific references to the government burden of proof in the willful blindness charge itself.the court generally instructed the jury 
the burden is always upon the prosecution to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.this burden never shifts to a defendant for the law never imposes upon a defendant in a criminal case the burden or duty of calling any witnesses or testifying himself or producing any evidence.
emphasis added.the court charge on the defendant knowledge indicated the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant acted knowingly and willfully with respect to each and every count in the indictment.further,in reciting the elements of the crime,the court again indicated that the government alone bears the burden of proof.finally,in the willful blindness charge,immediately prior to its oral misstatement the district court indicated that the government bears the burden of proof with respect to flores knowledge 
so with respect to the issue of the defendant knowledge,if you find,beyond a reasonable doubt,from all the evidence in the case,that the defendant was subjectively aware of a high probability of the existence of a fact and deliberately tried to avoid learning whether the fact was true,you may find that the government has satisfied its burden of proving the element of knowledge of that fact.
at the risk of piling on,the court willful blindness charge included repeated references that the jury could not find knowledge based on a willful blindness theory unless there was proof beyond a reasonable doubt that flores was personally aware of a high probability of the existence of a particular fact,and then deliberately failed to take action to determine whether or not the fact existed.
all of this was more than sufficient to dispel any possible misconception that flores bore a burden to prove that he was not willfully blind.see united states lee,cir willful blindness instruction did not improperly shift the burden of proof to the defendant,even though it did not instruct that the government had the burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the factual predicates for willful blindness united states cincotta,cir no plain error regarding the district court willful blindness instruction that appeared to shift the burden of proof to a defendant,given the totality of court instructions united states ciampaglia,cir willful blindness instruction,read in totality,would not have been construed by a reasonable juror to impose a burden on defendants to disprove criminal knowledge 
because the instructions imposed the burden of proof on the government generally,emphasized that the government bore the burden of proving guilty knowledge,and repeatedly imposed the burden of proving willful blindness on the government,flores has failed to demonstrate that the district court willful blindness instruction amounted to plain error.
was the district court defendant charge legally sufficient 
at trial,flores exercised his right under the fifth amendment to remain silent by choosing not to testify in his own defense.as a result,the defense asked the court to charge the jury that a defendant in a criminal case has an absolute right under our constitution not to testify,that the fact that the defendant did not testify must not be discussed by you,or considered by you,in any way when deliberating and in arriving at your verdict,and that to consider the fact that the defendant did not te
