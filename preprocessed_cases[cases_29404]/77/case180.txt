the government appeals from the district court order dismissing on statute of limitations grounds the indictments of defendants raymond grenier and delta equity services for violation of and.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the district court dismissal of defendants indictments.
statement of facts 
substantive facts 
raymond grenier and delta equity services delta sold securities through licensed securities sales representatives and agents in various states.in the securities and exchange commission sec began investigating grenier and delta lack of supervision of a group of maryland and ohio brokers who had defrauded investors and misappropriated money through the fraudulent offer and sale of unregistered securities.on july,after the sec informed defendants that it was preparing to take an enforcement action against them,defendants,through counsel,faxed an wells submission letter to the sec.this letter included a settlement proposal.on the same day,the original letter was mailed by overnight courier,and the sec received it on july.the mailed document included an additional page,a notarized waiver dated july,and signed by raymond grenier as president of delta and individually.on february,the sec censured and fined both grenier and delta and imposed other sanctions upon them.
procedural history 
in an indictment filed on july,a federal grand jury alleged that from through on or about july,grenier and delta had knowingly and wilfully concealed and covered up a material fact regarding securities violations by means of tricks,schemes,and devices and had knowingly and willfully made a false writing,specifically a letter,to the sec that contained fraudulent material statements.the indictment set forth ten allegedly false and fraudulent statements included in the document sent to the sec.the indictment alleged that these statements minimized defendants knowledge and responsibility for securities violations.defendants were charged with violating and.
defendants filed a joint motion to dismiss the indictment,pursuant to.b,on the ground that the indictment was returned one day outside of the statute of limitations because the alleged false statements were contained in the wells submission sent to the sec on july.the government opposed the motion and argued that defendants crime was not complete until july,because the sec lacked jurisdiction over the settlement proposal until july,when it received the signed authorization that was required by sec regulations.after conducting a hearing,the district court entered an order granting the motion to dismiss on september.the government filed a motion for reconsideration,which was denied.the government filed a notice of appeal of the denial of the motion for reconsideration on october.
discussion 
preservation of the issue 
defendants claim that the only issue before us is whether the district court abused its discretion in denying the government motion for reconsideration since the government appealed only the order denying reconsideration.def.br.however,defendants argument is meritless since this circuit precedent clearly establishes that a notice of appeal that names only a decision may extend to the judgment itself if it can be reasonably inferred from the notice of appeal that the intent of the appellant was to appeal from the final judgment and it also appears that the appellee has not been misled.harris united states,cir internal quotation marks omitted quoting peabody coal local union,and,cir.accord sanabria united states,d caudill hollan,cir.
although the language of harris suggests that the underlying basis for an appeal must be apparent from the notice of appeal,courts have relied upon briefs and other subsequent filings to infer the intent of the appellant.sanabria,at.boburka adcock,cir in this case,we may review issues relating to the district court grant of defendants motion to dismiss because the government brief put defendants on notice that the appeal regarded not only the order denying reconsideration but also the order granting defendants motion to dismiss.
standard of review 
the standard of review to be applied for a motion to dismiss an indictment is somewhat unclear.united states titterington,cir.when reviewing a district court disposition of a motion to dismiss an indictment based on findings of fact,we have generally applied either an abuse of discretion standard or a clear error standard.united states butler,cir reviewing a motion to dismiss based on a factual determination for clear error united states suarez,cir noting that the court has used both a clear error and an abuse of discretion standard to evaluate the dismissal of indictments based on findings of prosecutorial vindictiveness.when reviewing the district court legal conclusions in the motion to dismiss context,we have generally undertaken de novo review.united states philp,cir reviewing de novo denial of motion to dismiss on legal grounds united states,cir noting that the sixth circuit reviews a denial of a motion to dismiss involving questions of law de novo in re ford,cir reviewing de novo denial of a motion to dismiss on the ground of double jeopardy.
however,we have not always been consistent in determining the standard of review to apply to district court dispositions of motions to dismiss.compare,united states wright,cir reviewing de novo disposition of motion to dismiss indictment based on the government failure to preserve exculpatory evidence,with united states cody,cir reviewing for clear error disposition of motion to dismiss indictment based on the government failure to preserve exculpatory evidence.we have consistently reviewed motions to dismiss indictments on statute of limitations grounds de novo,although we have adopted different rationales for this practice.see united states watford,cir united states grenoble,cir united states del percio,cir.therefore,de novo review is appropriate in this case.
defendants were prosecuted under and.the crime of making false statements to the federal government is defined in,which imposes criminal liability for a person who in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive,legislative,or judicial branch of the government of the united states,knowingly and willfully 
falsifies,conceals,or covers up by any trick,scheme,or device a material fact 
makes any materially false,fictitious,or fraudulent statement or representation or 
makes or uses any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false,fictitious,or fraudulent statement or entry.
a.any person who causes someone else to commit a federal offense is punishable as a principal under.the applicable statute of limitations for prosecutions brought under is five years.the statute of limitations begins to run when a crime is complete,that is,when each element of the crime charged has occurred.united states lutz,cir.
the government presents a variety of rationales for finding the indictment of defendants timely.the government argument rests on claims that two separable offenses were committed by the faxing and the mailing of submissions,including false statements to the sec and defendants offense was not complete until the sec received the mailed submissions on july.
the mailing and faxing of the false statements did not constitute two distinct crimes 
the government claims that the indictment of defendants on july,fell within the statute of limitations because the document mailed to the sec and received on july,constituted a distinct violation of.govt.br.the mailed document differed from the document faxed and received on july,in that the mailed document included a signed waiver page.the mailed document contained no additional false statements,and the waiver page did not explicitly incorporate the false statements in the earlier pages in support of its claim,the government cites united states collier.cir unpublished,in which a defendant made false statements for which prosecution would have been and later made statements reaffirming the earlier false statements.a divided panel of this court held that the indictment was timely because the statute of limitations had not expired for the later s
