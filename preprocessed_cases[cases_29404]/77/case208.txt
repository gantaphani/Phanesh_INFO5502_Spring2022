a jury convicted edward thomas jung of eight counts of wire fraud in violation of and two counts of securities fraud in violation of a and.jung appeals,claiming that the district court erroneously admitted the statements of his former attorney under federal rule of evidence d d.jung also challenges his sentence,arguing that the sentencing court failed to properly consider and apply a.for the following reasons,we affirm.
background 
in,hollis lamon,an atlanta securities broker and promoter,decided to start a hedge fund and asked jung to manage it.shortly thereafter,lamon and jung formed a limited liability company called strategic income fund,llc sif.fred isaf acted as sif special counsel and drafted sif governing documents,which gave jung the exclusive right and power to manage the fund.
the fund was designed to attract investors who wanted to generate additional income on stocks that they already owned.an investment in sif cost per unit,but most investors signed a promissory note and pledged stocks or bonds to collateralize the note.investors were told that they would continue to receive the dividends and interest from their pledged collateral.the collateral was then transferred into a of thomas jung partners,etj,which was a on the chicago board options exchange cboe.the collateral enabled jung to secure margin from lit clearing services,lit,and jung used the margin to buy and sell options.profits generated by jung options trading on the sif margin were to be distributed to sif investors.
from july to september,jung,lamon,and others sold interests in sif to investors.beginning in,jung sold investments in an almost identical fund called the friends and family account ffa.by the end of,sif investors had invested more than million.however,the combined net value of etj and its totaled just over million.despite the trading losses,jung continued to pursue prospective investors.in order to keep etj in business and continue trading,jung had to retain the collateral invested in the funds and pursue additional collateral from old and new investors.by the end of august,even though sif investors had contributed another million that year,the total value of jung accounts totaled less than million.
in september,lit demanded payment from jung for the more than million that etj had borrowed and lost.lit had a security interest in all assets held in etj accounts,which included the sif and ffa investors collateral.the million debt consisted of jung personal trading loses,etj expenses,and cash withdrawals made by jung.after lit liquidated all of the assets in etj account,jung still owed lit more than million.on september,jung former attorney,james fox,called lamon and isaf and told them that all of sif collateral in the etj,approximately million,had been liquidated by lit.
a federal grand jury returned a indictment against jung on february.according to the indictment,jung had defrauded investors through his hedge fund by falsely representing that their pledged assets would be used solely to collateralize trading on the investors behalf.jung jury trial began on january.at trial,the defense tried to establish that jung reasonably believed that the investors were aware that their pledged assets all of jung trading and that jung did not intend to deceive anyone.
during its,the government introduced several pieces of evidence against jung,including statements attributed to fox.over repeated objections by jung trial attorney,the district court admitted the statements as under federal rule of evidence d d.first,the district court allowed isaf to testify that fox had told him that jung had,if i remember the words exactly,engaged in improper and illegal trading.second,the district court admitted a letter drafted by isaf to sif investors stating that jung lawyer informed me that jung had engaged in improper and illegal trading activity which he had concealed from lamon and stern,all sif members,and sif accountant.third,the district court allowed lamon to testify that fox had told him that jung,unbeknownst to us,had another account.and he had taken,i believe was the word,our money and used it for his own personal benefit and lost it all trading.finally,lamon also testified that fox gave us papers that he said were written by jung at the time that was,for lack of a better word,jung confession.
on february,the jury found jung guilty on all ten counts in the indictment.jung was sentenced to months imprisonment and three years of supervised release and ordered to pay a special assessment of and million in restitution.jung then filed this timely appeal.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,jung brings two separate challenges.first,jung argues that the district court erred in admitting into evidence the statements attributed to james fox,his former attorney,as party admissions under federal rule of evidence d d.second,jung argues that the sentence should be vacated because the district court did not properly consider and apply the sentencing factors under a.
admission of attorney james fox statements 
a decision regarding the admission of evidence is within the broad discretion of the trial judge and will be overturned only upon a clear abuse of that considerable discretion.united states brandon,cir.jung contends that the district court abused its discretion by admitting statements attributed to fox under rule d d,which provides that a statement is not hearsay if the statement is offered against a party and is a statement by the party agent or servant concerning a matter within the scope of the agency or employment,made during the existence of the relationship.d d.
an attorney may be the agent of his client for purposes of rule d d.united states harris,cir.but t he unique nature of the relationship demands that a trial court exercise caution in admitting statements that are the product of this relationship.id.this court has caution ed the government that it should only offer this sort of evidence in rare cases and when absolutely necessary,in order to avoid impairing the relationship,chilling full disclosure by a defendant to his lawyer,and deterring defense counsel from vigorous and legitimate advocacy.united states sanders,cir.
jung argues that the attorney statements admitted in this case,unlike the statements admitted in harris and sanders,infringed upon the policy concerns inherent in the relationship.in harris,harris attorney visited with an eyewitness prior to trial and showed him pictures of harris brother in an attempt to develop a defense to the charge of armed robbery.harris,at.harris theory was that his brother had committed the crime and that he was a victim of mistaken identity.id.however,after reviewing the pictures,the witness was confident that it was harris that he saw fleeing from the scene.id.at trial,the witness testified about his conversation with harris attorney,and the district court admitted a statement attributed to harris attorney acting in his investigative capacity.id.in admitting the evidence,the court explained that when harris lawyer met with the witness,he was testing a theory on behalf of his client and not relating confidential information about his client.id.at.
in sanders,the defendant former attorney visited two,who were in pretrial detention,and asked the whether they had given statements to the police.sanders,at.because the visit with the occurred several months before sanders was indicted,the government elicited the statements made by sanders attorney during his visit with the to establish that sanders must have been involved in the conspiracy.id.at.in deciding to admit the statements attributed to sanders former attorney,the court noted the parallel facts in sanders and harris 
in both cases,the lawyer spoke to the witness in order to develop a defense strategy.both lawyers took a calculated risk in approaching an individual who might well testify against his client.the fact that the strategy backfired does not mean that advocacy will be chilled moreover,the testimony did not impair the defendant privilege against in either case it simply force d the defendant to present a competing explanation to the jury.
sanders,at quoting harris,at.the c
