a jury convicted anna cacioppo and richard dean plaskett of five counts of making false statements failing to disclose certain facts in documents required to be kept by the employee retirement income security act of erisa in violation of and.according to the jury verdicts,cacioppo made the false statements failed to disclose facts required to be disclosed in documents she submitted to local of the laborers international union of north america local and the laborers welfare fund and laborers pension fund collectively,the fund.while plaskett did not directly submit paperwork to the fund,the indictment alleged that he was punishable as a principal pursuant to.the jury also convicted cacioppo of six additional counts of violating with respect to documents she submitted to local of the laborers international union of north america local and the kansas welfare fund and the kansas pension fund collectively,the fund.
following trial,the district court entered a judgment of acquittal in favor of cacioppo and plaskett as to the counts of conviction based upon their submissions to the fund.the district court did not rule on plaskett alternative motion for a new trial.the district court refused to set aside the jury verdicts against cacioppo for the counts of conviction related to the fund submissions.the united states appeals the judgment of acquittal for cacioppo and plaskett.plaskett the district court failure to decide his motion for a new trial,and cacioppo the denial of her motion for a new trial with respect to her submissions to the fund.we affirm in part and reverse in part.
background 
a special grand jury returned a indictment charging five individuals with conspiracy,bribery and mail fraud,as well as the erisa reporting violations that are the subject of this appeal.the conspiracy,bribery and mail fraud counts related to demolition and work to be done for rockhurst university in kansas city,missouri.plaskett was the of industrial environmental management iem,an asbestos removal company in kansas city,missouri,that employed both union and employees at its work sites.plaskett partner in iem was charles cacioppo.charles cacioppo daughter,anna cacioppo,worked as an office employee at iem during the relevant period.the erisa reporting counts centered upon two collective bargaining agreements that iem entered,one with local and another with local,and the employee benefit payments for which iem was responsible.
in february,iem entered into a collective bargaining agreement with local for covered work in certain counties in missouri and kansas the association agreement.plaskett signed on iem behalf.the agreement provided,among other things,that the parties would provide a fringe benefit program and that iem would pay into the fringe benefit fund a specific amount for each hour of covered work conducted by each employee covered by the agreement.to implement the fringe benefit program,article viii of the association agreement required iem to file a written report setting forth the names,social security numbers and the hours paid for each employee for whom benefit payments shall have been made during said period and such other information as the fringe benefit program trustees desire.the report,referred to as a monthly remittance report,was to be submitted monthly along with iem payments to the fund.the monthly remittance report was required to be signed by an authorized employee at iem,and anna cacioppo signed on iem behalf.cacioppo certified,among other things,that the employees listed on the reports constitute all employees for whom contributions are required under the terms of said agreements.
in april,iem entered a second collective bargaining agreement,this time with local the local agreement.under the local agreement,iem was required to pay benefits and to submit a similar monthly remittance report each month.in contrast to the association agreement which required the individual submitting reports to list all employees for whom contributions are required,the reports to the fund explicitly required iem to report on all employees,union or.emphases added.again,cacioppo prepared and submitted the reports on iem behalf.
following seven days of trial,the jury acquitted plaskett of conspiracy and bribery charges.it also acquitted cacioppo of a mail fraud charge.however,the jury returned guilty verdicts against plaskett and cacioppo on counts through of the indictment,which alleged that they violated in connection with their submission of monthly remittance reports to the fund.the jury also convicted cacioppo on counts through of the indictment,which alleged that she violated in connection with her submission of monthly remittance reports to the fund.
after trial,the district court set aside the jury verdicts and entered judgments of acquittal in favor of plaskett and cacioppo with respect to those charges.the district court found insufficient evidence that the association agreement actually required iem to list all employees,including employees.the district court did not rule on plaskett alternative motion for a new trial.the district court denied cacioppo request for a judgment of acquittal or,in the alternative,a new trial on the charges that she violated in connection with her reporting to the fund.the district court sentenced cacioppo to years probation for those convictions.
ii.discussion 
the government argues that the district court erroneously granted cacioppo and plaskett motions for judgment of acquittal on counts through of the indictment because the evidence was sufficient to sustain the jury verdicts.plaskett the district court failure to rule on his motion for a new trial as to those counts.cacioppo appeals her convictions on counts through of the indictment.she argues that the district court improperly instructed the jury that it could convict cacioppo based upon her reckless disregard for,rather than knowledge of,the falsity of her statements or the completeness of her submissions.cacioppo also asserts that the jury should have been given a good faith instruction.
we begin by determining the proper mens rea requirement for a conviction under issue raised by cacioppo,but which also affects our analysis of the disposition of the government appeal.we then address the various motions for judgment of acquittal and new trial to determine whether the evidence was sufficient for a reasonable jury to find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt under the correct mens rea standard and,if so,whether a new trial is warranted due to misinstruction of the jury.we view this as the appropriate method of deciding the appeal and two that the parties present.see united states boyd,cir reasoning that the district court misconceived the elements of the offense and,therefore,reviewing the evidence under the correct standard to resolve an appeal concerning the sufficiency of the evidence.
section mens rea requirement 
section criminalizes two separate activities first,provides for criminal penalties when any person makes in any document required to be kept for erisa purposes any false statement or representation of fact,knowing it to be false the false statement prong.second,provides for criminal penalties when any person knowingly conceals,covers up,or fails to disclose any fact the disclosure of which is required by title i of erisa or is necessary to verify,explain,clarify or check for accuracy and completeness of any report required by such title to be published or any information required by such title to be certified the concealment prong.
with respect to false statement prong,the district court instructed the jury that cacioppo and plaskett could be found guilty if either acted knowingly and in the case of a false statement,with knowledge that the statement was false or with reckless disregard for its truth or falsity.jury instruction emphasis added.the district court further instructed the jury that the government must prove that the defendant had knowledge that the statement was false or acted with reckless disregard for whether or not it was false.jury instruction emphasis added.with respect to concealment prong,the district court instructed the jury that cacioppo and plaskett could be found guilty if either acted knowingly and in the case of a concealment,cover up,or failure to disclose,without a ground for believing his action was lawful or with reckless disregard for its lawfulness.jury instruction emphasis added.concerning both prongs,the district court added that,r egardless of whether the charge involves a false statement or a concealment,cover up,or failure to disclose a fact,however,the government need not prove that the defendant intended to violate the law or that he had actual knowledge of his obligations under the law.jury instruction emphasis added.in so doing,the district court rejected cacioppo and plaskett proffered instructions,which omitted any reference to reckless disregard.
cacioppo contends that the district court should not have allowed the jury to find guilt based solely upon a reckless disregard of the falsity of her statements or a reckless disregard for the completeness of her reporting.the government counters that has long been interpreted in a way that allows convictions based upon reckless disregard.in this regard,the government relies primarily upon united states tolkow,cir and united states s vee cartage,cir,both of which approved instructions that included a reckless disregard mens rea standard.we conclude that the district court erred when it instructed the jury that reckless disregard of the falsity of statements or completeness of reporting was a sufficient basis upon which to convict.
we begin with the fairly obvious observation that reckless disregard appears nowhere in,as authored by congress.we also note that the supreme court has repeatedly declined opportunities to imply a mens rea requirement somewhere between knowingly and strict liability in cases similar to the one we consider here.see,united states video,d liparota united states,d.nevertheless,we examine both of prongs to determine what mens rea standard is appropriate.
the least complicated issue to resolve is the proper mens rea under the false statement prong,as the district court insertion of a reckless disregard mens rea standard into false statement prong conflicts with the statute plain language.it is well established that we commence any statutory interpretation with the statute plain language.see,watson ray,cir when determining the meaning of a statute,our starting point must be the plain language of the statute.where the language is plain,we need inquire no further.see,united states ron pair,d where the statute language is plain,the sole function of the courts is to enforce it according to its terms.internal quotation omitted.
here,it is impossible to square the district court instruction that the jury could find cacioppo guilty of making a false statement if cacioppo acted with reckless disregard for whether or not it was false with the statute provision that a defendant can be found guilty only for making a false statement knowing it to be false.a person is said to have knowledge of a fact when she has no substantial doubt about its existence.black law dictionary ed see also arthur andersen llp united states,d knowledge and knowingly are normally associated with awareness,understanding,or consciousness.recklessness,on the other hand,reflects something less than knowledge of a statement falsity.see,d fraud deceit a representation is reckless if it is made without any knowledge of the truth,or if the person making the representation knows that he or she does not have sufficient information or a basis to support it,or if the maker realizes that he or she does not know whether or not the statement is true.we have noted this distinction repeatedly in the context of the false claims act,a.see.ass of nurse anesthetists allina health,cir addressing the false claims act mens rea requirement and distinguishing between whether defendants knew or would have known absent reckless disregard that bills submitted to government would falsely imply that certain services had been rendered.indeed,it is clear from our false claims act jurisprudence that congress insertion of a reckless disregard standard captures defendants who lacked actual knowledge.see id.where,in the context of representations to erisa plans,congress instead has elected to make persons criminally liable only for those false statements made knowing them to be false,we are bound to enforce the law as written.
the concealment prong presents a more difficult issue,as the prong language is susceptible to two readings.the question we must decide is whether knowingly modifies only the clause addressing a defendant acts that is,knowingly conceals,covers up,or fails to disclose or whether knowingly also modifies the concealment prong second clause the disclosure of which is required by such title or is necessary to verify,explain,clarify or check for accuracy and completeness any report required by such title to be published or any information required by such title to be certified.in other words,we must decide whether allows criminal conviction only where someone conceals,covers up,or fails to disclose facts that she knew she was required to disclose or whether criminalizes the knowing concealment,cover up or failure to disclose certain facts,regardless of whether the defendant knew she was required to reveal,uncover or disclose them.
we hold that the former reading is correct.in our view,tolkow and s vee of which allowed instructions that included a reckless disregard mens rea in conflict with the reasoning of subsequent decisions of the supreme court.for instance,in liparota,the supreme court addressed the mens rea requirement of b,which provided that whoever knowingly uses,transfers,acquires,alters,or possesses coupons or authorization cards in any manner not authorized by the statute or the regulations is subject to criminal penalties.at.the question to be resolved was whether knowingly modified only the use,transfer,acquisition,alteration or possession portion of the statute or if it also modified the phrase in any manner not authorized.id.at.that is,just as in this case,t he question presented was whether the government must prove that the defendant knew that he was acting in a manner not authorized by statute or regulations.id.
in liparota,the supreme court applied a method of statutory interpretation,first looking to the statute plain language and structure and,in the absence of clear language,then attempting to infer the statute meaning from its legislative history.id.at.beginning with b plain language,the supreme court found that,while it was clear that congress intended to require a mens rea of knowingly with respect to some act,it was unclear whether knowingly applied merely to possession of the coupons and cards or whether the statute required both knowing possession and knowledge that the possession was proscribed by law.id.at.the court concluded that e ither interpretation would accord with ordinary usage.id.because the statute plain language was ambiguous,the court then examined the statute legislative history.id.it found,however,that the legislative history of the statute contains nothing that would clarify the congressional purpose on this point.id.
the liparota court then held that,absent a clear indication to the either the statute plain language or legislative court would presume that congress intended to apply knowingly to both elements of the statute because to interpret the statute otherwise would criminalize a broad range of apparently innocent conduct.id.at.specifically,it stated that,a bsent indication of contrary purpose in the language or legislative history of the statute,we believe that b requires a showing that the defendant knew his conduct to be unauthorized by statute or regulations.id.at.
since liparota,the court has consistently applied this presumption to statutes where construing the statute more broadly would criminalize otherwise innocent conduct.see arthur andersen llp,at.noting that reading a statute to require corrupt intent is particularly appropriate where the act underlying the conviction is by itself innocuous staples united states,d addressing the particular care we have taken to avoid construing a statute to dispense with mens rea where doing so would criminalize a broad range of apparently innocent conduct internal quotation omitted posters n things,united states,d requiring in a drug paraphernalia case the government to establish that the defendant knew that the items at issue are likely to be used with illegal drugs ratzlaf united states,d holding in a currency transaction structuring case that t o convict ratzlaf of the crime with which he was charged,the jury had to find he knew the structuring in which he engaged was unlawful,superseded by statute,a,b,c.indeed,the court has extended the application of knowingly to elements in separate subsections of a criminal is,to phrases more remote than we do here.see video,at.reasoning that morisette,reinforced by staples,instructs that the presumption in favor of a scienter requirement should apply to each of the statutory elements that criminalize otherwise innocent conduct and applying knowingly to the elements in each subsection of the statute,even where the word did not appear in each subsection.
we have followed suit in cases where a broad range of apparently innocent conduct would be criminalized by a particular reading of an ambiguous statute mens rea requirement.see united states jain,cir only conduct that is inevitably nefarious,that is,obviously evil or inherently bad,warrants the traditional presumption that anyone consciously engaging in it has fair warning of a criminal violation.thus,we agree with the district court decision to instruct the jury that the government must meet a heightened mens rea burden.internal citation and quotation omitted united states collins,cir refusing to expand the reach of knowingly within a statute where the defendant had reason to know that the use of explosives is a type of conduct that a reasonable person should know is subject to stringent public regulation and may seriously threaten the community health or safety quoting liparota,at.
applying liparota reasoning to this case,we conclude that the government is required to prove both that the defendant knowingly conceal ed,cover ed up,or fail ed to disclose a fact that she was required to disclose and that she knew that she was obliged to disclose it.we begin with the statute plain language and structure.a comparison of the statute at issue in liparota and the statute here shows them to have identical structures in all relevant respects the plain language of both statutes is equally ambiguous as to whether knowingly applies to a defendant knowledge of the requirements of the relevant regulations or statute.
here,however,unlike in liparota,the statute structure offers one additional clue as to congressional intent.congress specifically provided in that one may be convicted under the false statement prong of the statute only if the statement is made knowing it to be false.on the other hand,under the government reading of concealment prong,a defendant could be convicted for concealing facts,even though she was unaware that she was required by law to disclose them.nothing in the statute language,structure or history indicates to us that congress meant to apply different mens rea standards to two different means of violating.that is,we see nothing indicating that congress meant to allow conviction for affirmative statements only when the defendant knows they are false but,at the same time,to allow conviction for the failure to disclose facts where the defendant was unaware of the duty to disclose them.to the contrary,in our view,the provision that false statements are punishable only if made knowing them to be false indicates that congress meant to restrict the type of activity that criminalized rather than to write the statute as expansively as possible.
applying the second step of liparota analysis,the legislative history here does not indicate clearly that congress intended to circumscribe the reach of knowingly in a way that criminalized the failure to disclose certain information where the defendant was unaware of a duty to disclose it.we acknowledge that tolkow addressed legislative history and found that the history indicated that congress intended to be applied broadly,at,but we are unpersuaded that the legislative history requires us to read into the statute a reckless disregard standard that appears nowhere in its text.tolkow takes an extraordinarily broad view of legislative history,noting only that was passed with the intent to give the welfare and pension plans disclosure act enforcement teeth.id.at.but observing that a particular statute is meant to have teeth is not the same as defining the extent of its bite.congress undoubtedly intended the pornography statute addressed in video to have teeth,as it had recently broadened the statute application to regulate even more pornographic material than did previous iterations of the statute.at.discussing the expansion of the statute in to regulate materials that were not legally obscene,whereas an earlier version of the bill had limited itself to actual obscenity.the supreme court,however,still read the statute in a way that required a defendant to know that he was transporting a video that depicted an actual minor.id.at.
more to the point,in lieu of tolkow exceedingly broad view of the legislative history,liparota and its progeny require us to examine the legislative history with an eye toward determining whether congress made some statement particularly addressing the intended mens rea requirement.see,video at.examining legislative history regarding the intended mens rea requirement.after our review of legislative history,we see nothing addressing the mens rea requirement at all,much less indicating that congress intended to criminalize the failure to report certain information even where the actor was unaware of the duty to do so.see,pt,reprinted in.when interpreted in this fashion,the statute still has enforcement teeth,but captures only those actors who deliberately conceal,cover up or fail to disclose information that they knew they were required to reveal,uncover or disclose.
for all these reasons,we conclude that neither the statute plain language nor the statute legislative history clearly indicate that congress intended to criminalize conduct where the defendant was unaware of a duty to disclose the information allegedly concealed.we further find that the government reading of the statute would criminalize an extraordinary amount of otherwise innocent conduct.for instance,if a clerical employee failed to retain any document that the benefit fund later decided it needed to verify,explain,clarify or check for accuracy and completeness any report required by erisa,she could later be held criminally liable,even though she had no reason to suspect that she was required to create or keep the,indeed,even if she had no idea of the document purpose.because the government reading of the statute would criminalize apparently innocent conduct,we apply liparota presumption and conclude that congress intended to apply knowingly to both clauses of concealment prong 
we pause to address two final,but important issues.first,our holding does not imply that a defendant must in fact know that exists and that she is violating it before she can be held to account in a criminal prosecution.we hold only that the defendant must have known that she was required to disclose the information she allegedly concealed.the supreme court discussed this distinction in liparota,at.second,our decision concerning the proper mens rea requirement in no way affects how the government can go about proving that the required mens rea exists.despite the requirement that the government prove that a particular defendant knowingly concealed information she knew she was required to disclose,knowledge can still be inferred from circumstantial evidence,including any external indications that she knew that she was required to keep or disclose the particular information.staples,at.see also ratzlaf,at.a jury may,of course,find the requisite knowledge on defendant part by drawing reasonable inferences from the evidence of defendant conduct.
motions for judgment of acquittal and new trial 
having decided the proper mens rea requirement under,we must decide whether the district court appropriately decided the various motions.we review de novo the grant of a motion for judgment of acquittal,united states hively,cir,using the same standards used by the district court,united states monnier,cir.a provides that the district court must enter judgment of acquittal of any offense for which the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction.when considering whether there is sufficient evidence to support a conviction,we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict,giving it the benefit of all reasonable inferences.monnier,at quotation omitted.a motion for judgment of acquittal should be granted only if there is no interpretation of the evidence that would allow a reasonable jury to find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.united states gomez,cir.
counts through monthly remittance reports submitted to the fund 
the district court granted cacioppo and plaskett motions for judgment of acquittal on counts through of the indictment,reasoning that there was insufficient proof that the association agreement actually required cacioppo and plaskett to report the names of all workers at any work site,irrespective of whether they were union members.we affirm the judgment of acquittal in favor of cacioppo,albeit for a different reason.see united states mccaster,cir we may affirm the judgment on any grounds supported by the record,even if not relied on by the district court.however,we reverse the judgment of acquittal in favor of plaskett and remand for the district court to determine if he is entitled to a new trial.
motions for judgment of acquittal 
given our resolution of the mens rea issue above,the question we must resolve with respect to the reporting to the fund is whether the government presented evidence sufficient to allow a reasonable jury to find cacioppo and plaskett guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of knowingly making false statements knowingly concealing or failing to disclose facts they knew they were required to disclose.
we briefly restate the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict,resolving evidentiary disputes in favor of the government.we begin with the association agreement.article iii of the agreement provided that the parties recognize d the union as the exclusive bargaining agent for all employees of the employer performing any type of construction work which has historically and traditionally been performed heretofore by laborers in the geographical area of this agreement.emphasis added.article iv of the agreement recognized the union as the sole and exclusive bargaining agent for all employees coming within the terms of this agreement.emphasis added.article viii provided that t he parties agreed to provide a fringe benefit program which program is to be maintained by contributions from employers under the terms of this agreement and is established for the benefit of employees of members of the association and that o n all work covered each employer shall pay to the fringe benefit program the amounts per hour set forth in the agreement for each hour paid to each employee covered by this agreement.emphasis added.finally,article viii required iem to file a written report setting forth the names,social security numbers and the hours paid for each employee for whom payments shall have been made during said period and such other information as the fringe benefit program trustees desire.
suzanne clark bradley,who managed iem offices until march of,was responsible during an undefined period in for preparing and submitting the monthly remittance reports.bradley testified that she understood that she was required to list all employees on the monthly remittance reports,irrespective of union membership.her understanding was based solely upon her reading of the association agreement.bradley further testified that she prepared the monthly remittance reports by running a report on iem financial software.bradley testified that plaskett told her to remove names from the reports she had prepared.bradley also testified that she had a conversation with plaskett and his partner,chuck cacioppo,about the reporting 
q.when you were doing these reports then for plaskett,did you discuss how to fill out the forms,who was supposed to be on the forms,that kind of information 
tell us about that,please.
i was basically told after i did a couple of them to mind my own business.
tell us about that conversation,who was there,what was the conversation 
i had had a conversation with don in regard to union and non union employees and who we were paying on and who we were paying on and i was basically told just to keep my nose out of it.
by plaskett and chuck cacioppo.
trial tr.vol.ii at.
anna cacioppo took over the reporting duties when she began working at iem.bradley did not testify that she informed cacioppo that cacioppo should list all employees,irrespective of union membership.when asked whether she explained the reporting requirements to cacioppo,bradley said only that she basically showed cacioppo how bradley did the reports in the beginning and gave cacioppo the time by name report and she was to discuss it with plaskett and how he wanted to pay.id.at.bradley later testified that she showed anna how the reports were to be pulled out of the computer and how plaskett showed bradley to do them.and basically anna dealt with plaskett from that point forward.id.at.
the government also called leslie williams,who had been president and business manager for local for years and a trustee for the laborers fringe benefit office health and welfare fund.williams testified that the association agreement required iem to report and pay fringe benefits for every employee,irrespective of union membership,from the very first day of employment.williams further testified that the union had field representatives who were responsible for telling employers about their responsibilities with respect to paying fringe benefits.williams also testified that plaskett signed the collective bargaining agreement on behalf of iem.as to cacioppo,williams testified that he had never met her and had no idea whether she had ever seen the collective bargaining agreement.
plaskett testified that he did not list employees because the union agreement does tell us to do that.trial tr.vol.iv at.he further testified that,to meet what he perceived to be the reporting requirements,he set up on iem computer a recurring report that listed all employees working on a project.plaskett called it the report.plaskett then applied to the report a filter that eliminated the names of employees.plaskett testified that,as soon as an employee reported that he joined the union,plaskett then changed the designation of that employee and iem would begin reporting their work on monthly remittance reports.
cacioppo testified that she never read any union agreement.she stated that she prepared the report that was memorized on the computer.id.at.according to cacioppo,the report was called,something like that.id.at.referring to cacioppo role in the reporting,plaskett confirmed that cacioppo simply ran the report with the filters that plaskett defined to yield only union members names.
to decide whether either defendant conviction can be upheld,we must first determine whether a reasonable jury could find that iem was required to disclose the names of each employee on the monthly remittance reports,irrespective of union membership.we disagree with the district court conclusion that no reasonable jury could so find.iem agreed that o n all covered work herein each employer shall pay to the fringe benefit program the amounts set forth for each hour paid to each employee covered by this agreement.in the same agreement,iem recognize d the union as the exclusive bargaining agent for all employees of the employer performing any type of construction work which has historically and traditionally been performed heretofore by laborers in the geographical area of this agreement.based upon these two provisions alone,a reasonable jury could conclude that the employer wa
