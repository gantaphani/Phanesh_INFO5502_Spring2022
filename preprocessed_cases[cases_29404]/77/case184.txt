susan ellis has appealed her eight counts of failure to account for and pay federal taxes in violation of.ellis objects to two of the district court rulings admitting evidence against her,the enhancement of her sentence based on her supposed perjury,and the fine imposed by the district court.for the reasons discussed below,we affirm on all counts.
background 
on may,ellis was indicted on eight counts of willful failure to collect or pay over taxes in violation of.ellis was the president,sole owner,and principal agent of pharmasource temporary pharmacy services.pharmasource provided pharmacists on a temporary basis to medical facilities and retail stores throughout the country.in early,ellis made nine federal tax deposits,but she failed to make any deposits for the rest of,all of,and the first quarter of.during this time,ellis withheld employment taxes,including federal income taxes,fica,and medicare,from the employees of pharmasource in the total amount of.in addition,pharmasource was required to pay a matching employer contribution for employment taxes,which totaled.the total employment tax loss to the government was.
from february through march,ellis transferred from pharmasource business checking account to pharmasource business investment account and,as stated above,stopped making federal tax deposits for pharmasource.from may through november,ellis took from the pharmasource business investment account to build a personal residence.she took an additional from the pharmasource business investment account to purchase numerous trips to florida,a luxury car,home decorations,and a house for her mother.
ellis was tried in the southern district of indiana.on october,ellis filed two motions in limine one to exclude evidence relating to ellis use of money and one to exclude evidence relating to ellis uncharged personal and corporate tax violations.ellis filed another motion in limine to exclude evidence relating to her failure to file returns and pay over taxes for periods other than those alleged in the indictment on november.the district court denied all three motions and ellis was found guilty on june.

admitting evidence of ellis personal expenditures 
we review a district court admission or exclusion of evidence for abuse of discretion.united states wilson,cir.
as noted above,prior to trial ellis filed a motion in limine to bar the admission of evidence concerning how she spent money during the eight quarters of charged in the indictment.the district court ruled that the evidence of ellis personal expenditures was probative of willfulness,an element of the charged offense.specifically,the district court stated that the evidence of expenditures on the purchase of her home,home decoration and travel were relevant to negate ellis principal defense that she was too busy to notice or remember her tax obligations.ellis argues that the evidence was not relevant,and,moreover,that it should have been excluded under federal rule of evidence as unduly prejudicial.ellis charged crime was willful failure to collect or pay over tax.the relevant statute provides that 
any person required under this title to collect,account for,and pay over any tax imposed by this title who willfully fails to collect or truthfully account for and pay over such tax shall be guilty of a felony.
the supreme court has defined the willfulness described in the criminal tax laws as requiring proof of a voluntary,intentional violation of a known legal duty.cheek united states,d.
ellis argues that the evidence was not relevant because she did not present inability to pay or good faith defenses at trial.however,ellis principal defense was that she was too busy to notice or remember her tax obligations.because ellis claimed that she had no time to remember her taxes,the ways she was spending her to florida,buying cars,purchasing and overseeing the decoration of her two million dollar relevant.we also note that the amount of taxes ellis failed to pay during the indictment period was around the same amount she spent on herself during the indictment period.this fact also undermines ellis defense that she simply overlooked or forgot her tax liability,since most people would inquire as to why they have an unexpected additional two million dollars to spend on themselves.
ellis also argues that the evidence of her expenditures gave rise to a highly prejudicial inference that she had a bad character,and that the district judge did not appropriately limit questioning of witnesses in this vein.while ellis lavish personal expenditures certainly place her in an unfavorable light,in view of the evidence relevance,we do not believe that the danger of unfair prejudice substantially outweighed the evidence probative value.see.ultimately,striking the correct balance was up to the district court and we can not conclude that the district court abused its discretion in making this determination.
admitting evidence of ellis uncharged tax violations 
again,we review a district court admission or exclusion of evidence for abuse of discretion.wilson,at.
prior to trial,ellis filed two motions in limine objecting to the admission of evidence regarding her other tax liabilities and uncharged failures to pay during and before the indictment period.the district court ruled against ellis and explained several reasons why the other uncharged failures were relevant.the district court stated that t he evidence of the earlier failures to file the returns and to make deposits,even when accountants were doing all of the work for ellis except the final submissions is all relevant to show that defendant fully understood that pharmasource was withholding the taxes and that the company and she were legally responsible for filing the returns and depositing the money with the irs.the district court also stated that ellis failure to file individual and corporate tax returns was probative of the defendant state of mind on the charged violations because they tended to show that the violations were part of a larger disregard for federal tax obligations that a jury could find was willful.under the district court interpretation,the uncharged violations were directly relevant under cheek to show that ellis was aware of her duties under the tax laws and to show her complete disregard of those duties.see cheek,at.during trial,the district court again stated that t he evidence that i heard at trial has reinforced my view of its relevance to willfulness,and i think strongly indicates that the probative value of that evidence is not outweighed by any prospect for unfair prejudice to ellis.
ellis argues that evidence regarding her past tax violations runs afoul of rule b.she also argues that any slight probative value the evidence had in showing intent was outweighed by the unfair prejudice resulting from its admission.the government responds that the pattern of tax violations showed that ellis trial testimony about forgetting her obligations was not worthy of belief.government brief at.specifically,the government notes that ellis failed to timely file from to,until her accountant discovered the misconduct and ellis belatedly filed and paid the taxes.the government argues that this showed that ellis had long been aware of her legal obligation to file and pay taxes and that ellis knew that substantial penalties could be imposed for late filing and payments,decreasing the likelihood she would,as she claimed at trial,forget her tax obligation during the indictme
