melvin dokich sold stock for efoora,a company that claimed to be developing diagnostic tests for hiv,disease,and blood glucose levels.unfortunately,efoora in the end was nothing but a phony.the company invited potential investors and customers to its headquarters in buffalo grove,illinois,where they received tours of manufacturing facilities staffed by temporary laborers and filled with fake test kits and empty boxes.dokich and others who sold stock lied about efoora sales figures,promised that the company would soon be traded publicly,and falsely said that federal agencies were poised to approve its diagnostic tests for sale in the united states.during his time with efoora,dokich and his group defrauded thousands of investors of millions of dollars.
it is impossible to run such a scam forever,and efoora was no exception.in,a grand jury returned an indictment charging with david grosky,efoora ceo,and craig rappin,its nine counts of mail and wire fraud,and four counts of money laundering,a four counts of illegal monetary transactions,and counts of illegal structuring transactions,a.without reaching an agreement with the government,dokich pleaded guilty to one count of mail fraud and all of the structuring charges.the district court sentenced him to months imprisonment and ordered him to pay in restitution,jointly and severally with grosky and rappin.dokich did not object to the restitution order at sentencing,but he argues on appeal that the district court plainly erred by failing to make a finding that efoora victims suffered in actual loss.because we find no miscarriage of justice that requires us to overturn the district court decision,we affirm.
dokich challenge to the district court restitution order requires us to delve into the details of the various estimates submitted to the court between august,when dokich entered his guilty plea,and july,when he was sentenced,of the loss suffered by his victims.as of,the government estimated that efoora fraud caused approximately in loss.two months later,the government told the probation officer in charge of dokich presentence investigation report psr that efoora had deprived investors of million and suggested that dokich could have foreseen million in loss.based on this information,the psr concluded that million was likely to be the appropriate amount for restitution,but it noted that the government intended to provide more specific numbers at the time of sentencing.
by february,the postal inspection service had completed an extensive investigation of efoora.this information prompted the government to file a new calculation of loss with the district court in this version,it asserted that efoora had defrauded shareholders of over the course of the scheme.of that total,represented the amount for which dokich,who had been an account executive from to,was responsible.the filing incorporated the postal agent detailed report,which explained how loss was calculated.first,the postal agent identified stock certificates representing more than million shares in efoora,which were dubbed victim certificates because investors bought the securities and never saw any return.next,the postal agent calculated the total amount paid for those outstanding securities.this figure was based on reports from investors of actual expenditures on victim certificates,and,where that information was not available,on the estimated amount someone would have paid for the stock based on the average share price at the time of the sale in question.the postal agent noted that the current value of efoora shares was discounted to zero,to maximize the recovery to investors,and so the total of was simply the amount investors had paid for all outstanding shares.along with its new calculation,the government gave the district court an appendix detailing the amounts lost by individual victims.
in march,the probation officer supplemented dokich psr again.this time,it noted that even though the estimated losses had increased from million to over million,the government was not seeking the sentencing guidelines enhancement for a loss of between and.the probation officer disapproved of that decision and recommended that the district court use the figure to calculate both restitution and dokich offense level under the guidelines.dokich objected to the supplemental psr he took the position that he could have foreseen only million in losses.in response,the government dismissed dokich estimate as meritless and reiterated that a lthough the actual loss was more than million,the government is not arguing for a higher guideline level.
five days before the sentencing hearing,the government submitted a final calculation of loss to the victims and required restitution.it updated its calculation based on further review of information submitted by efoora victims,and it added close to million in losses based on newly discovered securities called revenue royalty rights,which efoora had sold to a number of investors.according to the final calculation,dokich was responsible for.
at sentencing in july,dokich agreed to take responsibility for million of fraudulent stock sales.the court,however,decided to accept the government figures.the court noted that efoora victims had invested in a situation in which they were defrauded to the tune of the figures i have seen in the government response,which reflected million in loss.the district court used that range to calculate dokich sentence.over the government objection,the court relied on the april supplement to the guidelines.adopting the sentencing recommendation from the supplemental psr,the court increased dokich base offense level of six by to reflect million in loss,b l,and by an additional six levels because the crime involved more than victims,b c.after reducing the range for acceptance of responsibility,the court found that dokich final offense level was,and it placed him in criminal history category i,resulting in a guidelines range of months.the court sentenced dokich to months,below the calculated range.
at the end of the sentencing hearing,the district court turned to restitution.noting that a restitution award was required by statute and lamenting that any award would amount to tapping an empty barrel,the district court reviewed the government filings on loss and the lengthy appendix detailing the experience of individual victims.at various points,the court recognized that the government had asked for restitution of almost million as to dokich.after expressing concern that the number of victims would make restitution difficult to administer,the court concluded,i will make the determination that the amounts of restitution are joint and several in the sum that provided by the government.on the same day,the court entered a judgment and commitment order,which included restitution,and noted,all the victims are listed in the list provided to the district clerk office.dokich did not object to this part of the judgment.
we appointed susan kister to represent dokich in his appeal.unable to identify any nonfrivolous issue,attorney kister filed a motion to withdraw.anders california.dokich responded,arguing that even though he had received a sentence,the district court should have sentenced him based on million in loss,not million.although we found no merit in that argument,we noted that there was a conflict between the order imposing restitution in the amount of and the guidelines calculation,which was based on a maximum of million in loss.concluding that a restitution award can never exceed the actual loss suffered by victims,we asked attorney kister to proceed with the appeal.she did,and we thank her for her assistance to this court and to her client.
dokich only argument at this point is that the restitution component of the judgment can not stand,because the court never made a finding that efoora victims actually lost.the remedy,in his view,is to vacate that order and remand for reconsideration.because dokich failed to object to the district court calculations,he concedes that this court may review the decision only for plain error.united states allen,cir.under that standard of review,dokich must show that the
