jonathan culbert,and johnny watts were indicted,along with a number of other defendants,for their involvement in a scheme to cash stolen treasury checks and launder the proceeds.a jury found watts guilty of one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud and transport stolen checks in interstate commerce,see,and a second count of conspiracy to commit money laundering,see id.h.the district court sentenced him to a total of months imprisonment and ordered him to pay in restitution.two months later,at a separate trial,a different jury found culbert guilty of the same two crimes.the district court sentenced him to a total of months imprisonment and imposed in restitution.both defendants now appeal their convictions and sentences.we affirm the judgments in all respects.
the two juries found that watts and culbert played a part in the same conspiracies,but neither man knew the other.each defendant instead dealt principally with gene vaughn,the central figure in the conspiracy.the defendants respective roles in vaughn scheme are summarized in relevant part below.
jonathan culbert.
in early culbert sister,sheryl,solicited florida resident marlon holt to cash stolen treasury checks.at the time she did not reveal the source of the stolen checks.holt,in turn,asked vaughn,a wisconsin resident who partnered with holt in previous forgery schemes,to incorporate a fake corporation.in march of that year,holt and vaughn,using aliases,incorporated ez check cashing and opened a corporate checking account in that name at a wells fargo branch in milwaukee.the two agreed that holt would get the stolen checks from sheryl roommate,alvyna sanders,and send them on to vaughn for deposit into the ez check cashing account.the take was to be split into thirds one third to be shared by sheryl and holt,for sheryl source,and for vaughn.
during a conversation in the summer of,sheryl hinted to holt that her brother,culbert,a postal service employee working at the los angeles processing and distribution center lapdc,was the source of the stolen checks.sheryl later introduced culbert to holt and,on three separate occasions,confirmed that culbert was stealing from the mail the checks she was sending to holt.culbert had even engineered a schedule change that summer from the day shift to the night shift,giving him greater access to the machine that sorted treasury checks.
the stolen treasury checks consisted mostly of income tax refunds from the irs and benefit checks from the social security administration,all but one of which were payable to california residents.at first,vaughn paid sheryl and holt by mailing checks drawn on the ez check cashing account to holt,who would take his cut and send the balance on to sheryl in california.soon,however,vaughn bypassed holt and began distributing funds directly to sheryl through sanders,who had opened a bank account in california where the roommates lived.culbert continued to supply vaughn with stolen treasury checks at least until the end of september,and by that point vaughn had deposited just over checks totaling over.but the precise number of checks supplied by culbert is uncertain because,as we will see,during part of that time watts also was providing vaughn with treasury checks stolen in california.
in november federal investigators executed a search warrant at culbert home.the warrant,predicated on an affidavit authored by irs special agent thomas glunz,noted that persons who commit forgery crimes typically retain in their possession items relating to those crimes.one item found in culbert bedroom during the search was a stolen check in the amount of.that uncashed check,which would have been processed through lapdc,was issued by holy family hospital in payment for services to sulzer orthopedics.
johnny watts 
watts,another california resident,first met vaughn in july while delivering a cadillac escalade to a mutual friend in california.during this meeting vaughn boasted about some of his illegal activities,including the creation and operation of ez check cashing.watts then disclosed that he also had access to stolen treasury checks,and a week later he telephoned vaughn to inform him that a batch had just been received.vaughn proposed that watts give him the checks and let him deposit them into the ez check cashing account.vaughn suggested that watts could receive his cut by opening a wells fargo account in los angeles and giving the account number to vaughn so that vaughn could write checks to watts on the ez check cashing account and deposit them in milwaukee.watts agreed to the plan,which called for an even split between the two men.
in august,watts used a false social security number and a phony drivers license to open an account with wells fargo in los angeles.watts gave as his street address the address for a road runner maildrop he had rented with yet another fake name and address two weeks earlier.that same day in milwaukee,vaughn deposited into watts account three checks drawn on the ez check cashing account for,and.by the end of september,vaughn had deposited seven more such checks for a grand total of.
by october,wells fargo had shut down the ez check cashing account and watts personal account.after that,between november and april,watts mailed vaughn at least four packages containing stolen treasury checks.vaughn twice responded by sending watts checks drawn on a newly opened wells fargo account in the name of tax returns by redd,which vaughn had opened to replace the defunct ez check cashing account.the address watts used on his mailings,much like the one he used to open his wells fargo account,was in fact the address of mail boxes,another maildrop where watts had rented a mailbox under an alias.watts later had his wife,cheryl,open a new wells fargo account in california so that vaughn could resume depositing watts cut in milwaukee instead of mailing checks to him in california.the street address cheryl used was once again the address of a commercial maildrop,not the couple residence.wells fargo,however,caught up with vaughn again and closed down his tax returns by redd account in late april.at that point,vaughn stopped getting checks from watts and the conspiracy ended.by then watts had provided vaughn with stolen treasury checks totaling,of which his cut had been.
in january a federal grand jury in milwaukee returned an indictment against sheryl,holt,vaughn,and culbert.two months later the grand jury returned a superseding indictment adding watts.sheryl,holt,and vaughn all pleaded guilty.culbert,arguing that special agent glunz affidavit did not establish probable cause,moved to suppress the evidence obtained during the november search of his residence.the district court denied the motion,reasoning that the affidavit included sufficient facts to demonstrate probable cause that evidence of culbert involvement in the ring might be found at his residence.
watts,who was tried in july before culbert,moved in limine to exclude evidence that he and cheryl opened their wells fargo accounts using addresses for commercial mailboxes rented under aliases.the district court reserved ruling on this motion and then denied it after three days of trial testimony.culbert,tried separately in september,moved in limine to exclude evidence that he also had provided stolen treasury checks to others not involved in this scheme.once again the court reserved ruling,and once again after three days of trial testimony the court allowed the evidence in.
together,culbert and watts raise eight issues on appeal,three of which concern the district court administration of the trial and five that concern sentencing.we discuss each issue in turn,providing additional facts as necessary.

search warrant 
culbert first argues that the district court erred by not granting his motion to suppress the fruits of the search of his residence.he argues,as he did in the district court,that special agent glunz affidavit did not establish probable cause to believe that incriminating evidence would be found in his home and thus,he continues,the warrant was invalid.in reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress,we review the district court findings of
