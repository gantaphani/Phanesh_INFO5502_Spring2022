introduction 
after defendants youssef semaan and liliane semaan defendants pled guilty to grand theft and fraud,the trial court conducted restitution hearings under penal code section appellants elham cherfan and marie rose roukoz semaan claimants submitted verified claims to protect their bank account funds from being distributed to defendants crime victims as restitution.claimants were not involved in the charged crimes.nevertheless,the trial court denied their claims on the grounds defendants unlawful activities involved fraudulently using claimants identities and controlling their bank funds.
claimants appeal from the order denying their verified claims to protect their bank funds,and from the order seizing and using claimants bank account funds to pay defendants crime victims restitution.claimants contend the people did not meet their burden of proving claimants did not have a legitimate interest in the bank funds.
we conclude claimants met their initial burden of proving they had legal title to their bank account funds.in order to refute this,the people were required to prove by clear and convincing evidence that claimants did not have a legitimate interest in the funds.as to marie,the people failed to do so.the trial court erred in ordering her bank funds used for restitution.as to cherfan,the people succeeded in presenting clear and convincing evidence that cherfan did not have a legitimate interest in her bank account funds.the court thus properly denied cherfan claim seeking to protect her bank account funds but erred in denying marie claim.the judgment is affirmed as to cherfan and reversed as to marie.
factual and procedural background 
in october,the people filed a complaint against defendants,alleging that on or about march,defendants committed grand theft,subd.a.the people also filed a petition and supplemental petition to preserve property subject to levy or seizure under section,known as the aggravated white collar crime enhancement.in the supplemental petition the people identified additional property they requested preserved and seized under section,including funds in marie and cherfan wells fargo bank accounts.claimants are of defendants.
in early november,claimants,who both resided in lebanon,filed verified claims and amended claims to protect their bank account funds from possible levy or seizure under section.marie sought protection of located in her wells fargo bank account and cherfan requested protection of in her wells fargo bank account.
marie alleged in her claim that the funds were from the sale of her and her deceased husband home.marie husband died in,and she sold their home in august.marie deposited the sales proceeds,in her wells fargo bank account.her social security benefits were also deposited in the bank account.
cherfan alleged in her claim that her bank account funds of were from the sale of defendants residence located on pepperwood lane in corona,and were from defendants repayment of a loan.
at the end of november,defendants pleaded guilty to a information charging them with credit card and check fraud resulting in damages to their victims in excess of.defendants allegedly unlawfully took money and personal property from victims,delivered checks and drafts for the payment of money knowing defendants had insufficient funds or credit for payment of those instruments,and relied upon fraudulent personal information as to salary,employment,and value of homes to obtain credit.neither claimants was charged with involvement in defendants fraud scheme.
on october,the trial court held a hearing on claimants verified claims for protection of their bank account funds.the court heard testimony from claimants expert witness,certified public accountant susan carroll and the people witness,detective brad kloepfer.after hearing testimony and argument,the court took the matter under submission.on february,the court denied both claims and ordered claimants bank funds seized and distributed to defendants crime victims as restitution.
after the court denied claimants claims for protection of their bank funds,the court conducted a restitution hearing for the purpose of determining the amount of restitution defendants were required to pay.the court ordered defendants to repay the victims in restitution.in a separate appeal case no,defendants challenged the amount of the restitution order,claiming it should be reduced.this court affirmed the lower court restitution order.
third party claims of interest in bank account funds 
claimants contend the trial court erred in denying their claims for protection of their bank funds from being used to pay restitution to defendants crime victims.specifically,claimants argue the people failed to meet their burden of establishing by clear and convincing evidence that claimants did not have a legitimate interest in the bank funds.
law applicable to claims for protection of assets 
when a defendant is charged with having committed two or more related felonies involving fraud or embezzlement,a pattern of related felony conduct,and the taking of more than,the defendant may also be charged with the aggravated white collar crime enhancement,subd.a.if found true or admitted,the enhancement subjects the defendant to an additional prison term of one to five years,paying restitution to the defendant victims,and fines.id.at subds.a d,subds.a b.
after the specified felonies and enhancement are charged,the superior court is authorized under section to preserve or freeze any asset or property that is in the control of th e defendant,pending the outcome of the criminal proceeding,in order to pay restitution and fines,subd.e.section is thus sometimes referred to as the freeze and seize law.people green th,d.
a section proceeding is pendent to the defendant criminal proceeding and is solely for the purpose of imposing the section criminal remedies of restitution and fines,subd.e.the prosecuting agency initiates a section proceeding by petitioning the superior court for a temporary restraining order,preliminary injunctive relief,the appointment of a receiver,or for any other relief necessary to preserve the defendant assets and properties,pending the outcome of the criminal proceeding.id.at subd.e.anyone claiming an interest in the property may file a verified claim stating the nature and amount of his or her interest in the property,subd.e.
following the defendant conviction or admission of the specified felonies and aggravated white collar crime enhancement,the assets and properties may be levied upon and liquidated to pay the restitution and fines,subds.i j.
burden of proof 
the parties disagree as to the applicable burden of proof and who bears it.the people argue claimants bear the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that they have a legitimate interest in the bank funds.a preponderance of the evidence standard requires that the existence of a fact be more probable than not.tannehill finch d.
claimants,on the other hand,argue the people have the burden of showing by clear and convincing evidence that claimants property interest was not legitimately acquired.the clear and convincing burden of proof requires that the evidence be so clear as to leave no substantial doubt in the mind of the trier of fact it must be sufficiently strong to command the unhesitating assent of every reasonable mind.citation.citation.tannehill finch,supra,d at.
the trial court did not indicate which burden of proof it applied or the grounds for denying the claimants claims,other than that there was insufficient evidence.the court stated as to cherfan claim that the court did not find the opinion evidence supporting the claim credible.as to marie claim,the court stated she failed to provide evidence she owned any money in her bank account.the court did not provide any explanation as to how it arrived at this conclusion or why it did not believe claimants expert testimony.
section does not specify the applicable burden of proof.the usual burden of proof applicable in criminal proceedings does not apply here since the restitution proceeding is a collateral matter in which the restitution order is enforceable as a civil money judgment.people guardado th,d penal code,subd.e.when the legislature does not specify a burden of proof,the preponderance of evidence standard applies,aydin first state ins.cal th,d.under evidence code section,as the parties filing claims for protection of funds,the claimants bear this initial burden of proof except as otherwise provided by law,a party has the burden of proof as to each fact the existence or nonexistence of which is essential to the claim for relief or defense that he is asserting.
under evidence code sections and,claimants thus bear the initial burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence the nature and amount of their interest in the property subject to forfeiture.once claimants have met this burden of proof,the burden of producing evidence shifts to the people under evidence code section.evidence code section provides the owner of the legal title to property is presumed to be the owner of the full beneficial title.this presumption may be rebutted only by clear and convincing proof.
because claimants and the people view the trial court action of ordering restitution and denying their claims as one action,they maintain that the proper standard of review is abuse of discretion.while we agree that restitution orders are reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard of review in re johnny th,d we disagree that the same standard applies to the order denying claimants claims.instead,because the trial court had to weigh the evidence in making its decision,we find that the question on appeal is governed by the substantial evidence rule like any other issue of fact.
as discussed further below,in the instant case,the evidence was sufficient to meet claimants burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that they had legal title to the wells fargo funds.the funds were contained in bank accounts held in the claimants names.the burden thus shifted to the people to show by clear and convincing evidence that claimants did not have any legitimate interest in the funds.
the people argue in their respondent brief that they were not required to establish this.rather,the people argue they only had to show defendants had control over the funds.then the burden was on claimants to refute this by a preponderance of the evidence.while a showing of defendants control over an innocent third party property may be sufficient grounds for granting pendente lite orders to preserve the property,section does not state that a showing of control alone constitutes sufficient grounds for taking an innocent third party property and using it for restitution.
we conclude this based on the statutory language of section as a whole.in construing section,our fundamental task is to determine the legislature intent so as to effectuate the law purpose.citation.we begin by examining the statute words,giving them a plain and commonsense meaning.citation.citations.if possible,significance should be given to every word,phrase,sentence and part of an act in pursuance of the legislative purpose.citation.citation.where the legislative intent is expressed in unambiguous terms,we must treat the statutory language as conclusive no resort to extrinsic aids is necessary or proper.citation.citation.where the statutory language is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation,however,we look to extrinsic aids,including the objects of the legislation,public policy,and the statutory scheme of which the statute is a part.citations.we do not consider the particular clause or section in isolation,but instead examine it in the context of the statutory framework as a whole,keeping in mind the scope and purpose of the provision and harmonizing it with the statutory scheme.citations.people superior court plascencia th,d.
in considering section as a whole,as well as section legislative history,we reject the proposition that defendants control of claimants bank accounts was a sufficient basis for seizing and using claimants bank funds for restitution.subdivisions g and i of section clearly state that,in ordering restitution,the court must protect the property of innocent third parties in making its final order,the court shall seek to protect the legitimately acquired interests of any innocent third persons,including an innocent spouse,who were not involved in the commission of any criminal activity,subd.i.it is clear from this language that,when ordering restitution,the court can not take and use innocent third parties property for restitution.
although section,subdivision e,allows the court to issue pendente lite orders to preserve property controlled by defendant until a defendant is tried,such control is not a sufficient ground for ultimately taking and using an innocent third party property for restitution.even if the court issues a pendente lite order based on a defendant control of a third party property,in doing so,the court is required to protect the third party property interests.at this stage,a third party property interests generally remain protected since the property is merely being preserved and the status quo maintained until the defendant is tried for the criminal offenses.section is referred to as the the freeze and seize law because it provides for freezing the defendant assets before trial,and seizing them only after he or she has been found guilty.people green th,d.
once property has been frozen pending a defendant trial,the property owner has the opportunity to avoid losing the property by filing a verified claim for protection of the property.the court must then conduct a hearing to determine if the innocent third party has a legitimate interest in the property,and if so,the court must protect it from being taken from the innocent third party without just compensation.subdivision i states that if a defendant is convicted,at the sentencing hearing the trial judge shall make a finding at that time as to what portion,if any,of the property or assets subject to the preliminary injunction or temporary restraining order shall be levied upon to pay fines and restitution,i a.
while the purpose of section is to facilitate reimbursement of crime victims,as well as provide enhanced punishment,the legislature also made it clear that,in ordering restitution,the court must protect innocent third parties from losing their property.com.on crim,analysis of bill,reg.sess.april.even if the defendant controlled the property,there is no language in section which authorizes the trial court to take an innocent third party property and use it for restitution,particularly if the third party was unaware that the defendant was in control of the property or using it for an illicit purpose.
here,the claimants bank funds were ordered taken from claimants and used for paying restitution to defendants crime victims.viewing section as a whole,particularly the provisions mandating the court to protect innocent third party property interests,we conclude evidence of defendants control over claimants bank funds is not a sufficient ground for seizing and using the funds to pay restitution.in order to refute the claimants property claims,the people must prove that the claimants did not have any legitimate interest in the funds.
marie rose semaan claim 
marie filed a verified claim to contained in a wells fargo bank account in her name.it is undisputed the funds were in a bank account in her name.this satisfied marie initial burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that she had legal title to the funds in her account.
in addition,the people stipulated the sum of in marie bank account was from the sale of her home,which had been in her deceased husband name.upon his death,marie inherited title to the home.there is no evidence that the funds marie and her deceased husband used to acquire their home were derived from an illegal source,such as from stolen or laundered funds.also,claimants expert witness,certified public accountant susan carroll,testified that marie was the seller of the residence and the proceeds from the sale were deposited in marie account in august,when escrow closed.the only other money in the bank account was from marie so
