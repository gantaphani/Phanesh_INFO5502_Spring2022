petitioner jon knutsen,a citizen of norway and a lawful permanent resident of the united states,appeals a decision by the board of immigration appeals bia which affirmed the immigration judge ij order of removal.the ij decision was based on a determination that monetary losses from unconvicted relevant conduct could be considered in calculating whether knutsen had been convicted of a crime of fraud involving losses greater than,pursuant to section of the immigration and nationality act ina.see a a iii.the ij primarily relied on the tenth circuit decision in khalayleh ins,cir,which held that losses from dismissed counts in an indictment could be considered,provided those counts were part of the same fraudulent scheme.because the ij decision is contrary to the plain language of the ina,and the ij misapplied the khalayleh decision,we grant knutsen petition for review,vacate the ij order of removal,and remand for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.
background 
in,knutsen was admitted to the united states as a lawful permanent resident,a status that he has continuously held since that time on february,a federal grand jury indicted knutsen on two counts of bank fraud under.count one alleged that from january through july,knutsen executed a scheme to defraud his employer,firstar bank,by converting funds from firstar bank petty cash and operating accounts and depositing them into his personal account and depositing a customer check,which was payable to firstar bank,into his personal account.count one alleged a total loss from knutsen misappropriation of funds.count two alleged that during september knutsen orchestrated a scheme.he deposited several checks,drawn on his firstar personal account,at several atm to take advantage of the time delay in processing the checks.this gave him an artificially inflated balance in his account,causing firstar to lose.
on september,knutsen entered into a written plea agreement in which he pled guilty to count one.the government,in turn,agreed to dismiss count two.knutsen also stipulated that the facts alleged in count two constituted relevant conduct within the meaning of sentencing guideline.for the purpose of adjustments under the sentencing guidelines,he acknowledged that the total loss from the offense of conviction and relevant conduct exceeded.
on september,the district court judge,after dismissing count two,consistent with the plea agreement,sentenced knutsen to five months imprisonment,with a recommendation for home confinement,and three years supervised release.in the judgment order,under the section entitled guideline range determined by the court,the district court judge entered a total amount of restitution of,although he did not order actual payment of restitution 
on november,the government moved for knutsen removal due to his bank fraud conviction,claiming that since knutsen had been convicted of an aggravated felony relating to fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victims exceeded,he was subject to removal under section of the ina.
following several hearings,the ij issued a written opinion in which he concluded that knutsen conviction constituted an aggravated felony under the ina.as a result,the ij ordered that knutsen be removed from the united states to norway.the bia affirmed the ij decision,without opinion,and knutsen now appeals.
ii.analysis 
jurisdiction and standard of review 
our jurisdiction in this case is limited by the ina,which precludes judicial review of any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed an aggravated felony.a c,a a iii.this provision,however,does not limit judicial review of questions of law raised upon a petition for review.a d see also gattem gonzales,cir noting that the recent real id act of provides the court with jurisdiction to review questions of law.furthermore,this court retains the authority to assess its own jurisdiction w hen judicial review depends on a particular fact or legal conclusion,then a court may determine whether that condition exists.yang ins,cir.consequently,we have jurisdiction to determine whether knutsen has been convicted of an offense involving fraud or deceit,with losses greater than.see also ins,cir.

b.the indictment did not allege a single fraudulent scheme that encompassed the acts alleged in counts one and two.
under the ina,a ny alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission is deportable.a a iii.an aggravated felony includes any offense that involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds.a m i.knutsen does not dispute that he was convicted of an offense involving fraud or deceit.instead,his sole argument is that his offense of conviction is not an aggravated felony under the ina because he pled guilty solely to count one,which involved a loss,which was below the threshold.knutsen argues that the additional in losses stemming from count two can not be added to the losses from count one because he was not convicted of any of the fraudulent acts alleged in count two,as the government dismissed count two as part of knutsen plea bargain.
knutsen argument is supported by the plain and unambiguous language of the statute,which predicates removal on a convicted offense resulting in losses greater than.a a iii,a m i see also khalayleh,at finding the operative language of the pertinent ina provisions unambiguous.this plain language forecloses inclusion of losses stemming from unconvicted offenses,and,as we explain below,should have terminated knutsen removal proceeding at the very outset.
the ij,however,did not stop with the statutory language.instead,after correctly determining that this circuit had not yet addressed whether unconvicted fraudulent conduct can be used in the calculation of loss amounts under the pertinent provisions of the ina,the ij turned to the tenth circuit decision in khalayleh ins,cir,as well as the ninth circuit decision in chang ins,cir.although both these cases are instructive,neither supports the ij decision here.to the contrary,a precise reading of these cases compels the opposite result.
in khalayleh,a petitioner was charged with bank fraud based on a scheme,in which the petitioner knowingly wrote several checks drawn on various accounts at several banks.khalayleh,at.the indictment had four counts,with each count representing a different fraudulent check.id.thus,the separate counts were essentially mirror images of one another,and merely segmented the component acts of a larger fraudulent scheme.the petitioner pled guilty to a single count,which carried a loss of,although he agreed to provide total restitution in the amount of.id.when the government sought removal under the ina,the petitioner argued that he fell outside of the ina provisions for an aggravated felony because his offense of conviction involved a loss under.id.at.the tenth circuit disagreed,and held that there was no ambiguity regarding the scope of the offense to which petitioner pleaded.id.at.rather,the indictment alleged a single scheme to defraud that encompassed a number of checks,and,therefore,the offense of conviction was the entire scheme.id.as a result,the tenth circuit concluded that the proper total loss calculation should have included losses from all four counts.id.
in the ij view,the khalayleh case determined the outcome here.khalayleh,however,is readily distinguishable.specifically,the tenth circuit decision depended entirely on an integral fact that is missing here namely,an overarching fraudulent scheme that encompassed the individual counts in the indictment.indeed,the tenth circuit fully recognized the importance of connecting all the counts in the indictm
