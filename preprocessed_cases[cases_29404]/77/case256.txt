oh what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive 
sir walter scott,marmion,canto vi,stanza.
in his capacity as the state director of the united public workers,afscme,local,afl cio upw petitioner gary wayne rodrigues negotiated contracts with dental and health insurance providers,ostensibly on behalf of upw members and their families.the providers were hawaii dental services hds and pacific group medical association pgma.at rodrigues request,the providers included in these contracts what purported to be consultant fees.these fees were effectively to be paid by upw members as part of their insurance premiums to the insurance providers,but the fees eventually ended up in the pockets of persons rodrigues designated as the consultants.as it turned out,the purported consultants were the stepfather of rodrigues girlfriend and secretary,al loughrin,and shell companies of which rodrigues daughter,robin haunani rodrigues sabatini sabatini,was the sole shareholder,only director,and simultaneously the president,vice president,secretary,and treasurer.during the investigation of these relationships and transactions,it was discovered that neither designated consultant did any real consulting work on these contracts,and that part of the consultant fees were diverted to rodrigues personal use circumstances unknown to the upw.
a jury convicted rodrigues of fifty counts of theft of honest services from the upw and its members.the jury also convicted him of conspiracy,embezzlement,money laundering,and health care fraud.
after we affirmed his conviction on appeal,united states rodrigues,fed.appx.cir.june,unpublished,the supreme court decided in skilling united states,that the crime of theft of the intangible right of honest services,as described in and alleged in counts,is limited to conduct that encompasses bribes and kickbacks,id.at,because any broader construction would be unconstitutionally vague,id.at.the jury in rodrigues case had not been so instructed,leaving us here with an instructional omission of constitutional proportions regarding an element of the crime of which he was convicted.we must now decide,as commissioned by the court in skilling,whether that trial error was harmless,or not.
following a searching examination of the record,we conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that this error had no substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury verdict,brecht abrahamson,internal quotation marks omitted see also hedgpeth pulido,per curiam whether a defendant suffered prejudice from an instructional error is governed by the brecht standard neder united states,harmlessness with respect to the omission of an element of the offense from the instructions must be demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt.accordingly,we affirm the theft of honest services,money laundering,and health care fraud judgments of conviction against rodrigues and the denial of his petition by the district court.
background 
the serial consultants rodrigues designated in this scheme were al loughrin loughrin,and later,effectively rodrigues daughter robin haunani rodrigues sabatini sabatini,whose companies at different times received the disputed consultant fees from upw.loughrin was the upw consultant from october,until march.loughrin,to whom petitioner owed,was also the stepfather of petitioner girlfriend and secretary,georgietta carol.between and,hds paid loughrin in consultant fees.this money went to extinguish a personal debt rodrigues owed to loughrin,a debt that had no connection to upw business.loughrin widow and carol both testified that loughrin did not perform any consulting work for upw in exchange for the fees.
on march,after the personal debt to loughrin had been satisfied,petitioner informed hds that loughrin was no longer a upw consultant.rodrigues then directed that all consultant fees should be held until a new consultant was designated.thereafter,petitioner designated his daughter company,four winds rsk,four winds of kapaa,kauai as the consultant.four winds was not incorporated until february.at that point,hds cleared its books with respect to the accrued consultant fees by writing a check in the amount of to four winds on march,covering premiums paid by upw for the period from january through december before four winds was incorporated.beginning on march,and through,hds continued to make quarterly payments to four winds.at trial,various upw witnesses testified that they had no contact with four winds other than to send it checks,and that they had never seen any work produced by sabatini.
in late,adverse attention was drawn by the media to four winds,so sabatini transferred four winds assets to a new company called,which was incorporated using only her middle and maiden names.at rodrigues direction,hds then began indirectly to make payments to,in by paying the consultant fees to voluntary employees benefit association of hawaii vebah.vebah then paid the fees to management applied programming map,which in turn paid.sabatini at this time tried to make it seem as though she had performed consulting work,but in actuality all the documentation and work she submitted to map had been done by upw employees.
jury instruction 
the jury was instructed with respect to mail fraud as charged in counts as follows 
first,the defendant knowingly devised a scheme or artifice to deprive upw and its members of their right to defendant gary rodrigues honest services as the state director of upw second,the defendant acted with the intent to deprive upw and its members of their right to the honest services of gary rodrigues third,the defendant knew or reasonably should have foreseen that the scheme could cause some economic or pecuniary harm to the upw and its members.pecuniary harm may include,but is not limited to,loss of services that were due and fourth,in advancing,or furthering,or carrying out,or attempting to carry out an essential part of the scheme,the defendant caused the use of the united states mails.
pursuant to skilling,the appropriate instruction for this charge is now found in our ninth circuit model criminal jury instructions for mail fraud scheme to defraud deprivation of right to honest services.this new skilling instruction requires a jury to find that 
first,the defendant devised or knowingly participated in a scheme or plan to deprive victim of his her right of honest services second,the scheme or plan consists of a bribe kickback in exchange for the defendant services.the exchange may be express or may be implied from all the surrounding circumstances third,the defendant acted with the intent to defraud by depriving victim of his her right of honest services fourth,the defendant act was material that is,it had a natural tendency to influence,or was capable of influencing,a person an entity acts and fifth,the defendant used,or caused someone to use the mails to carry out or to attempt to carry out the scheme or plan.
ninth circuit model criminal jury instructions.
using this new instruction as a guide,our task thus is to ascertain whether it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that a rational jury would have found rodrigues guilty of theft of honest services absent the error.neder,at.accordingly,we ask in typical fashion,whether the record contains evidence that could rationally lead to a contrary finding with respect to the omitted element.id.at.our review of the district court harmless error determination is de novo,its finding of facts is for clear error.padilla terhune,cir.
the supreme court in skilling gave us a classic example of a kickback,the elements and dna of which we have in mind as we begin our analysis.the factual example chosen by the court comes from mcnally united states,which the skilling court portrayed as follows 
a public official,in exchange for routing kentucky insurance business through a middleman company,arranged for that company to share its commissions with entities in which the official held an interest.this was no mere failure to disclose a conflict of interest rather,the official conspired with a third party so that both would profit from wealth generated by public contracts.
