the,raul carvajal,was prosecuted in the southern district of florida for money laundering and was acquitted at the conclusion of a jury trial.he then brought this civil suit in the northern district of illinois against drug enforcement administration dea task force officer louis dominguez,for damages,alleging violations of his constitutional rights in connection with the criminal prosecution.the illinois district court granted dominguez motion for summary judgment in part by dismissing several counts of carvajal amended complaint,but the court denied the motion with respect to a count which asserted a bivens cause of action alleging a brady violation.that decision also included a denial of qualified immunity for dominguez.this appeal followed.
background 
the relevant facts revolve around officer dominguez identification of carvajal in two undercover money pickups in chicago.chicago dea task force officer wayne hunter was assisting in an investigation called operation double trouble of a money laundering operation in early april.dea miami asked for assistance in arranging two undercover money pickups in chicago.dea miami provided hunter with a cell phone number and a code to be used to arrange the pickups.the first pickup was to occur on april.hunter asked agent dominguez to do the job.dominguez used the cell number to arrange to meet two individuals he later identified them as german matos ruiz and raul carvajal.dominguez met with the men for about five minutes in the midafternoon inside a coconuts music store,and he saw them in the parking lot where he spoke with the man identified as ruiz for a few minutes and observed the man identified as carvajal sitting in a vehicle.a second transaction took place on april.dominguez again identified the men as ruiz and carvajal a woman was also with them.this meeting took place in a baker square restaurant.the meeting lasted about minutes.during the meeting dominguez initially sat next to the man identified as carvajal with the man identified as ruiz across the table later the men switched,putting the supposed carvajal across the table from dominguez.this meeting also occurred in the midafternoon.
it is unclear just when hunter learned of carvajal name in connection with the money laundering testified in a deposition in this civil action that he may have gotten the name from dea miami or from a chicago field office intelligence analyst who traced the cell number to carvajal.either way,on april,an intelligence analyst in chicago requested a photo of carvajal from the illinois secretary of state.hunter did not remember when he got the photo or whether he had it before april,the date of the first undercover pickup.hunter said he knew carvajal name by april and may have had the picture by the.
dominguez said that he did not see carvajal photo or have his name prior to the april meeting.dominguez claims that he first saw carvajal photo sometime between the first meeting on april and may,the date of his written reports.he can not recall whether he saw another photo at the same time he saw carvajal or not.he never saw a formal lineup.hunter testified that he possibly gave carvajal name and photographic image to dominguez prior to the april,operation to make sure that dominguez had all the information about the case and that dominguez was not meeting with someone he already knew.it is agreed that hunter would have provided whatever information he had to dominguez,including the so would have been his normal practice.
a federal grand jury in miami indicted carvajal and others in connection with a money laundering scheme in a superceding indictment he was charged only with acting as a courier.carvajal filed a motion to suppress dominguez identification of him as unduly suggestive in light of the procedure used.the judge denied the motion after an evidentiary hearing at which dominguez and another law enforcement officer not hunter testified.the judge began his ruling with the assumption that the photo identification procedure used by dominguez was unduly suggestive,but he found that regardless of whether the procedure used was impermissibly suggestive,there was not a substantial likelihood of misidentification.he noted that dominguez had an excellent opportunity to view carvajal at the time of the two money pick ups and that there was no evidence that he was pressured to select carvajal photograph.that judge also made a finding that during a separate undercover money pickup in which dominguez was not involved,a vehicle was seen that was registered to carvajal.later,in a trial with one,who was found guilty,a jury acquitted carvajal.
this brings us to the instant case in which carvajal brought this civil suit in the northern district of illinois for damages against dominguez.the district court granted dominguez motion for summary judgment on count one,a claim for false arrest and unlawful search and seizure,and count two,a claim alleging a deprivation of liberty.the court also granted the motion with respect to count claim for police witnesses are entitled to absolute immunity from perjury claims for trials and pretrial proceedings and found no evidence supporting an application of the complaining witness exception to this rule.count three claimed that dominguez withheld favorable evidence in violation of brady maryland,d.the amended complaint alleged that he knowingly and falsely identified carvajal as the perpetrator in a money laundering conspiracy and wrote false police reports about him.the district court denied dominguez motion for summary judgment with respect to this claim.in its decision,the court rejected the notion that an acquitted defendant,such as carvajal,can not have a brady claim but noted that the question is an open one in this circuit and that the district court is split on the question.the court concluded that an acquittal alone does not show that the police officers complied with brady or that the defendant trial was fair and applied the brady analysis on a prospective basis.analyzing under brady,the judge explained carvajal identified as exculpatory dominguez alleged failure to tell the prosecutor that he was given carvajal name and photographic image before the first transaction on april.this evidence would have impeached dominguez testimony at trial that he did not know carvajal name or see his photograph until after the april,transaction and undermined the credibility of dominguez,identification of carvajal.according to the district court,this was material because it would have changed the outcome of the suppression hearing,and the withholding of evidence denied him a fair trial.the court also concluded that dominguez was not entitled to qualified immunity explaining that the boundaries of brady as applied to this case have long been established.
dominguez now appeals.
ii.discussion analysis 
this case comes to us from a denial of summary a case in such a posture is not immediately appealable to our court.we have jurisdiction,however,under and the collateral order doctrine.an appeal of an order denying qualified immunity is a application of this doctrine a district court denial of a claim of qualified immunity,to the extent that it turns on an issue of law is an appealable final decision within the meaning of,notwithstanding the absence of a final judgment.mitchell forsyth,d.
the supreme court recently clarified that the scope of this doctrine includes jurisdiction over whether to devise a new bivens damages action and explained 
we recognized just last term that the definition of an element of the asserted cause of action was directly implicated by the defense of qualified immunity and properly before us on interlocutory appeal.hartman moore,d.because the same reasoning applies to the recognition of the entire cause of action,the court of appeals had jurisdiction of this issue,as do we.
wilkie robbins,d.thus,we have jurisdiction over the questions presented by this appeal.our review is de novo.see wernsing thompson,cir wade hopper,cir.
determining whether a defendant law enforcement officer is entitled to qualified immunity involves a analysis.the first step is whether the facts alleged,taken in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,amount to a constitutional violation.if not,the inquiry ends,and the officer has qualified immunity.if yes,then the second step is whether the violated right was clearly established.this is determined by looking at whether it would be clear to a reasonable official that his or her conduct was unlawful in the situation,michael gresbach,cir.we begin with the first prong and address whether the facts alleged show a constitutional violation.
the constitutional violation alleged in this case was a violation of due process for failure to turn over evidence to the defendant as constitutionally brady violation.brady maryland,d.while most commonly viewed as a prosecutor duty to disclose to the defense,the duty extends to the police and requires that they similarly turn over evidence to the prosecutor,thereby triggering the prosecutor disclosure obligation.see youngblood west virginia,d a brady suppression occurs when the government fails to turn over even evidence that is known only to police investigators and not to the prosecutor citing kyles whitley,d strickler greene,d steidl fermon,cir.a brady violation can be broken down into three basic elements the evidence at issue is favorable to the accused,either being exculpatory or impeaching the evidence must have been suppressed by the government,either willfully or inadvertently and there is a reasonable probability that prejudice other words,materiality.see youngblood,at.united states bland,cir ienco angarone,cir.evidence is suppressed when the prosecution failed to disclose the evidence in time for the defendant to make use of it,and the evidence was not otherwise available to the defendant through the exercise of reasonable diligence.ienco,at.evidence is material if there is a reasonable probability that,had the evidence been disclosed to the defense,the result of the proceeding would have been different.strickler,at.internal quotations omitted see also bland,at.
specifically,carvajal alleges that dominguez failed to disclose that he had carvajal name and saw his photograph prior to the first undercover drug pickup on april.dominguez version of the events is that he did not see carvajal photograph until sometime after the first undercover pickup.hunter deposition testimony,on the other hand,suggests that perhaps dominguez had the photo earlier,prior to the first pickup.this can be inferred from the april request to the illinois secretary of state for a photograph of carvajal and hunter deposition testimony in the civil case that he was sure he would have a picture back from the illinois secretary of state within a week.hunter and dominguez also explained that,per the usual practice,if hunter indeed had the photograph of carvajal before the april undercover pickup he would have shown it to dominguez.carvajal claims that this fact would have been used to impeach dominguez and would have changed the outcome of the suppression hearing and that perhaps carvajal would not even have been subjected to a trial.we simply can not agree,however,that this amounts to a brady violation.
at the most as we must assume from the conflicting recollections of when the photo may have been viewed,the facts could support an inference that dominguez did see the photo before the first pickup and that he lied about when he saw the photograph.but a lying witness is certainly not a brady violation.it is already established law that brady does not extend so far as to provide relief in a situation where a police officer makes a false statement to a prosecutor.harris kuba,cir harris essentially seeks an extension of brady to provide relief if a police officer makes a false statement to a prosecutor by arguing that an officer is suppressing evidence of the truth by making the false statement.this court has already foreclosed this extension.see also sornberger city of knoxville,cir the constitution does not require that police testify truthfully rather the constitutional rule is that the defendant is entitled to a trial that will enable jurors to determine where the truth lies.citations omitted.
moreover,both hunter and dominguez were accessible to the defense for the hearing on the motion to suppress the identification in the criminal case.it is carvajal responsibility to probe the witnesses and investigate their versions of the relevant events.there was nothing preventing carvajal from discovering and drawing out this discrepancy between the officers stories during the suppression hearing.suppression does not occur when the defendant could have discovered it himself through reasonable diligence.ienco,at united states tadros,cir.brady does not require disclosure by one officer that he and another officer,both called as witnesses,have slightly different versions with respect to precisely which date they saw carvajal photograph or learned his name.
there is also a logical flaw in carvajal argument.his claim is based on the fact that dominguez failed to disclose to the prosecutors that he was given carvajal name and shown his photograph prior to the first transaction while insisting the opposite in his police reports and during his testimony appellee br.at.however,the fact that dominguez saw the photograph or had the name prior to the first meeting itself is not impeaching.under brady,the evidence suppressed must be exculpatory or impeaching,not the fact that it was suppressed.now,perhaps,one could,at least logically,argue that the prosecutor failure to disclose that dominguez lied violated brady thus the suppressed impeaching evidence was the fact that dominguez lied and not the fact that he saw a photo.carvajal did not advance such an argument,however,and regardless,it could not logically support a cause of action against dominguez himself,rather than the prosecutor.
and by itself the fact that he saw the photograph before the first pickup is not exculpatory many inferences have to be made to reach that conclusion.see harris,at none of the pieces of evidence the plaintiff points to,when considered at face value,is exculpatory t he evidence is arguably favorable only after several inferences are made this stretches the meaning of favorable beyond that of brady.simply because a trained officer viewed a photograph of someone he might potentially encounter in an undercover make sure it was not someone he already knew,or someone who might know not amount to exculpatory evidence.this is regular police fact,a sign of good police work.it only makes sense that an officer going undercover would gather information about the individuals he may meet,if for no other reason,to preserve his undercover status and ensure his and others safety.as hunter and dominguez testified,obtaining and looking at such information was part of their regular practice.frankly,it is quite difficult to see at all how the regular police practice of checking a photograph before meeting someone undercover amounts to exculpatory evidence.
similarly,there is also no reasonable probability that if dominguez had disclosed that he had carvajal name had seen the photograph prior to the april pickup that his identification of carvajal would have been suppressed or the charges dropped.see strickler,at.t he question is whether the favorable evidence could reasonably be taken to put the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the outcome.quoting kyles,at.the judge at the suppression hearing in response to carvajal challenge to the procedure used assumed that a suggestive identification procedure had been utilized,but nevertheless concluded that there was not a substantial likelihood of misidentification.dominguez had an excellent opportunity to view carvajal at the time of the two money pick ups.there was also other evidence supporting the conclusion that carvajal was involved besides dominguez cell phone number and car links to his,for instance.so,even if there were something troubling about when dominguez saw the photo,carvajal has not shown that it would have made any difference in the outcome.if we focus on the possible impeachment aspect,the best carvajal could have achieved is casting so
