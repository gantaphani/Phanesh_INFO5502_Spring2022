appellant gregory bartko was charged by a superseding indictment with conspiracy to commit mail fraud,launder money instruments,engage in unlawful monetary transactions,make false statements,and obstruct proceedings of the securities and exchange commission sec,in violation of count one mail fraud and aiding and abetting,in violation of and count two through count five sale of unregistered securities and aiding and abetting,in violation of,and count six and making false statements to a federal agent in january and october,in violation of a counts seven and eight.before trial,and pursuant to the government motion,the district court dismissed counts seven and eight,as well as two of the objects of the conspiracy in count one making false statements and obstructing sec proceedings.after a trial,the jury convicted bartko of the remaining counts.
thereafter,bartko filed four motions for a new trial,all of which the district court denied.the district court subsequently sentenced bartko to months imprisonment.this timely appeal followed.
in his appeal,bartko maintains that the district court erred in denying two of his motions for a new trial,improperly considered an ex parte sealed document submitted by the government,abused its discretion by not instructing the jury on testimony and on multiple conspiracies,and improperly imposed sentencing guidelines enhancements based on the amount of loss,the number of victims,and bartko status as a registered at the time of the offenses.we have jurisdiction pursuant to and a.discerning no reversible error,we affirm both bartko conviction and sentence.
from to,bartko was the leader and organizer of a financial scheme that involved securing money from investors to provide funding for two private equity funds,the caledonian fund and the capstone fund.john colvin,scott hollenbeck,darryl laws,rebecca plummer,and levonda leamon participated in the scheme.as a part of their scheme,the parties mailed,faxed,and correspondence to one another and engaged in banking transactions.
bartko was a securities attorney,investment banker,and registered.laws was also an investment banker who,along with bartko,created the caledonian fund.colvin was the president of colvin enterprises and a general partner with scott hollenbeck of franklin asset exchange.leamon and plummer were financial advisors who owned and operated legacy resource management lrm.
in january,bartko was seeking investors for the caledonian fund.on january,colvin sent to bartko a fax regarding an investment opportunity that one of colvin companies,webb financial services,was offering.the articles of incorporation for the company were attached.they listed scott hollenbeck as the initial registered agent of webb group.these materials made fraudulent claims that the principal and interest were guaranteed and that the investments were insured.on january and,bartko performed a record check on colvin with the national association of securities dealers.on february,he made the same record check on hollenbeck.according to those records,both had past allegations of forgery and both had been fired from jobs.hollenbeck check also showed that his securities license had been suspended for violations of securities rules.
bartko sent a fax to laws on january,which detailed colvin fraudulent fundraising methods.for example,one page of the materials stated that p rincipal investment is secured insured and that the i nterest rate declared is guaranteed.in a fax that colvin sent to bartko on february,proposing an agreement between franklin asset exchange and the caledonian fund,hollenbeck was referred to in the materials as a co managing general partner of franklin asset exchange and as the founder and creator of both franklin asset exchange,llc and the webb group financial services.
colvin ultimately agreed to raise million for the caledonian fund through the franklin asset exchange.although the march,agreement to raise the money was signed by colvin,it was hollenbeck who actually solicited and secured the money from the individual investors.
in april,the north carolina securities regulatory agency issued a cease and desist order directing hollenbeck to stop selling securities in north carolina.this arose from his involvement in a separate investment scheme regarding mobile billboards of america mobile billboards.bartko,along with his,wes covington,provided legal representation to hollenbeck on this matter.during the course of that representation,hollenbeck provided bartko with information concerning how he had sold the mobile billboards investments.hollenbeck informed bartko that he had promised investors that their money was guaranteed and insured.he also provided to bartko a copy of his promotional materials,including an application for an insurance policy that he used to show that the investment was insured.
from january,to may,hollenbeck fraudulently raised large amounts of money for the caledonian fund,as well as for other investments,from a total of investors.he then deposited the money into franklin asset exchange or some similar account.the money was not separated but was instead comingled.he sent the money to various entities,as directed by colvin.
hollenbeck and colvin raised for the caledonian fund,which was wired to the caledonian fund on four separate occasions between february and may.bartko and laws used the money to pay salaries and expenses.none of it was used for investments or loans.
in late,after colvin failed to send bartko the million that he had promised,bartko terminated their relationship.in november,the caledonian fund dissolved.the in the fund was not returned to the investors.
almost immediately after dissolution of the caledonian fund,bartko began the capstone fund.hollenbeck was the primary fundraiser.nevertheless,on december,during a deposition with the sec concerning mobile billboards,hollenbeck was asked what investments he was currently selling.he failed to mention the capstone fund.bartko and his,wes covington,were at the deposition representing hollenbeck,but neither one corrected hollenbeck false statement.
although securities law disallowed it,hollenbeck continued selling securities and raising money for the capstone fund through fraudulent means.moreover,some of the investors were not accredited or sophisticated investors,as required by securities law.to be an accredited investor,one net worth or net income must reach a certain threshold.
on january,bartko met with potential investors at lrm.around the same time as this meeting,bartko asked plummer and leamon whether lrm would receive money from the capstone fund investors and then send the money back to the capstone fund.because the money that hollenbeck had million at that fraudulently obtained and because the capstone fund was an unregistered fund,bartko wanted lrm to appear to be the investor.plummer and leamon agreed,and on january,they opened a bank account with tristone bank for the purpose of receiving the capstone fund money.tristone,however,eventually closed their account and so,at bartko suggestion,they opened an account with wachovia.
also on january,bartko issued reimbursement checks to several investors.but then bartko instructed hollenbeck to have the investors receiving the reimbursements endorse the checks and return them to lrm.bartko sent some of the checks to hollenbeck to return to the investors because he did not have their addresses.instead,hollenbeck forged the signatures of the investors on the checks and embezzled the proceeds.
the money that was sent to lrm was returned to the capstone fund.thus,with the exception of one individual,no refunds were actually made to the investors.all told,bartko received from forty capstone fund investors.
in february,the north carolina secretary of state learned that hollenbeck was continuing to sell investments for bartko,and it advised the sec of that fact.on march,alex rue,an attorney for the sec,confronted bartko.bartko then filed an interpleader action in the middle district of north carolina on may,and ultimately returned percent of the capstone fund money to the court.
bartko eventually stood trial for conspiracy to commit mail fraud,launder money instruments,and engage in unlawful monetary transactions count one mail fraud and aiding and abetting count two through count five and sale of unregistered securities and aiding and abetting count six.the district court dismissed counts seven and eight,as well as two of the objects of the conspiracy in count statements and obstructing sec proceedings.after a trial,the jury convicted bartko of the remaining counts.
bartko then filed four motions for a new trial.the district court denied them all in a comprehensive and page order.at the subsequent sentencing hearing,bartko objected to several of the sentencing guidelines enhancements,including those based on the amount of loss,the number of victims,and bartko status as a registered at the time of the offenses.the district court overruled the objections and sentenced bartko to months imprisonment.this appeal followed.
first,bartko argues that the district court erred in denying two of his motions for a new trial.rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure provides,in relevant part,that u pon the defendant motion,the court may vacate any judgment and grant a new trial if the interest of justice so requires.we review the district court denial of a motion for a new trial under an abuse of discretion standard.united states wilson,cir.
bartko first motion for a new trial concerns a report on internal revenue agent scott schiller interview with judge anderson cromer,who presided over receivership litigation involving webb group and franklin asset exchange as plaintiffs and bull mountain project,colvin,colvin enterprises,and others as defendants.bartko and covington had represented the plaintiffs and had obtained a substantial settlement.the government failed to give this report to bartko until after trial.
in the fact section of bartko opening brief,he states the following 
this interview summary,referred to in bartko new trial motions as the judge cromer,revealed that the judge believed that bartko had performed ethically and professionally in connection with the coal company litigation and that bartko had made disclosure of his prior relationship with colvin,hollenbeck and the proposed receiver.because that information had not previously been furnished to the defense,the defense did not know that judge cromer testimony would have been favorable.he was,therefore,never called as a witness and the topic of the coal company litigation was never raised at trial.the jury never learned that bartko efforts on behalf of hollenbeck victims in other schemes resulted in a million recovery for the people he bartko supposedly victimized.
the only mention that bartko makes in the argument section of his opening brief,however,is that the interview report related to bartko actual innocence of the charges in this case,because that information related to his behavior and state of mind,rather than the credibility of any particular witness.bartko also states that the government agreed when it moved to exclude this evidence that it would have unfairly cast bartko in a favorable light.
after reading bartko opening brief,it first appeared to us,as it did to the government,that bartko was not raising this issue on appeal.but,then in his reply brief,buried in a footnote,he states that it is an issue in this appeal and that this brady violation was a component of his argument that the cumulative effect of the withheld evidence resulted in a trial that was unfair.
the argument section of an appellant opening brief must contain the appellant contentions and the reasons for them,with citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellant relies.fed.a a.because bartko has failed in this regard,we consider this issue waived.see wahi charleston area med,cir concluding that those issues on which the appellant failed to comply with the specific dictates of rule a a were waived.
in bartko second motion for a new trial,he protests that the government allowed scott hollenbeck to testify falsely that he had not received any promises or inducements in exchange for his trial testimony.the supreme court long ago opined that a state may not knowingly use false evidence,including false testimony,to obtain a tainted conviction.napue illinois.this is true regardless of whether the g overnment solicited testimony it knew or should have known to be false or simply allowed such testimony to pass uncorrected.united states kelly,cir.a new trial is required when the government knowing use of false testimony could affect the judgment of the jury.see giglio united states.we do not,however,automatically require a new trial whenever a combing of the prosecutors files after the trial has disclosed evidence possibly useful to the defense but not likely to have changed the verdict id.quoting united states keogh,cir.
to obtain a new trial on the basis that hollenbeck testified falsely,bartko must demonstrate that hollenbeck gave false testimony he need not demonstrate that hollenbeck committed perjury.d ue process is violated not only where the prosecution uses perjured testimony to support its case,but also where it uses evidence which it knows creates a false impression of a material fact.hamric bailey,cir.hence,e vidence may be false either because it is perjured,or,though not itself factually inaccurate,because it creates a false impression of facts which are known not to be true.id.
in early,as part of its investigation of the capstone fund,as well as several other investment schemes,the united states attorney for the eastern district of north carolina wanted to interview scott hollenbeck.thus,the government entered into a proffer agreement with him and his attorney,scott holmes.the agreement,directed to holmes but signed by both holmes and hollenbeck,set forth the following 
as you have indicated,your client,hollenbeck,is interested in meeting with federal agents currently investigating the sale of numerous investments,including webb group,franklin asset exchange,disciples trust,and capstone.i have informed you that hollenbeck is not a target of this investigation.the parties will schedule an interview of hollenbeck to take place at the federal correctional institution in coleman,florida.hollenbeck,you,and the united states attorney office usao agree as follows concerning the ground rules for this interview 
in any trial in this matter,the usao will not offer into evidence in its case or at sentencing any statements made by hollenbeck at the interview provided,however,this paragraph shall not apply to any prosecution for false statements,obstruction of justice,or perjury that is based in whole or in part on statements made by hollenbeck at the interview.
notwithstanding paragraph above 
the usao may use information derived directly or indirectly from statements made by hollenbeck at the interview for the purpose of obtaining other evidence,and that evidence may be used in the prosecution and sentencing of hollenbeck by the usao in any trial of this matter or at sentencing,the usao may use statements made by hollenbeck at the interview to him if he testifies or to rebut any evidence offered by or on behalf of him.
this agreement is limited to statements made by hollenbeck at the interview and does not apply to any other statements made by hollenbeck at any other time.no understandings,promises,or agreements exist with respect to the meeting other than those set forth in this agreement,and none will be entered into unless memorialized in writing and signed by all parties.
the usao will not share the statements made by hollenbeck during the interview with any other state or federal prosecuting entity unless the prosecuting entity agrees to be bound by the terms of this agreement.
please return the original signed copy of this letter agreement prior to the interview.
scott hollenbeck wife,crystal hollenbeck,also entered into a proffer agreement with the government.it is almost identical to her husband agreement.
at trial,on direct examination,the government asked hollenbeck,hollenbeck,what if any promises has the government made to you about your testimony here today hollenbeck responded,none.despite any contrary suggestion by bartko,our review of the record convinces us that this was a truthful statement.
bartko makes much of the fact that the agreements stated that the hollenbecks were not targets of the investigation into the sale of investments,including webb group,franklin asset exchange,disciples trust,and the capstone fund.from this,bartko concludes that hollenbeck had some sort of incentive to assist the government in its prosecution of bartko.but that is not how we interpret the agreement.
paragraph three of the agreements make clear that n o understandings,promises,or agreements exist ed with respect to the meeting other than those set forth in th e agreement s,and none will be entered into unless memorialized in writing and signed by all parties.because nothing in the agreements suggests that the hollenbecks not being a target was conditioned on their participation in the investigative interviews,or that they would not be a target in the future,we decline to graft such a provision into the agreements.
therefore,hollenbeck answer that he had not been promised anything in return for his testimony at trial was true.but,his answer to the question by his counsel was not.during of hollenbeck,bartko counsel asked,now,one of the things that you said when you took the stand was that the government has made you no promises,correct you said that hollenbeck replied,that is exactly right.then defense counsel followed up and the government has not,as of this time,made you any promises,have they hollenbeck answered,they have not.the district court held that hollenbeck answer to this question was not false.however,it provided an alternative analysis on the assumption that hollenbeck testimony on this point was false.
from our review of the record,we conclude that the government had made a promise to hollenbeck.in fact,it made to him several promises concerning how the information that he gave at the investigatory interview would and would not be used against him.and,because the government made those promises,it had a duty to correct hollenbeck answers when he testified falsely that it had not made any promises.but this it regrettably failed to do.therefore,we must now decide whether that testimony could have affected the jury judgment.
had hollenbeck testified truthfully when asked whether the government had made any promises to him up to that time,bartko arguably could have used that fact to impeach hollenbeck.but,having made an exhaustive review of the record,we do not think that impeachment could have made an iota of difference in the jury final judgment.as explained by the district court,
d efense counsel thoroughly impeached hollenbeck on the subject of bias in favor of the government and on hollenbeck motive to lie to please the government.defense counsel thoroughly impeached hollenbeck concerning his desire to avoid prosecution for his fraud involving colvin,webb group,franklin asset exchange,disciple trust,the caledonian fund,and the capstone fund.defense counsel thoroughly impeached hollenbeck about his desire to receive a reduction in his month prison sentence stemming from the mobile billboards fraud.furthermore,defense counsel explored at great length and with absolutely devastating effect hollenbeck character for untruthfulness.defense counsel recounted the many lies hollenbeck had told and the many frauds he had committed throughout his life.in fact,this court has never seen a witness more thoroughly impeached than hollenbeck.in the face of such blistering impeachment and the other evidence in the trial,one more false statement by hollenbeck could not have possibly affected the jury judgment.
united states bartko,cr d,slip op.at,citations omitted.consequently,the district court did not err in refusing to grant to bartko a new trial on this issue.
in bartko second motion for a new trial,he also contends that the government failure to disclose the agreements between it and scott and crystal hollenbeck amounts to a brady violation.
as this court recognized in united states wilson,cir 
in brady,the supreme court held that the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment,irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.at.in order to prove that the g overnment failure to tender certain evidence constitutes a brady violation,the burden rested on the defendant to show that the undisclosed evidence was favorable to him either because it is exculpatory,or because it is impeaching material to the defense,prejudice must have ensued and that the prosecution had materials and failed to disclose them.united states stokes,cir.
id.at.evidence is exculpatory and favorable if it may make the difference between conviction and acquittal had it been disclosed and used effectively.id.at quoting united states bagley.and,it is material if it is likely to have changed the verdict.id.quoting moseley branker,cir.it is an abuse of discretion for the district court to commit a legal as improperly determining whether there was a brady that underlying legal determination is reviewed de novo.wilson,at.
there is no dispute that factors one and three of the test set forth in stokes are that the proffer agreements were favorable to bartko because they were impeaching and that the prosecution had the materials and failed to disclose them.see stokes,at.thus,our inquiry here will focus on only the second element whether the agreements were material to the defense.in other words,was bartko prejudiced by the see id.
the district court held that the hollenbecks proffer agreements constituted cumulative impeachment evidence.in the alternative,it stated that there is no reasonable probability that the jury verdict would have been different if the government had disclosed the agreements.
if bartko had had the hollenbecks proffer agreements,he could have used them in an attempt to attack scott hollenbeck credibility.but,as the district court noted,bartko impeachment of hollenbeck was devastatingly thorough and thoroughly devastating.bartko,cr d,slip op.at.it encompassed 
hollenbeck felony convictions,his bias in favor of the government due to his desire to receive a rule motion and a reduction in his month prison sentence for his involvement in mobile billboard fraud,his bias in favor of the government due to his desire to avoid being prosecuted for the fraud that he committed with colvin,webb group,franklin asset exchange,disciples trust,and others,his bias in favor of the government due to his desire to avoid being prosecuted for the fraud he committed while raising money for the caledonian fund and the capstone fund,myriad specific instances of lying,fraud,and forgery throughout hollenbeck adult life,prior inconsistent statements to prosecutors,contradictions within his trial testimony,and his inability to recall certain facts.
bartko,cr d,slip op.at.thus,the proffer agreements would have been cumulative and,as such,we are unable to fathom how the jury knowing about them could have further damaged hollenbeck credibility.the proffer agreement s had nothing to add and would not have shed any new light on the depth of hollenbeck wrongdoing,the magnitude of his incentive to cooperate with the government,or the absence of his credibility.bartko,cr d,slip op.at.hence,we are confident that there is no reasonable probability that the jury would have reached a different verdict if bartko had been given and effectively used the hollenbecks proffer agreements.
in bartko third motion for a new trial,he contends that the government committed a brady violation in failing to disclose the tolling agreements that it had entered into in with levonda leamon.the agreements tolled the statute of limitations for potential federal criminal violations regarding leamon involvement in the fraudulent sale of investments during the year,including conspiracy,mail fraud,the sale of unregistered securities,and money laundering.the purpose of the agreements was to allow additional time for the parties to present facts and discuss the matter and to evaluate and discuss potential resolutions to the case.the january,agreement tolled the statute of limitations on leamon crimes until july,and the july,agreement tolled the statute of limitations until december.it appears from the record that,without these agreements,the statute of limitations on some of leamon alleged crimes would have run before she gave her testimony at bartko trial.
as already enumerated,we consider three factors in determining whether a brady violation has occurred whether the undisclosed evidence was favorable to the defendant either because it is exculpatory,or because it is impeaching whether the evidence was material to the defense,prejudice must have ensued and whether the prosecution had materials and failed to disclose them.stokes,at.the government acknowledges that the leamon agreements are impeaching and that it had the materials but failed to disclose them.thus,as before,because factors one and three are met,we need focus on only the second materiality factor.
we discard as immaterial undisclosed impeachment evidence where it was cumulative of evidence of bias or partiality already presented and thus would have provided only marginal additional support for the defense.united states cooper,cir second alteration in original quoting douglas workman,cir.
in general,evidence whose function is impeachment may be considered to be material where the witness in question supplied the only evidence linking the defendant to the crime.united states avellino,cir.likewise,we may find impeaching evidence to be material where the witness supplied the only evidence of an essential element of the offense.id.at.this is especially true where the undisclosed matter would have provided the only significant basis for impeachment.id.
leamon testified at trial that she was a high school graduate and former flight attendant.she became a of lrm in or with her role primarily being community involvement.she also attested to bartko use of lrm office for the january,meeting and how lrm received money from the capstone fund,as well as hollenbeck other investors,and then sent the money back to capstone.according to leamon,she spoke with hollenbeck and bartko about pooling the money that came in from investors and the potential round trip of the refund checks as the investors endorsed them to lrm.leamon also stated that lrm received a commission from the capstone fund.
leamon further testified about lrm process of mailing statements and letters to investors,as well as corrected statements and letters,the closing of the account at tristone bank and the opening of an account with,as bartko put it,a larger bank like a wachovia.
as the district court noted,this testimony served primarily as summary evidence of lrm bank activity,mailings,and meetings,which was corroborated by substantial documentary evidence,the testimony of victims,the testimony of plummer,and the testimony of bartko.bartko,cr d,slip op.at.in short,bartko admissions and a mountain of other evidence independently corroborate leamon testimony.id.at.as such,leamon testimony was not material.and,because it was not material,the district court did not err in its refusal to grant bartko a new trial on this issue.
although courts of necessity examine undisclosed evidence,their materiality determinations must evaluate the cumulative effect of all suppressed evidence to determine whether a brady violation has occurred.united states ellis,cir.when the net effect of the evidence withheld by the government in a case raises a reasonable probability that its disclosure would have produced a different result,the defendant is entitled to a new trial.kyles whitley.a reasonable probability does not mean that the defendant would more likely than not have received a different verdict with the evidence,only that the likelihood of a different result is great enough to undermine confidence in the outcome of the trial.smith cain,quoting kyles,at.
here the likelihood of a different result is not great enough to undermine confidence in the outcome of bartko trial.see id.as the district court aptly noted,
in so finding,the court stresses that bartko case was not a close one.the trial record reveals overwhelming evidence of bartko guilt.the jury carefully heard the evidence over a period.the jury received detailed jury instructions.after deliberating approximately four hours,the jury unanimously convicted bartko on all six counts.
circumstantial this case was tenuous it absolutely was not.the mountain of evidence marshaled against bartko demonstrated his guilt beyond any shadow of a doubt.moreover,if the jury had had any doubts,bartko testimony destroyed them.the jury was permitted not only to disbelieve bartko testimony,but to believe the opposite.
bartko,cr d,slip op.at.therefore,having reviewed the omitted evidence in the context of the entire record.united states agurs,and finding that there is no reasonable probability that the disclosure of the withheld evidence or the correction of hollenbeck false testimony could have produced a different result,we conclude that the district court did not err in refusing to grant bartko a new trial.
having analyzed the brady and giglio issues that bartko raises,we pause here to address the discovery practices of the united states attorney office in the eastern district of north carolina a cursory review of this court opinions reveals recent consideration of at least three cases involving discovery abuse by government counsel in this district.see,united states flores duran,wl,cir.july,noting that d uring the week prior to trial,the g overnment sent over one thousand pages of additional discovery,the bulk of which was due no later than fourteen days prior to trial and that the government argued its discovery violation was excusable because it misread the discovery order a power outage occurred at the courthouse in raleigh and it made a last minute decision to present certain evidence and that on the saturday immediately prior to the monday on which trial was to begin,the government faxed key information obtained approximately hours earlier to defense counsel office,but it did nothing to ensure that counsel received the fax,even though it sent the information outside of normal business hours united states burkhardt,app x,cir considering a defendant appeal of his civil commitment as a sexually dangerous person and citing as a matter of concern the government failure to disclose prior to the commitment hearing that one of the defendant victims would testify united states king,cir vacating and remanding the defendant conviction for felony possession of a firearm because the government specifically rebuffed both written and oral demands by the defendant that it disclose potentially exculpating grand jury testimony and refused to disclose the testimony,even after the district court suggest ed that it do so.and this case,which confronts us with three alleged constitutional violations two instances of withholding discoverable evidence and one choice to leave uncorrected a witness false testimony only adds to the list.
mistakes happen.flawless trials are desirable but rarely attainable.nevertheless,the frequency of the flubs committed by this office raises questions regarding whether the errors are fairly characterized as unintentional.oral argument at,flores duran,wl,available at.referencing the government late disclosure of pages of discovery in violation of the judge discovery order and stating,this is a repeat offense by the government.the order is entered by the court requiring disclosure by a certain date,and the government simply ignores it.and their explanation for ignoring it is,i missed it.so what.there no prejudice.and it just happens again and again.moreover,the government responses to queries regarding its practices are less than satisfactory.for example,in this case,when asked at oral argument about its failure to correct scott hollenbeck testimonial misstatement regarding promises he had received,the government suggested that at the time hollenbeck made the misstatement,trial counsel had no recollection of the promises made to him.but as judge keenan aptly noted,such an idea
