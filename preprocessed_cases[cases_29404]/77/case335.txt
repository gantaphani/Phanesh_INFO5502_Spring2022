this case is before us on remand from the united states supreme court for reconsideration in light of gall united states,d.livesay united states,d.in this billion fraud scheme,kenneth livesay,the former assistant controller and chief information officer cio of healthsouth corporation who played a major role in the fraud,was sentenced to months probation,with the first months to be served as home detention.this panel previously vacated livesay sentence.see united states livesay livesay ii,cir after reconsideration in light of gall and affording substantial deference to the district court sentencing determinations,we conclude that the district court committed gall procedural error,and thus we must vacate livesay sentence and remand.
factual background 
earlier decisions of this court outline the billion criminal fraud scheme at healthsouth.see united states martin,cir united states mcvay,cir.accordingly,in this opinion,we provide only a brief overview of that general scheme.we then detail livesay specific role in the fraud,as outlined in livesay presentence investigation report psi 
at some point in the early to,healthsouth officials realized that healthsouth financial results were failing to produce sufficient to meet the expectations of wall street analysts.various healthsouth officials,including livesay,became aware that the earnings shortfall created a substantial risk that,unless the were artificially inflated,the earnings would fail to meet analyst expectations,and the market price of healthsouth securities would decline.
therefore,from at least until march,a group of healthsouth officials conspired to artificially inflate healthsouth reported earnings and earnings per share,and to falsify reports about healthsouth overall financial condition.martin,at.the officials made,and directed accounting personnel to make,false and fraudulent entries in healthsouth books and records for the purpose of falsely reporting healthsouth assets,revenues,and earnings per share and in order to defraud investors,banks,and lenders.id.
for over ten years from april to november,livesay was the assistant controller in healthsouth accounting department according to the psi,during his time as assistant controller,livesay had access to all of the financial information on healthsouth balance sheets and income statements.as assistant controller,livesay directly assisted the controller and the chief financial officer in preparing the financial statements and reports that healthsouth was required to file with the securities and exchange commission sec.senior executives issued instructions to defendant livesay regarding the desired,and assistant controller livesay and healthsouth accounting staff met to discuss ways to meet wall street expectations.
more specifically,livesay,as assistant controller,made false entries in healthsouth books and records to artificially inflate the company.livesay also managed and supervised others in manipulating healthsouth books and records,instructing healthsouth accounting staff to alter certain accounts so as to inflate healthsouth.livesay participated in the preparation of healthsouth quarterly and annual reports that were filed with the sec,and livesay fully knew that the reports materially misstated healthsouth net income,revenue,assets,and liabilities.for example,healthsouth income was overstated by approximately in and in.
this massive fraud,in which livesay directly participated for over five years,impacted many victims.after the conspiracy was uncovered in march and the sec temporarily suspended trading in healthsouth stock,the total drop in the value of outstanding healthsouth stock was approximately billion.many shareholders had invested their life savings in healthsouth stock,which plummeted to pennies per share.this fraud also affected many others,including healthsouth employees,many of whom were employees close to retirement,who suffered by either losing their job or their retirement savings that was invested in the company stock ownership plan or pension fund employees of contractors who were dependent on healthsouth contracts for income banks and other lenders who loaned money to healthsouth based on false financial information competitors who lost business or financing due to healthsouth false financial representations and members of the community who benefited from healthsouth charitable activities.
ii.procedural history 
guilty plea and advisory guidelines range 
livesay pled guilty to an information charging him with conspiracy to commit wire and securities fraud,in violation of a,b a b and b,and and and,et.count one and falsification of financial information,in violation of b a,b,and count two.the information also included a forfeiture count.
the psi set livesay base offense level at,pursuant to a livesay adjusted offense level was,however,due to four enhancements reflecting the magnitude of the fraud and his significant role in it.the enhancements were levels,pursuant to b s,because the loss amount exceeded million levels,pursuant to b a,because the offense involved more than minimal planning levels,pursuant to b c,because the offense involved sophisticated means and levels,pursuant to b,for livesay role in the offense as a manager or supervisor.after a reduction for acceptance of responsibility under,livesay adjusted offense level was.with an offense level of and a criminal history category of i,livesay advisory guidelines range was to months imprisonment.
the government filed a motion for downward departure,based on livesay cooperation and substantial assistance.the government noted that livesay met whenever needed with several government agencies,each of which had a substantial need for his assistance met with the forensic auditor reconstructing healthsouth books and records spent many hours reviewing financial statements and other documents provided the government with critical documents evidencing the fraud helped quantify the fraud and facilitated guilty pleas from other and the prosecution of others yet to be convicted.
first sentencing in june 
at livesay first sentencing,the government motion recommended a downward departure of levels from to and a sentence of months imprisonment.the district court granted the government motion,but departed downward levels,to an offense level of.livesay i.at.offense level,combined with livesay criminal history category of i,yielded an advisory guidelines range of to months imprisonment.because livesay guidelines range of to months imprisonment fell within zone b of the sentencing table,the guidelines gave the district court the option of sentencing livesay to probation and months home detention without any additional guidelines departures.see a,c permitting a sentence of probation,subject to certain conditions inapplicable here,if a defendant applicable advisory guidelines range is within zone b.the government objected to the reasonableness of the departure.
alternatively,the government asked that livesay at least be sentenced to the maximum sentence in that range months imprisonment.the district court nevertheless sentenced livesay to months probation,with the first months to be served on home detention,pursuant to a and c the district court imposed a fine and forfeiture of.
the government appealed,which resulted in our livesay i decision.in livesay i,this court vacated livesay sentence and remanded livesay case to the district court for resentencing.livesay i.at.this court concluded that the sentencing court failed entirely to address specifically the factors or otherwise to state reasons supporting the extent of its departure.id.this court further concluded that w e do not say that every factor must be separately addressed in the order of judgment and conviction we say only that this record fails to provide the minimum indicia required to allow us to review for reasonableness.id.
resentencing in december 
this current appeal is from the resentencing in december.as discussed later,the district court judge added very little to the record in this resentencing and basically made it clear he was simply reimposing the same sentence on remand.we outline what the brief resentencing transcript shows.
this brief transcript shows that the district court actually began livesay resentencing hearing with preliminary remarks,in which the district court commented that l urking not too far in the background of this sentencing is the jury verdict in the richard scrushy case.richard scrushy was the chief executive officer of healthsouth at all times pertinent,and he was acquitted by the jury in his trial.the district court,speaking not as one of twelve article iii judges of the court,but as the chief judge of the northern district of alabama,observed that he knew of no allegations that the jury in the scrushy case had been in any way compromised.the district court publicly thanked the scrushy jury for its tremendous public service,and observed that before attacking the jury verdict,it is important to reflect on the fact that we did not sit here in the courtroom and hear and consider all of the evidence,as the jurors did.
the district court then noted that,in livesay case,this court had directed the district court to outline in some detail the factors on which it relied in giving the departure and its reasons for the extent of the departure.the government renewed its motion,but in light of livesay continued substantial assistance since the first sentencing,recommended months,less than its recommendation for months imprisonment at the first sentencing 
the district court again granted the government motion and said it was basically reimposing the original sentence.the district court did make specific findings that the significance and truthfulness of livesay information and testimony,as well as the nature and extent of his assistance,was extraordinarily high and warranted an extraordinary departure.the district court further found that livesay assistance was very timely and warranted extraordinary consideration.the district court acknowledged that livesay actions were not sufficient to meet the legal standards for withdrawing from a conspiracy,but nevertheless stated that it was impressed with the fact that from just an ordinary,common sense understanding,livesay did substantially withdraw from the conspiracy.
the district court then repeated the same earlier downward departure and departed downward levels to an offense level of,which once again left livesay with an advisory guidelines range of to months imprisonment.
at that point,the government asked to be heard before the district court imposed its final sentence.while the government acknowledged that livesay was well deserving of a downward departure,the government stressed that livesay also was a key player,a significant cog,in the operation of this fraud at healthsouth for a number of years.the government emphasized that although livesay did come forward early,he nevertheless did come forward until the fraud itself was revealed.the government further observed that livesay handiwork as one of the mechanics of the fraud was reflected in the fraudulent forms that healthsouth filed with the sec.the government stressed the need for deterrence in sentencing livesay,and stated its belief that some prison sentence of significance was necessary in light of the sentencing factors found in a.the government renewed its request for a sentence of months imprisonment under the adjusted guidelines range found by the district court.
the district court then summarily stated,if i wrong on the extent of the departure which i have just made,i believe that the sentence i about to impose is the most appropriate sentence in this case in consideration of the booker case.in other words,even without the departure,the district court would have made the same variance under united states booker,d,from the advisory guidelines range of to months imprisonment.the district court proceeded to sentence livesay to months probation the first months to be served on home detention,which livesay already had done.the district court reimposed the fine and forfeiture of,both of which livesay had already paid.
with regard to the sentencing factors in a,the district court stated that it viewed the sentence as appropriate based on the nature and circumstances of livesay crimes livesay history and personal characteristics the need for this sentence to reflect the seriousness of the crimes to which livesay pled guilty the need to promote respect for the law,and to provide just punishment and to afford adequate deterrence.the district court further stated that it considered the sentence justified in order to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct,and listed the sentences imposed on twelve other healthsouth as follows 
in the cases arising out of this conduct,weston smith received months imprisonment william owens,months imprisonment emery harris,five months imprisonment angela ayers,months of probation cathy edwards,months of probation rebecca morgan,months of probation virginia valentine,months of probation michael martin,seven days imprisonment aaron beam,three months imprisonment richard botts,months of probation will hicks,months of probation and catherine fowler,months of probation.
livesay counsel then pointed out that william owens sentence was actually months imprisonment,not months.the district court said,i stand corrected.the district court did not discuss the nature of the conduct of these twelve other or explain how their conduct was similar to livesay.
this appeal followed.
iii.discussion 
district court duties at sentencing 
after the supreme court decisions in booker and gall,the district courts are still required to correctly calculate the advisory guidelines range.see united states pugh,cir see also martin,at united states crawford,cir.a fter giving both parties an opportunity to argue for whatever sentence they deem appropriate,the district judge should then consider all of the a factors to determine whether they support the sentence requested by a party.pugh,at quoting gall.at.gall also instructs that the district court must make an individualized assessment based on the facts presented.id.at quoting gall.at.if the district court decides that a sentence outside of the guidelines is warranted,it must consider the extent of the deviation and ensure that the justification is sufficiently compelling to support the degree of the variance.id.quoting gall.at emphasis omitted.
in addition,gall admonishes that the district court must adequately explain the chosen sentence to allow for meaningful appellate review and to promote the perception of fair sentencing.gall.at see also c stating that a district court at the time of sentencing,shall state in open court the reasons for its imposition of the particular sentence rita united states,d discussing c.the supreme court in rita recognized that the requirement that a district court explain the reasons for its chosen sentence reflects sound judicial practice because c onfidence in a judge use of reason underlies the public trust in the judicial institution and a statement of the judge reasoning helps provide the public with the assurance that creates that trust.rita.at.
the length and amount of detail of the judge reasoning required depends on the circumstances.id.a statement of reasons for a criminal sentence is particularly important.id.while a sentencing judge is not required to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the a factors or to discuss each of the a factors,united states scott,cir,t he sentencing judge should set forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decisionmaking authority,united states agbai,cir quoting rita.at.
generally,when sentencing within the advisory guidelines range,the district court is not required to give a lengthy explanation for its sentence if the case is typical of those contemplated by the sentencing commission.see id.citing rita.at.however,if a party requested a sentence outside of the guidelines range,the district court will normally go further and explain why he has rejected those arguments.rita.at.further,rita
