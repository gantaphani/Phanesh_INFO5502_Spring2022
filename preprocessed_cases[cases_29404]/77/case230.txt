thomas coughlin coughlin,a successful and prominent corporate executive,pled guilty to six felony counts five counts of aiding and abetting wire fraud,in violation of and and one count of filing false tax returns,in violation of.after properly calculating an advisory united states sentencing guidelines range of to months imprisonment,the district court departed and varied downward eight levels,sentencing coughlin to no imprisonment,years probation under c of which months is home detention,a fine,and in restitution.the government appeals.we reverse and remand.
background 
from january to october,coughlin was stores,chief operating officer and then executive vice president and vice chairman of the board of directors.during this period,coughlin defrauded by directing that employees travel vouchers be falsely adjusted to request unwarranted reimbursements,which were then converted into cash and pocketed by coughlin falsifying invoices so paid coughlin personal expenses altering employees expense vouchers to include fictitious expenses,which were then converted into cash and pocketed by coughlin using large quantities of gift cards for personal use and looting audio equipment and cameras using merchandise transfer report.
the united states probation office prepared a presentence investigation report psr.the psr set coughlin base offense level at and,due to the amount of the loss,increased coughlin offense level by levels.see a,b j the psr increased coughlin offense level by levels because the offense involved more than minimal planning,see id.b a,by levels because coughlin was the organizer of the criminal activity,see id.c,and by levels because coughlin abused a position of trust,see id.coughlin adjusted offense level was.the psr reduced coughlin offense level by levels for acceptance of responsibility.see id.coughlin total offense level was,and coughlin had a criminal history category i,resulting in an advisory guidelines sentencing range of to months imprisonment.
at sentencing,the government and coughlin stipulated the psr properly calculated coughlin advisory guidelines sentencing range,and the court accepted the psr calculation.the issues at sentencing were a departure based on coughlin health pursuant to guideline and a variance based on the factors set forth at a.
coughlin is in poor health.the record reflects coughlin is six feet four inches tall and weighs about pounds.coughlin survived sudden cardiac death and has had an implantable cardioverter defibrillator since.coughlin presently suffers from cardiac arrhythmia,severe pulmonary hypertension,double vessel coronary atherosclerosis,type ii diabetes,gout,ethmoid sinusitis,obesity,high blood pressure,severe allergies,and back and knee pain.coughlin also suffers from severe obstructive sleep apnea,which necessitates the use of a continuous positive airway pressure machine at night to prevent a dangerous drop in coughlin oxygen levels.doctors have ordered coughlin to control his weight and blood pressure since at least,yet these warnings have generally gone unheeded.
joel carver carver,coughlin treating physician,testified with a reasonable degree of medical certainty sending coughlin to prison would increase coughlin stress level and significantly increase the risk of another heart attack coughlin regularly took thirteen different medications,two of which carver understood are not available through the bureau of prisons bop and coughlin medications should not be changed.carver has never visited a bop facility and conceded he has no knowledge regarding how the bop operates or treats the inmates medically,or even what medical capabilities exist within the bop carver was asked on direct examination whether coughlin could survive in the bop,and carver stated,it honestly would be hard for me to speculate.according to carver,his medical opinion about coughlin and the bop is j ust based on common sense.
tecora ballom ballom,the clinical consultant for the south central region and acting clinical director at the federal medical center located at carswell,texas,testified the bop would review and assess coughlin medical history and treat him appropriately.the bop classifies inmates according to their medical needs.level one usually includes healthy patients with uncomplicated diseases who can perform the activities of daily living.level two includes patients with chronic diseases who require more frequent monitoring.patients may not be able to perform all of the activities of daily living,require even more frequent monitoring,and are housed in a community with access to medical resources.patients have the most difficulty with daily living,require monitoring up to hours a day,and are housed at medical referral centers.
ballom testified coughlin probably would be classified as a patient or possibly as a patient,which would include access to medical treatment for patients with pacemakers and defibrillators and availability to a continuous positive airway pressure machine at night.ballom discussed the procedure by which coughlin could continue to take his current medications that are not typically available through the bop.ballom testified the bop could help coughlin cope with any increase in stress by using medical monitoring and possibly psychological or psychiatric consultations.ballom noted carver testimony concerning an increase in stress appeared to assume coughlin would be housed at a level one or two prison from a camp situation to a penitentiary rather than at a facility.ballom also testified coughlin health conditions might improve because coughlin would be in a controlled environment.
the district court agreed with ballom and found coughlin is at a very high risk.and the court is equating that to an extraordinary physical impairment and,therefore,under guideline,the court finds that there should be a downward departure by a level of eight.this resulted in an adjusted total offense level of and an advisory guidelines sentencing range of to months imprisonment.the district court further observed,in addition to a downward departure under guideline,coughlin could be entitled to a downward departure under guideline concerning family ties and responsibilities as well as community ties,concerning charitable and contributions as well as prior good works,and concerning grounds for a departure not otherwise considered in the guidelines.the district court declined to grant a further downward departure on these grounds because the reduction given under guideline is appropriate.the court sentenced coughlin to no imprisonment,years probation of which months is home detention,a fine,and in restitution.in the alternative,if our court ruled on appeal that the district court abused its discretion in departing downward pursuant to guideline,the district court imposed an identical sentence as a sentence,adopting the previous findings for a a analysis.the district court concluded home detention with electronic monitoring is going to be in coughlin best interests.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
after united states booker,d,the sentencing court first must calculate the advisory guidelines sentencing range.see united states ture,cir.next,the sentencing court must decide whether a traditional departure from the advisory guidelines sentencing range is appropriate based either on parts h or k of chapter five of the guidelines,policy statements,or commentary.see united states dalton,cir.the sentencing court has then arrived at a final advisory guidelines sentencing range.id.then,the sentencing court must consider the factors set forth at a to determine whether to impose a sentence within or without the final advisory guidelines sentencing range.see united states rouillard,cir.the sentencing court must impose a sentence tailored to the a factors.see booker,at.on appeal,we address the reasonableness or unreasonableness of the sentence.see rita united states,d booker,at.
physical condition departure 
the first issue before the court is the propriety of the district court downward departure pursuant to guideline.we review for abuse of discretion departures from the guidelines,rouillard,at,and review for clear error the district court factual finding that coughlin suffers an extraordinary physical impairment,see united states robinson,cir.if an appellate court is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed,then a factual finding is clearly erroneous even if some evidence supports the factual finding.anderson city of bessemer city,d.
guideline permits a downward departure based on a defendant extraordinary physical impairment.a departure based on a physical condition is a discouraged ground on which to depart and should be limited to exceptional circumstances.see koon united states,d united states johnson,cir,vacated on other grounds,cir.a defendant physical condition must be assessed in the light of the situation the defendant would encounter while imprisoned.johnson,at.to determine if an extraordinary physical impairment exists,we ask three questions.first,i s the particular defendant physical condition such that he or she would find imprisonment more than the normal hardship united states rabins,cir.second,w ould imprisonment subject him or her to more than the normal inconvenience or danger id.specifically,would imprisonment worsen his or her condition or does he or she require special care not provided by the bop id.at accord robinson,at johnson,at.third,d oes the physical condition have any substantial present effect on the defendant ability to function rabins,at.
the first and third questions are not in dispute thus,we will focus on the second question.coughlin only evidence regarding how imprisonment would affect coughlin health is carver testimony that life in prison is more stressful than life outside of prison and coughlin should avoid stress.carver has never visited a bop facility.carver conceded he had no personal knowledge of prison conditions or where coughlin would be housed within the bop,nor does carver have specific knowledge regarding the accompanying stress level.common sense was the basis for carver opinion.in contrast,ballom testimony was based on her considerable personal experiences with the bop.ballom commented that while life in prison may be stressful,the bop has the capability to help inmates cope with stress.furthermore,ballom stated a controlled environment helps many inmates control and manage their health problems and the bop will provide coughlin with any medication or other necessary medical care.the record,omitting conjecture,does not show coughlin condition will worsen in a bop facility or that coughlin requires special care the bop can not provide,that is,the record does not establish imprisonment would subject coughlin to more than the normal inconvenience or danger.
coughlin relies on united states wadena,cir,where this court affirmed a sentence of years probation based in part on the defendant poor health.in wadena,the defendant had a worsening kidney disease,which required dialysis treatments three times a week.id.at.here,coughlin health ailments were not as severe as wadena ailments.on this record,the district court clearly erred in finding coughlin suffers an extraordinary physical impairment and abused its discretion by departing downward eight levels pursuant to guideline.the no imprisonment sentence is not supported by the record.
in the event our court concluded the district court abused its discretion in departing downward pursuant to guideline,the district court imposed the same sentence as a sentence based on coughlin family ties and responsibilities,as well as community ties coughlin charitable and contributions,as well as prior good works and other factors not otherwise considered in the guidelines,such as coughlin fall from grace.although the district court identified certain factors that could in the abstract support the imposition of a sentence,the district court failed to consider these factors in the context of a.under a,in imposing a sentence,the district court must also consider the seriousness of the offense,promotion of respect for the law,just punishment,adequate deterrence,protection of the public from further crimes,and the avoidance of unwarranted sentencing disparities.perhaps coughlin family ties and station in the community,as well as his lofty corporate position of trust and power,exacerbate the nature of his crimes,especially for coughlin victims,and more generally,american businesses.the record does not reflect the district court ever weighed both the aggravating and the mitigating nature of coughlin conduct upon his family and community,coughlin position with,and the other relevant factors in a.
section c of title,united states code,requires the sentencing court to state with specificity the reasons for the imposition of a sentence.see united states paz,cir.section c specifically informs the parties of the reasons for a particular sentence outside of the guidelines range,aids the appellate court in reviewing a guidelines departure or sentence,and assists the sentencing commission in collecting sentencing data and in maintaining a comprehensive database on all federal sentences.id.here,the district court did not state the reasons with sufficient specificity for the sentence,especially considering the factors relied upon by the district court are ordinarily not relevant in determining a sentence and are discouraged grounds for the imposition of a sentence were not weighed against the negative impact coughlin crimes had on his family,community,and employer and were not balanced with the other considerations in a,and.
iii.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we must remand for resentencing.united states peterson,cir.the district court eight level departure or variance,based on this record,does not fall within the range of reasonableness.we reverse coughlin sentence and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion both the government and coughlin should have an opportunity to supplement the sentencing record with additional evidence and argument on these resentencing issues,if either desires to do so.
the district court did not err when it found coughlin suffers from an extraordinary physical impairment.the district court did not abuse its discretion when it determined it was appropriate to downward depart,pursuant to.furthermore,a sentence of five years probation with months of home detention,a fine,and in restitution is not unreasonable.
whether coughlin has an extraordinary physical impairment for the purpose of a departure is a question of fact we review for clear error.united states rabins,cir.the district court must ask three questions when determining whether a defendant has an extraordinary physical impairment whether the defendant physical condition is such that the defendant would find imprisonment more than the normal hardship whether imprisonment would subject the defendant to more than the normal inconvenience or danger and whether the defendant physical condition has any substantial present effect on the defendant ability to function.united states johnson,cir citing rabins,at.
as the majority indicates,the first and third questions are not in dispute.both the bop expert,ballom,and coughlin expert,carver,agree coughlin is at very high risk cardiac and pulmonary wise.ballom testified coughlin is in the highest risk category,his condition being more than serious.both medical experts agree,coughlin physical condition has a substantial present effect on his ability to function and will cause coughlin to find imprisonment more than the normal hardship.
the majority concludes the record does not establish imprisonment would subject coughlin to more than the normal inconvenience or danger,and holds the district court clearly erred when it so found.i disagree.carver,a respected cardiologist whose credentials the government does not dispute,testified unequivocally coughlin meets every one of the rabins factors for an extraordinary medical impairment.
coughlin has an unusual heart condition in that he has suffered multiple cardiac episodes as a result of stress.the majority incorrectly concludes,however,coughlin only evidence regarding how imprisonment would adversely affect his health is carver testimony that life in prison is
