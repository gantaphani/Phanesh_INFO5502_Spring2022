hagop vartanian vartanian appeals his jury convictions for aiding and abetting the filing of a false tax return,in violation of and,and two counts of aiding and abetting the making of false statements on a loan application,in violation of and.on appeal,vartanian asserts that the district court abused its discretion when it dismissed a juror from service we have jurisdiction under,and we affirm vartanian conviction.
in november,a grand jury returned an indictment charging vartanian with understating the income from his auto sales business,pacific sales leasing,on his and tax returns with deliberately omitting income from his business,and with deliberately omitting income from his illegal bookmaking business.the indictment also charged vartanian with knowingly making false statements on his and tax return for the purpose of obtaining a car loan.
vartanian trial began in february,and the jury began deliberations in march.on the second day of deliberations,the trial judge received a note from the jury foreperson stating there is one juror that has been seen on different occasions speaking to the defendant family.juror name is kathy.three or four people have seen her and two saw her this morning chatting with them outside the courtroom.after discussing the note with counsel for both sides,the judge decided to interview the juror juror to determine the extent and nature of her contacts with individuals associated with the case.
when questioned about her contacts,juror stated that she had only exchanged pleasantries with people associated with the case,telling them hi,it a nice day,or t hings will be okay.juror assured the judge she had done nothing more than say hello and did not intend to express her feelings about the case.at that time,juror also maintained that she made the t hings will be okay comment to a woman she described merely as and present in the courtroom.
after the interview with juror,the judge commented that he did have any reason to disbelieve juror,but wanted to talk to the foreperson who had raised the initial complaint.soon after making that comment,however,the judge learned that juror had spoken to another court official after her interview and informed the official that the woman with dark brown hair was actually vartanian fact she had not stated in her interview.
the trial judge then interviewed the remaining jurors and a person associated with vartanian whom juror had approached.in these interviews,the jurors collectively related several instances in which they observed juror improper contacts juror once made a point of taking the elevator alone with people associated with vartanian case juror deliberately approached vartanian family and individuals associated with his case and talked with them for maybe a minute while in starbucks,juror initiated conversation with defense counsel,vartanian,and a few other people associated with vartanian,though she explained to another juror that she was just saying hi and juror walked out of the courthouse talking with a blond woman who was present during trial proceedings.one juror added that,while seated at a lunch table,juror started talking about vartanian eyes and how kind he looked and everything.
between interviews,defense counsel confirmed that he,vartanian,and other people associated with vartanian were ordering coffee,when juror,who was with another juror from the case,called out to them to buy us a coffee too.the judge also interviewed vartanian brother fianc√©,a blond woman with whom juror had been observed speaking,to determine the extent of her contact with juror.
in his interview with each juror,the judge carefully verified that the situation had not affected the juror ability to remain fair and impartial.although the trial judge attempted to focus the juror interviews on juror contact with individuals associated with the case,one breach did occur.during an interview,one juror blurted out that juror said that vartanian was not guilty and nobody can change later,when asked whether juror conduct influenced her or affected her in any way,the same juror also remarked well,i think the jury is going to be hung up.
following these interviews,the trial judge expressed his concern with juror behavior.he noted that,at the outset of the case,the jurors were shown a video tape entitled called to serve,which instructed them not to mingle or talk with anyone associated with the case,including the lawyers,the parties,and the witnesses and not to discuss the case with other jurors until inside the jury deliberation room.the judge emphasized the fact that when confronted with the allegations,juror mentioned only one contact and assured the court it was just casual.however,interviews with the other jurors revealed that juror had much more extensive contact than she had admitted.the trial judge found that juror had not been forthcoming and entirely truthful with the court and had entirely minimized her contacts.in addition to the evidence gained through juror interviews,the judge also noted that juror exhibited other bizarre behavior,including bombard ing the parties and the court with notes asking questions at inopportune times and bringing chocolates to the court reporter and insisting that she take them.
the trial judge found that juror expressed solicitude and gave assurances to family members and persons associated with the defendant.he further found that juror was not forthcoming,did not disclose all her contacts,and we had to learn about all these contacts from other jurors.based on his observation of juror demeanor and explanations,the judge found that the juror had been deceitful and untruthful with the court and was untrustworthy.the trial judge concluded that he was unwilling to trust juror to be a fair and impartial juror and dismissed her from service.
after two more days of deliberation,the jury found vartanian guilty on all counts.the court pronounced judgment and sentenced vartanian to fifteen months in prison and ordered payment of a fine.vartanian filed a timely appeal to this court.
federal rule of criminal procedure b provides that a fter the jury has retired to deliberate,the court may permit a jury of persons to return a verdict,even without a stipulation by the parties,if the court finds good cause to excuse a juror.fed.crim.b.good cause encompasses a variety of problems that may arise with respect to the jury,including sickness,family emergency,or misconduct.see,united states beard,cir.because the district court is in the best position to evaluate the jury ability to deliberate,we generally defer to the district court good cause determinations.id.at internal quotation marks omitted see also united states ross,cir.we review a district court dismissal of a juror during deliberations for abuse of discretion and the district court factual findings relating to the issue of juror misconduct for clear error.see united states shryock,cir beard,at.
vartanian asserts that the district court should not have dismissed juror because so long as there is any reasonable possibility that the impetus for a juror dismissal stems from the juror views on the merits of the case,the trial judge must either send the jury back to continue deliberating or declare a mistrial.united states symington,cir.for reasons we explain below,symington does not govern our disposition here.
in symington,the jury complained that one of its members refused to participate in the deliberative process.id.at.the evidence that developed,however,suggested that the jurors frustrations with the reluctant juror may have derived more from their disagreement with her on the merits of the case.id.at.the issue was what evidentiary standard a district court should use when evaluating the likelihood that a juror views on the merits underlies the request for her removal.id.at.we expressed concern that any inquiry would invite trial judges to and influence the work of the jury,and that the district court might expose jury deliberations to public scrutiny,thereby interfering with the integrity of the deliberative process.id.quoting united states thomas,cir.in order to preserve these twin imperatives,we held that if there w
