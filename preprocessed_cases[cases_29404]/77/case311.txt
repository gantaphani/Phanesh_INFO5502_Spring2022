defendant peggy appeals her convictions on counts of healthcare fraud and one count of obstruction of justice.the principal issue on appeal is whether sufficient evidence supports these convictions.in addition,defendant contends the court erred by declining to dismiss the health care fraud charges as unconstitutionally vague.finally,defendant argues her sentence was procedurally and substantively unreasonable.we affirm her conviction and sentence.
background 
in,defendant and her spouse,johnnie,incorporated the great meeting is on for your success,a nonprofit business licensed to provide outpatient drug and alcohol treatment services.they jointly owned and operated the business,with defendant working as executive director and working as program and education director.according to testimony,defendant handled the financial aspects of the business,and both she and participated in its operations and in client care.defendant and were both certified drug and alcohol counselors who had been involved in the drug and alcohol treatment community for numerous years.
the record shows that from to,the great meeting survived largely on income from.then,in,the nonprofit became eligible to bill medicaid.medicaid only pays for drug or alcohol treatment for beneficiaries who are addicted.before receiving medicaid funds in kansas,a counselor must assess the beneficiary,then complete a kansas client placement criteria form and submit it to a regional assessment center.employees at the center assess and approve or deny services.medicaid pays for limited addiction services through programs such as the great,counseling and case management facilitating access to ancillary services.
according to testimony,defendant and both attended medicaid billing training in august.from july through november,the great meeting submitted claims to medicaid for drug and alcohol services.counts two through of the indictment are representative of these.a billing expert testified that she reviewed all claims and found them all to be false and fraudulent.a medical expert who reviewed the client files supporting the charges agreed those claims were false in numerous respects and should not have been paid.the experts testified to several types of falsities,corroborated by testimony from fact witnesses and other evidence introduced at trial.
first,the experts testified that the great meeting submitted claims for drug abuse treatment for seventeen children under age twelve,even though the government introduced testimony that it is clinically impossible to diagnose or treat anyone under age twelve as an addict.indeed,the evidence shows that two children were only weeks old and several were defendant and relatives.according to testimony,defendant had learned in one administrative meeting that medicaid computers do not edit for age.the great meeting received more than from medicaid for these seventeen children alone.
the experts also testified that in fifty of the client files,the diagnosis on the initial assessment had been changed on the claims to reflect substance abuse.put differently,the claims identified the clients as addicts even though,based on the great meeting other documentation,they were not.a number of clients testified that their initial assessments contained false information and that the great meeting conducted only one assessment while billing medicaid for two.some documents entered into evidence made it appear clients had received services they testified to never receiving.and clients testified they signed blank attendance logs which were later completed without their knowledge.notably,defendant name appears on all the client kcpc forms,as well as on numerous initial assessments,attendance and transportation logs,and progress notes.
further,the experts testified that the great meeting kept documentation to support the medicaid claims and that the company submitted claims for case management and addiction treatment although,according to its own documentation,it provided no such services.instead,it offered only support services such as general counseling,anger management counseling,tutoring and homework help,care,drug prevention education,transportation,and meals.at trial,defendant testified in her own defense.she admitted that,at least as to the child clients,these support services did not constitute drug or alcohol treatment.yet a report introduced into evidence by defense counsel showed that,in a july administrative meeting held at defendant request,defendant had admitted she knew she could only bill medicaid for drug and services.she had also claimed it was out of the great meeting scope to admit a client for anything other than drug or alcohol problems.
a verbatim transcript of an administrative hearing held on november,was also admitted into evidence at trial.at the hearing,an administrative officer reviewed two of the great meeting claims for alcohol and drug treatment which had been denied by the kansas medikan program.medikan is a state program similar to medicaid in some ways,but with different enrollment criteria and stricter limitations on services.defendant testified at this medikan hearing that she believed the clients at issue to be covered by medicaid at the time the great meeting provided services to them.consequently,she made a variety of admissions about her knowledge of and participation in the medicaid program.among other things,defendant admitted to having received the medicaid provider manual in july and represented that she knew how to obtain preauthorization for medicaid claims and,in fact,sought preauthorization for all clients.yet,other evidence introduced at trial showed the great meeting obtained no preauthorizations from the regional assessment center for medicaid clients.additionally,defendant attested at the hearing that the great meeting had provided drug and alcohol treatment to two clients,rafael and james w.but a government expert testified at trial that there is no indication any such treatment was provided.
for his part,a defense expert opined that all the problems cited by the government experts occurred simply because the defendants lacked understanding of the assessment tools used.
in addition to the experts,fact witnesses testified that both defendant and specifically recruited people with medicaid cards,offering community services in exchange for medicaid identification numbers.in fact,there was testimony that defendant and encouraged at least one relative to obtain a medicaid card and turn it over to the great meeting in exchange for a place to live.the relative did so.later,after she had problems obtaining grief counseling due to the great meeting use of her card,she confronted defendant.defendant threatened to throw her out of the house,and changed the locks on the house several times.through all this,the relative received no counseling from the great meeting.
the government also introduced evidence that both defendant and personally benefitted from the medicaid payments,essentially using their business bank account as a personal account.defendant made numerous personal purchases with the money.she admitted that after years of and scraping by,she wanted medicaid funds to pay her back.the government presented evidence that defendant and ultimately received more than million in medicaid money in less than seventeen months.
the record reveals that defendant and became aware of the investigation when they received an initial request for records on september.among other things,the request asked for proof the regional assessment center had authorized the billed services.on october,defendant was served with a federal subpoena requesting the same records.shortly thereafter,the great meeting started submitting preauthorization documents to the assessment center.in november alone,documents for thirty clients were submitted.
the government ultimately charged defendant with conspiracy,obstruction,fifteen counts of money laundering,and counts of health care fraud.she stood trial with and was convicted of all counts.however,the district court later declared a mistrial on the conspiracy count because of the jury failure to identify which substantive crime defendant and conspired to commit.the court also declared a mistrial on the money laundering counts because of a jury instruction error.the court granted the government later motion to dismiss these charges.one additional count of conviction related to forfeiture.however,defendant waived a jury trial on that count and has not contested the final forfeiture amount imposed.
at sentencing,the court considered a loss amount of more than million.the court sentenced defendant to months the low end of the guideline range on each of the fraud counts and to sixty months on the obstruction count,all to run concurrently.the court also ordered defendant to serve two years of supervised release.
discussion 
sufficiency of the evidence 
defendant first challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting her convictions for health care fraud and obstruction.
health care fraud 
defendant convictions for health care fraud were based upon the medicaid claims the great meeting submitted.defendant generally claims the government presented insufficient evidence of her intent to defraud,without addressing any of the convictions individually.
we review this challenge de novo,determining whether,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime s beyond a reasonable doubt.united states mcphilomy,cir internal quotation marks omitted.by viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,we necessarily resolve any conflicts in the evidence in favor of the government and we assume the trier of fact found that evidence credible.united states williamson,cir.accordingly,we do not conflicting evidence or consider the credibility of witnesses.id.in this respect,we must defer to the jury resolution.united states brooks,cir.
to prove defendant violated,the government had to show she knowingly and willfully executed or attempted to execute a scheme to defraud a health care benefit program or a scheme to gain control of a health care benefit program money or property through false pretenses,representations,or promises.see.to establish knowledge and willfulness,the government must prove that the defendant acted with knowledge that her conduct was unlawful.bryan united states,d quoting ratzlaf united states,d.
we conclude the government presented sufficient evidence of defendant intent to defraud.perhaps most significantly,defendant admitted knowing the great meeting could not bill medicaid for services other than drug or alcohol treatment or for clients.yet she also knew the great meeting did bill medicaid even in cases where no drug or alcohol services were provided.however,defendant role was not limited to knowledge alone.at the medikan hearing,defendant admitted knowledge of and involvement in the company medicaid practices although she later denied knowledge and involvement at trial.during the same hearing,defendant represented that the great meeting had provided drug and alcohol treatment to two clients whose medikan coverage was at issue.yet the government experts testified there was no indication the clients received any such treatment.
but this is not all.the government also established defendant participation in the drug treatment industry,the steps she took to become a medicaid provider,and her active,daily role at the great meeting.defendant affirmatively signed children up for the great meeting,obtaining their medicaid cards for billing purposes.she admitted knowing the children treated were not drug addicted and were receiving only support services,yet forms listing her as the screener indicated the children had addiction problems.the government also presented evidence that defendant gave a relative a free place to live in exchange for the use of the relative medicaid card.moreover,defendant profited greatly from the scheme.
defendant implies the evidence would only be sufficient to sustain her conviction if,after someone alerted her to problems with her billing practices,she continued the problematic practices.while such evidence would certainly be strong,it is not necessary to establish the intent to defraud.
taken in the light most favorable to the government,we conclude the record contains evidence from which a jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant knowingly and willfully executed or attempted to execute a scheme to defraud a health care benefits plan.accordingly,defendant challenge fails and we sustain her health care fraud convictions.
obstruction 
defendant next argues the government presented insufficient evidence to support her obstruction conviction.
both parties assume we should review the sufficiency of the evidence supporting defendant obstruction conviction de novo.however,it does not appear defendant properly moved for judgment of acquittal on the obstruction count.although the motion for acquittal is broad,it is also vague,and the supporting memorandum addresses only health care fraud.therefore,the correct standard of review is plain error.however,even under a de novo standard of review,defendant challenge to her obstruction conviction fails.
to establish defendant obstructed justice,the government had to show she willfully prevented,obstructed,misled,or delayed the communication of information or records relating to a violation of a federal health care offense to a criminal investigator.a.defendant contends the government failed to establish willfulness.
the government presented evidence that after defendant was served with a federal subpoena seeking specific client records including records showing the medicaid claims were preauthorized,the great meeting suddenly began submitting requests for preauthorization to the regional center.the government linked these requests specifically to consultant who helped develop the kcpc computer program testified that defendant filled out several of these client preauthorization forms while speaking with her.defendant argues the timing of the requests does not establish she intended to obstruct the investigation.however,in light of the other evidence,the timing is significant.at the medikan hearing,defendant expressed her understanding of the preauthorization requirement and claimed she sought preauthorization for all clients.yet,in reality,only after she had received a federal one year after the medikan preauthorizations actually sought.in the month after the subpoena alone,preauthorization requests for thirty clients were submitted.from this evidence,a jury could have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was trying to hide her earlier failure to obtain preauthorizations.
additionally,the government presented evidence that defendant transferred more than in medicaid proceeds from her personal account to a success,savings account on november,shortly after receiving the federal subpoena.from this,a jury could infer defendant was trying to legitimize the business accounts by restoring money to the business.taken in the light most favorable to the government,the evidence submitted at trial is sufficient for a jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant willfully obstructed the investigation.consequently,we reject defendant challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting her obstruction conviction.
motion for a new trial 
we likewise reject defendant contention that the district court abused its discretion by denying her motion for a new trial based on the weight of the evidence.our conclusion that the evidence was sufficient for a reasonable jury to find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt on the health care fraud and obstruction counts forecloses a finding that the court abused its discretion by not granting a new trial.
ii.vagueness 
defendant next argues the health care fraud statute,is unconstitutionally vague as applied to her.the government contends defendant failed to raise this issue of statutory vagueness before the trial court,so we should conduct plain error review.however,the record reveals defendant challenged the statute on vagueness grounds in a joint motion to dismiss,then touched on it again in a motion for acquittal.co
