todd willis was convicted of aiding and abetting the accessing without authorization of a protected computer,in violation of a and a c,c b iii.he was sentenced to months imprisonment.he now appeals both his conviction and sentence.we take jurisdiction under and affirm willis conviction,vacate his sentence and remand for resentencing.
background 
willis was employed by credit collections,an oklahoma city debt collection agency.to obtain information on individuals for debt collection,the agency utilized a financial information services website called site owned by lexisnexis.the information available on includes the names,addresses,social security numbers,dates of birth,telephone numbers,and other property data of many individuals.in order to access the information on,customers must contract with lexisnexis and obtain a username and password.in his position as a small claims supervisor,willis had significant responsibility for the computers in the agency.as part of his employment,willis assigned to employees usernames and passwords to access.employees were not authorized to obtain information from for personal use.willis deactivated the usernames and passwords of employees who no longer worked for the company.
while investigating two individuals,michelle fischer and jacob wilfong,for identity theft,police officers found pages printed out from with identifying information for many people.the information obtained from was used to make false identity documents,open instant store credit at various retailers,and use the store credit to purchase goods that were later sold for cash.a subpoena to revealed that the information had been obtained through the user name amanda diaz,which was assigned to credit collections.secret service agents twice interviewed willis about the identity theft.during the first interview,willis insisted that the username and password assigned to amanda diaz had been deactivated and that there was no way to determine who had accessed the website.during the second interview,however,willis admitted that he had given a username and password to his drug dealer in exchange for methamphetamine.he also admitted that he met fischer through his drug dealer and that he began providing to her individuals information he obtained through.after fischer continued to ask willis for information,he gave her the amanda diaz username and password so that she could access herself.on one occasion,when fischer was having trouble accessing the site,willis helped her to log on and specifically showed her how to obtain access to individuals addresses,social security numbers,dates of birth.in exchange,fischer said that she would take care of willis later.she later gave him a silver seiko watch.when willis learned through a newspaper article that fischer had been arrested for identity theft,he deactivated the username and password.
willis was charged in a indictment alleging that he aided and abetted the accessing without authorization of a protected computer and obtaining information therefrom,in violation of a and a c.following a jury trial,willis was convicted of the crime charged.in a special question submitted to the jury,the jury found beyond a reasonable doubt that the value of the information obtained by the unauthorized access exceeded.this finding set the maximum sentence under the penalty provisions of c at five years.willis was sentenced to months imprisonment.he raises three issues on appeal.first,he argues that there was insufficient evidence that he knowingly,and with the intent to defraud,aided another in obtaining unauthorized access to a protected computer.second,he argues that the district court erred in failing to instruct the jury that to convict,it must find that willis knowingly and intentionally aided another in obtaining information worth more than or that it was foreseeable that the information obtained was worth more than.finally,he argues that the district court incorrectly applied the sentencing guidelines.we address each argument in turn.
ii.discussion 
sufficiency of the evidence 
we review claims of insufficient evidence de novo.united states gurule,cir.evidence is sufficient to support a conviction if,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,a reasonable jury could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.united states lavallee,cir.we will reverse a conviction only if no rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.gurule,at quotation omitted.we also review questions of statutory interpretation de novo.united states begay,cir.
under a c,w hoever intentionally accesses a computer without authorization or exceeds authorized access,and thereby obtains information from any protected computer if the conduct involved an interstate or foreign communication shall be punished as provided in subsection c of this section.subsection c provides in relevant part that the punishment for a violation of a is 
a except as provided in subparagraph b,a fine under this title or imprisonment for not more than one year,or both,in the case of an offense under subsection a,a,a a iii,or a of this section which does not occur after a conviction for another offense under this section,or an attempt to commit an offense punishable under this subparagraph 
b a fine under this title or imprisonment for not more than years,or both,in the case of an offense under subsection a,or an attempt to commit an offense punishable under this subparagraph,if 
iii the value of the information obtained exceeds.
c a b.in other words,the crime of intentionally accessing a protected computer without authorization and thereby obtaining information from that computer is punished as a misdemeanor unless,inter alia,the value of the information obtained exceeds,in which case it is a felony.
willis argues that congress could not have intended that any person who intentionally aids another in gaining unauthorized access to a protected computer be prosecuted as a felon if the information the third party obtains has a value of more than.rather,he argues,the person who aids and abets must have the intent to defraud in so doing and must know that the information obtained will have such a value.to this end,he maintains that there was no proof that willis knew that fischer would use the information she obtained from to commit identity evidence established only that he thought he was helping her obtain information on people who owed her money.we reject willis arguments and conclude that a c only requires proof that the defendant intentionally accessed information from a protected computer the section does not require proof of intent to defraud nor proof that the defendant knew the value of the information obtained.
i n order to be convicted of aiding and abetting,a defendant must share in the intent to commit the underlying offense.united states vallejos,cir alterations and quotation omitted.to be convicted of the underlying offense,a c,a defendant must intentionally access a computer without authorization or exceed authorized access,and thereby obtain information from any protected computer willis insists that the intent to defraud is an element of a c because it is such an element under a.under that section 
whoever knowingly and with intent to defraud,accesses a protected computer without authorization,or exceeds authorized access,and by means of such conduct furthers the intended fraud and obtains anything of value,unless the object of the fraud and the thing obtained consists only of the use of the computer and the value of such use is not more than in any period,shall be punished as provided in subsection c of this section.
a emphasis added.
a plain reading of the statute reveals that the requisite intent to prove a violation of a c is not an intent to defraud as it is under a,it is the intent to obtain unauthorized access of a protected computer.see shurgard storage,safeguard self storage,d,one element under a that is not present under a c is the intent to defraud.that is,to prove a violation of a c,the government must show that the defendant intentionally accessed a computer,without authorization or exceeded authorized access,and thereby obtained information from any protected computer if the conduct involved an interstate or foreign communication.the government need not also prove that the defendant had the intent to defraud in obtaining the information or that the information was used to any particular ends 
nevertheless,willis contends,without citation to authority,that subsection a c is the general provision of the statute and that subsection a is the specific provision of the statute.that is,he argues,subsection a sets out the specific elements required to prove a violation of subsection a c,and his conduct should be judged under subsection a,requiring an intent to defraud.we disagree.
as an initial matter,other courts have explained that each subsection of addresses a different type of harm.see yonkers,celebrations the party and seasonal superstore,cir lists seven different types of conduct punishable by fines or imprisonment,verio,d,aff in part and reversed in part on other grounds,cir.for example,subsection a c requires that a person intentionally access a computer without authorization and thereby obtain information,whereas subsection a c requires that a person intentionally access a computer without authorization and thereby cause damage,d at.similarly,subsection a has different elements than subsection a c.in addition to requiring that a person act with the specific intent to defraud,a violation of a also differs from a c in that a person can violate the former by obtaining anything of value by the unauthorized access,whereas,as noted above,a person violates a c by obtaining information.
furthermore,subsections a c and a are punished differently.under c,a violation of subsection a is punishable by no more than one year in prison unless,inter alia,the value of information obtained exceeds,in which case the offender is subject to up to five years imprisonment.see c.on the other hand,a violation of a subjects a person to five years imprisonment if the defendant obtains anything of of its the thing obtained is merely the use of the computer and the value of such use is not more than in any period.id.at c.in other words,if a person knowingly and with the intent to defraud accesses a protected computer and by means of such conduct furthers the intended fraud and obtains information valued at only,for example,he would nevertheless be subject to the stricter penalty provided for under c.the difference between the subsections is the type of intent required.
finally,we reject willis argument that the statute requires proof that the defendant knew the value of the information obtained.there is no separate intent or knowledge requirement with respect to the penalty provision of the statute,c.the relevant portion of the statute provides that punishment for an offense under subsection a or b of this section is a fine under this title or imprisonment for not more than years,or both,in the case of an offense under subsection a if the value of the information obtained exceeds.c b iii.the defendant need not know that the value of the information obtained has a particular value,or any value,for that matter.
willis does not contest that he provided fischer unauthorized access to.he merely argues that he had no intent to defraud in so doing nor did he know that she planned to obtain information of a certain value.as the foregoing discussion demonstrates,however,such proof is not required to establish a violation of a c.accordingly,his sufficiency of the evidence argument fails.
jury instructions 
we review a jury instruction for plain error when a party fails to object to the instruction at trial.lavallee,at.willis argument with respect to the jury instructions is essentially a reiteration of his sufficiency of the evidence argument.he contends the district court should have instructed the jury that to find willis guilty of aiding and abetting,the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that willis knew or intended that the information obtained as the result of the unauthorized access exceeded.we have just held,however,that the intent requirement in a c respects obtaining unauthorized access to a protected computer.the intent requirement does not extend to the value of the information ultimately obtained.accordingly,the district court did not commit plain error in giving the jury instructions.
sentencing 
following willis conviction,the probation office prepared a presentence report psr.the united states sentencing commission guideline for a violation of a is found at sentencing guidelines manual or guidelines and calls for a base offense level of.see a.the probation office recommended a enhancement under b f after concluding that the total amount of loss from fischer and her identity theft was more than.it also recommended a enhancement under b c i because it concluded the offense involved the unauthorized transfer or use of any means of identification unlawfully to produce or obtain any other means of identification.finally,it recommended a enhancement under because willis abused his position of trust by giving others access to the personal credit information of the victims in this case.given these enhancements,the psr calculated willis base offense level at.the probation office also determined that based on willis two prior felony convictions for embezzlement by an employee,a prior felony conviction for uttering a forged instrument,and a prior misdemeanor conviction for driving under the influence and driving under suspension,he had a criminal history category of v.the recommended guidelines range for an offense level of and a criminal history category of v is to months.see pt.because the statutory maximum for the offense is five years,however,the psr noted that willis can not receive a sentence longer than months.
willis filed several objections to the psr.relevant to this appeal,willis contended that he should not be held accountable for the total loss resulting from his passing on a username and password to others.he argued that it was not foreseeable to him,nor did he intend,that any loss would result from his actions.he also argued that because he did not share fischer fraudulent intent to steal identities,the b c i enhancement did not apply.at the sentencing hearing,the government agreed with willis to the extent that he argued the entire amount of loss should not be attributed to willis for sentencing purposes.it took the position that only those losses directly caused by fischer were attributable to willis,which were losses of more than but less than.
the district court agreed with the government and found fischer conduct foreseeable to willis.it therefore imposed a enhancement on willis base offense level as opposed to the enhancement recommended by the psr.see b c.it also applied the b c i enhancement because the offense involved using a means of identification to produce another means of identification,as well as the enhancement because willis abused a position of trust.this produced an adjusted offense level of,which,when coupled with his criminal history category of v,resulted in an advisory guidelines range of to months,see pt.a.the district court sentenced willis to months imprisonment.
on appeal,willis renews his claim that the district court erred in enhancing his sentence based on the conclusion that any loss caused by fischer was foreseeable to him.he contends that the evidence established only that he thought fischer was going to use the information to track down people who owed her money,and not to engage in the type of criminal venture in which she involved herself.he also contends that the district court erred in imposing the enhancement under b c i for unauthorized transfer or use of any means of identification unlawfully to procure or obtain other means of identification.
standard of review 
we apply a approach to appellate review of sentences.united states herula,cir.first,we determine whether the district court correctly calculated the applicable guideline range.id.if so,then we determine whether the sentence imposed is reasonable.id.a sentence within the correctly calculated
