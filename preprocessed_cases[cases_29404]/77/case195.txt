virginia carter was convicted by jury of tax fraud,in violation of,money laundering,in violation of a b i,and engaging in monetary transactions knowing that the property involved represents the proceeds of an unlawful activity,in violation of.the district court sentenced her to months imprisonment,a sentence below the advisory guidelines range the government timely appealed the sentence for the reasons set forth in this opinion,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
robert carter embezzled money from his insurance business over several years.in and,his accountant prepared tax returns that reported a total income from those years of less than.these returns the carters income by nearly.his wife,virginia carter,signed those joint tax returns.
in,carter filed for a divorce from robert.her divorce attorney was unaware that much of the couple money had been obtained through fraud,and he recommended that she attempt to take control of the couple liquid assets in order to secure those funds in the pending proceedings.in that year,carter transferred more than into new and previously existing bank accounts bearing only her name.
carter was charged with two counts of tax fraud for her income in and she was also charged with counts of money laundering,of which went to trial.eighteen of the money laundering counts that went to trial were based on allegations that,from march to september,carter had engaged in monetary transactions to disguise the proceeds of fraud,in violation of the other four counts of money laundering were based on allegations that carter had engaged in financial transactions with the proceeds of fraud between april and april,in violation of carter testified at her trial and denied the tax fraud and money laundering allegations.the jury found her guilty on all counts.
at sentencing,the district court heard arguments by carter and the government regarding the presentence investigation report psr and the calculation of the advisory guidelines range.the court then determined the base offense level for carter offenses to be,which included a increase for obstruction of justice.the resulting advisory guidelines sentencing range was to months imprisonment.after considering the factors set forth in a,the district court imposed a sentence of months imprisonment.the district court stated 
well,i do see any legal basis for a departure,so that leaves the issues raised by section in determining a sentence that is proper under the facts of the case,and not greater than necessary,to supply the reasons for the penalties in our criminal justice system.
there is no question that the federal law was broken in this case.a jury so found that carter broke the law on a number of occasions,i think there was something like counts.
as i looked over the counts to which she was found guilty,the tax first year,certainly i think that a spouse who is faced with a tax return that is only out of whack probably would notice it.but the next year when they went on the wild spending spree it kind of defies reason that you would look at the return and say,wait a minute,there is something wrong here.
i believe that at some point carter must have known her husband was stealing money because their spending went from one level to an entirely different level.
there is no question that when her husband was on his way to prison,or was about to go to prison,she took it upon herself to try and take this money and make it as difficult as possible for anybody,including creditors and the government and the tax people,from collecting it.
so,she violated the law,and the law she violated was structuring and money laundering.having said that,this is obviously not a paradigm of the money laundering cases.
the article in the sentencing guidelines by the commission indicates that congress original purpose was,in the context of organized crime,to prevent proceeds from crimes from being used to commit other crimes.however,it is still a violation of the law,which she did.
now,in considering what an appropriate sentence in this case is,it does seem to me that it would be entirely improper to give her a sentence that was similar,or certainly higher,than what her husband got.her husband was the source of the illegal funds.she did benefit from them though,there is no question about that.
now,he got,i believe,months,which is certainly in my judgment an appropriate judgment in the fraud conduct in which he engaged in.i think,on the other hand,we do have the age of carter,she is,and that is not the age of your normal criminal that comes before the court for sentencing.
i do think that she probably did freak out when she found out that her husband was basically on his way to prison and had stolen all this money,and i think she acted to a certain extent out of an attempt to protect herself,which i believe,if i remember correctly,i think her divorce lawyer said that he had suggested that that money be put in her name that she was aware of,because i think they were contemplating a divorce.
now,that is not an unusual recommendation.having never been a matrimonial lawyer it is my understanding that matrimonial lawyers always tell the wife,if you can do it,get the money in your name and fight about it later in court rather than let your husband take it and you have to fight for it.it is the old,a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.
so,her actions are certainly not legal,were not wholly not understandable.
i believe also that she am certain she did anticipate the consequences of her actions.she may have known they were illegal,but certainly did expect them to be to the extent where she would be standing here possibly subjected to a sentence of months.
i believe she also did not receive good advice.the advice would have been to do do anything,this money is tainted money.whatever advice she received,that was it,and she certainly did follow it.
there is no indication that she had anything to do with the fraud.it does,however,seem to me that she must have been aware at some point that her husband was doing something illegal because of the vast amount of money that all of a sudden came into his hands,buying a piano,a ring,et cetera.
her actions were over a relatively short period of time and the government did recover a good bit of the money.
one of the comforting features of the guidelines was that this type of question did come up.it was a guidelines case,if you do find a reason for a departure,you sentence.now that we have the authority and the discretion to sentence,we have to make a conscious decision of what is a fair sentence,and it is not an easy time.
having considered everything,it seems to me that a month sentence is appropriate in this case.
i think this case is a serious one,and i do think that a month or a month and a day sentence is appropriate.
i think under all the circumstances i think that when one considers the age i do mean to suggest that she is an old lady,i am considerably older than she is,but i think it does reflect the seriousness of the offense,i think it does reflect the characteristics of the offense,which is not your paradigm instance of money laundering,and i think it does protect the public from further crimes from this defendant.
i do anticipate her breaking the law again,and i think that certainly a sentence within the guidelines would have been disparate from her husband sentence.

discussion 
we review a sentence for procedural error and substantive reasonableness.see united states omole,cir.we therefore begin by ensuring that the district court did not commit any significant procedural error,such as failing to calculate or improperly calculating the guidelines range,treating the guidelines as mandatory,failing to consider the section a factors,selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts,or failing to adequately explain the chosen an explanation for any deviation from the guidelines range.gall united states,d united states gordon,cir.
if we determine the district court sentencing decision to be procedurally sound,we then consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence.in reviewing the district court decision on the issue of reasonableness,we employ the deferential abuse of discretion standard.gordon,at united states mykytiuk,cir.therefore,our task on reasonableness review is limited.united states wachowiak,cir.we must consider the sentencing court explanation of its reasons for imposing a particular sentence.that explanation need not be exhaustive but it must be adequate to allow for meaningful appellate review and to promote the perception of fair sentencing.omole,at,quoting gall.at.if the sentence imposed is outside the guidelines range,the district court must provide a justification that explains and supports the magnitude of the variance.see also gall.at.
in reviewing the substantive reasonableness of a sentence that falls outside the advisory guidelines range,we must give due deference to the district court determination that the section a factors,taken as a whole,justified the extent of the variance.gall.at gordon,at.the fact that we might reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court.gall.at.our review must take into account that a sentencing judge is in a superior position to find facts and judge their import under section a in the individual case.the judge sees and hears the evidence,makes credibility determinations,has full knowledge of the facts and gains insights not conveyed by the record.id.quotation omitted.because the district court has greater familiarity with the case and the individual defendant and therefore an institutional advantage over an appellate court in making sentencing determinations,we must defer,absent an abuse of discretion,to its ruling.gordon,at.
in our consideration of the substantive reasonableness of a sentence,it is important to bear in mind that t he concept of substantive reasonableness contemplates a range,not a point.omole,at citation omitted.because the contours of substantive reasonableness review are still emerging,we can not target a fixed point at which a sentence turns from reasonable to unreasonable,or vice versa.id.quoting wachowiak,at.a variant sentence based on factors that are particularized to the individual defendant may be found reasonable,but we are wary of divergent sentences based on characteristics that are common to similarly situated offenders,and sentences that deviate from the guidelines solely on the basis of overstated mitigating factors or normal incidents of the offense,wachowiak,at emphasis added.even if a judge overstates mitigating factors or considers normal incidents of an offense,however,if such a consideration is just one of many reasons the judge gave for his sentence,the sentence will be affirmed.see id.
here,there is a sizable difference between the advisory range and the sentence imposed on carter.the sentencing court therefore was required to enunciate persuasive reasons,based on the factors in section a,for the variance.see gall.at omole,at.the government contends that seven aspects of the district court explanation of the variance were either weak or impermissible justifications for mitigation,or were factually incorrect.the government submits that any justifications properly relied on by the district court were insufficient to support the extent of the variance and that the sentence therefore is substantively unreasonable.we shall consider each of the government arguments.
the government first two contentions relate to the district court primary explanation for the sentence variance.the district court stated explanation for the sentence relied primarily on two factors the district court finding,based in part on carter age,that she was unlikely to commit future crimes,and its conclusion that the seriousness and characteristics of her offense were not part of the heartland of offenses that the guidelines were designed to address.sent.tr.at.in our view,the government objections to the district court primary justification for the variance are,under the circumstances presented here,without merit.
the government first submits that carter age was a weak mitigating factor because her age,years,did not set her apart from the usual tax or offender it relies for this proposition on the sentencing commission report,which found that percent of tax offenders were over and that,for persons whose primary offense involved money laundering,percent of offenders were over sentencing commission,sourcebook of federal sentencing statistics,available at.
statistical evidence such as that proffered by the government can no doubt be a helpful tool to a sentencing judge.yet,there is certainly no evidence that congress ever intended that such evidence rigidly cabin the discretion of the district court in exercising its duty under section a.in any event,the breadth of the statistical categories tendered by the government counsels in favor of extreme caution in relying on such raw numbers in the delicate task of sentencing.for instance,the government notes that,in,almost of tax offenders were over years old.this statistic conveys little probative information,however,because it does not provide the age distribution of offenders in the over category.furthermore,it includes all types of tax offenses,not just the particular tax fraud committed by carter,again without describing the distribution of ages among those different tax offenses.nor does the statistic convey any other relevant measure of the data,like the mean,median and mode.because of the caution with which we approach statistical analysis generally,and because of the particularly imprecise nature of this statistic in particular,we can not conclude on this basis alone that the district court clearly erred when it found that carter was not a tax offender of the age that usually comes before the courts 
the government additionally submits that carter age was an improper consideration because she is not exceptionally elderly or infirm.it also submits that the district court did not give a sufficient explanation for why carter age was significant.we can not accept these contentions.the district court discussion with counsel and its statement of reasons make clear that it considered carter age to be a mitigating factor not because she was infirm,but because her age set her apart from the average offender and made it less likely that she would commit these crimes again.see sent tr.at i think,on the other hand,we do have the age of carter,she is,and that is not the age of your normal criminal that comes before the court for sentencing,i think that when one considers the age i do mean to suggest that carter is an old lady,but i do anticipate her breaking the law again.the likelihood of recidivism is a proper sentencing consideration.a c the court,in determining the particular sentence to be imposed,shall consider the need for the sentence imposed to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant.indeed,we have held specifically that a district court may properly consider a defendant age as it relates to the possibility of her committing crimes in the future.see united states holt,cir affirming a sentence where the district court only reason for the variance was that the defendant age made it unlikely that the defendant again would be involved in another violent crime.we can not say that the district court abused its discretion when it determined that,based on her age and the totality of the circumstances,carter was unlikely to commit further crimes in the future.consequently,the court did not abuse its discretion when it concluded that this factor counseled in favor of a sentence significantly below an advisory guidelines sentence.see id.affirming a sentence of months imprisonment,months below the guidelines range,where the variance was based solely on the offender age see also omole,at.
the government second contention is that the district court erred when it determined that carter offenses were not typical money laundering offenses.the government relies on the following statement by the district court 
so,carter violated the law,and the law she violated was structuring and money laundering.having said this,this is obviously not a paradigm of the money laundering cases.
the article in the sentencing guidelines by the commission indicates that congress original purpose was,in the context of organized crime,to prevent proceeds from crimes being used to commit other crimes.
sent.tr.at.the government also relies on another statement that the court made after it determined and announced carter sentence i think under all the circumstances the sentence does reflect the seriousness of the offense,i think it does reflect the characteristics of the offense,which is not your paradigm instance of money laundering.id.at.
the government submits that there are three types of money laundering spending,concealment and promotion.carter committed two of those types of laundering,specifically spending and concealment.the third type,promotion,refers to money laundering designed to promote an underlying illegal activity,for instance,drug smuggling or racketeering.in the government view,the district court statement reflected an improper assessment that carter spending and concealment were less serious types of money laundering than promotion.the government argument is twofold first,that the district court statement reflects a finding that concealment and spending are less serious than promotion,and second,that such a finding is improper because congress intended to punish identically promotion,concealment and spending offenses.the government contends that the only proper consideration is the extent and magnitude of the a distinction between promotion,concealment,and spending.br.at.it contends that congress intended to punish identically promotion,concealment and spending,as demonstrated by the statutory scheme,which sets the same maximum term of imprisonment for promotion and concealment.see.
in stating that carter offense was not the typical case of money laundering,the district court referred to a report by the sentencing commission.see sentencing policy for money laundering offenses,united states sentencing commission,available at congress launder.pdf.that report states that the relatively high base offense levels under the money laundering guidelines,id.at,are inflexible and arbitrarily determined without connection to the seriousness of the defendant actual offense conduct,id.at.the sentencing commission conducted a study on money laundering sentences and determined that money laundering sentences are being imposed for conduct that is substantially less serious than the conduct contemplated when the money laundering guidelines were first formulated.id.at.the commission concluded from its investigation that the sentencing structure was generating disproportionate penalties for violations of federal laws in that serious misconduct was not being punished more severely than less serious offenses and that the structure should be recalibrated to reflect directly the seriousness of the underlying offense.id.at.the commission noted a particular concern regarding offenses involving the concealment of the proceeds of drug trafficking,the promotion of further criminal conduct,and the use of foreign banks,international transactions or other sophisticated forms of money laundering.see id.at.
here,the district court consideration of whether carter offense was a typical money laundering offense was within the bounds of permissible interpretation.a sentencing court is required to consider the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense,to promote respect for the law,and to provide just punishment for the offense.a a.the district court concluded that carter offense was not in the heartland of offenses that the sentencing commission intended to address when it set the guidelines.its conclusion is supported by the sentencing commission policy statement.the government contention that promotional and concealment offenses carry the same maximum term of imprisonment is correct,but unavailing.the district court,in its analysis,did not compare offenders who simply had undertaken different types of money laundering instead,it concluded that carter offense,when viewed in light of all the circumstances,was not of the sort that had caused the guidelines to be set at the level at which they had been set.the district court did not abuse its discretion when it selected a sentence that reflect ed the seriousness of and provide d just punishment for the offense actually committed by carter.see see also united states walters,cir holding that a sentence reduction was not disproportionate in light of the district court conclusion that the guidelines overstated the seriousness of the offender actual conduct.
in addition to the government first two objections,which relate to the district court primary explanation of the sentence,the government makes several other arguments with respect to the district court general sentencing considerations.
the government third contention is that carter reliance on her divorce attorney advice was not a solid ground for mitigating her sentence because the attorney did not advise her to protect funds.at sentencing,the district court stated 
i do think that she probably did freak out when she found out that her husband was basically on his way to prison and i think she acted to a certain extent out of an attempt to protect herself i think her divorce lawyer said that he had suggested that that money be put in her name so,her actions were not wholly not understandable.
sent.tr.at.the court also said 
i believe she did not receive good advice.the advice would have been to do do anything,this money is tainted money.whatever advice she received,that was it,and she certainly did follow it.
sent.tr.at.
the government contends that the divorce attorney advice is not a mitigating factor because the attorney was not fully informed.the divorce attorney testified that he told carter on march,to make certain that you preserve the liquidity for as long as you can because i do want the spouse to in any way try to take the moneys and freeze her out or starve her out.tr.at,see also id.at q.so you told her to protect the liquid assets,right yes.he also testified that carter did not tell him that some of the couple liquid assets were the proceeds of robert fraud.id.at i t never came up about any type of fraud whatsoever.the attorney further stated that he would not have advised her to transfer funds that were the proceeds of fraud.id.at.
the government contends that the district court did not consider that carter divorce attorney testified that,if she had told him about the source of the money,he never would have suggested that she protect notably different from conceal her assets.appellant br.at.the district court stated that her actions were not wholly not understandable,tr.at,based in part on the conversations that carter had with her attorney.nothing in the record suggests that the court misconstrued her attorney testimony or his advice to her.nor does the record suggest that the district court put undue weight on this consideration the district court acted within the permissible bounds of discretion in considering evidence of the effect the advice had on carter as a factor affecting the nature and circumstances of the offense she committed.see a.
the government fourth contention is that the district court comparison of carter sentence with her husband sentence was impermissible because carter was not similarly situated to her husband.here,it presumably relies on the following statement by the district court 
now,in considering what an appropriate sentence in this case is,it does seem to me that it would be entirely improper to give her a sentence that was similar,or certainly higher,than what her husband got.her husband was the source of the illegal funds.she did benefit from them though,there is no question about that.
sent.tr.at.after announcing carter sentence,the district court also stated i do anticipate her breaking the law again,and i think that certainly a sentencing within the guidelines would have been disparate from her husband sentence.id.at.
the government contends that carter is not similarly situated to her husband because,unlike him,she did not plead guilty but instead went to trial.it
