the nigerian counterfeit check scam 
defendant anthony ross is a residential and commercial real estate broker in lorain county,ohio.ross has been in real estate for approximately twenty years.after graduating from high school,ross joined the navy,where he became involved in real estate part time.after receiving an honorable discharge in,ross became a real estate agent in lorain county.in,after working as an agent for realty one for several years,ross obtained his broker license and opened his own business,northshore realty.at the time of trial,northshore realty had eight employees and seven affiliated independent agents.in,ross became a certified commercial industrial management ccim specialist,a designation of some renown in real estate,which allowed him to conduct commercial real estate transactions.during his time as an agent in lorain county,ross was involved with the lorain county board of realtors and in was elected its president.
when ross opened northshore realty,he planned to develop and sell houses to residents of lorain county.ross created investors,which was a general contracting business affiliated with northshore realty for the express purpose of building houses.ross obtained financing through firstmerit bank and also from family and friends who invested between and in the project.between and,ross sold of these homes.unfortunately,he was never able to return a profit on them,and suffered a financial loss.throughout,firstmerit repeatedly reminded ross to make timely payments on his credit line.in,firstmerit foreclosed on his credit line and ross was unable to repay the loans he obtained from his family and friends.also in,ross filed for personal bankruptcy,though his businesses remained intact.
it was during these financial difficulties that ross met a potential commercial real estate investor.in,ross was attending a national realtors association convention in washington,where he met an individual by the name of didi duke.duke and ross agreed to develop commercial real estate in lorain county.duke offered to gather approximately million in investment capital for the proposed project.upon his return from the conference,ross memorialized his agreement with duke in a contract to represent duke and a group of investors in a development or an investment of about million.ross and duke corresponded several times over the phone before agreeing to enter into this contract,and ross had his attorney review the contract prior to signing it.testimony at trial did not,however,provide any insight into the specifics of this alleged commercial real estate transaction other than million was to be invested in commercial real estate projects in lorain county,ohio.
according to ross testimony,after the contract was signed,duke mailed a due diligence check to him.ross received this check via overnight mail on october.the check was drawn on an associates credit card services account with the bank of new york.the check itself appears to be printed on a british petroleum check.upon receipt of this check,ross quickly went to a firstmerit branch in oakwood nearest his office to deposit it and to get cash back.the branch informed him a hold would be placed on a check of that size and he would be unable to receive funds from the check until after the check cleared.ross then decided to take the check to the firstmerit branch in sheffield nearest his home because they knew him over there.at the sheffield branch,ross was able to gain approval from the manager to deposit the check in his investors account and to receive back.ross needed the in order to make payroll at one of his housing construction sites.a few days later,on october,ross withdrew another from the investors account in order to have cash for a trip he was taking with his girlfriend now wife to new orleans.
while in new orleans,ross bank card and credit card from firstmerit were frozen and he was unable to withdraw funds.ross spoke with an official from the bank who informed him that the check he had deposited was counterfeit.upon his return from new orleans,ross contacted duke to inquire about the counterfeit check.duke informed ross that his investors were no longer interested in investing in the united states after the events of and had backed out of the transaction.ross accounts at firstmerit remained frozen through the time of trial.ross financial difficulties subsequently proved too much to bear,and he filed for personal bankruptcy under chapter of the bankruptcy code on april.ross was discharged from his bankruptcy on july.
during the summer of,several months after the failed transaction with duke,ross was contacted by an individual named didi hassan.from may until sometime in the fall of that year,there were several email and telephonic communications between ross and hassan discussing the resurrection of the transaction originally arranged with duke.hassan led ross to believe an individual by the name of bello from canada was arranging financing for the deal.ross spoke with bello on the phone and provided his personal information for purposes of securing financing.
in june,ross received via overnight mail a check for drawn on the account of gregory dodge hyundai car dealership in highland park,illinois.ross believed this check was from bello and that gregory dodge hyundai was an investor in the proposed real estate deal.ross called gregory dodge hyundai to confirm they were actually investors in the deal and discovered the check was counterfeit.ross mailed the counterfeit check to gregory dodge hyundai at their request.
a few days later,ross received a bank of america cashier check for.ross deposited this check in his firstmerit account,believing it to be money sent from hassan for the purposes of opening up an offshore account to facilitate the proposed deal.after depositing the check,ross was contacted by the bank and informed the check was counterfeit.because ross had not withdrawn any funds from the check,the bank suffered no loss.ross informed the bank he was dealing with nigerians who were interested in investing in lorain county.ross shared several emails between himself and hassan with the bank investigator.the bank investigator informed ross that this was likely a scam and to stop dealing with hassan or any other nigerians.ross promised to cut off his dealings with hassan.
from august until may there was a break in the email communication between ross and hassan.no evidence was presented as to why this break occurred other than ross own testimony that he was ignoring hassan because he was angry about the counterfeit checks.
in the summer of,hassan contacted ross again in an attempt to revive the deal with new financing.hoping to prevent any future counterfeit checks,ross informed hassan that he would only accept payment by wire transfer from a united states bank.hassan agreed to a wire transfer and initiated negotiations with ace financial,allegedly based in chicago,to secure financing in the amount of.in june of,ross emailed hassan stating that he had been contacted by the chicago financiers about the loan and that the disbursement would occur within seven to ten business days.
on july,national city bank received an envelope containing a united states treasury check for payable to ross.the account number for ross was typed on the endorsement line on the back of the check.upon receipt of the check,national city immediately deposited the check in the ross corporation account.no hold was placed on the check as treasury checks are considered guaranteed funds.at this time,ross was out of town.when he returned to town on monday,july,ross was greeted with an email from hassan asking if the funds had been credited to his account and a phone call and fax from ace financial in chicago stating that the funds had been disbursed to his account at national city in the amount of.ross testified that he believed the money to have been wired into his account.
over the next three days,ross purchased several cashier checks from the bank in order to pay off debts owed to friends and family.he also moved into an investment account at edward jones which he had opened approximately a month earlier.within days,the treasury check was returned to national city as counterfeit.thanks to its own quick actions and the cooperation of ross,national city was able to recover all but.
upon learning that the funds were from a check rather than a wire,ross immediately contacted hassan and ace financial.at some point in the summer of,the phone number for ace financial was cut off and hassan stopped communicating with ross.at this time,ross had been in contact with the bank investigator and had attempted to negotiate a payment plan to pay back the money lost by the bank,but the bank turned down his request and referred the case for prosecution.
in november,united states secret service agents showed up unannounced at ross office.one of the agents told ross they were investigating a nigerian counterfeit check scam of which ross may have been a victim.believing the agents were there to help him,ross happily discussed all of his dealings with duke and hassan in detail.this meeting lasted several hours in a conference room in ross office.at some point during this meeting,ross deduced that he was the actual suspect.the agents informed ross of his miranda rights and ross subsequently agreed to offer a written statement.in his testimony and his written statement,ross revealed that at some point after receiving the first counterfeit check,he researched nigerian scams on the internet.after that research,ross insisted that all transactions be done by wire transfer between united states banks and received assurances from hassan that he and his associates were not part of any scam.additionally,his written statement said that he was aware through his dealings with duke and hassan that they were likely attempting to scam him,but he wanted to get them before they got me.he also stated that his business dealing should have been cut off.greed got the better of me.finally,he said in his written statement that he had no idea who sent the treasury check.
on december,a federal grand jury in cleveland,ohio,returned an indictment charging ross with two counts of bank fraud,in violation of.the first count related to the counterfeit check passed at firstmerit,and the second count related to the check deposited at national city.on july,a jury found ross guilty of both counts of bank fraud.on october,ross was sentenced to months incarceration,followed by four years of supervised release.
district court determination of intended loss at sentencing 
at ross sentencing hearing,the district court adopted the findings of the probation officer that the actual loss resulting from ross bank fraud was and that the intended loss was.
in computing his sentence,the district court determined that the sentencing guideline for violation of calls for a base offense level of.the district court also found that pursuant to b h the offense level should be increased by because the loss was between and.the district court stated it was constrained by the definition of loss contained in application note to b,which states that loss is the greater of actual loss or intended loss.ross objected to the intended loss amount of but the district court overruled his objection stating only that a jury found ross guilty on both counts of bank fraud for passing two counterfeit checks totaling.
the district court found that ross had a total offense level of because ross had no prior convictions,he was placed in criminal history category i.the guidelines range for that offense level and criminal history category is to months.the district court sentenced ross to months imprisonment and four years of supervised release.the district court noted this was at the low end of the guidelines range.
deliberate ignorance instruction 
this court reviews a district court choice of jury instructions for abuse of discretion.united states prince,cir.a trial court has broad discretion in crafting jury instructions and does not abuse its discretion unless the jury charge fails accurately to reflect the law.united states layne,cir quoting united states busacca,cir.moreover,no single provision of the jury charge may be viewed in isolation rather,the charge must be considered as a whole.united states lee,cir.a judgment may be reversed based upon an improper jury instruction only if the instructions,viewed as a whole,were confusing,misleading,or prejudicial.united states harrod,cir quoting beard norwegian caribbean lines,cir.
the district court gave the following deliberate ignorance instruction 
next i want to explain something about proving a defendant knowledge.no one can avoid responsibility for a crime by deliberately ignoring the obvious.if you are convinced that anthony ross deliberately ignored a high probability that any checks or deposits received from didi hassan or any of his associates would be counterfeit or otherwise fraudulent in nature,then you may find that anthony ross knew that the deposit into his national city bank account on july,was also fraudulent in nature.
but to find this,you must be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that anthony ross was aware of a high probability that any checks or deposits received from didi hassan or any of his associates would be counterfeit or fraudulent in nature,and that anthony ross deliberately closed his eyes to what was obvious.carelessness or negligence or foolishness on his part is not the same as knowledge,and is not enough to convict.this,of course,is all for you to decide.
this instruction tracks verbatim with the sixth circuit pattern instruction on deliberate ignorance.it appears the district court only instructed on deliberate ignorance with regard to the second count of bank fraud,the count relating to the treasury check.
ross argues that the district court abused its discretion because there was insufficient evidence to support a deliberate ignorance instruction.ross argument is largely controlled by united states mari,cir.in mari,this court held that when a district court gives a deliberate ignorance instruction that does not misstate the law but is unsupported by sufficient evidence,it is at most harmless error,so long as there is sufficient evidence of the defendant actual knowledge to support a conviction.id.the mari court,relying on the supreme court decision in griffin united states,d,reasoned that if a jury instruction does not misstate the law,but rather is unsupported by the evidence,the jury conviction will not be overturned if there is evidence supporting a conviction on another instructed theory.id.at.in subsequent cases this circuit has reaffirmed mari reasoning.see,united states monus,cir e ven if there had been insufficient evidence to support a deliberate ignorance instruction,we must assume that the jury followed the jury charge and did not convict on the grounds of deliberate ignorance.
here,ross does not argue that the instruction given misstated the law on deliberate ignorance and,as the government points out,there is sufficient evidence to support a deliberate ignorance instruction on the second only count for which the instruction was given.over the course of two years,ross received four counterfeit checks,one of which he found so suspicious that he called the account holder to determine its validity,only to confirm hi
