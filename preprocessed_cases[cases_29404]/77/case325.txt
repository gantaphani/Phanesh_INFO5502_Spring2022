this federal criminal prosecution arises out of a million loan from david wittig to clinton odell weidner,ii.in april,when wittig made the loan,weidner was the president,chief executive officer,and general counsel of the topeka,kansas bank at which wittig did business.the government alleged that weidner and wittig concealed the loan,and the jury agreed,convicting both men of one count of conspiracy to submit false entries to a federally insured bank and to launder money,in violation of four counts of making a false bank entry,in violation of and one count of money laundering,in violation of.the jury also convicted weidner of a criminal forfeiture count involving the arizona real estate in which he had invested the million that he had borrowed from wittig.the district court sentenced wittig to concurrent terms of months imprisonment on each of the six counts,followed by a term of supervised release,and ordered him to pay a million fine.the court sentenced weidner to concurrent terms of months imprisonment,also followed by three years supervised release.
in this appeal,weidner and wittig raise a variety of issues relating to the sufficiency of the evidence and the adequacy of the jury instructions.they also challenge their sentences,arguing that the district court erred in calculating the amount of loss and in basing their sentences on factual findings not made by the jury.
although the government case was largely circumstantial,we conclude that the evidence was sufficient and that the jury instructions were adequate.however,as to the defendants sentencing challenges,we conclude that,in light of the ambiguity of the guidelines,the district court did err in calculating the amount of the loss.accordingly we affirm the defendants convictions,vacate their sentences,and remand the cases for resentencing in accordance with this opinion and the principles set forth in united states booker,d.
background 
in recounting the relevant facts,we view the record in the light most favorable to the government.see united states radcliff,cir.
a.the loan transactions 
during and,weidner was the president,chief executive officer,and general counsel of capital city bank in topeka,kansas.wittig was an established capital city bank customer with substantial assets a march financial statement on file with the bank reported a net worth of million.he was the chairman of the board,president,and chief executive officer of western resources,the largest electric utility in kansas.
in,wittig borrowed to purchase the landon mansion in topeka,kansas.two years later,he opened a million line of credit in order to renovate the mansion.by april,capital city bank had increased wittig line of credit to million.
in early,michael earl,another capital city bank customer,approached weidner about a real estate project in scottsdale,arizona that required a million investment.earl told weidner that he was not capable of making this investment,but he asked weidner if he knew of anyone who would be interested.
weidner informed wittig of the arizona project and asked if he was interested.wittig responded that he thought that the investment was a great opportunity but had other projects that he wanted to pursue instead.in particular,wittig explained that he thought he could get a better return at less risk by investing in a new utility company called westar.
weidner then told earl of his own interest in the arizona project,and he reached an agreement with earl requiring a million investment in exchange for an interest in the real estate.weidner did not have the million he needed to make the investment.moreover,as to its employees,capital city bank rules limited loans not involving a principal residence or children educational expenses to.accordingly,weidner needed to look elsewhere for funds,and he approached wittig about a loan.
in late april,weidner directed his administrative assistant,christy gurney,to prepare a loan proposal increasing wittig line of credit from million to million.the proposal characterized its purpose as a s hort term increase of wittig operating line for investments renovation costs,wittig app.at,adding that david is the president and ceo of western resources.he utilizes the line of credit to purchase stock and make business investments.he is also using the line to complete the final renovation costs of the landon mansion as well as their personal funds.id.at.at trial,gurney testified that weidner provided her with the information that she included in the loan proposal.the owner of capital city bank,frank sabatini,approved the proposal on april.according to gurney,wittig did not review the written loan proposal before it was approved.
on april,however,wittig and his wife did sign a change in terms agreement related to the million increase in the line of credit.a printed section of that document stated that the existing indebtedness was the promissory note from borrower to lender dated and that this change in terms will serve to increase the line from the current availability of to a line availability of.id.at.wittig crossed out the million figure and wrote instead.the change of terms agreement provided for interest at an initial annual rate of and contained provisions regarding default,set off,and collateral.however,the agreement contained no further description of the purpose of the increase in the line of credit.the agreement also included a printed section stating that t his written agreement is the final expression of the agreement between lender and borrower and may not be contradicted by evidence of any prior oral agreement or contemporaneous oral agreement between lender and borrower.id.at.finally,a section concerning nonstandard terms was left blank.
wittig faxed the signed agreement to gurney at capital city bank.on the same day,april,two transactions posted to wittig account at capital city bank a million deposit and a million withdrawal.the million was routed to security title in phoenix,arizona,the company handling the real estate transaction in which weidner wanted to invest.gurney testified at trial that she had not personally ordered the wire transfers and did not know who had done so.however,she added that weidner had the authority and ability to make the wire transfers himself.
on the following day,weidner and wittig executed a promissory note that required weidner to pay wittig million at one payment of the million principal plus interest due in a year,as well as quarterly interest payments beginning on august.the note was secured by the accounts,contract rights,and general intangibles of the arizona real estate project.at trial,an fdic official testified that this promissory note was not discovered in the regular examinations of the bank records.in the following weeks,wittig received two additional increases in his line of credit at capital city on may,and another on june.
weidner and wittig both filed documents with the bank that failed to disclose the million loan between them.first,on may,weidner submitted his responses to an officer questionnaire,part of a regular examination of the bank by the fdic.one question asked weidner to l ist all extensions of credit made for the accommodation or direct benefit of anyone other than those whose names appear either on the note or on other related credit instruments.wittig app.at.weidner responded none.id.second,on may,weidner submitted an annual personal financial statement on a preprinted form containing a section listing notes,accounts,and bills and contracts payable.weidner left that section blank.finally,on january,wittig and his wife submitted an annual financial statement required by the terms of their credit agreement with the bank.the wittigs stated that they had million in liabilities to capital city bank but did not list a million loan to weidner as an asset.
in late july,soon before the first payment on the million note from wittig came due,weidner requested a loan of from the capital city bank.in the loan application,he stated that the purpose of the loan was to finance the purchase of a harley davidson motorcycle.weidner obtained the loan and deposited the,along with a personal check for,into an account at a different bank,capitol federal savings and loan.at capitol federal,weidner drew a cashier check payable to wittig.wittig deposited this check into a money market account at a third bank.
weidner made additional payments to wittig one on january,for,and another one on may,for.he used his account at capitol federal to make those payments,and,in conjunction with that capitol federal account,he submitted a financial statement that again omitted his liability to wittig on the million note.
at capital city bank,weidner first disclosed the loan from wittig in a conversation with his administrative assistant gurney in june.he told her that he was the beneficiary of the million increase in wittig line of credit in april.he added that he had invested the money in a luxury subdivision and that he hoped to make a million profit.
in october,gurney relayed that information to bob kobberman,who was then capital city chief loan officer.bank officials filed a suspicious activity report with the fdic and also conveyed the information about the loan to the bank bonding company.after the disclosure of the loan,weidner asked a friend,mcgivern,to pay back the loan from wittig.mcgivern obtained the money and transferred it to weidner arizona partner,michael earl.earl then transferred the funds to wittig account at capital city bank,and wittig paid down his line of credit by million.
in april,weidner resigned from his position with capital city bank.bank officials asked wittig to pledge additional utility stock,to increase the mortgage on his personal residence,and to provide million in life insurance benefits to properly collateralize the loan.wittig complied with those requests.in july,he paid off his line of credit with capital city and opened accounts with another bank.
b.the government allegations 
the government charged weidner and wittig with the following offenses conspiracy to submit false entries to a federally insured bank and to launder money,in violation of count making or aiding and abetting in the making of false bank entries,in violation of and counts and money laundering,in violation of count.the government also sought criminal forfeiture of the arizona real estate count.
the false bank entries alleged in counts through concerned the documents that failed to reveal a million loan from wittig to weidner a the april,loan proposal stating that wittig was requesting a million increase in his line of credit to renovate the landon mansion and to make business investments count b weidner may,response to the fdic questionnaire count c weidner annual financial statement,submitted to capital city bank on may,count and d the wittigs january,financial statement,submitted to capital city bank under the terms of their credit agreement count.
c.wittig defense 
at trial,wittig did not contest making the loan to weidner.however,he argued that he reasonably assumed that the capital city bank officials knew about the loan and that he in no way authorized weidner false statements.
in support of his defense,wittig noted that he was not involved in the preparation of the april,loan proposal requesting the million increase in his line of credit,and he contended that he did not even see the document before the increase was approved.similarly,wittig pointed to weidner testimony that wittig was not involved in any way in the submission of the may,questionnaire responses and the may,financial statement.additionally,wittig invoked the testimony of michael earl,the man who had informed weidner about the arizona real estate opportunity.earl stated that he believed that capital city bank officials knew about weidner arizona real estate investment because weidner was the head of the bank and,if weidner knew about the investment,earl assumed the bank knew too.according to wittig,he made the same assumption about the million loan to weidner would inform the bank.
as to his own financial statement,which also did not disclose a million loan to weidner,wittig argued to the jury that the document was submitted after weidner had confided in gurney about the loan and after gurney had informed kobberman,the bank chief loan officer,about the transaction.thus,he contended that the omission of the loan from the financial statement was not intended to injure or defraud the bank.moreover,wittig observed,like other financial statements he had submitted to the bank,this one omitted other assets and liabilities,such as a million mortgage from capital city bank on his home.according to wittig,all of the omitted items were linked to transactions with capital city bank or other information that the bank,through weidner,already knew.wittig further contended that the omission was not material the financial statement listed million in assets,which far exceeded wittig outstanding debt to capital city bank.
wittig also challenged the government contention that his depositing loan payments from weidner into a money market account outside of capital city bank demonstrated his intent to conceal the loan.he noted that he did not have a money market account at capital city bank and that the government own witnesses acknowledged that money market accounts typically pay higher interest rates than checking accounts.moreover,he added,he had used the money market account for years,and he submitted records of deposits into the account for more than a year before the deposits of weidner interest payments on the million loan.
finally,wittig attacked the government quid pro quo wittig had made the loan to weidner in order to obtain financing for a new utility company.he argued that there was no need for the alleged quid pro quo because the board of directors of capital city bank had openly discussed lending money to the utility company executives,including wittig,and because this transaction was widely regarded as an outstanding business opportunity for the bank.additionally,under the bank lending rules,the proposed financing of the utility exceeded the amount that weidner could personally approve.
d.weidner defense 
weidner pleaded guilty to counts and making false entries on the may,questionnaire responses and the may,financial statement,but he defended the remaining counts at trial.his defense as to the conspiracy count,the allegedly false statements on the april,loan proposal,and the money laundering charge counts,and was that he had not intended for the million increase in wittig line of credit to be used for the arizona venture.he testified that,although he did intend to borrow money from wittig,his understanding was that the money would come from a source outside capital city bank.as to wittig january,financial statement the subject of count,weidner maintained that the statement was submitted by wittig acting alone.
e.the judge findings at sentencing 
after the jury convicted wittig and weidner,the district court applied the version of the united states sentencing guidelines ussg those in effect at the time of the offense conduct.the sentencing proceedings focused on the determination of the offense level based on the amount of loss.
the court determined the amount of loss in two ways.applying ussg b,the court considered the gross receipts that the defendants had obtained from the offenses of conviction.the court also determined the amount of intended loss.the court found that both wittig and weidner had received million in gross receipts and that they had each intended a loss of that amount.as to weidner,the court further found that he had obstructed justice and that he had abused a position of trust.applying ussg and,the court increased weidner offense level by two points for each of those findings.
as to wittig,the court imposed concurrent sentences of months incarceration,a fine of million,and a term of supervised release.the court sentenced weidner to concurrent terms of months incarceration and three years supervised release.
ii.discussion 
in these appeals,wittig and weidner both challenge the sufficiency of the evidence supporting their a conspiracy convictions b bank fraud convictions and c convictions for money laundering.wittig further argues that d the district court erred in admitting evidence concerning his wealth and his executive employment agreement with the utility company and e the court erred in instructing the jury on the count and in refusing to give an instruction that nominee loans are not illegal per se.
both defendants also challenge their sentences on several grounds.wittig argues that f the district court erred in calculating the amount of loss under ussg b based on loan proceeds he received because the court had already determined that weidner had benefitted from those proceeds.both defendants argue that g the district court erred in increasing the offense level based on intended loss under ussg b i when the loan obtained by wittig was fully collateralized and fully repaid and h the district court violated their sixth amendment rights by relying on facts not found by the jury in imposing the sentence.
for the reasons set forth below,we must reject the defendants various challenges to their convictions.however,as to their sentences,we conclude that the district court erred in calculating the amount of loss and we therefore remand for resentencing under the principles set forth in united states booker,d.
sufficiency of evidence supporting conspiracy convictions 
at the close of the government case,the district court denied wittig and weidner motions for judgments of acquittal on the conspiracy charge and the substantive offenses.both defendants now challenge that decision.
we engage in de novo review.united states bush,cir.in doing so,we consider both direct and circumstantial evidence,and all reasonable inferences therefrom,in the light most favorable to the government.id.we do not question the jury credibility determinations or its conclusions about the weight of the evidence.united states,cir.there is sufficient evidence to support a conviction if a reasonable jury could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.bush,at quotation and citation omitted.nevertheless,t he evidence,when viewed in its entirety,must generate more than a mere suspicion of guilt,and where such evidence is equally consistent with both guilt and innocence the conviction can not be sustained.united states fox,cir quoting direct sales united states.additionally,we may not uphold a conviction obtained by piling inference upon inference.united states,cir.
we begin with the conspiracy charge.in order to convict a defendant of that offense,the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant entered into an agreement the agreement involved a violation of the law one of the members of the conspiracy committed an overt act the overt act was in furtherance of the conspiracy object and the defendant wilfully entered the conspiracy.united states dazey,cir.
the core of a conspiracy is an agreement to commit an unlawful act.united states morehead,cir quoting united states esparsen,cir.t he critical inquiry is whether the circumstances,acts,and conduct of the parties are of such a character that the minds of reasonable men may conclude therefrom that an unlawful agreement exists.id.quoting united states kendall,cir.the existence of the agreement to violate the law may be inferred from a unity of purpose or common design and understanding among conspirators to accomplish the objects of the conspiracy.kendall,at.
secrecy and concealment are often necessary to a successful conspiracy,and,as a result,direct evidence of the crime is frequently difficult to obtain.dazey,at.therefore,conspiracy convictions may be based on circumstantial evidence,and the jury may infer conspiracy from the defendants conduct and other circumstantial evidence indicating coordination and concert of action.id.
moreover,a conspiracy conviction requires at least the degree of criminal intent necessary for the substantive offense itself.morehead,at internal quotation marks omitted.thus,mere knowledge or acquiescence in the purposes of the conspiracy is not sufficient to establish the defendant willful entry into the conspiracy.united states migliaccio,cir.instead,the government must establish informed and interested cooperation,stimulation,or instigation.direct sales,at.
here,the government alleged that weidner and wittig engaged in a conspiracy to make false bank entries in violation of and to launder money in violation of.a conviction requires the government to prove that the defendant knowingly made a false bank entry or caused such a false entry to be made and that the defendant intended to defraud one or more of the bank officers,auditors,examiners,or agents.united states evans,cir.section requires the government to prove the defendant knowing engagement in a transaction involving criminally derived property the defendant must know that the property in question is criminally derived.united states allen,cir quoting united states pettigrew,cir.as a result,in order to establish the conspiracy charge against weidner and wittig,the government was required to prove that the two men agreed to make false bank entries to defraud bank officials,and to knowingly engage in a transaction involving criminally derived property.
with those principles in mind,we address each defendant contentions in turn.
in challenging his conspiracy conviction,wittig repeats the arguments that he advanced at weidner acted independently in completing the april,loan proposal,may,questionnaire responses,and may,personal financial statement,and that,as to wittig own january,financial statement,the government failed to establish that the omission of the million loan to weidner demonstrated an intent to deceive the bank.as a customer of capital city bank,wittig maintains,he reasonably assumed that weidner would fulfill his obligations to disclose the loan to the bank,and weidner failure to do so is insufficient to prove the conspiracy charge.
we acknowledge that the sufficiency of the evidence against wittig presents a close issue.the government theory was that the million increase in wittig line of credit in april was a nominee loan,a sham transaction in that wittig was not the actual borrower and that the purpose of the increase was not to renovate the landon mansion and fund wittig other investments,as the april,loan proposal stated,but rather to provide weidner with funds to invest in arizona real estate.see united states waldroop,cir discussing nominee loans.nominee loans are not inherently illegal,but are illegal if they are used to deceive a financial institution about the true identity of a borrower.see also united states saks,cir stating that c ourts have on several occasions concluded that if a borrower obtains funds at the insistence of and for the benefit of a bank officer,without disclosing the officer interest on the loan documents,thereby knowingly flouting banking rules and regulations designed to protect the financial integrity of the bank,a jury can conclude that both borrower and officer acted with intent to defraud the bank united states shively,cir observing that t here is no law against a bank customer lending to a bank officer,but the defendant bank customer refused to lend the defendant bank official his own money and the bank would not wittingly have helped the customer get a hold over the bank official by providing the customer with money to lend to the bank official.
in contrast to many of the reported cases involving nominee loans,the government here presented no direct evidence that the alleged nominal borrower,wittig,suggested to the actual borrower,weidner,that a nominee loan scheme could be used to deceive the bank and obtain the loan.see waldroop,at,discussing evidence that the defendant came up with the plan to use nominee loans as a way around the bank borrowing limit and that the defendant had stated that he personally could not get a loan and had therefore suggested that the sign the loan application united states.kennedy,cir discussing direct evidence that the defendant told a to include false information on a loan application.
nevertheless,the government did present substantial circumstantial evidence of wittig participation in the alleged conspiracy.first,in order to obtain the million increase in his line of credit in april,wittig signed a change in terms agreement that closely resembled other change in terms agreements that he signed in order to increase his line of credit,the agreements he signed in may and june.the april change in terms agreement described an increase in wittig line of credit,not a loan to weidner,and it recited that there were no terms.yet the government evidence supported the inference that wittig intended the million to be used by weidner for an investment in which wittig himself had declined to participate.
another aspect of that change in terms agreement supports the government contention that wittig was involved in concealing the loan to weidner.although the april,loan proposal prepared by gurney requested an increase in the line of credit from million to million,wittig sought to modify the request by deleting the million figure on the change in terms agreement and writing in million.the fact that wittig sought and obtained two additional line of credit increases shortly thereafter permits the inference that,in making the request for million on april,wittig sought to obtain million for weidner and million for himself through one single line of credit increase and that he sought to do so without disclosing that part of the requested increase was for weidner.
moreover,the loan transaction between wittig and weidner was structured in such a way that weidner himself received no direct payments from wittig.instead,the million was deposited in wittig account and then transferred on the same day to the arizona title company managing the arizona real estate transaction.as the district court noted,this was the first of several instances in which the transfer of funds between weidner and wittig occurred in a manner in which it could be concealed from others at capital city bank and from capital city bank examiners.wittig app.at.even though there was no direct evidence that wittig ordered the million wire transfer to the arizona company,the evidence permitted the jury to infer at a minimum that he acquiesced in the transfer gurney testified that wittig closely monitored his financial transactions at the bank,and there is no indication that he objected to the million transfer.
finally,perhaps the strongest evidence of wittig participation in the concealment of the loan to weidner comes from the document that he did prepare and submit to the january,financial statement that did not list the loan in stating his assets and liabilities.at trial,wittig did offer an explanation of this omission he contended that he did not disclose it because he believed that the bank knew about the loan.he also observed that the financial statement omitted other significant assets and liabilities.
for several reasons,the jury could reasonably have rejected these explanations and found the omission of the loan to demonstrate wittig participation in the conspiracy.first,even though,by january,gurney had conveyed to the bank chief loan officer that weidner was the beneficiary of the million line of credit increase,there is no evidence that wittig knew about that conversation and would have relied on it in failing to disclose the loan.moreover,wittig january,financial statement did list the line of credit with capital city bank.however,the statement described the line of credit solely as a million liability of wittig there was no reference to the fact that part of that liability was offset by weidner obligation to pay the million promissory note.thus,the jury could view wittig listing of the line of credit as qualitatively different from other assets and liabilities,such as his home mortgage,which were not mentioned at all.rather than an inadvertent omission,the failure to list the loan to weidner could be viewed as a knowing concealment of a nominee loan.see united states walker,cir stating that the fact that a particular document could be read in two ways,one favorable to the defendant and one favorable to the government,did not establish that the district court erred in denying the defendant motion for a judgment of acquittal because the court was required to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government.
viewed as a whole,this evidence permits the conclusion that wittig willfully entered into an agreement to violate the bank fraud and money laundering statutes and that he and weidner committed overt acts in furtherance of this conspiracy.if one or more of the individual pieces of evidence we have discussed had been lacking,then the conspiracy charge might have required the kind of inference upon inference that courts have deemed insufficient.see,at.however,the jury here heard evidence of a pattern of concealment of the loan to the change in terms agreement,in the direct payment of million from wittig account to the arizona real estate investment,and in the omission of the loan to weidner on wittig financial to establish the elements of the conspiracy charge beyond a reasonable doubt.
weidner challenges his conviction on related grounds.first,he criticizes the government quid pro quo wittig loaned the million to weidner because wittig wanted to obtain financing for a new utility company.weidner points to evidence that the proposal to create the new company was public knowledge,that financing required participation by other lending institutions,and that,as a result,weidner could not personally assure that wittig would obtain the needed financing for the new company.second,weidner contends that the loan transaction was not per se improper,weidner br.at,and that the loan was a legitimate way in which wittig could further his business interests.he maintains that loans obtained for third parties are not illegal.
these arguments do not persuade us.although some of the government quid pro quo evidence was indeed tenuous,the government was not required to prove a specific motive in order to convict the defendants of the charged conspiracy.see shively,at stating,in a prosecution for the misapplication of bank funds against a bank customer and a bank official under and,that i t is unimportant whether the customer loaned money to the official out of pure friendship,or,as is more likely,to ingratiate himself with the officer of a bank with which he did business both as supplier and as borrower.the gist of the government case was that the defendants made false statements so that weidner could obtain the loan from wittig.
as to weidner contention that loans obtained for third parties are not per se illegal,we agree.see waldroop,at.however,the government case was based not merely on wittig obtaining money for a third party but on the concealing of the loan from the bank.thus,the fact that these loans are not per se illegal does not undermine the government case.
from the evidence we have discussed,a jury could reasonably conclude that weidner willfully entered into a conspiracy with wittig to violate the bank fraud and money laundering statutes and and that the two men each committed overt acts in furtherance of that conspiracy.in particular,gurney testified that weidner directed her to complete the april,loan proposal,and it is undisputed that the proposal omits any reference to the line of credit increase being used to fund a loan from wittig to weidner.moreover,on the same day it was deposited into wittig account,the million was transferred to the arizona project in which weidner wanted to invest.additionally,weidner acknowledged that his responses to the officer questionnaire and his personal financial statement made no reference to the million loan from wittig.
we therefore reject weidner sufficiency of the evidence challenge to his conspiracy conviction.
sufficiency of evidence supporting bank fraud convictions 
both wittig and weidner challenge their bank fraud convictions.in order to establish a violation of,the government must establish beyond a reasonable doubt that an entry made in bank records is false the defendant made the entry or caused it to be made the defendant knew the entry was false at the time he made it and the defendant intended that the entry injure or defraud the bank or public officers.united states chaney,cir.the supreme court has described the aim of the statute as giv ing assurance that upon an inspection of a bank,public officers and others would discover in its books of account a picture of its true condition.united states darby.see also united states cordell,cir citing darby for the same proposition.
under,an omission of material information qualifies as a false entry.cordell,at see also united states copple,cir a n omission where an honest entry would otherwise be made can be a false entry for section purposes.the entry is rendered no less false simply because,through considerable effort and a piecing together of minute details,the bank might have been able to discover the truth.united states luke,cir see,phillips united states,cir affirming a conviction based upon nominee loans and loans to fictitious parties even though microfilm bank records revealed the true nature of the transactions and stating that the fact that an entry falsity may be exposed by an examination of other books of account,does not render it any less a false entry made with intent to deceive internal quotation marks and citation omitted.additionally,the defendant himself need not make the false entries in bank records it suffices that he set in motion management actions that necessarily caused bank personnel to make false entries.united states wolf,cir.
with those principles in mind,we turn to each defendant challenge to the convictions.as set forth above,there are four allegedly false entries at issue the april,loan proposal stating that wittig was requesting a million increase in his line of credit to renovate the landon mansion and make business investments count weidner may,responses to the fdic questionnaire count weidner annual financial statement,submitted to capital city bank on may,count and wittig january,financial statement count.these documents do not contain any reference to a million loan from wittig to weidner.
application of to bank customers 
in challenging his convictions,wittig first invokes the third circuit decision in united states barel,cir.there,the court held that a defendant who had submitted false information about his social security number in opening an account could not be prosecuted under section because the legislative history shows that congress intended the statute to apply only to bank insiders or their accomplices.id.at emphasis added.the court also held that under the particular facts of the case,the defendant could not be convicted under an aiding or abetting theory.see id.at concluding that the defendant acts causing bank employees to make false entries in the bank books,although intentional in the general sense of the word,were merely a byproduct of his specific intent to defraud his wife.
barel does not foreclose the government prosecution of wittig for violating because,unlike the prosecution in that case,the government here alleged and the jury found that wittig conspired with a bank official to make false bank entries in violation of the statute.many courts,including this one,have held that a bank customer may be convicted of violating,and other federal bank fraud statutes,if he or she conspires with a bank official or aids and abets the official violation of the statute.see,phillips,at affirming a conviction of a bank customer on the grounds that he aided and abetted a bank president in making false entries see also copple,at affirming convictions of bank customers under and other federal bank fraud statutes and stating that the d efendants have been charged with aiding and abetting and conspiring with a bank officer who held a position sufficient to trigger jurisdiction of the statutes specified in the indictment luke,at affirming bank customers convictions for aiding,abetting and causing the making of a false entry in bank records,in violation of and.
thus,wittig status as a bank customer did not bar his prosecution under.
participation in conduct alleged in counts 
wittig directs another challenge at counts,which involve the april,loan proposal,weidner may,response to the officer questionnaire,and weidner may,financial statement.he notes that these documents were prepared by weidner and gurney,and he contends that there was no evidence that he aided and abetted in the preparation and submission of these documents.
as we have observed above,in order to convict a defendant of a violation of,the government is not required to prove that the defendant made the false bank entries himself.see wolf,at.a defendant may be convicted of a charge if he or she conspires with or aids and abets a bank official making of a false entry.see,copple,at phillips,at.here,the evidence we have discussed in addressing wittig challenge to the conspiracy convictions provides sufficient support for the convictions alleged in counts.the loan proposal,questionnaire responses,and personal financial statement addressed in those counts all failed to disclose the loan from wittig to weidner.based on those omissions,a jury could reasonably conclude that the submission of each document was an overt act committed in furtherance of the conspiracy charged in count.because the evidence is sufficient to support the conclusion that wittig was a member of that conspiracy,a jury could properly convict him for the submission of the documents addressed in counts,even though he did not personally prepare those documents.see united states russell,cir during the existence of a conspiracy,each member of the conspiracy is legally responsible for the crimes of fellow conspirators that are committed in furtherance of the conspiracy.citing pinkerton united states.
statements alleged in count 
wittig also argues that,contrary to the allegations of count,the statements in the april,loan proposal were not false.he observes that the loan proposal stated one of the purposes of the million increase in his line of credit was to make business investments.wittig app.at.according to wittig,his million loan to weidner,on which he charged percent interest,was such a business investment,and thus the loan proposal did not contain a false statement.
but the policy underlying is to ensure that an inspection of the bank books will yield an accurate picture of its condition.darby,at.cordell,at.as a result,a material omission from a document may constitute a false entry.cordell,at stating that an omission of material information relating to matters which should be disclosed in order to show a true picture of the transactions involved,as well as an actual misstatement,qualifies as a false entry under the statute.here,even though,in broad terms,one could arguably characterize wittig loan to weidner as a business investment,the proposal addressed in count omitted a key material fact about the requested line of credit increase for it was really for weidner,who wanted to use it for an investment that wittig had expressly turned down.thus,the government presented sufficient evidence of a false entry under.
wittig addresses another challenge directly at count,which concerns his january,financial statement.he argues that,for two reasons,the government failed to prove that he submitted that document with the intent to defraud the bank and that the evidence is therefore insufficient to support this particular count.
first,wittig observes,weidner already knew about the million loan he had received from wittig.thus,wittig argues,the omission of that loan from wittig own financial statement merely demonstrates that he failed to disclose information that would have been pointless to disclose.second,wittig contends that when he submitted the financial statement,gurney had already told the bank chief lending officer about the loan to weidner.
again,we are not persuaded.congress passed to protect the integrity of the bank records.see darby,at.cordell,at.thus,the fact that a particular bank official,like weidner,is aware of certain information not disclosed in a document does not foreclose a finding of the necessary intent to defraud.see chaney,at stating that t he government need not prove intent to cause the bank injury all that is required under is that the defendant intended to defraud one or more of the bank officers,auditors,examiners,or agents emphasis added.as to the fact that gurney had disclosed the loan to the bank chief lending officer three months before wittig filed his financial statement,we have previously noted that there is no evidence that wittig himself knew about that disclosure.thus,despite gurney disclosure,the jury could still have reasonably concluded that wittig failure to list the loan demonstrated the intend to defraud necessary to support his conviction as to count.
weidner challenges his convictions for the violations alleged in counts and april,loan proposal and wittig january,financial statement.he invokes his own testimony that he believed that the funds for the arizona investment were to come from funds other than those in wittig capital city accounts.that belief,he contends,demonstrates that he lacked an intent to defraud.then,as to count,weidner advances the same argument as it was proper to describe the purpose of the initial loan as business investments.wittig app.at.
neither argument has merit.even though weidner testified that he did not intend to use wittig million line of credit increase as the funding for the arizona real estate investment,the jury was not required to believe him.as the district court explained,there was sufficient circumstantial evidence from which a reasonable juror could conclude that weidner and wittig did intend to use the million line of credit increase for weidner real estate investment.in particular,the million was deposited in wittig account and then on the same day transferred to the arizona title company managing the real estate transactions in which weidner wanted to invest.there is no indication that wittig objected to that transfer,and,on the following day,weidner signed a promissory note obligating him to pay million plus interest to wittig.
as to the fact that the april,loan proposal referred to business investments,we have already noted that,despite the use of that phrase,the failure to disclose that weidner was the real borrower supports the jury finding that wittig possessed the necessary intent to defraud.the same is true of weidner.
we therefore conclude that the evidence is sufficient to support weidner convictions alleged in counts and.
sufficiency of evidence supporting money laundering convictions 
wittig and weidner also challenge the sufficiency of the evidence supporting their money laundering convictions under.section a prohibits knowingly engag ing in a monetary transaction in criminally derived property that is derived from specified unlawful activity.to establish a violation of,the government must prove that the defendant engaged or attempted to engage,in a monetary transaction,in property,knowing that the property was derived from unlawful activity,and the property is,in fact,derived from specified unlawful activity.united states massey,cir.
in a prosecution for an offense under this section,the government is not required to prove the defendant knew that the offense from which the criminally derived property was derived was specified unlawful activity.c.in other words,t he knowledge element of the offense requires that the defendant know that the property in question is criminally derived,although it does not require knowledge that the property was derived from specified unlawful activity.united states allen,cir quoting united states pettigrew,cir.
wittig money laundering conviction is based upon the wire transfer of funds from his capital city account to the arizona title company on april.in challenging the evidence supporting this conviction,wittig advances arguments similar to those he offers in attacking his conspiracy conviction.wittig argues that these funds were not criminally derived and that,in the alternative,there is no evidence that he knew that the funds were criminally derived.
we are not persuaded by wittig contentions.as the government notes,the evidence supporting the conspiracy and convictions also supports the money laundering conviction.because a jury could reasonably conclude that wittig concealed the purpose of the line of credit increase he obtained from the bank,a jury could also conclude that the funds that were transferred by wittig on april,were criminally derived.accordingly,the evidence is sufficient to support wittig money laundering conviction.
weidner also challenges his money laundering conviction.his argument here is dependent on his challenge to the conspiracy conviction and to the conviction alleged in count.in particular,weidner notes that a money laundering conviction requires an underlying criminal activity.here,he contends,there was no underlying crime because there was no evidence from which a jury could conclude that,at the time the million was transferred to the arizona title company,he intended to conceal from bank officials the loan that he had obtained from wittig.
weidner challenge lacks merit.gurney testified that it was weidner who instructed her how to complete the april,loan proposal.that proposal did not disclose that the million increase in wittig line of credit was intended for weidner real estate investment in arizona.moreover,the million that wittig loaned to weidner was not transferred directly to weidner but instead was routed to the arizona title company managing the transaction in which weidner wanted to invest.gurney testified that she did not make that transfer and that weidner had the authority and the ability to make such a wire transfer himself.from the manner in which the million was transferred from wittig account to weidner arizona real estate investment,the jury could conclude that weidner intended to conceal from bank officials that he was the real borrower of the million advanced by capital city bank.thus,the evidence was sufficient to support the jury finding that weidner knowingly engaged in a transaction involving criminally derived property in violation of.
evidence of wittig wealth and executive employment agreement 
wittig challenges the district court admission of exhibits and,arguing that they were unduly prejudicial and that,as a result,he is entitled to a new trial.we review a district court evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion.united states curtis,cir.

the first document to which wittig objects,exhibit,is an employment agreement between western resources and wittig,dated september.at trial,the government contended that this agreement demonstrated that wittig would greatly benefit from the creation of a new utility company and that,because wittig was seeking funding from weidner bank,the agreement supplied a motive for wittig allowing his line of credit to be used to provide the million loan to weidner.
the second document at issue,exhibit,is an overview of the benefits that would flow to executives in the new utility company.the government contended at trial that the document indicated that wittig would receive between million and million.again,the government asserted that the opportunity available to wittig to receive these substantial sums explained why wittig declined to invest in the arizona real estate project himself and opted instead to curry favor with weidner,whose bank would be able to finance the creation of the lucrative new utility company.
wittig contends that both documents were irrelevant and prejudicial.according to wittig,the government trumpeted these documents in an attempt to prejudice the jury with arguments about a potential multimillion dollar payout scenario,bonuses,stock options,and life insurance,as well as the value of the wittigs extensively renovated home in topeka and a new york apartment they maintained.wittig br.at.
wittig further contends that the government failed to establish that he needed weidner assistance in obtaining financing for the new utility company.he points to evidence that the new utility company had great profit potential for the bank and that,as a result,wittig did not need weidner help in obtaining the financing.moreover,he notes,any decision with respect to the financing at issue would have been referred to a committee because weidner lacked the authority to personally approve it.finally,wittig observes that the proposed transaction creating the new utility never came to fruition.
to a degree,wittig points are.the government quid pro quo theory involved a substantial amount of speculation and in fact was unnecessary to prove the counts against wittig,which involved the loan to weidner,not the creation of the new utility.shively,at noting,in a prosecution for conspiracy to misapply bank funds in violation of,and,that the motivation of a customer in loaning money to a bank official was irrelevant whether he did so out of pure friendship,or,as is more likely,to ingratiate himself with the officer of a bank with which he did business.moreover,even without the evidence of the potential benefits from the new utility company,the government introduced evidence that wittig was benefitting from the loan to weidner weidner was paying wittig a higher interest rate than wittig was paying the bank.
nevertheless,we can not conclude that the district court abused its discretion in admitting this evidence.the evidence of the lucrative benefits from the new utility company was of some relevance it did indicate that wittig had an interest in cultivating a good relationship with weidner.the evidence invoked by wittig does not foreclose the government allegation that wittig sought to cultivate weidner good will and that one way of obtaining that good will was to loan weidner the million.moreover,wittig has not established the necessary prejudice to warrant reversal of his conviction.see coletti,at noting i f this court find s error in the admission of evidence,it will set aside a jury verdict only if the error prejudicially affects a substantial right of a party internal quotation marks omitted.
jury instruction errors alleged by wittig 
wittig challenges the district court jury instructions on three grounds.we review a district court decision to give a particular jury instruction for an abuse of discretion.osteguin pac.transp,cir.however,we review de novo whether,considering the instructions as a whole,the jury was misled.wilson muckala,cir.in reviewing such allegations,this court examines the record as a whole to determine whether the instructions state the applicable law and provide the jury with an appropriate understanding of the issues and the legal standards to apply.faulkner super valu stores,cir.
allowing a bank customer to be convicted of a violation 
wittig argues that the jury instructions allowed him to be convicted of the violations based on a finding that he acted alone,solely as a bank customer.again invoking the third circuit decision in barel,he maintains that the statute does not authorize prosecutions based on such a theory.although wittig acknowledges that the jury was also instructed that he could be convicted of the violations on an aiding and abetting or a conspiracy theory,he contends that one can not determine whether the jury relied on these theories or on the theory that he acted alone as a bank customer.
wittig challenge is based on the supreme court decision in yates united states,d,overruled on other grounds by burks united states,d.in yates,the court held that a verdict must be set aside where the verdict is supportable on one ground,but not on another,and it is impossible to tell which ground the jury selected.id.at.in a subsequent decision,the court limited that holding to instances in which one of the possible bases of conviction was legally insufficient as opposed to factually insufficient.see griffin united states,d discussing yates.
here,even assuming that wittig is correct in arguing that a bank customer can not be prosecuted for a direct violation of,he has not established that his convictions are invalid.the jury was also instructed that wittig could be liable for violating as an aider or abettor or as a conspirator,and from a review of the instructions,evidence,and arguments of counsel,it is clear that it the jury relied on those theories in convicting wittig of the violations.
in particular,as to counts,the government,as wittig himself contends,offered no evidence that wittig submitted the documents at issue the loan proposal,the questionnaire responses,and weidner financial statement.thus,the only basis on which the jury could have found wittig responsible for these violations was on an aiding and abetting or conspiracy theory.
as to count,the government alleged that wittig submission of his january,financial statement was an overt act carried out in furtherance of the conspiracy.the fact that the jury convicted weidner on that count demonstrates that it found that wittig overt act of submitting his own financial statement was done in furtherance of the conspiracy.there was no evidence that weidner was involved in the preparation and submission of that document,and so a conspiracy theory is the only theory on which the jury could have relied in convicting weidner of that count.because the jury necessarily found that wittig submission of his own financial statement was done in furtherance of the conspiracy,there is no risk that the jury relied solely on the allegedly invalid theory that wittig committed the violation alleged in count by acting alone as a bank customer.see united states hudgins,cir noting that yates requires reversal only where it is impossible to tell that the bad ground was not the sole basis for the verdict emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted.
instructing on pinkerton conspiracy theory 
wittig next challenges the district court pinkerton instruction insofar as it concerned count,the false bank entry charge that addresses wittig submission of his own financial statement on january.wittig argues that,as to that count,no conduct by weidner was charged or argued.as a result,wittig contends,the district court pinkerton instruction improperly allowed wittig to be convicted for the conduct of a bank official.
wittig conviction under count was not based upon the pinkerton doctrine.that doctrine provides that one conspirator can be found guilty of crimes committed by another conspirator in furtherance of the conspiracy.see russell,at.here,it was wittig,not his,who committed the act alleged in count by submitting his own financial statement.as we have noted,bank customers who conspire or aid and abet bank officials may be convicted under.see,copple,at luke,at phillips,at.thus,there is no instructional error here.
refusal to give instruction regarding third party loans 
in a final challenge to the jury instructions,wittig argues that the district court erred in refusing to give an instruction stating that nominee loans loans on behalf of a third person are not per se illegal.
we discern no grounds for reversal here.viewed as a whole,the instructions properly focused the jury on the key wittig and weidner misled capital city bank officials.as the government persuasively argues,to have given the jury a simple instruction that nominee loans are not per se illegal would have been an incomplete statement of the law nominee loans are illegal when the borrower and bank officer make false statements or omit material information in order to obtain the funds.whether the defendants made such statements and omitted such information was the issue contested here,and wittig per se instruction was not necessary to inform the jury of the relevant legal principles.
