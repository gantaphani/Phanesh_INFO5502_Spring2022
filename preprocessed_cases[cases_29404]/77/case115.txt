opinion of the court 
keith cimera,the former manager of a check cashing store in montclair,new jersey,was convicted by a jury for his participation in an illegal check cashing scheme involving fourteen fraudulent checks.several months after his conviction,cimera moved for a new trial under federal rule of criminal procedure based on newly discovered evidence.that evidence,he claims,are deposit account numbers on the back of five of the fraudulent checks which are different from the deposit account numbers on the others,indicating that the checks were cashed in a branch of the check cashing business other than the one in which he worked.the district court granted cimera motion based on its conclusion that the discrepancy in the account numbers constituted newly discovered evidence.
we conclude that the district court erred in granting cimera motion for a new trial.first,cimera failed to identify any evidence that had not been admitted at trial.second,even if he had identified new evidence which would prove that the checks were endorsed at another branch,he has failed to establish that he was subjectively unaware of such evidence or that it could not have been discovered with the exercise of reasonable diligence before the trial.accordingly,we will reverse the order granting cimera motion for a new trial.
cimera was the general manager of montclair check cashing in montclair,new jersey.he was indicted and charged with one count of conspiracy to transport stolen property interstate and six counts of transporting stolen securities and money in violation of and.he pled not guilty.at his trial,the government presented evidence that cimera had conspired with michael ferrante and frank palmer to cash checks that palmer had stolen from his employer 
ferrante was a new jersey bookie.he worked for mimmo marzullo a loanshark who ran a gambling operation in montclair.when ferrante clients were unable to pay their gambling debts,ferrante would arrange for them to obtain loans from marzullo.marzullo charged interest at a rate of three percent per week and made borrowers aware that,if necessary,he would use violent means to collect any outstanding debt.
palmer was ferrante former high school classmate.in the fall of,palmer was down on his luck and in debt to another bookie.ferrante helped him obtain one of marzullo loans.palmer,however,continued to gamble and became increasingly indebted to marzullo.in order to avoid the repercussions of defaulting on his upon ferrante recommendation palmer began stealing checks from his employer,ernst young,in lyndhurst,new jersey.between december of and january of,palmer stole three checks in the amounts of,and,respectively.ferrante took the checks to cimera,explained that he had a friend that worked at ernst young,and told cimera that no one would ever find out about it.app.at.cimera cashed the checks,but told ferrante that if they were returned,ferrante would be responsible for reimbursing him.
in january of,palmer contacted ferrante and told him that he had something big coming up and asked if ferrante could arrange to have a check for more than cashed.id.at.ferrante said,let me reach out to someone and i get back to you.id.he then contacted cimera.cimera declined to discuss the matter over the phone,but invited ferrante to his house they met later that day,and cimera agreed to cash the check.
until that time,cimera and palmer had never met.because of the value of the check,however,the three men decided to meet the following day in the parking lot of a clothing store to discuss how palmer had obtained the check and when cimera would be able to deliver the money.although there was no discussion regarding how the money would be divided,ferrante testified that he understood that the amount would be split three ways.ferrante delivered the check to cimera the following day.the check was cashed on january.thereafter,palmer stole four more checks from ernst young in lyndhurst,which totaled.he gave these checks to ferrante,who in turn gave them to cimera to cash 
in april of,palmer was promoted to become the accounts payable manager in the general counsel office of ernst young headquarters.in his new position,palmer was authorized to issue checks to outside counsel.during his first three months of employment,he falsified six checks totaling.consistent with the prior scheme,palmer gave these checks to ferrante,who passed them on to cimera to cash.
in june of,an accounting director at ernst young identified three checks that had been falsely endorsed.the suspected fraud was reported to ernst young director of security,larry bastoky.bastoky discovered that the checks had been deposited into an account for matt,at a chase manhattan bank branch in montclair,new jersey.he also learned that matt,was owned by tom wilson and that it served as the corporate name of two check cashing businesses montclair check cashing and west orange check cashing as part of his investigation,bastoky called montclair check cashing in an effort to reach wilson.employee matt dolan answered the phone and told bastoky that he should speak to the store manager,keith cimera.although bastoky left his name and telephone number,cimera never returned his call.bastoky called again and dolan told him that he had left the message for cimera.finally,on july,bastoky reached cimera directly.
during their telephone conversation,bastoky explained to cimera that he was conducting an investigation regarding three fraudulently endorsed checks that had been cashed at montclair check cashing and deposited into a matt,account.upon bastoky request,cimera agreed to review the business records in an attempt to discover who was responsible for cashing the checks.cimera indicated that the store received hundreds of checks every day,suggesting,according to bastoky,that it would be quite a project for him to review the records.id.at.bastoky faxed copies of the three stolen checks to cimera.
bastoky tried to reach cimera several times after he faxed the checks to follow up.he finally reached him on july or.although cimera did not indicate that he had made progress in identifying the individual who had cashed the stolen checks,he did ask if bastoky had a suspect in mind.bastoky indicated that he suspected frank palmer,and agreed to fax a photo of palmer to cimera.federal agents subsequently found a copy of that fax during a search of michael ferrante house.
based on the evidence that he had collected,bastoky decided to interview palmer at ernst young office in manhattan.during the interview,bastoky told palmer that the evidence suggested that palmer had been stealing company checks and that he believed palmer might have a gambling problem.palmer denied the allegations.bastoky placed palmer on a paid leave of absence,retrieved his access card,identification,and keys,instructed him to contact his supervisor the following day,and had him escorted out of the building.palmer testified that after the interview with bastoky,he called michael ferrante.ferrante instructed him to deny everything and said that he would contact keith cimera.
the following day,palmer contacted his supervisor and bastoky by telephone.he admitted that he had stolen the three checks then under well as several other he was working in the lyndhurst office.he explained that,after he was promoted to the general counsel office,he began creating fictitious invoices from law firms and other businesses.he would send the fictitious invoice to the dallas accounting center,and request that a check be sent directly to his attention so that it could be.when bastoky realized the breadth of palmer check fraud scheme,he contacted the fbi.
several days later,bastoky contacted palmer,who agreed to meet him at the meadowlands sheraton hotel.when palmer arrived,several fbi agents were present.the agents offered him the opportunity to cooperate.he subsequently agreed to assist in the investigation.in all,the government discovered that palmer had stolen fourteen checks between january and june of.eight checks were stolen during palmer employment at the lyndhurst office six were stolen during his employment in the manhattan office.the combined value of the checks was.initially,palmer admitted only that he had stolen twelve checks he failed to disclose that he had stolen the two remaining checks until after he entered his guilty plea.
as part of his agreement with the government,palmer consented to have his conversations with ferrante and cimera recorded.between august and september,palmer engaged in thirteen recorded conversations with ferrante.he also left two recorded messages on cimera answering machine.although there is no evidence that palmer ever actually spoke to cimera directly,telephone records reflect that ferrante and cimera spoke almost every day,and often,numerous times per day,during this period.
in the recorded conversations,palmer told ferrante that ernst young had discovered three of the fourteen stolen checks,but that they had agreed not to press charges against him if he reimbursed the company for the value of those checks.he told ferrante that he did not have the money and asked if cimera would pay it.ferrante repeatedly told palmer that he was unable to reach cimera or that cimera did not want to discuss the matter.ferrante testified,however,that he spoke with cimera every day and that cimera had refused to give palmer any money.
on october,the fbi searched ferrante house.they seized loansharking documents,gambling records,a copy of frank palmer picture that cimera received by fax from bastoky,the chase manhattan bank memo from nadia ali,the stolen nextel checks,two bb guns,an antique gun,and some personal checks.they also seized ferrante wallet,which contained a fake identification card with frank palmer information and ferrante picture and a casino card in mimmo marzullo name.
on july,a grand jury returned a indictment against marzullo,ferrante,and cimera.on october,ferrante pled guilty to one count of illegal gambling,one count of extending credit by extortion,and one count of conspiracy to defraud the united states.at the time of trial,ferrante had not yet been sentenced.on february,marzullo pled guilty to one count of illegal gambling and one count of extending credit by extortion.he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment.
on april,the grand jury returned a superseding indictment against cimera.he was tried by a jury in the district of new jersey and was convicted on all seven counts on july.following the trial,cimera filed a rule motion for judgment of acquittal and a rule motion for a new trial.the district court held a hearing on these motions on september,and entered an order denying the motions on october.
on january,cimera filed a notice of substitution of counsel.his new attorney filed a motion for a new trial on a claim of newly discovered evidence on february.the district court held a hearing on cimera second motion for a new trial on march.
in his motion,cimera claimed that,after the trial,he had discovered that five of the fourteen checks bore endorsement stamps with bank deposit account numbers that differed from the numbers on the other nine checks.the discrepancy between the account numbers,cimera argued,made clear that there were two separate matt,accounts one for montclair check cashing and one for west orange check cashing.although the checks themselves were admitted into evidence,the account numbers were illegible on four of the five checks at issue cimera argued that if this information had been presented to the jury,it would have cast doubt on the government case and likely would have resulted in an acquittal,at least with respect to some of the counts.the district court agreed and,in an oral ruling,granted cimera motion for a new trial.the government filed this timely appeal.
the district court exercised jurisdiction over this criminal case pursuant to.we have jurisdiction over an appeal from an order granting a motion for a new trial pursuant to.the decision to grant or deny a motion for a new trial under federal rule of criminal procedure is committed to the sound discretion of the district court.gov t of the virgin islands lima,cir.accordingly,on appeal,our review is for abuse of discretion.id.
federal rule of criminal procedure provides that u pon the defendant motion,the court may vacate any judgment and grant a new trial if the interest of justice so requires.in interpreting rule,this court has held that a district court may grant a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence if five requirements are met 
a the evidence must be in fact,newly discovered,discovered since the trial b facts must be alleged from which the court may infer diligence on the part of the movant c the evidence relied on,must not be merely cumulative or impeaching d it must be material to the issues involved and e it must be such,and of such nature,as that,on a new trial,the newly discovered evidence would probably produce an acquittal.
united states iannelli,cir see also gov t of the virgin islands lima,cir united states saada,cir.although the decision to grant or deny a motion for a new trial lies within the discretion of the district court,the movant has a heavy burden of proving each of these requirements.see saada,at.
in this case,the district court reviewed each of the five requirements and concluded that they had all been satisfied.although the court acknowledged that the checks themselves were admitted into evidence,it nonetheless concluded that the evidence namely,the discrepancy in the serial numbers was indeed newly discovered.id.at.the failure to discover that discrepancy,the court held,was not the result of a lack of diligence by any of the parties.id.at.to the contrary,the court explained,it frankly was the exercise of truly extraordinary diligence by substitute defense counsel in coming into this case that generated what really is newly discovered evidence.id.furthermore,the court determined that the new evidence was material and that it was not merely cumulative or impeaching.finally,the court explained 
the newly discovered evidence must be of such a nature that on new trial,it would probably produce an acquittal.in this court view,while i am not asked to look into a crystal ball or even a magnifying glass to make that determination,what this does indicate to me is that at least if these particular counts remain drafted and charged as they are,essentially that the checks were transmitted to and processed at montclair check cashing this evidence would,in all likelihood,produce an acquittal on such a charge as drafted.
id.at.based on these findings and conclusions,the court granted cimera motion for a new trial.id.at.
on appeal,the government argues that,contrary to the district court holding,cimera failed to satisfy four of the five iannelli requirements.specifically,the government contends that cimera failed to prove that the discrepancy between the account numbers was newly discovered in other words,that it was unknown to him before the close of trial even if cimera was unaware of the discrepancy,he could have discovered it by exercising reasonable diligence prior to the conclusion of the trial the evidence was not material to the outcome of the case and presentation of the evidence would not likely have produced an acquittal.
insofar as the the physical markings on the backs of those admitted at trial,we conclude that cimera has failed to identify any new evidence.furthermore,even if cimera had identified new evidence,we agree with the government that cimera failed to satisfy the first two prongs of the iannelli test.accordingly,we will reverse the district court order granting his motion for a new trial 
at the outset,it is important to identify the evidence at issue.in this case,cimera makes two separate,but related,arguments.first,he claims that the digits in the account numbers on the checks at issue are newly discovered because,as a result of their size and illegibility,he was unaware of them at the time of trial and could not have identified them with the exercise of reasonable diligence.second,he claims that the discrepancy between the account numbers,which reflected that the checks had been cashed in different accounts,was newly discovered.
the relevant physical represent the account evidence by contrast,an
