keith simmons appeals his convictions on one count of securities fraud,one count of wire fraud,and two counts of money laundering,as well as his sentence of fifty years imprisonment.we affirm his fraud convictions but reverse his convictions because the transactions prosecuted as money laundering constituted essential expenses of his underlying fraudulent scheme.accordingly,we affirm in part,reverse in part,vacate his sentence,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
from april to december,simmons operated a million ponzi scheme called black diamond capital solutions.with help from a network of hedge fund managers,simmons recruited more than investors by promising to invest their money in a lucrative and exclusive foreign currency exchange,or forex fund.simmons told investors that only ten or twenty percent of their investment would be at risk at any given time.he sent them monthly earnings statements reporting sizeable profits.and he promised them that,after an initial period,they could withdraw their money at will.
numerous investors tested simmons promise and withdrew a portion of their money after ninety days had passed.upon the receipt of these returns,which seemed to evidence black diamond legitimacy and profitability,many investors sent even more money to simmons.some recruited their friends to invest with simmons as well.
in fact,no forex fund existed and simmons never invested a cent of his victims funds.simmons fabricated the earnings reports,and he paid the purported returns to early investors from deposits made by later ones rather than investing his victims funds as promised,simmons treated their investments as his personal piggy bank.he purchased million in real estate,invested million in an extreme fighting venture,funneled million to his other businesses,and bought lavish gifts and trips for his employees and girlfriends.
greed provoked the ponzi scheme,and greed doomed it.as more investors sought to withdraw their funds,simmons told a series of escalating lies to string out investors and delay withdrawals.first,he claimed that withdrawals were interfering with the fund,and that he would henceforth limit withdrawals in order to reduce the fund volatility.later,he asserted that he was negotiating with a german named klaus bruner,who allegedly planned to cash out investors and take over the account.and simmons told some investors that the fbi itself was impeding some withdrawals.
simmons was lying.in,when investors earning statements reflected a total of more than million,the black diamond bank account had in fact dwindled to.still,simmons told investors that their money was safe.
by july,simmons permitted no further withdrawals by investors.after that date,simmons managed to attract only one new investor.moreover,existing investors began demanding their money back.and as became more alarmed,simmons dissembling became more desperate.finally,in december,the fbi raided his offices.during a long conversation with an fbi agent,simmons confessed to the fraud.
ultimately,simmons ponzi scheme cost his victims more than million.many lost their life savings.some lost their families.many became depressed,even suicidal,after learning that their money was gone.
the government indicted simmons on one count of securities fraud,one count of wire fraud,and two counts of money laundering.the fraud counts arose from simmons role in the ponzi scheme itself,which,according to the superseding indictment,took place from april to december.the indictment did not predicate simmons two fraud charges on discrete instances of fraud rather,it charged simmons with a year scheme to defraud,specifically claiming that simmons executed what is commonly known as a ponzi scheme.simmons counts,by contrast,arose from two discrete payments to investors made in.the government alleged that these payments also involved the diver sion of investor money back to other investors in to induce further investments by investors and their friends and family members.
simmons proceeded to trial in december.nine of his victims testified against him,as did certain hedge fund managers,an irs agent,and the fbi agent to whom simmons confessed.simmons did not testify.his counsel argued that he was a neophyte financier who never intended to defraud his investors.the jury,however,convicted him on all counts.
after simmons conviction,a probation officer drafted a presentence report calculating simmons recommended term of imprisonment.the probation officer recommended an offense level of the maximum level permitted under the guidelines and a criminal history category of i.this offense level and criminal history category produced a sentence of months imprisonment.
the district court varied downward from the probation officer recommendation and sentenced simmons to months imprisonment.specifically,the court sentenced simmons to months on the count,a consecutive term of months on the count,and month terms on each of the two counts months of which was to be served consecutively to the fraud counts,and months of which was to be served concurrently.the court acknowledged that this was an enormous sentence,but explained that it could not remember another case that involved such devastating,life wrecking greed.the court concluded that a sentence was sufficient,but not greater than necessary,to accomplish justice.
on appeal,simmons primarily challenges his convictions he claims that the trial court erred by declining to grant his motion for judgment of acquittal on those counts.we review the denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal de novo.united states mehta,cir.
the federal promotional statute makes it a crime to engage in a financial transaction involving the proceeds of specified unlawful activity with the intent to promote the carrying on of that activity.a a i.the statute defines specified unlawful activity to encompass more than predicate crimes,including securities fraud and wire fraud.id.at c a.
both of simmons convictions arose from payments that he made to investors during the course of his ponzi scheme.the first conviction was based on a wire transfer of to james bazluki on march.bazluki had invested in black diamond prior to receiving this return after receiving it,bazluki invested another.the second conviction was based on a wire transfer of to till lux on october.lux had recovering the,he subsequently convinced many of his friends to invest in black diamond.lux also continued to withdraw money from black diamond,and ultimately turned a small profit on his investment.simmons contends that these payments did not involve proceeds of unlawful activity as required to constitute money laundering.
his argument relies on united states santos,a decision in which the supreme court reversed the convictions of a defendant convicted of both running an illegal gambling business and money laundering.santos gambling counts arose from his operation of an illegal lottery through a network of local bars and restaurants.the counts were based on payments by santos to the runners and collectors who helped operate the lottery,and to the lottery winners themselves.the lower court concluded that these payments involved the proceeds of operating an illegal lottery,and could therefore constitute grounds for convictions.
five members of the supreme court disagreed.a plurality concluded that the term proceeds in the statute was ambiguous it could mean either receipts or profits and invoked the rule of lenity to resolve the ambiguity in favor of the defendant.id.at plurality opinion.the plurality thus concluded that the statute only covers transactions involving profits of criminal activity.id.at.
in rejecting the statute broader interpretation,the plurality found that construing proceeds to mean receipts would create a merger problem.id.at.the plurality explained that those who run illegal gambling businesses must necessarily pay their accomplices and the lottery winners.if a defendant could commit money laundering merely by paying the expenses of his illegal activity,all illegal gambling businesses would involve money laundering,and the government could punish a defendant twice for an offense that congress intended to punish only once.id.at.
this merger problem,the plurality noted,is not limited to illegal gambling.writing for the plurality,justice scalia explained 
few crimes are entirely free of cost,and costs are not always paid in advance.anyone who pays for the costs of a crime with its proceeds for example,the felon who uses the stolen money to pay for the rented getaway car would violate the statute.and any crime with multiple participants would become money laundering when the initial recipient of the wealth gives his confederates their shares.generally speaking,any specified unlawful activity,an episode of which includes transactions which are not elements of the offense and in which a participant passes receipts on to someone else,would merge with money laundering.
id.at.the plurality concluded that interpreting proceeds to mean profits would resolve the merger problem by ensuring that defendants can not be convicted of money laundering merely for paying the essential expenses of the predicate crime.id.at.
justice scalia devoted much of the plurality opinion to challenging the dissent prediction that applying the profits interpretation would undermine the viability of the very cases that money laundering statutes principally target,that is,cases involving criminal operations that continue over a substantial period of time.santos,at alito,dissenting.the dissent warned that,following the plurality approach,the statute could not reach criminal enterprises in which the distinction between payments of essential expenses and payments dispensing criminal profits may often be unclear.but the plurality dismissed the dissent concerns as baseless.according to the plurality,determining the lifespan of a criminal enterprise,for purposes of evaluating whether the enterprise produced profits,would raise no difficulties because an enterprise lasts as long as the government chooses to charge.id.at plurality opinion.because the government selects the lifespan of the predicate crime,it must prove that payments charged as money laundering during that lifespan involved profits,rather than essential expenses,of the predicate crime.id.
justice stevens provided the crucial fifth vote to reverse santos convictions,but did not endorse the plurality view that proceeds always means profits.rather,justice stevens concluded that courts should resolve the scope of the term proceeds on a basis by reference to congressional intent.id.at stevens,concurring.justice stevens grounded his conclusion on the merger problem identified by the plurality.he concluded that using funds earned through an illegal lottery business to pay the essential expenses of that business can not constitute money laundering.id.at.and he agreed with the plurality that there was no explanation for why congress would have wanted a transaction that is a normal part of a crime it had duly considered and appropriately punished elsewhere in the criminal code,to radically increase the sentence for that crime.id.justice stevens concluded that congress could not have intended such a perverse result.id.
congress amended the statute in may that amendment effectively overruled santos,defining proceeds to include gross receipts.fraud enforcement and recovery act of,f,stat,codified at c.however,because the amendment was not enacted at the time of the conduct giving rise to simmons convictions,this expanded definition of proceeds does not apply in this case.we are therefore called on to wade into the murky santos waters,as we have in three previous published opinions.
in united states halstead,we considered the reach of santos in the context of a defendant convicted of healthcare fraud and money laundering.cir.halstead fraud convictions arose from his scheme to capitalize on his patients healthcare benefits by making phony medical diagnoses.his conviction,by contrast,arose from his transfer of the illicit gains into his personal bank account.he claimed that santos prohibited his conviction because transferring his gains into his own coffers constituted an essential expense of operating his healthcare fraud.santos,at stevens,concurring.
to resolve halstead argument we first examined what,exactly,santos held a task complicated by the fractured disposition.relying on marks united states,we interpreted santos narrowly to bind lower courts only in cases where illegal gambling constituted the predicate for the defendant conviction.halstead,at.but,because the merger problem provided the driving force behind both the plurality and justice stevens opinions,we recognized that santos compelled us to construe the statute so as to avoid punishing a defendant twice for the same offense.id.at.we concluded that a defendant can not be convicted of money laundering merely for paying the essential expenses of operating the underlying crime.id.at quotation marks omitted.but if the financial transactions of the predicate offense are different from the transactions prosecuted as money laundering no merger problem arises.id.at.
applying this rule to halstead,we held that no merger problem tainted his conviction.his healthcare fraud was complete as soon as he received the healthcare reimbursements.transferring these reimbursements into his own account thereafter constituted an altogether separate offense that the government properly prosecuted as money laundering.id.at.
after halstead,we twice returned to santos and its elusive merger problem.in united states cloud,we considered a defendant convicted of mortgage fraud for fraudulently luring into making bad investments and money laundering for paying kickbacks to the accomplices who helped him locate his victims.cir.we reversed cloud convictions,concluding that the kickbacks constituted essential expenses of the scheme because cloud mortgage fraud depended on the help of others,and their help,in turn,depended upon payments from cloud.id.at.because cloud scheme could not have succeeded without the kickbacks,we held that convicting him separately for these transactions would present the very same merger problem identified in santos.id.at.
a few months ago,in united states abdulwahab,we again relied on santos to reverse a defendant convictions.cir.abdulwahab had committed an elaborate investment fraud,and the jury convicted him of money laundering based on payments he made to his to carry out that fraud.id.at.as in cloud,we found that these payments were for services that played a critical role in the underlying fraud scheme because they persuaded confederates to participate in the crime.id.at.abdulwahab resembled the paradigmatic felon,recognized by the santos plurality,who uses stolen money to pay for the rented getaway car.id.we therefore concluded that the same merger problem presented in santos barred his convictions.id.
simmons argues that santos,halstead,cloud,and abdulwahab require that we reverse his convictions.he claims that his payments to investors did not involve proceeds of criminal activity but rather essential expenses of maintaining his ponzi scheme.and he maintains that convicting him separately of money laundering for payments that were essential to accomplishing his fraud would raise the same fatal merger problem identified in santos.the government,by contrast,argues that simmons fraud did not depend on payments to investors and that these payments were not essential to the fraud.the government therefore maintains that simmons convictions should be affirmed.
after considering the record in this case,the parties arguments,and controlling law,we conclude that simmons convictions can not stand.the evidence admitted at simmons trial irrefutably established that the ongoing success of his ponzi scheme depended on payments to earlier investors,including those payments charged in the counts.
the evidence against simmons confirmed the commonsense notion that people generally do not send money into unproven investment schemes without some evidence that they will see their money again.early payments from simmons provided his victims with just such evidence.thus,the million dollars that simmons paid to early investors was essential to perpetuating the fraud scheme that ultimately earned him more than million.indeed,james bazluki the victim whose payment formed the basis of simmons first count testified that the fact that he was able to request money out of the account convinced him that this was a good place to have his money and prompted him to make further investments.and till lux whose payment formed the basis of simmons other count testified that the fact that he was able to withdraw from his account made him percent confident in his investment,convinced him that his gains were not just on paper,and made him encourage his friends to invest.in sum,the very victims who received the payments that formed the basis for simmons charges unequivocally testified to the critical importance of those payments in fostering the misplaced confidence necessary to perpetuate the fraud.
that simmons fraud continued for five months after the payments to existing investors stopped does not alter this fact.when payments ceased in july,simmons managed to attract only one new investor.and,as soon as the payments ceased,existing investors started demanding the answers that led to the scheme prompt unraveling.that simmons managed,through lies and dissembling,to extend a fraud that had endured for more than two years for an additional five months without paying any new returns to investors does not prove that those payments were unnecessary to the scheme.if anything,the rapid unraveling of the ponzi scheme when the payments ceased suggests just the opposite.
furthermore,we note that throughout its prosecution of this case,the government itself treated the payments to investors as essential to simmons fraud.the superseding indictment characterized the wire fraud offense as including transfers to wire ponzi payment to investors and to their intermediaries in other states the very transactions that the government later prosecuted as money laundering.and in its closing argument,the government contended that payments to investors were necessary to the fraud because they g a ve the investors confidence that their investment was sound and induce d them to put even more money back into the scheme.the government explained that the payments were one of the ways the defendant kept the scheme going.
in addition to the evidence proving that this particular ponzi scheme relied on payments to early investors,such payments are understood to constitute essential features of ponzi schemes.in fact,we have defined a ponzi scheme as one in which early investors are paid off with money received from later investors in order to prevent discovery and to encourage additional and larger investments.united states loayza,cir.the oxford english dictionary similarly defines a ponzi scheme as a form of fraud in which belief in the success of a enterprise is fostered by payment of quick returns to first investors using money invested by others.ponzi scheme,oxford english dictionary.
given these definitions,it is hardly surprising that the only other appellate court to decide a case involving a operator convicted of both fraud and money laundering has reached the same conclusion as we do.in united states van alstyne,the ninth circuit reversed the defendant convictions on the ground that the payments of purported returns to early investors were inherent to the defendant underlying scheme to defraud,cir.the court concluded that the convictions suffered from a merger problem because the very nature of a ponzi scheme require s some payments to investors for it to be at all successful.id.at.
finally,we note that when congress amended the statute in to include gross receipts within the law definition of proceeds,the senate report acknowledged that ponzi scheme payments could not be prosecuted as money laundering under the existing statute.the report bluntly stated that,given the santos court interpretation of the existing statute,the proceeds of ponzi schemes like the bernard madoff case,which by their very nature do not include any profit,would be out of the reach of the money laundering statutes,at.of course,the senate interpretation of supreme court case law does not bind us.it does,however,accord with our conclusion that payments of purported returns to early investors are understood to constitute essential expenses of ponzi schemes rather than transactions dispensing a ponzi scheme profits.
the government concedes that this case involves a difficult issue,gov t br.at,but nonetheless contends that we must affirm.the government raises three principal arguments as to why simmons convictions present no merger problem.
first,the government contends that simmons returns to investors constitute the reinvestment of profit to finance future fraud rather than essential expenses of an ongoing fraud.gov t br.at.although the line between using criminal profits to finance a future fraud and using gross receipts to pay the expenses of an ongoing fraud is less than,see santos,at alito,dissenting,santos both requires us to draw this line and offers useful guidance as to where the line falls in this case.
santos gambling scheme and simmons ponzi scheme resemble each other in virtually all material respects.both constituted ongoing schemes rather than discrete criminal transactions.the indictments in both cases charged underlying conduct that spanned a number of years rather than a single illegal act.and both schemes required occasional payments to third parties to sustain the crime during its lifespan.
santos paid his lottery winners,presumably hoping that reliable paydays would induce winners,losers,and new players alike to test their luck during the next round of play.of course,santos could have declined to pay his winners and instead pocketed the cash.had he done so,however,his gambling scheme would have been it could not have lasted the six years charged in the indictment.a majority of the supreme court therefore agreed that santos payments to winners did not amount to the reinvestment of profit to finance new,discrete gambling crimes.rather,these payments constituted expenses necessary to further a crime that,by its very nature,required periodic payments to survive.
the same is true in this case.like a bookie who pays his winners in the hopes of attracting new and repeat gamblers during the course of an ongoing lottery,simmons paid early investors in the hopes of attracting new and repeat investors during the course of an ongoing fraud.although simmons could have absconded with the early investors money before paying any returns,had he done so,his scheme certainly could not have lasted for the nearly period charged in the indictment.see santos,at plurality opinion a criminal enterprise profitability must be proved for as long as the government chooses to charge.
given this case similarity to santos,we must decline the government invitation to divide simmons ponzi scheme into a successive series of past,present,and future frauds.rather,santos requires that we hold that simmons ponzi scheme,like the lottery scheme in santos,represented a single,ongoing enterprise that the defendant could sustain only by making limited payouts.
the government next argues that payments to innocent third parties rather than to coconspirators can not constitute essential expenses of a criminal scheme.the government notes that in both cloud and abdulwahab,the payments we deemed to be essential were made to the defendant criminal accomplices rather than to innocent outsiders like simmons ponzi victims.according to the government,while paying one accomplices is a typical expense of criminal activity akin to paying for a rented getaway car,paying investors in order to maintain a ponzi scheme is a different matter entirely.
this argument ignores the very facts of santos itself.in santos,payments to runners,collectors,and lottery winners formed the basis of the defendant convictions.at.although the runners and collectors were accomplices to santos crime,the lottery winners were not manifestly,the supreme court therefore did not believe that the merger problem arises only when the defendant pays his or accomplices.see santos,at plurality opinion since few lotteries,if an
