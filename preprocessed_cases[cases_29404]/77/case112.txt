opinion of the court 
the government appeals the sentencing calculations and downward departures from the sentencing guidelines ranges for defendants found guilty of fraud.a criminal jury convicted faridah ali also known as rita spicer and her daughter lakiha spicer together,defendants for using a school to obtain federal funds for classes that were never conducted.at sentencing,the district court applied a standard to determine loss amounts far below the ones the government had urged under a standard.the court then looked to good works and community support along with other factors to depart downward from the suggested guidelines ranges.defendants received no prison time.instead,the court sentenced each defendant to some term of probation with periods of confinement and restitution payments in line with its determination of the loss amounts.
the issues presented to us are whether the court erred in its initial guidelines calculations,whether it relied on inappropriate factors for its downward departures,and whether the resulting sentences were unreasonable.we conclude yes for all three issues and remand for further proceedings.
ii.factual and procedural background 
the community college of philadelphia the college or ccp is a public college that obtained a federal grant from the department of education to provide adult basic education abe classes.in addition to classes,the terms of the grant required the college to conduct classes at approved neighborhood sites in philadelphia.under the arrangement,ccp paid per month in rent for these sites plus salaries for qualified teachers,those who had completed at least a bachelor degree.one of the approved abe sites was the sister clara muhammad school the school in west philadelphia,a private school.
between and,this program was a fa√ßade.the school and ccp personnel maintained all the trappings of a functioning and paying teachers,establishing a course schedule,filing registration forms,and causing ccp to pay rent to the school for the classrooms.but no courses were taught.rather,faridah ali,assistant director of education at the school,and delores weaver,director of the abe program at ccp,led a fraudulent scheme to steal the money allocated to the program.specifically,they submitted false student registration forms to ccp,thereby ensuring that it would make salary and rent payments to the school for a certain number of classes.ali and weaver divided the rent payments between themselves and arranged for salaries to go to ghost teachers,many of them unqualified,for courses that never took place.ali children,lakiha and azheem spicer,and weaver son,eugene weaver iii,were some of the ghost teachers who received money through this scheme.
in,ali and the spicers lakiha and azheem were tried and convicted on several counts of fraud by a federal jury in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania the grand jury indictment specified that ali and weaver had fraudulently obtained over,and lakiha spicer,but the verdict slip did not designate loss amounts.those amounts were to be determined at sentencing 
between the jury verdict and the time of sentencing in,the supreme court issued united states booker,d,making sweeping changes to federal sentencing.united states davis,cir.booker sever ed and excis ed the portions of the united states code that made the united states sentencing guidelines mandatory on sentencing and appellate courts.at.see also b,e.it then set a reasonableness standard of appellate review to this guidelines scheme.at.booker did not,however,decide the required standard of proof for finding facts relevant to sentencing.see united states grier,cir en banc.
at sentencing,the judge stated his view that the loss amounts should be calculated by evidence proved beyond a reasonable doubt.the government argued that booker required only proof by a preponderance of the evidence.however,the judge maintained his view,stating 
the question then becomes,under calculating the guideline range,what was the amount of money that is properly chargeable as having been obtained by fraud.i persist in the view that this is a it affects the guideline s calculation in an upward way,that this is issue which should be resolved as the g uideline s range is concerned,it has to be found beyond a reasonable doubt i confess to considerable doubt as to exactly what the amount of loss was in each case.
as noted below in more detail,the judge determined that the presentence report psr likely had overstated the amount of funds fraudulently obtained.for ali he calculated the guidelines sentencing range according to his determination of the loss amount proved beyond a reasonable doubt,and for spicer based on the perjury conviction he further departed downward from those advisory ranges based on four factors records of public service and community support for both defendants,the lack of an initial intent to defraud for both,the minor role played by lakiha spicer,and the exculpatory no doctrine in lakiha spicer case he sentenced ali to five years probation with confinement for the first year,restitution payments of,and a special assessment of.he sentenced spicer to four years probation with confinement for the first six months,restitution payments of,and a special assessment of.
in appealing these sentences,the government contends that the district court erred by applying a standard to determine the loss amounts for both defendants,resulting in erroneous guidelines calculations.it also argues that the court relied on impermissible factors to depart downward for both defendants.in this context,the government maintains the final sentences were unreasonable 
iii.standard of review 
we review sentences for reasonableness.booker,at.see also grier,at.booker attempt ed no elaborate discussion of the reasonableness standard,cunningham california,d,but the supreme court recently clarified its meaning.reasonableness review merely asks whether the trial court abused its discretion in calculating and applying the guidelines.rita united states,d see also id.at.at stevens,concurring simply stated,booker replaced the de novo standard of review required by e with an standard that we called reasonableness review.
rita,which allowed appellate courts to apply a nonbinding presumption of reasonableness to sentences,did not set standards governing range sentences like those before us.see id.at.at however,it did note that the reasonableness presumption applies only to sentences without suggesting an unreasonableness presumption to sentences.id.at.at.it also emphasized that the reasonableness presumption applies to appellate review only it does not affect the ordinary sentencing process that a district court judge must undertake.id.at.at.
we have interpreted booker to require the following three steps in the ordinary sentencing process 
courts must continue to calculate a defendant guidelines sentence precisely as they would have before booker.
in doing so,they must formally rule on the motions of both parties and state on the record whether they are granting a departure and how that departure affects the guidelines calculation,and take into account our circuit case law,which continues to have advisory force.
finally,they are required to exercise their discretion by considering the relevant a factors in setting the sentence they impose regardless whether it varies from the sentence calculated under the guidelines.

iv.discussion 
step one guidelines.initial calculation 
as we have noted repeatedly,sentencing c ourts must continue to calculate a defendant guidelines sentence precisely as they would have before booker.gunter,at citing king,at cooper,at see also grier,at district courts must still conduct the full guidelines analysis in every case.nothing in rita changed this requirement.to the contrary,rita affirmed our approach,emphasizing that the sentencing process will normally begin by considering the presentence report and its interpretation of the guidelines.at.at.
in calculating the guidelines sentence,we have explained that,a s before booker,the standard of proof under the guidelines for sentencing facts continues to be preponderance of the evidence.cooper,at we have further determined that our court will continue to review factual findings relevant to the guidelines for clear error and to exercise plenary review over a district court interpretation of the guidelines.grier,at united states fred cooper,cir a finding is clearly erroneous when although there is evidence to support it,the reviewing body on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.concrete pipe prods.of,constr.laborers pension trust for,d internal quotation marks and brackets omitted.when a sentencing court clearly errs in making factual findings,the resulting sentence will generally be deemed unreasonable and,subject to the doctrines of plain and harmless error,will result in remand to the district court for resentencing.grier,at see also booker,at.united states miller,cir this court has taken the position that booker sentencing issues raised on direct appeal are best determined by the district courts in the first instance.
in calculating the recommended guidelines range for ali,the district judge rejected a preponderance standard for the loss calculation,and instead announced his intention to calculate the sentencing range according to his assessment of the loss amount proved beyond reasonable doubt the psr for ali specified a base offense level of six under for violation of.it alleged that she and her misappropriated a total of and that she and delores weaver were jointly and severally responsible for of that amount.it thus added points pursuant to b g for a loss amount of over but under and another four points for ali major role in the offense pursuant to a.this yielded a total offense level of coupled with a criminal offense category of i,for which the guidelines advise a range of months imprisonment.the court rejected the psr calculation.as noted,the court did not state a finding of an exact loss amount,but ordered ali to pay in restitution.this amount requires a addition to the base offense level pursuant to b c for a loss amount of over but under.the judge adopted the psr determination that the base offense level was six,and having made his own determination of loss amount yielding the,he presumably agreed that ali major role warranted another enhancement.added together,this yielded a total offense level of,which,in conjunction with a criminal history category of i,corresponds to a month recommended imprisonment range.
with respect to spicer,the district court calculated the guidelines range sentence based on the perjury offense section of the guidelines specifies a base offense level of for violation of.as there were no specific offense characteristics or adjustments applicable to this offense was also the total offense level.coupled with a criminal history category of i,this total offense level corresponds to a month recommended imprisonment range.
to reiterate,the appropriate burden for finding sentencing facts here is by a preponderance of the evidence.see grier,at.loss amount is a sentencing fact a specific offense characteristic,so it must be found by a preponderance of the evidence.the court need only make a reasonable estimate of the loss,app.c see also united states evans,cir.
by employing a standard rather than a preponderance standard in calculating the guidelines at step one,the judge here erred.he also failed to specify even a reasonable estimate of the loss amount for each defendant.each of these three mistakes is legal error,rendering the resulting sentence unreasonable.as a result,we vacate the sentence and remand 
constitutional claims 
defendants argue that the standard as applied here was correct,because to allow proof by a preponderance standard would raise constitutional concerns.
sixth amendment 
we have noted supra note that the sentencing judge believed that,because of blakely,any sentencing enhancements sought by the government based on loss amount implicated defendants sixth amendment guarantee to trial by an impartial jury in criminal cases.this,he concluded,required the facts that support those enhancements to be proved to a jury with evidence beyond a reasonable doubt.
however,other than the fact of a prior conviction,almendareztorres united states,d,any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury,and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.apprendi,at.see also grier,at.in other words,the right to proof beyond a reasonable doubt attaches only when the sentencing facts at issue have the effect of increasing the maximum statutory punishment to which the defendant is exposed.grier,at citing apprendi,at.
differing loss amounts raise no such problem.after booker,the statutory maximum to which apprendi and blakely refer is the maximum punishment in the for a certain crime.section of title,under which ali was sentenced,sets a maximum fine and imprisonment term of or years,respectively,or both,for convictions of fraud that do not involve a financial institution as here.section,under which spicer was sentenced,permits violators to be fined and sets a maximum imprisonment term of five years,or both,for perjury convictions.the recommended guidelines range sentences for ali fall far below years,whether the loss amount is calculated according to evidence proved by a preponderance months or beyond a reasonable doubt months.likewise,the recommended sentence for spicer falls far below the statutory maximum.
the judge here was mistaken as to what blakely requires to show sentencing facts.this mistake led to his erroneous calculation of the guidelines range.because the differing loss amounts do not increase defendants sentences beyond the statutory maximums,there is no sixth amendment concern here with applying a preponderance standard for the sentencing calculation.
fifth amendment 
defendants argue that the due process clause of the fifth amendment requires sentencing enhancements to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.following the briefing and argument of this case,however,an en banc majority of our court considered this precise contention and rejected it.see grier,at by excising the provisions of the united states code requiring mandatory application of the united states sentencing guidelines,the supreme court in booker altered the constitutional impact of the guidelines.none of the facts relevant to enhancements or departures under the guidelines can increase the maximum punishment to which the defendant is exposed.the due process clause thus affords no right to have these facts proved beyond a reasonable doubt.internal citations omitted.we follow suit.
constitutional avoidance 
defendants also point to these same constitutional concerns to urge us to apply the doctrine of constitutional avoidance and read the guidelines to require proof beyond a reasonable doubt.see jones united states,d w here a statute is susceptible of two constructions,by one of which grave and doubtful constitutional questions arise and by the other of which such questions are avoided,our duty is to adopt the latter.quoting united states ex rel.att y hudson.this canon is here because it applies to statutory interpretation only where there is doubt whether an otherwise acceptable construction of a statute would raise serious constitutional problems.edward debartolo florida gulf coast const.trades council,d.because there is no constitutional doubt,defendants arguments do not alter our conclusion that the judge committed legal error because he failed to apply the preponderance standard to determine the loss amount.
step two departure determinations 
legal framework 
similar to our approach at step one,we require that the entirety of the guidelines calculation be done correctly,including rulings on guidelines departures at step two.united states jackson,cir see also gunter,at king,at cooper,at.as with our conclusion concerning the proper standard of proof for finding sentencing facts,generally there is every reason to believe that the supreme court intended that the practices that have guided us and other courts in the twenty years since the guidelines were first promulgated would continue to govern sentencing in the federal courts.grier,at.booker itself suggested as much,at.discussing the past two decades of appellate practice in cases involving departures,as did rita,at.at noting that,after calculating the guidelines,the sentencing judge may hear arguments by prosecution or defense that the guidelines sentence should not apply,perhaps because,inter alia,as the guidelines themselves foresee the case at hand falls outside the heartland to which the commission intends individual guidelines to apply.
thus sentencing courts should continue to treat each sentencing factor as carving out a heartland,a set of typical cases embodying the conduct that each guideline describes.cmt.b see also united states sweeting,cir.where the defendant conduct falls outside the heartland of cases,a district court may determine whether a departure is appropriate.united states iannone,cir see also sweeting,at.the guidelines permit departures from the prescribed sentencing range in cases in which the judge finds that there exists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind,or to a degree,not adequately taken into consideration by the sentencing commission in formulating the guidelines that should result in a sentence different from that described.booker,at.quoting b sweeting,at.
in koon united states,the supreme court outlined what is required of sentencing courts when considering a departure from the applicable guidelines range,d.in applying the koon analysis,we have described the process as follows 
first,identify the factor or factors that potentially take the case outside the guidelines heartland and make it special or unusual.second,determine whether the guidelines forbid departures based on the factor,encourage departures based on the factor,or do not mention the factor at all.third,apply the appropriate rule if the factor is forbidden,the court can not use it as a basis for departure if the factor is encouraged,the court is authorized to depart if the applicable guideline does not already take it into account if the factor is discouraged,or encouraged but already taken into account by the applicable guideline,the court should depart only if the factor is present to an exceptional degree,or in some other way makes the case different from the ordinary case in which the factor is present or if the factor is unmentioned,the court must,after considering the structure and theory of both relevant individual guidelines and the guidelines taken as a whole,decide whether the factor is sufficient to take the case out of the guideline heartland.
united states serafini,cir quoting iannone,at.
in our review of these sentences for reasonableness,we assess the extent to which the sentencing court followed the proper procedures to depart at step two from the recommended sentencing range.jackson,at.that query includes consideration of whether the factors relied on by the district court are appropriate bases for departure,kikumura,at brackets original,citations and quotation marks omitted jackson,at.
here the sentencing judge identified four bases for his departure downward from the initial guidelines calculations defendants good works and community support,their lack of an initial intent to defraud,spicer minor role,and the exculpatory no doctrine in spicer case.we evaluate each according to the criteria of koon,with particular emphasis on the first works and community which the judge and the parties rely most.
good works and community support 
the judge stated that a downward departure was appropriate largely because of defendants exemplary record of public service and charitable works,as demonstrated by the tremendous outpouring of public support.app.at 
public service and good works are discouraged bases for departures.see military,civic,charitable,or public service contributions and similar prior good works are not ordinarily relevant in determining whether a departure is warranted.fred cooper,at.under the koon analysis,the court should have departed only if the works were exceptional.serafini,at see also fred cooper,at.
exceptional works involve acts that are both substantial and personal in nature.id.at.they are evaluated with reference to the offender wealth and status in life.more is expected of those who enjoy sufficient income and community status,as they have the opportunities to engage in charitable and benevolent activities.id.at citations and quotation marks omitted.notably,in passing the protect act which stands for prosecutorial remedies and other tools to end the exploitation of children today,in,congress has expressed a disinclination towards leniency for white collar criminals and its frustration with the fact that these defendants receive probation more often than other offenders who commit crimes of comparable severity.id.at sloviter,dissenting citations omitted.for this reason,exceptional,as applied to charitable works,is a hard standard to meet,united states wright,cir,and thus it is applied in very few cases 
in fred cooper,the district court received letters pleading for leniency because of cooper charitable donations and activities.at.the judge granted a downward departure on that basis,and sentenced cooper to six months house arrest and another months probation,expressing his belief that cooper community and charitable activities have been truly exceptional,and that just not the amount of money he spent on the things,but also the amount of personal effort,and work,and help that he has given to so many people.id.at.
we affirmed,noting that cooper acts were 
not the detached acts of charity one might ordinarily expect from a wealthy business executive.they were,in a very real way,personal sacrifices,which have had a dramatic and personal impact on the lives of others.in addition,when compared with a defendant who received a downward departure based on good works,cooper fares well.
id.at citations omitted.for support,we cited serafini,which affirmed a downward departure for a politician convicted for violating election finance laws and perjury because of the personal nature of several exceptional community works,as described in several letters written to the sentencing judge asking for leniency.at,see also united states woods,cir upholding a downward departure for defendant charitable activities,including bringing two troubled young women into her home 
the record here contains a number of attestations to the charitable acts of ali mainly and spicer.it also notes that ali received numerous citations and awards from the likes of mayor edward rendell currently the governor of pennsylvania,the pennsylvania house of representatives,and the city of philadelphia,between and.in addition,several witnesses testified regarding ali good works at the sentencing hearing,and individuals wrote letters to the sentencing judge on behalf of ali and her children.
a review of the testimony and the letters shows that ali charitable works consisted largely of her financial generosity,a few personal charitable actions,and duties carried out in the course of her employment at the school.the letters praise spicer for being a citizen generally and sometimes helping at the school.regardless whether we agree with the sentencing judge assessment,we find it within the bounds of reason that he observed that ali partook in the type of sustained and personal acts that would warrant a departure under 
but there are of charity of a sustained and personal nature with regard to spicer.most acts described seem ordinary,in that they occurred in the course of work with the school or family members and involved no special sacrifice.thus we can not conclude that spicer actions here met the definition of exceptional or that a departure for good works for either defendant would align easily with the guidelines advice to the contrary or with congressional policy of not privileging prominent citizens by allowing them to avoid prison time.
for charitable works to justify a departure,they must work in tandem with other valid departure factors,the possibility of which is called into question in the discussion below.see united states tomko,cir concluding that the charitable works alone did not justify a downward variance.accordingly,we urge the judge on remand to provide detailed explanation as to why the record justifies a departure for either or both of the defendants.
no initial intent to defraud 
the judge next expressed his view that defendants were individuals who had no intention initially to defraud the government section of the guidelines makes no mention of fraud that was not intentional at the outset,no doubt because intent to defraud is an element of the crime itself.in that circumstance,under koon a court should consider the structure and theory of the guidelines pertaining to fraud and the guidelines as a whole to determine whether the facts are sufficient to take the case out of the guidelines heartland.serafini,at.the court here engaged in no such structural or analogic analysis.if it had,it likely would have determined that the structure of indicates that this case of fraud was average because this section focuses on the loss amounts accompanying actual convictions for fraud,rather than whether intent to defraud existed at the outset.
the judge quarrel seems to be not with the culpability for which there is a jury the duration of the fraudulent scheme and thus the appropriate loss amount associated with that scheme.in our view,it is inappropriate to consider intent as a departure factor because of doubts about loss amount,particularly when,as here,the crime of conviction already specified an intent element moreover,there is nothing to suggest that any lack of intent if it were an appropriate ground for sufficient to take this outside of the heartland under the koon analysis for unmentioned factors.as such,we can not affirm the downward departure on the ground of a lack of an initial intent to defraud.
minor role 
the judge determined that spicer played a minor role in this scheme,further justifying a downward departure.it true,he stated,that lakiha and azheem spicer did receive the money.but at least with respect to the people who were behind arranging matters so that the matter would continue to flow,even though no classes were being held,i do think these defendants are chargeable with that aspect of it.app.at.minor role is not a departure factor.instead,it is an adjustment under the guidelines calculation at step one,which provides for a reduction from the offense level for defendants less culpable than most other participants,but whose role can not be described as minimal.see app.note.
applying the koon analysis,the district court should have concluded that this factor is encouraged but already taken into account by the applicable guideline,and calls for a depart ure only if the factor is present to an exceptional degree,or in some other way makes the case different from the ordinary case in which the factor is present.serafini,at citations omitted.the court failed to outline whether or how the minor role was exceptional.it thus should not have granted a downward departure on this basis.
exculpatory no doctrine 
finally,the judge determined that the exculpatory no doctrine warranted a lower sentence for spicer with respect to her perjury charge.he reasoned that the perjury that she committed was not much different from a simple denial of guilt,and therefore is not traditionally regarded as a punishable perjury.app.at,spicer sentencing hr g.
a downward departure from the guidelines range for perjury could have been appropriate only if the sentencing court found that the circumstances were such as to remove spicer perjury from the heartland of perjury cases.spicer was convicted under of knowingly making a false statement under oath to the grand jury investigating the ccp fraud scheme.when asked whether she actually taught on site at the school for every hour for which she was paid by the ccp,spicer responded,yes.the jury found that this statement was made under oath,that it was false,and that it was material to whether a fraud against the government had been committed.this would appear to put it squarely within the perjury cases.we fail to see how the fact that spicer lie tended to be exculpatory from her perspective moves it beyond the heartland.there are undoubtedly many perjury convictions that arise from false testimony tending to exculpate the defendant a downward departure from the guidelines range was,accordingly,error.
in sum,none of the factors on which the district judge relied presented a mitigating circumstance of a kind,or to a degree,not adequately taken into consideration by the sentencing commission in formulating the guidelines that should result in a sentence different from that described.b.good works and community service are discouraged factors under the guidelines,and in any event the judge has not explained how ali spicer charitable activities were so exceptional,as we have interpreted that term in serafini and fred cooper,as to warrant a downward departure,particularly if they constitute the sole valid departure factor.lack of fraudulent intent is unmentioned,but it seems implausible that it should be considered at this stage because intent was an element of the conviction for which defendants are to be sentenced under the guidelines.even if lack of intent were to be considered,there is nothing on this record indicating that the sentence for fraud here was outside the heartland of fraud cases.minor participation has already been taken into account by the guidelines reduction,and there is nothing to suggest that spicer level of culpability is so exceptionally low as to warrant a downward departure.the exculpatory no doctrine has no place here,as spicer perjured herself before the grand jury.for these reasons,we conclude further explanation regarding charitable judge erred in granting downward departures on these grounds 
step relevant a factors 
at step three,a sentencing court must state in open court the reasons for its imposition of the particular sentence,c,particularly where,as here,it chooses to var y significantly from the advisory guidelines range united states kononchuk,cir.there are no magic words that it must invoke when doing so.cooper,at see also rita,at.at the appropriateness of brevity or length,conciseness or detail,when to write,what to say,depends upon circumstances.rather,we require courts generally to give meaningful consideration to the relevant a factors,gunter,at quoting cooper,at quotation marks and brackets omitted,and state adequate reasons for a sentence on the record so that this court can engage in meaningful appellate review.king,at.where a court varies,and a party has raised cogent objections with legal merit that the variance is unjustified by the record,we require the court to explain why the variance is justified,with explanations of the relevant sentencing factors that go beyond mere formalism.kononchuk,at see also jackson,at.though the supreme court has not yet ruled on how sentencing judges must approach range sentences after booker,it signaled agreement with our approach 
while range sentences will not necessarily require a lengthy explanation,w here the defendant or prosecutor presents nonfrivolous reasons for imposing a different sentence the judge will normally go further and explain why he has rejected those arguments where the judge imposes a sentence outside the guidelines,the judge will explain why he has done so.
rita,at.at.
here,the judge analysis was flawed.the principal error occurred with respect to factor a,which requires meaningful consideration of the advisory guidelines range for a conviction.we have outlined above why the application of a standard to determining the loss amount was legal error,and how that error resulted in an erroneous guidelines calculation at step one.we have also explained how the judge erred at step two when he relied on inappropriate or factors to support his decision to depart downward.with an incorrectly calculated guidelines range and an improper departure determination,the judge necessarily was unable meaningfully to consider the recommended guidelines range as required by a.put simply,the preliminary errors at steps one and two tainted the step three analysis and resulting sentence 
the judge concerns throughout this sentencing process revolved around his view that loss amounts drive sentences in contexts like these,and he apparently did not believe that the amounts alleged by the government reflect accurately the offense for which defendants are culpable.the principal issue here,then,concerns a situation where a sentencing fact drives the guidelines sentences,but the judge has reservations about the strength of the evidence.here,he doubted that the evidence of loss applied to the duration of the crime alleged by the government and thus doubted whether the evidence was strong enough to support the final range.booker afforded judges broad discretion to enter appropriate sentences in consideration of a factors but under grier it is not within a sentencing judge discretion to diverge from applying the evidence standard in the initial sentencing calculation at step one or employing appropriate departure factors at step two.in light of the calculation error and the flawed departure analysis at step two,we vacate both sentences and remand for resentencing.

at the end of trial,the judge asked the parties if they could agree on a loss amount.they could not.absent a stipulation,the judge believed that blakely washington,d,required that the loss amount be determined by a standard.he proposed two alternate ways of proceeding the court could schedule additional arguments and submit the question of the loss amount to the jury to determine,or the parties could agree that the sentencing judge would decide the loss amount on the basis of beyond a reasonable doubt and without bothering the jury.app.at trial tr.the government requested the former proposal,but the judge opted for the latter.
the judge stated that he had applied this standard in entering the final sentence,though he stated no specific determination of loss amount.see infra notes and accompanying text.
this judicially created doctrine provides an affirmative defense to perjury if the statements at issue amount to no more than a denial of criminal conduct in response to investigatory questioning by the government.united states barr,cir see infra part.
the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over this case pursuant to.we have jurisdiction over the government appeal under a and.
the supreme court is considering that question this term in gall united states,d.
the proper standard for finding facts relevant to sentences has been much contested since the sentencing reform act of,culminating in the apprendi line of cases leading up to booker.see blakely,at.ring arizona,d apprendi new jersey,d see also infra note.this issue was central in grier,which assessed the effect of booker on sentencing requirements and held that preponderance is the appropriate standard for sentencing calculations.grier recognized that a makes no mention of a burden of proof,and a provides only that a court may consider information without regard to its admissibility under the rules of evidence applicable at trial,provided that the information has sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy.grier,at.however,as the grier majority also stated,t he commentary that accompanies reads the commission believes that use of a preponderance of evidence standard is appropriate id.quoting cmt.id.it concluded on that basis that a reasonable doubt requirement would be contrary to congressional intent.see id.at sloviter,dissenting noting that,like the sentencing commission,the supreme court has discussed the appropriateness of a preponderance standard at sentencing without holding that it was a requirement.
subsection e of,which booker excised,imposed a clearly erroneous standard of review for factual findings under a mandatory guidelines scheme.see at.in grier we concluded that booker excision of the was a collateral result of the actions taken to remedy e impermissible references to a mandatory guidelines scheme,but that the clearly erroneous standard is still proper because it fills in the gap for review of particular factual determinations.grier,at citing unanimous agreement among the other ten courts of appeals to have addressed this issue.
as a preliminary matter,defendants argue that the government has waived its ability to appeal the sentencing determination because it failed to object to the sentencing judge application of the standard to determine the loss amount.we disagree.at the outset,our task is to resolve questions of law raised by a petitioner alleging that a district judge applied the wrong legal standard.while a party can waive his or her ability to appeal a ruling for failure to object,there can be no waiver here of the judge duty to apply the correct legal standard.moreover,even if we were to conclude that defendants argument should be evaluated under.requiring contemporaneous objections to preserve the right to appeal a district court ruling,we would conclude that the government has preserved this issue because it timely objected before the district court.app.at trial,sentencing,same united states mcculligan,cir.
though the judge never made an explicit finding as to loss amounts for any of the defendants,we presume that the restitution payments he ordered reflect his assessment of loss beyond a reasonable doubt.we call these figures the low loss amounts,and the figures calculated by the government in the psr which correspond to the amounts alleged by a preponderance of the evidence the high loss amounts.
in so doing,the judge rejected the psr use of the mail fraud conviction carrying a base offense level of six,which would have required him also to calculate spicer sentence based on loss amount.the psr alleged that spicer stole,and added eight points pursuant to b e for a loss amount of over but under,plus another two points pursuant to for obstruction of justice,the conviction for perjury to the grand jury during the investigation.had the judge applied the mail fraud conviction and calculated the loss,this would have resulted in a total offense level of,to a criminal history category of give an advisory guidelines range of months imprisonment.in rejecting the psr enhancement for amount of loss,the court determined that the total offense level for the mail fraud offense was lower than the total offense level for the perjury offense.the court did not make an explicit for spicer under,but ordered her to pay in restitution,which would have resulted in only a enhancement,yielding a total offense level of only base offense level of six for the mail fraud conviction plus a enhancement for loss amount and a enhancement for obstruction of justice.
amount of loss is not a specific offense characteristic for perjury.moreover,except in circumstances not applicable here,the obstruction of justice adjustment under does not apply to perjury offenses.see,app.note if the defendant is convicted of an offense covered by,this adjustment is not to be applied to the offense level for that offense except if a significant further obstruction occurred during the investigation,prosecution,or sentencing of the obstruction offense itself accord,app.note.finally,we note that the cross reference in c,which requires application of in certain cases involving obstruction of an investigation or prosecution of a criminal offense which occurred here,does not apply because the resulting offense level under that section is not greater than.
although we remand for resentencing to allow the court to correct the sentencing calculation at step one,we continue our analysis of its sentencing determinations at steps two and three in order to provide guidance on related issues that arose here and,in some instances,also were incorrectly applied.
the supreme court repeatedly has affirmed the apprendi rule,applying it in multiple contexts.see cunningham,at.at applied to facts permitting judges to elevate a sentence beyond a middle term in a state law booker,at.applied to facts triggering a sentencing range elevation under the federal guidelines blakely,at.applied to facts permitting a sentence in excess of the standard range in a state sentencing scheme ring,at.applied to facts subjecting a defendant to the death penalty see also rita,at.at recognizing the apprendi rule but noting that it does not invalidate the reasonableness presumption for sentences.
as the district judge here observed,blakely indicated that the statutory maximum punishment to which apprendi referred was the top of the guidelines range accompanying a guilty verdict based on facts proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.blakely,at.by making the guidelines advisory,booker transformed the maximums to those specified by congress in the,which identifies the elements of each offense and requires that only these facts be established beyond a reasonable doubt.booker,at.see also grier,at.the advisory guidelines regime still requires judicial factfinding to inform individual sentencing decisions and to help meet the sentencing commission of sentencing uniformity and proportionality,rita,at.at emphases in original omitted.but this requirement does not curtail a judge ability to exercise broad discretion in determining a final sentence at step three when taking into account the a factors.booker,at.grier,at.
in a dramatic moment at the sentencing hearings,defense counsel announced that he would like the court and the record to reflect the amount of people that have come into this courtroom for both lakiha and azheem spicer,and would ask them to rise,to get an type of accurate indication for the record.app.at.the judge duly noted that the full courtroom of over supporters stood up.app.at.
most appeals courts follow a similarly high standard when determining whether good works warrant a departure in analogous situations,united states crouse,cir no downward departure for extensive community involvement that spanned years because that was typical of business executives united states morken,cir no downward departure for a businessman who advised local business,hired youth,served on his church council,and raised money for charity united states rybicki,cir no downward departure for a highly decorated vietnam war veteran for saving an innocent civilian during the war and serving with the secret service united states mchan,cir no downward departure despite work history,family ties and responsibilities,plus sizable contributions to economic of defendant town.
the first circuit court of appeals has taken a different approach.in united states thurston,the district court departed downward from a prison sentence of months for a medicare fraud conviction on the basis of good works including taking family members and others into defendant home for several weeks,tithing of his income,and devoting several hours per week to community service,cir thurston i,vacated by,d for consideration in light of booker.the district court sentenced defendant william thurston to three months imprisonment with the recommendation that the time be served in a halfway house,months supervised release,and no fine.id.at.the first circuit court reversed,concluding that the departure was improper because thurston acts were not exceptional in light of the nature of the offense and his occupation as a wealthy corporate executive with the means to undertake significant charitable causes,and instructed the district court to apply the mandatory sentence.id.at.signaling our disagreement with the first circuit,we commented that,like serafini,the good works in thurston could also be construed as personal in nature,and thus that case would be more difficult to distinguish from fred cooper fred cooper,at citing thurston i,at.on resentencing,the district court again imposed essentially the same sentence,with the addition of a fine.the first circuit court again reversed the departure and remanded,this time with instructions to the district court to impose a sentence not less than months imprisonment under the guidelines scheme.united states thurston,cir thurston ii.thurston has filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the supreme court,which implicates concerns expected to be resolved by the supreme court this term in gall.see supra note.

in this regard,he stated b ased on the evidence presented at trial,as well as the arguments here today,it has always been clear to me that none of these defendants started out with the intention of defrauding anybody.what they started out with was an opportunity to get some money by teaching at the community college in this special program of outreach to the community t he outreach program,the adult education program,was very sloppily put together i have no doubt that,when the defendants were first hired by the community college,they,in good faith,expected to teach classes.and,they did start out teaching classes.and then,everybody who was supposed to be coming to the class lost enthusiasm,and the whole thing kind of fell apart.and,these defendants stayed in it too long and collected money they were entitled to.but it not the kind of case where people set out originally to defraud.at spicer sentencing hr g accord app.at ali sentencing hr g e verybody was well intentioned at the start they wanted to do some good in the community and saw this as an opportunity to finance the sister clara school to some extent and also to help the people in the community.undoubtedly,as i said before,there came a point when it should have been and obviously was apparent that this was a scam and was working out in the way it should have.
any such doubts are addressed more appropriately at step one,when estimating the loss amount,or at step three,when considering relevant a factors.for example,if the judge determined by a preponderance of evidence that the fraudulent intent occurred one year after the establishment of the program rather than for the entire period as alleged by the government,he would come up with a reasonable estimate of the loss amount from his estimate of the date on which defendants began the crime,and thus the date from which they were liable for losses to the government.we discuss the step three
