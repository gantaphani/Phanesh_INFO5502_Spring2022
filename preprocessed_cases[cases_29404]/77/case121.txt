the pc plaintiffs primary claim under cfaa was that defendant hack,without authorization and on behalf of defendant celebrations and defendant bailen,accessed pcc tomax computer system from his home times over seven days during october and november of.eight of the alleged incursions occurred after hack ceased working as a consultant to pc management additionally,plaintiffs claim that unauthorized access purportedly was gained again in december and a final time in april,when hack was no longer associated with any of the pc plaintiffs.
the access in december lasted a total of minutes.hack testified that he had a home office during his years with pcc and had been authorized to use his computer from home as proof,he offered demonstrating that he did so.he could not recall making this particular access but stated that he imagined it would have been for pc management business as he never accessed the tomax system for anything but pc management related work.the pc plaintiffs contested hack asserted authorization in their submissions.the april access was for a total of minutes and seconds,and hack testified that it appears to have been an automatic redial of the last call he had made to the pc lancaster store in december.there is a paucity of information as to precisely what could have been obtained from the system in these incursions,although the pc plaintiffs computer consultant,joseph savin,stated that reports could be ordered in a matter of seconds and then later,with a few keystrokes,downloaded and sent to a remote location.savini certification.
the pc plaintiffs averred that the defendants used the information obtained from this access to decide where to locate their stores,where to focus marketing efforts and budgets,and to obtain valuable information as to sales during the halloween season.they urge that by using this valuable information,defendants purportedly obtained an unfair competitive advantage.the pc plaintiffs specifically averred that defendants unauthorized access resulted in damage or loss to the pc plaintiffs of not less than within the meaning of cfaa.
the pc plaintiffs sought an injunction prohibiting celebrations from operating the celebrations stores and from using the pc plaintiffs trade secrets and confidential and proprietary information,and ordering the return of such information.they also averred that defendants conduct violated new jersey statutory and common law,entitling the pc plaintiffs to damages.
after limited discovery,the district court heard oral argument on the motion and expressed doubt that,which is primarily a criminal statute,provided for any civil relief.however,the district court reasoned that even if the statute were read to provide a civil remedy,the pc plaintiffs had failed to frame their claim as a claim under subsection a of,and thus were not entitled to injunctive relief under cfaa.further,the district court held that,even if a claim could properly be brought under subsection a of,the pc plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits of such a claim,because they had not shown what,if anything,was actually taken from the tomax system by defendants,nor for that matter,confirm with certainty that the incursions were inappropriate or outside the scope of a legitimate work purpose.trans.of op.at.
the court also ruled that the pc plaintiffs had not demonstrated that they would succeed under the related new jersey statute prohibiting certain computer incursions,or on the merits of their common law trade secret misappropriation claim.this latter finding was based on the pc plaintiffs failure to prove that the information in the tomax system was indeed entitled to protection as a trade secret and also because monetary damages would compensate for any injury,thus making injunctive relief inappropriate.

discussion 
denial of injunctive relief.
we will not disturb the district court ruling that if g is interpreted as providing a civil remedy,and injunctions in aid thereof,the pc plaintiffs failed to prove that they were likely to succeed on the merits of their claim because they failed to demonstrate any conduct on the part of defendants other than the alleged access which may or may not have been authorized.as the district court correctly found,there is absolutely no evidence as to what,if any,information was actually viewed,let alone taken.lacking such a showing,the elements of the causes of action brought by the pc plaintiffs can not succeed.
the federal and state law causes of action asserted by the pc plaintiffs have several elements.it is undisputed that the conduct complained of falls under subsection a of.a claim under cfaa a has four elements defendant has accessed a protected computer has done so without authorization or by exceeding such authorization as was granted has done so knowingly and with intent to defraud and as a result has further ed the intended fraud and obtain ed anything of value.a see also pacific aerospace,taylor,d.
