in november,federal agents executed a search warrant at the chicago residence of yousef joe pira.the agents suspicions proved to be justified they discovered credit cards,photocopied credit cards,and personal identification information related to people.in pira home and during a later search of his computer,agents also found an extensive collection of contraband,including bank cards,checkbooks in various names,two postal arrow locks the standard lock used on mailboxes across the city of chicago by the postal service,a magnetic encoder,four boxes of check stock,social security cards,stolen and counterfeit checks including the image of a counterfeit check on pira computer,fraudulent money orders,and much more.pira had hidden many of these items in a cubbyhole in his young daughter bedroom.
based on what was seized as a result of the search and on statements pira made to secret service special agent michael bush during the search,a federal grand jury issued a indictment charging pira with knowing possession of at least counterfeit,unauthorized access devices with the intent to defraud,in violation of a knowing production,use,and trafficking in at least one access device with the intent to defraud,in violation of a knowing possession of equipment with intent to defraud,in violation of a and knowing possession of a mail lock adopted by the postal service with intent to use,sell,or otherwise dispose of it and cause it to be used,sold,or otherwise disposed of unlawfully and improperly,in violation of.
pira proceeded to trial on these charges,but on the second day of trial he changed his plea to guilty on all four counts of the indictment.though he later attempted to withdraw his guilty plea,that request was denied.pira case then moved to sentencing.after an evidentiary hearing,the district court sentenced pira to months imprisonment.on appeal,pira challenges only his sentence,which we affirm.
considering the vast and varied assortment of access devices,encoding devices,counterfeit documents,and other contraband found in pira home and on his computer,it is perhaps unsurprising that,during the search,pira admitted to special agent bush that he manufactured and possessed counterfeit checks and money orders,and that he also boosted credit cards.as agent bush recounted at the sentencing hearing,pira boosting scheme involved obtaining a legitimate credit card from an account holder who had little or no available credit remaining on her credit limit,and then making fraudulent payments to the credit card issuers using other credit cards or counterfeit checks to restore the available credit.after restoring the credit,pira would make charges until the available credit was once again depleted.as the district court pointed out during sentencing,this scheme revealed a close relation between pira use of fraudulent credit cards and his use of counterfeit checks and money orders.
pira admitted during the search of his residence on november,that he had printed two counterfeit cashier checks,one drawn on tcf national bank and the other on bank one.both of these checks,pira stated,remained on his laptop computer,which he had used to create them.he had printed the checks for other people,but he was uncertain whether they were able to cash them.
following this lead,secret service agents conducted a forensic examination of pira computer.in addition to finding two tcf bank cashier checks for and,the agents also discovered the image of a counterfeit check issued by bank one and made payable to a man named salem in the amount of.the date on the check was november.testifying at his sentencing hearing,pira acknowledged that he created the image of the check,but he denied ever printing the check or attempting to cash it.instead,he claimed,he had prepared it in connection with his work for the secret service as an informant.though it is true that pira once was a confidential informant for the secret service,the two secret service agents responsible for working with pira during his cooperation period,agent bush and special agent matthew mccloskey,testified that they had no prior knowledge of the items found in pira residence,and that the items were not related to pira prior cooperation with the service.pira nonetheless has insisted throughout these proceedings that the items found in his apartment during the search were the remnants of his previous status as a confidential informant.
pira did not dispute that the other counterfeit checks had been found on his computer,but he said that he did not remember creating them.he admitted to helping with the preparation of fraudulent money orders,each in the amount of.these he mailed to another man,who,in return,was to pay pira for the printing job.
the sentencing hearing also featured the testimony of zach costinos,who said that he worked for pira from until pira arrest in.during that time,costinos stated,roughly two to three times per week pira provided costinos with credit cards for the purpose of making fraudulent purchases.pira instructed costinos to use the cards for purchasing items such as computers,laptops,and other small electronics at stores like circuit city and best buy.costinos then sold the items and split the proceeds with pira typically,costinos received of the proceeds,while the other went to pira.during these years of working together,pira also tutored costinos on how to obtain the credit cards and account information and how to use a computer and device to the cards with new information.costinos watched pira perform this process on at least one occasion.
costinos also worked for pira as a runner to cash and deposit stolen or counterfeit checks.to facilitate this activity,pira helped costinos obtain a false driver license,with a fake name george zoto,date of birth,and social security number.after taking costinos to a secretary of state office to obtain the license,pira instructed costinos to use the phoney id to open bank accounts under the alias.costinos did so,establishing accounts as george zoto at tcf bank,liberty bank,and plaza bank.pira then provided costinos with checks to deposit into those accounts.the checks included counterfeit checks as well as checks that pira had stolen from the mail using his arrow key.before the banks learned that the checks were no good and closed zoto accounts,costinos managed to deposit seven checks,in amounts ranging from just over to just under,and to withdraw approximately.
the presentence investigation report psr calculated the actual loss resulting from pira offenses of conviction at.that figure is based on losses reported by the fraud departments for the issuing banks of nine out of the total credit card numbers found in pira apartment.the psr also included in its assessment of relevant conduct the following items of intended loss

resulting from two counterfeit checks passed by an individual named abdel alsabih in december.because no evidence directly linked pira to these checks,the government did not seek to have this amount included in the loss calculation at sentencing.
in total,the psr concluded that the loss resulting from the offense of conviction and related conduct was.following an evidentiary hearing,the district court accepted the psr actual loss calculation and also concluded that most but not all of the uncharged conduct constituted relevant conduct within the meaning of the sentencing guidelines ussg and therefore had to be added into t
