factual and procedural background 
in october,greece requested that the united states extradite crystalla kyriakidou.according to the extradition request,kyriakidou had entered the united states using a false passport under the name of christina manta.greece sought to extradite kyriakidou on the following three charges 
deceit of especially great damage,by profession and by habit 
deceit from which it was provoked an especially important damage,in continuation and by habit and 
deceit in continuation against a bank,with damage that exceeds the amount of drachmas approx.usd and committed by a person who acted by profession and by habit and especially dangerous.
the extradition request also listed thirty convictions that were imposed on kyriakidou in abstentia,though some of these convictions were declared invalid some time after greece submitted the extradition request to the united states.in december,greece again requested kyriakidou extradition.in this request,greece added a fourth charge against kyriakidou for fraud by profession and out of habit of particularly great damage.
based on the three charges set forth in the extradition request,the united states filed a complaint for extradition against kyriakidou under in the united states district court for the southern district of california.the court issued an arrest warrant and,on june,manta was provisionally arrested on the belief that she was kyriakidou.she was released on bond one week later.on the day of the extradition hearing,march,the united states filed an amended complaint for extradition incorporating the fourth charge listed in greece extradition request.
the magistrate judge granted in part and denied in part the government request for extradition.the magistrate judge concluded that the person before the court,christina manta,was crystalla kyriakidou,the person greece sought for extradition.the magistrate judge granted greece extradition request with respect to two charges deceit from which it was provoked an especially important damage,in continuation and by habit,charge two,and fraud by profession and out of habit of particularly great damage,charge four based on her finding that there was probable cause to believe that kyriakidou had committed those crimes.the magistrate judge concluded that probable cause did not exist to extradite kyriakidou on charges one and three.
with respect to charge two,the amended complaint for extradition alleged that kyriakidou had misrepresented herself as a real estate investor and convinced an investor theodoros kiskiras to give her approximately for future real estate enterprises,and did not invest the money as promised.in her probable cause analysis,the magistrate judge relied on an investigation report written by a greek public prosecutor,which stated that it was based on testimonies from kiskiras and three other witnesses and described kyriakidou interactions with kiskiras.the magistrates council of athens issued a writ of arrest for kyriakidou based on this investigation report.
with respect to charge four,the amended complaint for extradition alleged that kyriakidou falsely represented to an investor her identity,that she was an expert in international stock exchange trading,that she had her own investment company,and that she was receiving annual returns of to percent on her investments,which caused an investor,dimitra loui,to give her.kyriakidou did not invest or return loui money.in her probable cause analysis,the magistrate judge relied on a complaint submitted by loui to the public prosecutor of athens misdemeanors court and an examination under oath before the public prosecutor of the appeal court of athens in which loui identified manta as kyriakidou loui affidavit.
manta challenged the order certifying her extradition by filing a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under in the district court.manta now appeals the district court dismissal of her habeas petition.we have jurisdiction under a.
ii.discussion 
extradition from the united states is a diplomatic process that is initiated when a foreign nation requests extradition of an individual from the state department.prasoprat benov,cir citing blaxland commonwealth dir.of pub.prosecutions,cir see.if the state department concludes that the request is within the scope of a treaty between the requesting nation and the united states,a united states attorney files a complaint in federal district court seeking an arrest warrant for the individual sought for extradition.prasoprat,at quoting blaxland,at.a judge or magistrate judge must then hold an extradition hearing to determine if the evidence is sufficient to sustain the charge of extradition under the relevant treaty.id.citing.if the judge or magistrate judge concludes that the crime is extraditable,and that there is probable cause to sustain the charge,the judge or magistrate judge must certify the extradition.id.citations omitted.
a habeas petition is the only available avenue to challenge an extradition order.vo benov,cir citing mainero gregg,cir.in examining a petition for writ of habeas corpus challenging an extradition order,our inquiry on appeal is limited to whether 
the extradition judge had jurisdiction to conduct proceedings 
the extradition court had jurisdiction over the fugitive 
the extradition treaty was in full force and effect 
the crime fell within the terms of the treaty and 
there was competent legal evidence to support a finding of extraditability.
zanazanian united states,cir citing caplan vokes,cir.the fifth factor,stated another way,requires us to consider whether competent legal evidence demonstrate s probable cause to believe that the accused committed the crime charged by the foreign nation.id.at citing merino marshal,cir.
on appeal,manta raises arguments under the fourth and fifth factors whether the crime fell within the terms of the treaty,and whether there was competent legal evidence to support a finding of extraditability.she claims that the district court erred in concluding that the treaty requirement of dual criminality was satisfied that the district court erred in concluding that there was competent evidence to support the magistrate judge finding that manta is kyriakidou,the person greece sought for extradition and that the district court erred in concluding that competent evidence supported the magistrate judge probable cause determination.we address each of these arguments in turn.
dual criminality 
article i of the treaty between the united states and greece sets forth a dual criminality requirement.it provides that surrender shall take place only upon such evidence of criminality,as according to the laws of the place where the fugitive or person so charged shall be found,would justify his apprehension and commitment for trial if the crime or offense had been there committed.treaty of extradition between the united states of america and the hellenic republic,may,stat.emphasis added.in other words,an offense is not extraditable under the treaty unless it is considered criminal under the laws of both greece and the united states.see caplan,at.
dual criminality exists if the essential character of the acts criminalized by the laws of each country are the same and the laws are substantially analogous.oen robinson,cir internal quotations and citations omitted.the name by which the crime is described in each country and the scope of liability need not be the same.id.citing emami dist.court,cir.the elements of the crime allegedly committed in a foreign country also need not be identical to the elements of the substantially analogous crime.id.at citing in re russell,cir stating that hong kong crimes of false accounting and publishing a false statement are substantially analogous to federal crime of making a false entry in a bank statement clarey gregg,cir d ifferences between statutes aimed at the same category of conduct do not defeat dual criminality.rather,i t is enough that the conduct involved is criminal in both countries.oen,at quoting in re russell,at see emami,at stating that dual criminality is satisfied if the substantive conduct each statute punishes is functionally identical.
we review de novo a district court decision as to whether a crime falls within the terms of a treaty,including a treaty requirement of dual criminality.clarey,at united states khan,cir.
we agree with the district court that the essential character of the two crimes on which the magistrate judge based the extradition order deceit from which it was provoked an especially important damage,in continuation and by habit,and fraud by profession and out of habit of particularly great damage target fraud by false pretenses or obtaining money by false pretenses which is criminal in the united states under laws punishing mail and wire fraud manta presents a narrow challenge to the district court conclusion that the treaty dual criminality requirement was met though manta admits that the foreign offenses charged are similar to criminal fraud,she argues that the government did not prove dual criminality because it failed to establish a specific intent to defraud.this argument is not persuasive.
we agree with manta that it is proper to consider her alleged intent as a part of our dual criminality analysis.dual criminality requires that the conduct involved is criminal in both countries.oen,at quoting in re russell,at emphasis added see emami,at concluding that as long as emami alleged conduct would be prosecutable under the laws of the united states,dual criminality was satisfied even though the two relevant countries had differing definitions of fraud.because conduct is only criminal if performed with the required intent,we must consider whether manta alleged conduct evidences a specific intent to defraud such that her alleged conduct would be criminal in the united states.
an intent to defraud may be inferred from circumstantial evidence.united states milwitt,cir citing united states cloud,cir schreiber distrib.furniture,cir specific intent to defraud required by mail and wire fraud statutes is satisfied by the existence of a scheme which was reasonably calculated to deceive persons of ordinary prudence and comprehension internal quotations and citations omitted oen,at inferring the intent to gain for himself or for another from the structure and result of the transactions.we can easily infer manta intent to defraud from the alleged conduct on which greece based charges two and four.
as to charge two,the extradition request alleged that manta falsely presented to kiskiras that she was in the real estate business,that she bought estates at auctions and resold them for profit in cooperation with certain belgian and swiss companies,and that she was of a great financial welfare as a result,manta convinced kiskiras to give her millions of dollars which she kept and never invested.manta intent to defraud is supported by the public prosecutor investigation report,which documented that when kiskiras asked manta to return some of his investment,she gave him checks that lacked sufficient funds.kiskiras also learned that,contrary to manta representations,she had no involvement with the banks or real estate companies.
we can also infer an intent to defraud from the conduct on which charge four is based.manta is alleged to have presented to dimitra loui knowingly of the truthlessness that she had an investment company named imar world trading,which invested in secured bonds of developing countries with an annual return of percent.loui gave manta approximately to invest as valued in the amended complaint for extradition,and this money was never returned to loui or invested.
at an extradition hearing,the court is required to determine whether the party before the court is the party named in the extradition complaint.hooker klein,cir.whether the person before the court is the accused is part of the magistrate judge probable cause analysis.quinn robinson,cir.on habeas,we uphold a magistrate judge finding that there is probable cause to believe the accused committed the crime charged if there is any competent evidence in the record to support it.then melendez,cir citing quinn,at zanazanian,at citing merino,at.
we agree with the district court that there was ample competent evidence to support the magistrate judge conclusion that crystalla kyriakidou,the person greece requested for extradition,is the same person as christina manta,the person before the magistrate judge.the magistrate judge relied on a complaint that loui submitted to the public prosecutor of athens misdemeanor court,in which loui alleged that the person who committed fraud against her in greece presented herself as christina manta using passport no.issued in,that manta left greece to live in san diego,and that loui later learned that manta real name was cristallo kiriakidou.in loui affidavit,she stated that she examined passport no,which was issued to christina manta in,and testified that she recognized the person in the picture as the person who deceived her.
the magistrate judge observed that the person in court appeared to be the same person that loui had identified in the passport photo.the magistrate judge also noted other evidence,though not conclusive by itself,supporting that the person before the court was kyriakidou.she considered that the public prosecutor in greece recognized the person in the passport photo as having a good likeness to the person greece sought for extradition,that manta had provided different dates of birth for herself on three occasions suggesting that her true identity was not that of christina manta,and that manta admitted that she was in greece in,when some of the alleged conduct took place.
manta argues on appeal that there is no evidence that she is the person sought in connection with charge two,and that loui identification is not competent to support that she is the person sought in connection with charge four.as a preliminary matter,manta errs in suggesting that the government needed to provide specific evidence that she was the person sought as to each charge.manta cites no case law to support such an approach and,by seeking extradition of one individual for multiple charges at once,it is implicit that greece seeks to extradite the same person on all charges.thus,our analysis of whether the magistrate judge had competent proof of identity is not.
manta also contends on appeal,for the first time,that loui identification is not competent because the government submission of loui affidavit identifying was untimely under the treaty,and loui identification was impermissibly suggestive.as a general rule,we do not consider issues raised for the first time on appeal.see allen ornoski,cir citing united states,cir.the ninth circuit has recognized three narrow exceptions to this general rule.see,at internal quotations and citation omitted stating that a court may exercise its discretion to review newly presented issues when there are exceptional circumstances,due to a change in law while appeal was pending,or when the issue is a pure issue of law and the opposing party will suffer no prejudice.these exceptions do not apply here due to the nature of the new arguments manta has asserted.however,a further exception applies when plain error has occurred and an injustice might otherwise result.id.
plain error occurs only when there is an error,that is plain,and affects a defendant substantial rights an appellate court may exercise its discretion to correct such an error only if it seriously affect s the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states thornton,cir quoting
