factual backgrounda.people case in chief 
riverside county district attorney office investigator dan stack was assigned to investigate real estate fraud in riverside county.he was contacted by the riverside county recorder office regarding suspicious quitclaim deeds and homestead declarations being filed by defendant.according to investigator stack,defendant searched the records at the riverside county recorder office and looked for properties that were in default and for which foreclosure proceedings were being started.
defendant filed a quitclaim deed and homestead declaration for palm view on january.brett hupe purchased palm view in late.he fixed it up and found a buyer for the property.he was then informed that someone had moved into the property.the locks had been changed,and the house was full of furniture.
on january,investigator stack went to palm view.the renters in the property had a rental agreement for per month rent signed with defendant for palm view.defendant came to palm view and told investigator stack that he was claiming palm view under adverse possession.defendant was suing the owners of palm view for quiet title of the property.he claimed to be the owner based on his recorded quitclaim deed and homestead declaration.the renters sued hupe,and he settled with them for.hupe eventually sold the house for.
defendant filed a quitclaim deed and a homestead declaration for donahue on january.barbara haynes had owned and lived in donahue for years.she had no idea that defendant had filed a quitclaim deed or homestead declaration against donahue.according to haynes,the address on the quitclaim deed and homestead declaration were erroneous because it listed the property in riverside,when it was in moreno valley.however,the parcel number was correct.
defendant filed quitclaim deeds and homestead declarations for oak dale and cobble creek on november.
defendant also filed a quitclaim deed and homestead declaration for larry dean on november.in,the owner of larry dean,andres serrano,could no longer afford the home,so he set up a short sale of the property.in november,he found a buyer.before it was sold,some people started moving into his home.defendant got a restraining order to keep serrano out of the property.defendant told serrano he had right to the property under section and emancipation.serrano could not sell larry dean due to the cloud on the property.serrano contacted investigator stack.
defendant eventually signed a grant deed giving the property back to serrano.serrano was eventually able to get the renters out and sell the property.
defendant filed a quitclaim deed and homestead declaration for harrow on november.an investor bought harrow in august for.the investor had to evict the prior owners.the investor listed it for sale in january.at that time,the investor was informed that the owner of the property was defendant.it took approximately one month in order for the investor to be able to list it for sale and only after a title company agreed to indemnify the investor from any challenge to the title.the property sold in may.
defendant filed a quitclaim deed and homestead declaration for amber view on november.in,amber view assessed value was.amber view was listed for sale in may.a short sale was approved.in november,unauthorized persons moved into the house.they told a riverside county sheriff deputy,who was called to the property,that they had rented the property for per month.the renters gave the deputy a rental agreement showing defendant executed a lease agreement with the renters.the renters were going to have to be evicted,and the owner of the property could not afford it.the property could not be sold,and it was foreclosed upon.defendant had sued the owner of amber view for quiet title.
defendant filed a quitclaim deed and a homestead declaration for star ruby on november,and another quitclaim deed on november.defendant filed a quitclaim deed and two homestead declarations for harrow on november.
an employee of the riverside county assessor office indicated that properties in riverside county are assessed for value for determining property taxes.the assessed values of the properties were displayed to the jury 
for each of the properties,defendant recorded a quitclaim deed attesting that i,eugene denman,quit claim to eugene denman all my rights,title and interest in the real property described as follows he also filed a homestead declaration for each claiming i am the owner of the land and premises more particularly described as all the homestead declarations were filed under penalty of perjury.
investigator stack called these quitclaim deeds wild deeds.the wild deeds were not in a chain of title,they were not granted from one person,who legally had title to the property,to another.once the quitclaim deed was recorded,it would appear on the title record for the property.
sharon grannis was employed by a title company.she also explained that a wild deed was a deed that is filed where the party had no prior recorded interest in the property.when a wild deed was found in the title for a property,it raised a red flag that there may be another interest in the property.a quiet title action would have to be filed by the title company to get the deed off the title.quitclaim deeds,like the ones filed in this case,would cloud the title.
defendant listed his address on some of the filings as being in wilmington.defendant parole agent had his address listed as a shelter on compton boulevard.he started parole on february.defendant also had listed the wilmington address as an address with the parole department.the parties stipulated that the homestead declarations and quitclaim deeds were all signed and executed by defendant.
defendant testified that he believed the homes were abandoned and that he was just providing shelter to people in need.he thought he was complying with state and federal laws.defendant mistakenly filed quitclaim deeds on harrow and donahue.defendant stayed one night at harrow he believed the quitclaim deed allowed him to occupy the premises.he also claimed that he had lived at the larry dean location.he had tenants at star ruby and palm view.he filed quiet title actions on some of the properties.defendant claimed that he either stayed in the properties or had tenants move in to exercise control of the property.
defendant admitted that he had no claim of title or interest in the properties.he admitted that he had previously been convicted of domestic violence.
quitclaim deed as a false document pursuant to section 
defendant contends that his convictions for filing false documents for the quitclaim deeds must be reversed.he claims that since a quitclaim deed only transfers title that a person may or may not have,he could not be found to have filed false documents,as he was not representing that he owned the property,and he had no interest to transfer.
our task is clear.on appeal we review the whole record in the light most favorable to the judgment to determine whether it discloses substantial evidence that is,evidence that is reasonable,credible,and of solid value from which a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.citations.the standard of review is the same in cases in which the people rely mainly on circumstantial evidence.citation.although it is the duty of the jury to acquit a defendant if it finds that circumstantial evidence is susceptible of two interpretations,one of which suggests guilt and the other innocence citations,it is the jury,not the appellate court,which must be convinced of the defendant guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.if the circumstances reasonably justify the trier of fact findings,the opinion of the reviewing court that the circumstances might also reasonably be reconciled with a contrary finding does not warrant a reversal of the judgment.citations.citation.citations.the conviction shall stand unless it appears that upon no hypothesis whatever is there sufficient substantial evidence to support the conviction.citation.people cravens cal th.
section,subdivision a provides as follows every person who knowingly procures or offers any false or forged instrument to be filed,registered,or recorded in any public office within this state,which instrument,if genuine,might be filed,registered or recorded under any law of this state or the united states,is guilty of a felony.
s ection was designed to prevent the recordation of spurious documents knowingly offered for record.citation.generes justice court d,generes.the core purpose of section is to protect the integrity and reliability of public records.citations.this purpose is served by an interpretation that prohibits any knowing falsification of public records.people feinberg th.
in generes,the defendant recorded a grant deed that purported to transfer from herself to herself an easement over land she did not own.after a municipal court denied the defendant demur to a complaint charging her with violating section,she petitioned the superior court for a writ of prohibition.the superior court issued a peremptory writ stating as follows it appears from the face of the complaint that defendant filed a document which was exactly what it purported to be to wit,a deed from herself to herself granting herself an easement over land she did not own.the court does not rule that this conduct is legal.it merely states now that it is not a violation of s ection.generes,supra,d at.
the people appealed arguing that the trial court applied an overly narrow construction of the word false.generes,supra,d at.in reversing the superior court order,the appellate court stated here the lack of an ownership interest in the land goes to the deception itself.if generes did not own the interest she purported to convey,the instrument she filed was clearly false.having no right to grant or convey an easement,her recording of a deed transferring an easement would establish a cloud on the title of those persons who lawfully owned interests in the land.a title searcher encountering the spurious document who acted upon it as genuine would of course be materially deceived.id.at.
in responding to the defendant claim that a violation of section required a forged instrument the court stated,in pertinent part as follows s ection differentiates between the two categories,clearly proscribing either a false or a forged instrument.obviously,as in the present case,an instrument may have the effect of defrauding one who acts on it as genuine even though it does not bear a forged signature or otherwise meet the technical requirements of a forged instrument.generes,supra,d at.
here,defendant filed quitclaim deeds to himself on property to which he admitted he had no title or interest.while defendant is technically correct that he attested in the quitclaim deed that he was only transferring whatever title or interest he possessed,it was clear based on the evidence he had absolutely no interest in the property.the documents themselves were false in that they transferred an interest that he did not have to himself and then he recorded the document,clouding the title of the true property owners.adopting defendant reasoning would be in direct contradiction with the purpose behind section to preserve and protect the integrity of public records.based on the purpose of the statute and the fact that section has been broadly construed,the quitclaim deeds could reasonably be considered false documents by the jury.
as noted by the trial court,the filing of each document clouds the title.grannis testified that once a wild deed is found by the title company,it must act upon it and clear the title.a title company,seeing the spurious document,would have to act on it.moreover,in conjunction with the quitclaim deeds,defendant filed false declarations of homestead,when it was clear that he had no interest in the nine properties.it gave the impression that the quitclaim deeds were valid and that defendant actually possessed the properties.
defendant asks this court to narrowly construe section and find that he did not technically make any false statements on the quitclaim deeds because such deeds only transfer whatever interest he possessed.it is well recognized that a quitclaim deed is a distinct form of conveyance and operates like any other deed inasmuch as it passes whatever title or interest the grantor has in the property.citations.it is equally settled that the form of the instrument creates a presumption that the title to the property is held as shown in the instrument.in re marriage of broderick d.defendant argues that although there is a presumption that the quitclaim deed transfers some interest or title,it does not actually transfer any interest.while we may agree with defendant that this true,the evidence here overwhelmingly showed that defendant only filed the quitclaim deeds in order to cloud title and to unlawfully gain possession of the property.this is akin to the actions in generes.
the purpose of section to preserve the integrity of public documents is served by finding the quitclaim deeds in this case were false documents.as such,we affirm the judgment of the jury in finding him guilty of section for each of the quitclaim deeds that he filed.
insufficient evidence of violations of subdivision a and of section 
defendant contends that the evidence was insufficient to find him guilty of violating section,subdivision a loss of more than and loss of more than,because there was no evidence that the victims losses exceeded these statutory amounts.we have set forth the standard of review for sufficiency of the evidence claims,ante.
section,subdivision a states when any person takes,damages,or destroys any property in the commission or attempted commission of a felony,with the intent to cause that taking,damage,or destruction,the court shall impose an additional term as follows if the loss exceeds thousand dollars,the court,in addition and consecutive to the punishment prescribed for the felony or attempted felony of which the defendant has been convicted,shall impose an additional term of one year.italics added.under subdivision a,a sentence of two years shall be imposed if the amount exceeds.subdivision b provides that i n any accusatory pleading involving multiple charges of taking,damage,or destruction,the additional terms provided in this section may be imposed if the aggregate loses to the victims from all felonies exceeded the amounts specified in this section and arise from a common scheme or plan.
in discussing the jury instructions and defending the section motion,the people made clear it was only proceeding on the theory that there was damage to the title and not a taking.the people did not discuss a theory under section,subdivision b of a common plan or scheme.in closing,the people argued that defendant damaged the title for each of the properties.his intent was shown by filing quiet title actions that he hoped the owners could not defend 
in people beaver th,the court found that section applies to any felony that causes a taking,damage or destruction of property.furthermore,as to defendant argument that the calculation of the value of property involved in the felony is limited to what the defendant received,rather than what the victim lost,this is incorrect.the inclusion of property that has either been damage d or destroy ed in the calculation demonstrates a clear intent that the emphasis is on what the victim lost,not what the defendant gained.id.at.
t he legislature did not intend that the application of section should depend upon the fortuitous circumstances of whether the police were able to recover stolen property or the victim was able to establish a civil claim citation.people frederick th.in people ramirez d,the court rejected the defendants argument that section applied only if the victim ultimate loss exceeds the statutory amount.ramirez,at.to interpret the statute in the manner suggested by appellants would be to attribute to the legislature an intent to depart radically from law that the recovery of stolen property by the victim is no defense to crime and is only relevant in mitigation of punishment when the defendant voluntarily returns it prior to being charged.ibid.
here,grannis testified that if a cloud on title was found,the issue would have to be investigated.the title company would not insure the property if a wild deed existed.for example,for a time,the investor in harrow was unable to get the title company to insure title,and therefore no sale could occur,because of the wild deed on the property.serrano could not sell larry dean because of the cloud on title.the owner of amber view could not sell the property because of the cloud on title,and it was foreclosed upon.further,a title company would have to file a quiet title action to clear title.hence,based on the wild deeds,the true owners of the property could not liquidate or sell their properties.as such,the loss at the time based on the cloud on title was a total loss of the value of the property.
defendant contends he could not take the properties because he had no title or interest in the properties,since he possessed no interest under the quitclaim deeds.however,the people proceeded on a theory that defendant damagedthe properties by clouding title,not that he took the properties.section does not define damage the ordinary meaning of damage is loss or harm resulting from injury to person,property,or reputation.webster new collegiate dict.here,by not being able to sell their properties because of the cloud on title,each of the victims suffered loss of the assessed value of their property.
defendant claims that it is the loss incurred,not the total value of the property itself,that must be measured to determine if the enhancement applied.however,as noted,ante,with the cloud on title,the owners could not sell or liquidate their properties.as such,at the time that he filed the quitclaim deeds and homestead declarations,the true property owners could not sell their properties.they suffered a total loss that equaled the assessed value of the property.defendant makes no claim the assessor testimony regarding the value of the properties was erroneous.even though most of the property owners were later able to clear title and sell the properties,this does not signify there was insufficient evidence of the enhancement.
although not raised by the defendant,we note that the jury was not properly instructed on the enhancement under section,subdivision a for counts,and.under subdivision a,the loss of the property need only be.on counts,and,defendant was only charged with taking or damaging worth of property.presumably,exhibit only provided evidence that the value of the property was greater than,but not greater than.however,the jury was instructed that it need find that the property taken,damaged,or destroyed was greater than for all counts.
when the trial court gives an incorrect or incomplete instruction that allegedly affects the substantial rights of a defendant,it is reviewable even if no objection was raised in the trial court.see people hudson cal th,no forfeiture when trial court gives an instruction that is an incorrect statement of the law.however,jury instructions must be considered in light of the entire record to determine whether it is reasonably likely the jury was misled.see people cross cal th.
here,the jury verdict form did state that the amount of loss need only be.we conclude the jury would have understood its duty was to determine for counts,and that the value of the property was greater than,not.see people hughes cal th,instructions read together with the verdict form evidenced a proper finding by the jury.
based on the foregoing,ample evidence supported that defendant damaged the properties in an amount exceeding for all counts except counts,and,which were supported by evidence that the amount exceeded.
taking of greater than pursuant to section,subdvision a 
similar to defendant previous contention,he claims he could not be found guilty of violating section,subdivision a,the aggravated white collar crime enhancement,because he took nothing,and therefore the losses to the victims did not exceed.
section,subdivision a,as it read at the time that defendant recorded the quitclaim deeds and homestead declarations,provides in pertinent part as follows any person who commits two or more related felonies,a material element of which is fraud or embezzlement,which involves a pattern of related felony conduct,and the pattern of related felony conduct involves the taking of,or results in the loss by another person or entity of,more than one hundred thousand dollars,shall be punished,upon conviction of two or more felonies in a single criminal proceeding,in addition and consecutive to the punishment prescribed for the felony offenses of which he or she has been convicted,by an additional term of imprisonment in the state prison as specified in paragraph or.this enhancement shall be known as the aggravated white collar crime enhancement.the aggravated white collar crime enhancement shall only be imposed once in a single criminal proceeding.stats,ch,italics added.subdivision a provides for a two,three,or five year prison sentence if the amount of loss or taking exceeds.
the purpose of the aggravated white collar crime enhancement is to provide a mechanism for greater punishment for criminals who engage in a pattern of fraudulent activity that results in a large amount of accumulated takings.people williams th.
as we found in the preceding section,the evidence supported that each of the owners of the properties suffered a loss of the value of the property of greater than except counts,and.as such,the evidence
