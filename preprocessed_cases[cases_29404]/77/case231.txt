karen hartstein appeals the sentence she received after pleading guilty to two counts of a count indictment involving credit card fraud and the solicitation of fraudulent loans from a large number of victims.hartstein sentence was based on a finding by the district court that her fraud involved a loss amount in excess of million and over victims.she also appeals an order to pay over million in restitution to her victims.because additional factfinding is required as to the loss amount and number of victims,we vacate the sentence and restitution order and remand for further proceedings.
background 
hartstein worked as a travel agent.in this capacity,she solicited loans from numerous victims,promising to repay their principal within a short time thirty give them free travel benefits including cruises and airline tickets.hartstein scheme expanded to the point where she was soliciting new loans to pay the principal on old loans in whole or in part or to purchase airline tickets to appease her prior lenders.she eventually used clients personal information and credit card numbers to open new lines of credit or to purchase tickets.in addition,she left vendors or cooperating travel agents with unpaid bills and repaid some lenders with bad checks.also,as to a few clients who complained loudly,she provided international tickets that she represented as tickets,thus leaving these clients stranded in foreign countries.in one instance,the stranded traveler was a minor.the government characterizes hartstein crime as a ponzi scheme.hartstein characterizes her activities as borrowing that spiraled out of control in which some lenders were the victims of fraud and other lenders were friends or acquaintances who gave or loaned her money apart from any fraud.
hartstein pleaded guilty to one count of mail fraud in violation of,and one count of account fraud using an access device in violation of a.in a subsequently prepared presentence investigation report psr,the probation office alleged that there were over victims with a combined total amount of loans and unauthorized charges over million.applying the guidelines,these figures resulted in a base offense level of seven,a an increase for a loss amount greater than million but less than million,b j and a increase for more than fifty but fewer than victims,b b.in addition,there was a increase for the unauthorized use of a means of identification,b c i a increase for the use of sophisticated means,b c and a upward adjustment for the abuse of a position of trust.this resulted in an initial psr recommendation that the total offense level should be set at.hartstein had no criminal history points and was in criminal history category i.the psr resultant advisory guidelines range was months imprisonment.
hartstein objected to the psr.in a detailed memorandum,she presented a series of arguments to establish that the amount of loss was substantially lower than the million listed in the psr.the million figure was the total amount purportedly loaned by hartstein to all alleged victims without reduction for amounts repaid and without reduction for travel benefits granted.hartstein expressly challenged the factual basis of many of the loans and the characterization of certain individuals as victims.she also argued generally that she was entitled to credit against each individual loan the principal sums repaid to the associated victim and the value of travel benefits provided to that victim.her arguments can be categorized in three separate groups,as follows.
first,hartstein challenged the government listing of purported losses as factually inaccurate.she asserted that many of the victims were not,in fact,victims of an interrelated ponzi scheme as alleged by the government,but were friends or relatives who loaned or gave her money out of kindness,or lenders who were unrelated to an alleged scheme.she also asserted that the government listing of loss amounts for several victims was inaccurate,redundant,or not supported by the evidence.for example,hartstein alleged that some victims were listed separately from their spouses and that the total losses to the couples were counted twice even though the couples only loaned hartstein money once.hartstein argued that the elimination of the challenged victims and their purported losses,and the correction of inaccurate accounting by the government,would reduce the total loss amount by approximately 
second,hartstein asserted that she repaid substantial sums to many of her and that the amounts repaid should be credited against the loss amount.according to hartstein,this argument,if accepted by the court,would reduce the total loss amount by approximately an additional million.hartstein essentially argued that the proper amount for loss calculations was not the total amount loaned by each victim,but the net loss of principal by each victim.
finally,hartstein asserted that the value of travel benefits cruises,plane tickets,she provided to her victims in lieu of or in addition to principal repayments should be used to offset the loss amounts by an additional sum of approximately.
based on these three categories of challenges,the repayment credit theory,and the travel benefit provided a detailed,summary of her position which she labeled defendant victim list.this list was based on the government summary of its own position,and the list detailed purported victims names,loan amounts,repayments,travel benefits,and the net amount still owed to each victim defendant victim list also included a brief explanation following each victim to explain why,in many cases,the loan amounts differed from those claimed by the government or why hartstein considered the lender not to be a victim.
the government responded to hartstein objections,and the probation office issued amendments and comments to the psr,noting repeatedly that the government was prepared to offer documents and testimony at sentencing to support the asserted loss amounts.prior to sentencing,hartstein conducted additional investigation,and shortly before sentencing,she provided the court and the government with an amended,detailed summary of her position regarding loss amounts.in this amended summary,hartstein listed the total loss amount as.hartstein argued at sentencing that she should be sentenced based on this loss amount.
at sentencing,the government argued that the friends and relatives hartstein sought to eliminate from the list of victims,and whose losses hartstein sought to eliminate from the loss totals,were,in fact,victims of fraud notwithstanding their personal relationships with hartstein.as to one of these individuals,the government noted that,even though hartstein characterized the person as having loaned money as a display of love and affection,the person received a promissory note from hartstein that was identical to notes received by other victims.the government argued categorically that all of the identified lenders were victims of a ponzi scheme and that individual factual findings were not necessary as to each victim.the district court agreed,found hartstein and declined the government offer to submit evidence to prove the loss amounts.
regarding repayments,the government alleged generally that hartstein scheme was a ponzi scheme in which she paid or partially paid early lenders with money received from subsequent lenders to assuage the earlier lenders worries or to gain their confidence so that they would increase their own lending activities or send other potential lenders to her.based on this argument,the government asserted that,as a matter of law,all of hartstein repayments to purported victims were merely instruments to perpetuate her fraud,and it would be improper to decrease the total loss amount by any sums that hartstein repaid to the alleged victims.the government also argued that it was improper to credit against losses the value of travel benefits provided to the victims because the government had not attempted to include the value of promised travel benefits in the initial loss amounts.the government also noted that hartstein had promised travel to her victims in addition to,not in lieu of,the return of their principal and that the goal in calculating loss amounts is not to enforce the terms of a fraudulently procured contract,but to identify the amount of the loss.
in effect,the government urged a categorical approach for the treatment of hartstein objections,relying on legal arguments to defeat hartstein challenges in the aggregate rather than focusing on specific loss amounts for each victim.the government also,however,selected certain victims as examples and addressed loss amounts related to these victims that hartstein claimed to have repaid or repaid in part.as to some of these particular victims,the government argued that hartstein had,in fact,repaid them with bad checks or had not actually repaid them at all.
at sentencing,the government presented no evidence to prove the loss amounts.rather,hartstein and the government relied upon accounting summaries indicating their respective positions.the district court accepted the government legal arguments,discussed the summaries,found hartstein summary to be inaccurate or as to certain victims who were selected as examples,and rejected all of hartstein arguments.although the sentencing hearing did not involve the presentation of evidence as to loss amounts,a number of witnesses testified as to other issues.for example,a postal inspector testified as to some financial matters relevant to the question of whether hartstein derived her means of living from the criminal activity.a victim testified as to a large loan she made to hartstein and as to hartstein use of the victim name to open credit accounts.mental health professionals provided testimony relevant to claims by hartstein that she committed her offense while laboring under a diminished mental capacity.
the district court found that hartstein did not suffer any mental impairments that qualified for a departure under the guidelines.the district court adopted the psr recommendations except that the district court granted hartstein a reduction for acceptance of responsibility and refused to apply a enhancement for abuse of a position of trust.this resulted in a total offense level of,criminal history category i,and an advisory guidelines range of months imprisonment.the parties both agreed that,given the court other findings as to the contested matters,this final calculation was accurate.the court then considered the other relevant sentencing factors under a and sentenced hartstein to the high end of the advisory range,months imprisonment.finally,the court adopted the psr recommendations as to amounts owed as restitution.
on appeal,hartstein renews her three arguments and,in addition,argues generally that the district court failed to properly allocate the burden of proof at sentencing and failed to require the government to present evidence as to challenged factual assertions.
ii.discussion 
standard of review and general framework 
we review a district court interpretation of the guidelines de novo and its findings of fact for clear error.united states holthaus,cir.although a district court must make factual findings for guidelines purposes by a preponderance of the evidence,id.at,the damage wrought by fraud is sometimes difficult to calculate,so a district court is charged with the difficult task of making a reasonable estimate of loss rather than a precise determination.united states agboola,cir see,comment.c stating that the sentencing court need only make a reasonable estimate of the loss.further,t he sentencing judge is in a unique position to assess the evidence and estimate the loss based upon that evidence.for this reason,the court loss determination is entitled to appropriate deference.id.combining the guidelines application notes with our established standard,the sentencing court must establish a reasonable estimate of the loss based upon a preponderance of the evidence.determination of the method for calculating a loss amount,however,remains a legal issue that we review de novo.see united states alfonso,cir applying de novo review to an issue of methodology.also,to the extent factual findings are not based on an examination of testimony or other evidence,no deference is due.
guidelines sections b i to k provide for sixteen,eighteen,and increases,respectively,if the total loss amounts are more than million,more than million,or more than million.in the present case,we would have to accept all three of hartstein general categories of arguments in their entirety to find that the loss amount advocated by hartstein is appropriate.one of hartstein arguments,however,is without merit and demands little discussion the argument regarding credits for travel benefits paid to victims.on the facts of the present case,the travel benefits were akin to interest that hartstein promised to her lenders.the government did not seek to include the value of promised travel benefits in the initial loss figures,and the payment of travel benefits did not in any manner restore to the victims the sums they had loaned to hartstein.
hartstein concession that the overall loss amount should be in the range of was based on her partial agreement with the government accounting as to the original loan amounts.she does not challenge the factual basis of approximately million of the government asserted loan amount figure.her other arguments regarding repayments and travel benefits account for the difference between this million figure and her overall asserted loss amount of.rejection of her travel benefits argument,then,effectively adds to hartstein conceded loss amount and places it well above the threshold of million found in b i,even if hartstein were to prevail on all of her other arguments.
given this fact,the loss calculations at hand are material to the guidelines calculations due to the additional increase that is imposed at the level of a million loss.if hartstein remaining purely factual challenges and her legal arguments regarding credits for or independently result in an overall loss amount less than million,hartstein total offense level would be rather than,and her advisory guidelines range would be months rather than months.we address these two remaining arguments in turn.
factual challenges 
as indicated supra at note,hartstein purely factual challenges,if sustained in full,would eliminate approximately from the total asserted loss amount.this challenge,then,could place the loss amount under the guidelines threshold of million and change the advisory guidelines range.we hold that remand is necessary in this case because hartstein objected to the method of calculation used in the psr as well as the resultant loss figures,but the government presented no evidence tending to prove the challenged figures.if the defendant objects to any of the factual allegations contained in the psr,the government must present evidence at the sentencing hearing to prove the existence of the disputed facts.united states jenners,cir quoting united states poor bear,cir.
the government did present summary tables of its position regarding an accounting of the fraudulent loans.summary tables of accounting data that are based on evidence not before the court,and that a party has challenged as inaccurate,are not sufficient to support a court factual findings.united states green,cir t he charts may include assumptions and conclusions,but said assumptions and conclusions must be based upon evidence in the record.quoting united states wainright,cir.when challenged,the conclusions and assumptions stated in summary accounting data are not evidence in and of themselves,but are more akin to representations by litigants.
on remand,hartstein will not be able to avoid her previous concessions,but she will be entitled to put the government to its burden of proof regarding the challenged loan amounts and the circumstances surrounding the lenders she alleges were not victims of fraud.the government need not present evidence as to each alleged victim,as hartstein challenges neither the characterization of many of her lenders as victims nor the loan amounts claimed by the government as to many of these victims.where the parties figures are not in agreement,however,and where hartstein claims a
