in this medicare fraud case,the defendant pleaded guilty to violating.he was sentenced to months imprisonment and restitution of more than million.the principal issues on appeal are whether assets pledged after the offense was discovered should be credited in calculating the amount of loss the effect of payments made and assets pledged as a result of bankruptcy proceedings filed before discovery of the offense and whether representing pension plan benefits that were funded before the loss was discovered should have been credited in determining the amount of loss.we conclude that the district court properly construed and applied the guidelines,except for the failure to credit in calculating the loss.we accordingly vacate the order of restitution and remand for resentencing.
howard douglas austin and his wife owned and operated home health agencies hhas in lafayette and baton rouge,louisiana.through the hhas,they provided services to medicare beneficiaries.medicare paid the hhas costs each year on an estimated basis,using historical and periodically updated data.at the end of each year,the hhas reported their actual costs.if those costs exceeded the amount already paid,the hhas would be reimbursed.but if the hhas had been overpaid,they were required to reimburse medicare.to qualify for reimbursement,the hhas expenses must have been paid in the year reported or during the following year.
austin filed cost reports on behalf of the hhas in and that included improper expenses and misrepresented actual costs.in a cost report included austin personal expenses of.the report also reflected employee bonuses of which had not been paid,and pension plan benefits of which had not been funded.however,pension plan benefits in the amount of were funded within six to twelve weeks after the deadline for reimbursable expenditures had passed.in a cost report included austin personal expenses of.that report also reflected employee bonuses of and pension plan benefits of which were not paid or funded during the applicable reimbursement period.
austin requested an extension to pay costs claimed on the report,but the request was denied.shortly thereafter,the hhas received a notice of medicare program reimbursement,which stated that medicare was seeking reimbursement of over million.medicare notice was sent in january.a few months later,in may,medicare discovered austin fraud.
in february,before the fraud was discovered but after the reimbursement notice was received,austin directed the hhas to initiate chapter bankruptcy proceedings.the purpose of the bankruptcy proceedings was to propose a plan to repay medicare.over a year later,to obtain approval of the reorganization plan,austin offered to pledge personal assets of more than million.his offer was accepted and the plan for reorganization was confirmed in july.the plan included repaying medicare of all overpayments.
in austin pleaded guilty to committing fraud in violation of.by may,when austin was sentenced,over million had been repaid to medicare through medicare withholding of cost reimbursements to the hhas for services performed on an ongoing basis,and the balance due was secured by assets worth more than the amount owed.at sentencing,austin asked the court to reduce his sentence based on the repayments and assets pledged.austin argued that regardless of whether the court applied the guidelines,which were in effect at sentencing,or the guidelines,which were in effect when the offense occurred,the pledged assets and repayments reduce the amount of loss.austin also argued that,under either version of the guidelines,the amount of loss and restitution are reduced by the in pension plan benefits that were funded well before the offense was detected.
the district court rejected austin arguments,concluding that the pledged assets and repayments do not reduce the loss under either the or guidelines.the district court determined the loss based on the improper and untimely costs reported,which totaled.under the guidelines,this loss calculation increased the offense level by points but under the guidelines,the offense level increased by only points therefore,the district court utilized the guidelines and calculated an advisory sentencing range of to months based on a total offense level of.the district court sentenced austin to months imprisonment,restitution of with credit for any payments previously made,a fine of,and an assessment of.austin appealed,raising the same arguments he made in the district court.
we continue to review the district court interpretation of the sentencing guidelines de novo and its fact findings for clear error,although the ultimate sentence is reviewed for unreasonableness when calculating a guidelines sentencing range,a district court applies the guidelines in effect at sentencing,unless the guidelines in effect when the offense occurred would yield a lesser penalty in such a case,to avoid ex post facto concerns,the court uses the guidelines yielding the lesser penalty 
at issue are the guidelines,which were in effect at sentencing,and the guidelines,which were in effect when the offense occurred.under both versions,the sentence for fraud is calculated by determining the amount of loss which yields the lesser sentence depends on how the loss is calculated under each.austin asserts that the loss amount of was incorrectly calculated,and he raises various arguments and alternative contentions.we consider each in turn.
the issues before us focus primarily on note b in the commentary to section of the guidelines and note e in the commentary to section of the guidelines austin contends that,unlike section of the guidelines,which the district court applied,section of the guidelines allow a credit for the value of collateral pledged without regard to the date the offense was discovered.if the assets austin pledged in the bankruptcy proceedings were to be credited against the amounts the hhas improperly reported,the resulting loss would be zero.
the guidelines themselves do not address whether or how collateral is to be applied,but the commentary provides specific rules,including rules regarding collateral.in construing and applying the commentary,we acknowledge that although the guidelines are now advisory,the commentary interpretation of the guidelines generally remains authoritative when interpreting the commentary,we apply ordinary rules of statutory construction 
the commentary to section of the guidelines provides that in fraudulent loan application and contract procurement cases,the loss is the amount of the loan not repaid at the time the offense is discovered,reduced by the amount the lending institution has recovered or can expect to recover from any assets pledged to secure the loan.in,the united states sentencing commission consolidated sections and into a single guideline,section the commentary to section of the guidelines regarding credits against loss,note e,expressly references the time the offense is discovered in subsection i but not subsection ii,which addresses collateral.austin pins his argument on that omission and the references to the time of sentencing 
credits against shall be reduced by the following 
i the money returned,and the fair market value of the property returned and the services rendered,by the defendant or other persons acting jointly with the defendant,to the victim before the offense was detected.the time of detection of the offense is the earlier of i the time the offense was discovered by a victim or government agency or ii the time the defendant knew or reasonably should have known that the offense was detected or about to be detected by a victim or government agency.
ii in a case involving collateral pledged or otherwise provided by the defendant,the amount the victim has recovered at the time of sentencing from disposition of the collateral,or if the collateral has not been disposed of by that time,the fair market value of the collateral at the time of sentencing.
loss,as used in the commentary to the guidelines,is the greater of actual loss or intended loss.actual loss means the reasonably foreseeable pecuniary harm that resulted from the offense,whil
