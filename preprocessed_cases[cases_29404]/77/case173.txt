in these consolidated appeals,defendants nathaniel gray and gilbert jackson appeal their jury trial convictions on multiple counts of violations of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico,d conspiracy to obstruct and obstruction of interstate commerce by extortion in violation of the hobbs act,and honest services mail and wire fraud,in violation of,and.gray also pleaded guilty to one count of income tax evasion.defendants convictions stem from their alleged schemes to procure government contracts for corporate clients and financial gains for themselves by illicitly providing money and gifts to public officials in exchange for political influence in the bid for municipal contracts.
the paramount common issue raised by both defendants is whether certain evidence obtained through electronic surveillance pursuant to title iii of the omnibus crime control and safe streets act of title iii or the act,was properly admitted at trial and,concomitantly,whether the district court abused its discretion by refusing to require disclosure of certain illegally intercepted conversations of defendants.jackson and gray also challenge the viability of their hobbs act convictions in light of our recent decision in united states brock,cir.in addition,defendants raise numerous other issues in these appeals,including,inter alia,challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence the district court denial of motions for severance,continuance,and mistrial prosecutorial misconduct claims of error in jury instructions and cumulative error.gray also appeals his sentences imposed under the advisory guidelines.
for the reasons stated below,we reverse gray convictions on counts,and of the superseding indictment but affirm his convictions and sentences on all remaining counts.with regard to jackson,we reverse his conviction on count but conclude that the remainder of his assignments of error are without merit and affirm his convictions on all other counts.accordingly,we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand these cases to the district court for resentencing consistent with this opinion.
nathaniel gray was a businessman based in cleveland,ohio,who,during the relevant time period related to this prosecution,operated a consulting firm,etna associates,and several other businesses.gilbert jackson was a senior,involved in marketing and business development,in the new orleans office of camp,dresser mckee cdm,a national design and engineering firm that specializes in wastewater treatment facilities.in addition to his job with cdm,jackson independently conducted business as a consultant with gray.gray received monthly payments from cdm and other corporate clients,including honeywell,and in turn paid jackson a monthly fee of or more.in the,defendants,along with other individuals,began to engage in a series of discrete transactions that allegedly involved the unlawful payment of cash and gifts to public officials in four and east cleveland,ohio houston,texas and new orleans,the purpose of steering municipal contracts to defendants corporate clients.
a lengthy investigation by the government into defendants activities ensued.the investigation,which utilized electronic and video surveillance authorized by a federal district court pursuant to title iii,culminated in january with the issuance by a grand jury of a superseding indictment charging gray and jackson,along with four other individuals,with violations of rico,the hobbs act,and mail and wire fraud statutes.gray was also charged with one count of tax evasion.
codefendants monique mcgilbra,brent jividen,and ricardo teamor entered into plea agreements with the government,thus leaving gray,jackson,and coindictee joseph jones,a cleveland city councilman,to stand trial.a june jury trial against these defendants in the district court for the northern district of ohio ended in a mistrial after the jury was unable to reach a verdict on some of the charges.the district court ordered an immediate retrial,which began on august.jones entered a guilty plea on the third day of trial thus,the trial proceeded against the present defendants,gray and jackson.
on august,the jury found gray guilty of one count of conspiring to conduct the affairs of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity rico conspiracy,in violation of d count three counts of conspiring to obstruct interstate commerce by extortion hobbs act conspiracy,in violation of a counts,and twelve counts of obstructing interstate commerce by extortion substantive hobbs act violations,contrary to a counts and and twenty counts of honest services mail and wire fraud,in violation of,and counts,and gray entered a plea of guilty to tax evasion count,in violation of,a charge that had been severed from the primary trial.
the jury convicted jackson on one count of rico conspiracy count two counts of hobbs act conspiracy counts and one count of a substantive hobbs act violation count and four counts of honest services mail and wire fraud counts and.the jury acquitted jackson on eight counts of mail and wire fraud counts and.
following the jury verdict,defendants moved for a judgment of acquittal new trial under federal rule of criminal procedure.the district court denied defendants motions.see united states gray,docket,wl,unpublished.
the district court sentenced gray to months of imprisonment on the rico and hobbs act counts and to months of imprisonment on the tax evasion and fraud counts,with all sentences to be served concurrently.the court ordered gray to pay in restitution and in special assessments.jackson was sentenced to concurrent terms of months of imprisonment on counts,and and to concurrent terms of months of imprisonment on counts and.the district court ordered jackson to pay in costs and in restitution.
in these consolidated appeals,gray and jackson now timely appeal their convictions.gray also appeals his sentences.
the prosecution case against defendants consisted of,in significant part,wiretap evidence obtained pursuant to title iii,which sets forth specific procedural requirements that must be followed before the government will be allowed to intercept the private conversations of citizens.as a prerequisite to surveillance,the government must submit a properly authorized application and obtain an approval order from a judge of competent jurisdiction.the act not only delineates the substantive provisions that must be included in both the surveillance application and authorizing order,but also proscribes the offenses covered under the act,requires specific findings of fact on the part of the issuing judge with regard to probable cause,and places temporal limitations on the validity of the order.the supreme court has explained that this system evinces congress clear intent to make doubly sure that the statutory authority be used with restraint and only where circumstances warrant the surreptitious interception of wire and oral communications.united states staffeldt,cir quoting united states giordano,d.
title iii provides for the suppression of all or part of the contents of intercepted wire or oral communications if the disclosure of that information would be in violation of this chapter.any aggrieved person in any trial,hearing,or proceeding in or before any court may move to suppress intercepted communications on three grounds i the communication was unlawfully intercepted ii the order of authorization or approval under which it was interpreted is insufficient on its face or iii the interception was not made in conformity with the order of authorization or approval.a.
the words unlawfully intercepted contained in paragraph i are themselves not limited to constitutional violations,but may include statutory infringements.giordano,at.however,the supreme court did not go so far as to suggest that every failure to comply fully with any requirement provided in title iii would render the interception of wire or oral communications unlawful.united states chavez,d.to the contrary,suppression is required under paragraph i only for a failure to satisfy any of those statutory requirements that directly and substantially implement the congressional intention to limit the use of intercept procedures to those situations clearly calling for the employment of this extraordinary investigative device.united states donovan,d quoting giordano,at.
while paragraphs ii and iii of a must be deemed to provide suppression for failure to observe some of the statutory requirements that would not render interceptions unlawful under paragraph i,giordano,at,every circuit to consider the question has held that a ii does not require suppression if the facial insufficiency of the wiretap order is no more than a technical defect.united states moore,cir citing cases from the second,third,fifth,sixth,and ninth circuit courts of appeals.indeed,as represented accurately by the moore court,we have held that suppression is not required for every minor facial insufficiency.united states vigi,cir quoting united states acon,cir.
before trial,gray,joined by jackson,filed motions to suppress the title iii intercepts and video surveillance that were used in the investigation on the ground that the government failed to comply with the statutory prerequisites of the surveillance application process.in its subsequent decision denying defendants motions to suppress,see united states gray,d,the district court explained the factual background giving rise to defendants claims 
the wiretaps originated with a january,application submitted by david sierleja,an attorney of the doj.sierleja made the application as an investigative or law enforcement officer under title iii.the january application has several defects.first,sierleja had received approval for the application from deputy assistant attorney general malcolm,who is a official authorized to review and approve title iii wiretaps.however,the january,application does not identify the justice department official who approved the application.the title iii application also does not include a copy of the letter from the doj official that approved the intercept.in addition,the january,application was not sworn under oath or affirmation,and it does not indicate the time when assistant united states attorney sierleja executed it.sierleja filed the application on january.
on january,judge oliver reviewed the application and issued an order granting an application to commence a title iii wiretap of gray various phone business and cellular phone numbers.like the application,the order does not identify the justice department official who approved the application.
following the expiration of the period,the government sought to renew the wiretap.in applying to renew the wiretaps,however,the government failed to comply with the statutory requirement that a doj official approve the renewal application.a district court judge granted the application.after later appreciating that the government had not obtained necessary approval from any authorized justice department official,the government the tainted interceptions from the unauthorized renewal applications,spanning from february,to may.gov t,dkt,at.
seeking to correct the problem associated with the interceptions from february,through may,the government filed a new title iii wiretap application on july,regarding the same phone numbers.correcting the problems in the earlier applications,the july,application identifies the authorizing official and attaches two exhibits the doj letter specially designating the authorizing official and the authorizing official letter approving the july,intercept.in attempting to show probable cause for this july,application,the government repeated many of the probable cause allegations that were contained in its january,application.however,the government also added evidence intercepted in the january,through february,period of wiretaps and evidence derived independently.judge matia approved the application on july,and the clerk office filed the documents under seal.
id.at footnotes omitted.
in april,after defendants moved to suppress the wiretaps,the district court held a suppression hearing,at which the parties examined the january and july applications and orders for the intercepts.id.at.after the hearing,the government proffered that,if required,judge oliver would testify that he was aware that sierleja had obtained doj approval for the january,application before he signed the order.id.at.the district court denied the government motion to accept the proffer,but reopened the hearing in may to allow sierleja to testify regarding the circumstances surrounding the submission of his application for title iii surveillance.id.sierleja testified that when he applied for the initial wiretap in january,he told judge oliver that he had obtained authorization from a doj official specially designated to approve wiretap applications before submitting the application.sierleja had the authorization letter with him when he appeared before judge oliver but did not show the letter to the court.id.according to the district court,i t is not clear from the record whether sierleja informed judge oliver of the name of the authorizing official or whether he merely informed judge oliver that he had obtained approval.id.
on june,following the reconvened hearing,the district court issued its opinion and order denying defendants motions to suppress the title iii wiretap evidence.in a separate order issued on june,the district court denied gray motion to suppress interceptions from a closed circuit television camera placed in his office.defendants now contest the denial of their motions to suppress on the same grounds presented to the district court.
when reviewing a district court ruling on a motion to suppress a wiretap,we will reverse the court findings of fact only if they are clearly erroneous.united states rice,cir.we review de novo questions of law,including legal conclusions as to the existence of probable cause.id.in reviewing the validity of a title iii surveillance order,we will accord great deference to the determinations of the issuing judge.however,this deference does not logically apply where the issuing judge is given misleading information in the wiretap application or supporting affidavits.id.internal citation and quotation marks omitted.
defendants cite numerous alleged defects on the faces of the january and july applications and orders,and in the process used to obtain them,that require suppression of some or all of the derivative evidence secured by the wiretaps.the question before us is whether the district court erred in concluding that these purported imperfections did not constitute grounds for suppression under a.
first,defendants allege that the january and july wiretap applications violate,which requires the approval of a wiretap application by the attorney general or a doj official specially designated by the attorney general.although the authorization letters for the january and july applications in this case were signed by deputy assistant attorney general john malcolm,the text of the letters includes the typed name of michael chertoff,assistant attorney general,criminal division,department of justice,indicating that chertoff drafted the letters.defendants thus contend that the applications are is unclear which official,if any,actually authorized the,if it was malcolm,argue that he was not specially designated under to approve the application.
defendants also cite the government admitted noncompliance with a related each application and order shall include the identity of the doj official authorizing the additional grounds for suppression.a and d.it is undisputed in this case that the january application and order violate a and d through the omission of the name of the authorizing official on the face of the documents.gray,d at.the district court nonetheless concluded that any defects in the january and july applications and orders did not warrant suppression under the circumstances.we agree.
in giordano,the supreme court held that of title iii plainly calls for the prior,informed judgment of enforcement officers desiring court approval for intercept authority,and investigative personnel may not themselves ask a judge for authority to wiretap or eavesdrop.the mature judgment of a particular,responsible department of justice official is interposed as a critical precondition to any judicial order.giordano,at.the court concluded that the executive assistant to the attorney general was not such a specially designated official empowered by to authorize applications for wiretap orders consequently,a title iii wiretap application authorized by the executive assistant was unlawful under paragraph i of a,and required suppression of evidence derived from the ensuing court order.id.at.the court reasoned that because the provision for approval was intended to play a central role in the statutory scheme suppression must follow when it is shown that this statutory requirement has been ignored.id.at.
the giordano court concluded,however,that suppression was not warranted under paragraph ii of a because the order,on its face,clearly,though erroneously,identified an assistant attorney general as the justice department officer authorizing the application,pursuant to special designation by the attorney general.id.at.
in chavez,a companion case to giordano,the court held that where the evidence showed that the attorney general had actually authorized the contested wiretap application,the fact that the application and court order misidentified an assistant attorney general as the authorizing official did not render the resultant interceptions unlawful under paragraph i,or the application insufficient on its face under paragraph ii of a,so as to require suppression for failure to comply with 
here,the interception order clearly identified on its face assistant attorney general wilson as the person who authorized the application to be made.under,he properly could give such approval had he been specially designated to do so by the attorney general,as the order recited.that this has subsequently been shown to be incorrect does not detract from the facial insufficiency of the order.moreover,it appears that the attorney general authorized the application,as he also had the power to do under.in no realistic sense,therefore,can it be said that the order failed to identify an authorizing official who possessed statutory power to approve the making of the application.
chavez,at.footnote omitted.
the chavez court also addressed the issue of misidentification of the authorizing official in the context of a and d 
the application and order for the chavez wiretap did not correctly identify the individual authorizing the application,as a and d require.of this there is no doubt.but it does not follow that because of this deficiency in reporting,evidence obtained pursuant to the order may not be used at a trial of respondents.there is no claim of any constitutional infirmity arising from this defect,nor would there be any merit to such a claim,and we must look to the statutory scheme to determine if congress has provided that suppression is required for this particular procedural error.
the court reviewed the legislative history of these provisions and found that the requirements serve primarily to fix responsibility for the source of the preliminary approval.id.at.thus,
w hile adherence to the identification reporting requirements of a and d can simplify the assurance that those whom title iii makes responsible for determining when and how wiretapping and electronic surveillance should be conducted have fulfilled their roles in each case,it does not establish a substantive role to be played in the regulatory system.
nor is there any legislative history concerning these sections,as there is,for example,concerning,to suggest that they were meant,by themselves,to occupy a central,or even functional,role in guarding against unwarranted use of wiretapping or electronic surveillance.
chavez,at.emphasis added.
the chavez court therefore concluded that because the misidentification of the authorizing official did not affect the fulfillment of any of the reviewing or approval functions required by congress,id.at,suppression was not necessary under the circumstances 
when it is clearly established,therefore,that authorization of submission of a wiretap or electronic surveillance application has been given by the attorney general himself,but the application,and,as a result,the interception order incorrectly state that approval has instead been given by a specially designated assistant attorney general,the misidentification,by itself,will not render interceptions conducted under the order unlawful within the meaning of a i or the disclosure of the contents of intercepted communications,or derivative evidence,otherwise in violation of title iii within the meaning of.
although the chavez court hinted in dicta that it was unpersuaded by the contention that an order incorrectly identifying who authorized the application is equivalent to an order failing to identify anyone at all as the authorizing official when measured for facial insufficiency under a ii,id.at,the court never reached the present issue of complete omission of an authorizing official identity from a title iii application or order.
nonetheless,we agree with the district court that the present case resembles misidentification cases where courts refused to suppress the intercepted conversations when an authorizing official in fact approved the application because the courts emphasized that the court had notice that the justice department authorized the application.gray,d at citing united states,cir misidentification in application not grounds for suppression where court approving order knew of it and authorization letter was attached to application.
in the wake of giordano and chavez,we,along with other courts,have held that suppression is not warranted under or a and d when a wiretap application or order either misidentifies a doj official who could not legally authorize the wiretap or,as in the present case,identifies no official at all,so long as the record shows that a statutorily designated official actually gave the authorization.see united states callum,cir failure to identify any approving doj official in wiretap order deemed minor insufficiency for which suppression is not the appropriate remedy,where issuing judge was presented with written doj authorization for wiretap before signing order united states radcliff,cir,and united states fudge,cir where applications were in fact approved by specially designated doj officials,failure in wiretap orders to name individuals who authorized application was merely a technical defect that did not require suppression united states lawson,cir,and united states swann,cir facial insufficiency of applications indicating approval by official not statutorily designated to approve wiretap applications did not require suppression where attorney general in fact approved applications and vigi,at suppression not required where wiretap application identified acting assistant attorney general as authorizing official,but attorney general actually approved it.
in the present case,the district court found that deputy assistant attorney general malcolm was specially designated to authorize the title iii applications,pursuant to a march,order from then attorney general john ashcroft designating any deputy assistant attorney general of the criminal division as having authority to approve wiretap applications malcolm thus had authority to,and did in fact,authorize the january and july applications given his authority,malcolm was thus presumed to have properly exercised that power and the condition s precedent are presumed to have been met unless the defendants offer evidence,apart from mere conjecture or speculation,to rebut this presumption and that defendants failed to introduce sufficient evidence to legitimately dispute the authenticity of malcolm authorizations.gray,d at quoting,at.the district court therefore held that suppression of the january and july applications was not required under.
we find no clear error in the factual determinations of the district court.the evidence of record confirms that malcolm had the authority as a specially designated official to approve the applications and did in fact do so.under these circumstances,the underlying purpose of to insure that decisions to wiretap were made by the named officials and did not reach into the lower echelons of command was served.united states lambert,cir emphasis omitted quoting united states cox,cir.we therefore conclude that suppression of the evidence obtained from the january and july applications and court orders was not required under a i or ii for failure to obtain approval from a specially designated official.
moreover,as the district court explained so succinctly,b ecause the procedures employed in this case sufficiently fixed responsibility with the justice department,which satisfies the underlying purpose of the identification requirement of a and d,suppression is not warranted for omitting malcolm name from the january application and order.gray,d at.the essential safeguards of title iii were not undermined judge oliver had notice that a qualified specially designated official had approved the application before his perusal and approval of the order.the district court was justifiably to find any resultant prejudice to defendants.id.at.in light of defendants opportunity to examine the application and order at the suppression hearing,and the fact that the application actually had been authorized by malcolm despite the identification omission,there was no prejudice to defendants arising from this breach of a requirement that does not occupy a central,or even functional,role in guarding against unwarranted use of wiretapping or electronic surveillance.chavez,at.the violation,technical rather than substantive in nature,did not require suppression of the january application under a.
defendants allege failure by the government to make the application upon oath or affirmation as required by.although the final page of the application containing sierleja signature was not signed by judge oliver,the application stated that sierleja had been duly sworn and the order signed by judge oliver approving the application stated that sierleja made the application under oath.under these circumstances,the district court properly found that had been satisfied.gray,d at see also united states florea,cir failure of fbi agent to sign affidavit in support of title iii application did not warrant suppression under where judge based order on agent oral sworn statements made in his presence,as well as the written application.
in their appeals,defendants raise several other grounds for reversal of the district court orders denying their motions to suppress evidence obtained through electronic surveillance and television recordings.they allege that there was insufficient probable cause to support issuance of the wiretap orders under the necessity requirement of c was not satisfied with regard to the january and july applications the government failed to minimize the interception of conversations as required by the government failed to terminate its surveillance upon attainment of the authorized objective,or in any event in thirty days,the government failed to timely notify defendants that surveillance had ceased under d and the district court erroneously denied gray motion to suppress television recordings.based upon our review of the record,however,we conclude that these issues lack merit and do not warrant further review.the district court was thorough in its analysis and correct in its conclusions that none of these stated grounds mandate suppression of the surveillance evidence obtained under title iii or the video recordings.we therefore affirm the district court orders denying defendants motions to suppress.
defendants contend that the district court erred in refusing to require the government to disclose the conversations that were illegally intercepted between february,and may,and subsequently sealed by the government the court denied defendants multiple motions to inspect the communications made during and after trial.we review the district court decision on this discovery matter for an abuse of discretion.united states in currency,cir.
section of title iii makes it unlawful to intentionally disclose to any other person or to intentionally use the contents of any wire,oral or electronic communication,knowing or having reason to know that the information was obtained through the interception of a wire,oral,or electronic communication in violation of the statutory provisions,c,d.section expressly prohibits the use of such unlawful communications in a court proceeding 
whenever any wire or oral communication has been intercepted,no part of the contents of such communication and no evidence derived therefrom may be received in any trial,hearing,or other proceeding in or before any court if the disclosure of that information would be in violation of this chapter.
gray contends that he was entitled to disclosure of the sealed communications under several judicially recognized exceptions to the disclosure prohibitions of and.we conclude,however,that none of these exceptions applies to the sweeping disclosure sought by defendants.
the protection of of the purposes of title iii requires strict controls on the repetition of the contents of illegally intercepted communications.nix,cir.each time the illicitly obtained recording is replayed to a new and different listener,the scope of the invasion widens and the aggrieved party injury is aggravated.id.at quoting fultz gilliam,cir.consequently,we have been loath to allow the republication of illegally obtained wiretap evidence and have limited disclosure to very narrow circumstances.id.at.
first,gray maintains that he was entitled to use the suppressed wiretaps for impeachment purposes.however,w hether or not an impeachment exception exists at all is an open question in this circuit.united states wuliger,cir.we have noted that the handful of other courts that have recognized such an exception in criminal cases have limited it to use by the government.id.at citing united states,cir united states vest,cir anthony united states,cir and united states caron,cir see also nix,at citing wuliger,at.under the present circumstances,there is no convincing reason to create,let alone expand to defendant,an impeachment exception where the illegally obtained conversations were by the government and not available for use by either party at trial.moreover,the record reflects that even without access to the suppressed tapes,gray attorney conducted extensive of the government witnesses and was able to point out contradictions in the witnesses testimony to the jury.accordingly,gray attempt to compel disclosure of the illegal intercepts for this purpose must fail.
the clean hands exception to the proscriptions of title iii likewise does not require disclosure under the present circumstances.consistent with the limitation on disclosure of title iii intercepts for impeachment purposes,the clean hands exception permits only the government,not a defendant,to use the contents of illegal wiretaps if it played no role in the interception.nix,at citing united states murdock,at,cir.the defense,adjudication,and consent to use exceptions similarly do not justify disclosure here,for the reasons stated by the district court in its may,opinion denying defendants motion to inspect the suppressed applications,orders,and intercepts.
gray also argues that disclosure is mandated under the jencks act,a,b,which provides in pertinent part 
a in any criminal prosecution brought by the united states,no statement or report in the possession of the united states which was made by a government witness or prospective government witness other than the defendant shall be the subject of subpoena,discovery,or inspection until said witness has testified on direct examination in the trial of the case.
b after a witness called by the united states has testified on direct examination,the court shall,on motion of the defendant,order the united states to produce any statement as hereinafter defined of the witness in the possession of the united states which relates to the subject matter as to which the witness has testified.if the entire contents of any such statement relate to the subject matter of the testimony of the witness,the court shall order it to be delivered directly to the defendant for his examination and use.
we have not recognized an exception to title iii disclosure prohibitions for statements made under the jencks act.indeed,as the district court observed,the issue of whether the jencks act requirements trump the title iii prohibitions of and is an issue of first impression in this court.we agree with the district court assessment,however,that because gray could not have used the illegally intercepted statements to impeach government witnesses,nix,at,disclosure of the unlawful wiretaps would not serve the distinct purpose of the jencks act,which 
was designed to prevent defendants from engaging in blind fishing expeditions through the government files,see,united states pope,cir,but at the same time,to assure defendants of their sixth amendment right to confront their accusers by compelling the government to produce statements useful for impeachment of government witnesses.united states carter,cir.the act accommodates both of these concerns by protecting the government interests before trial and by protecting the defendant rights at trial,since under the act the impeachment material is disclosed in time to be used by the defense at trial.
united states presser,cir.
furthermore,the government did not review the unlawful wiretaps,but them when the illegalities came to light.thus,defendants are not presented with the paramount concern voiced in the denial of access to facts known to the prosecution but not to a defendant would hinder the defendant meaningful because witnesses were not made equally available to both parties.we therefore conclude that the jencks act does not,under the circumstances,open a door to inspection of these illegally intercepted communications.
likewise,federal rule of criminal procedure a b i does not require that the government make the sealed wiretaps available to defendants.this rule requires disclosure of any relevant written or recorded statement by the defendant if the statement is within the government possession,custody,or control and the attorney for the government through due diligence could the statement exists,fed.a b i.
citing lanier bryant,cir,gray contends that title iii does not preclude disclosure of the illegal intercepts under rule.in lanier,a federal prisoner brought a civil action against several government prosecutors and law enforcement agents,pursuant to and other statutes,alleging that the defendants violated c of title iii by disclosing illegally intercepted telephone conversations in response to his rule discovery request.lanier,at.we affirmed the district court order granting summary judgment in favor of the defendants,holding that s ince the recordings were of lanier,and lanier presumably requested their disclosure during discovery in his criminal prosecution,any disclosure made pursuant to rule could not constitute an illegal disclosure.id.at.
lanier is not persuasive authority for several reasons.first,unlike the present case,it did not involve a criminal prosecution,but a civil action.second,there are dispositive factual differences between lanier and the case at hand.in the context of lanier prosecution,there was neither a finding by this court nor a concession by the government that the conversations were illegally intercepted.see united states lanier,cir,vacated on other grounds,cir although the government claimed that it acted lawfully in intercepting the cordless telephone calls,it nevertheless agreed not to use the tape recordings of the cordless telephone conversations at trial.significantly,in united states lanier,the government had access to and knowledge of the contents of the intercepted phone conversations and used the intercepts during the course of its criminal prosecution of lanier.conversely,the government in the present case the admittedly illegal intercepts without reviewing the contents.
thus,even assuming arguendo that lanier bryant creates an exception to title iii disclosure prohibition in the context of rule,the government in the instant case provided defendant in discovery with all of the wiretap tapes to which it had access and could not have used the illegally intercepted which it was the investigation or at trial.under these circumstances,title iii does not require the disclosure requested by gray 
finally,defendants argue that without access to the tainted surveillance,there is no way to determine whether any of the information gleaned from it was used to secure the additional untainted wiretaps.defendants suggest that the government case may have been tainted by the unlawful interceptions and claim that fbi agent peter smith,a government witness,may have reviewed the suppressed tapes.however,during questioning outside of the presence of the jury,smith testified that he was assigned to this case to replace agents who might have been exposed to the illegally obtained wiretaps and that he was never privy to the contents of the suppressed tapes.thus,the district court properly concluded that there was no evidence of a taint that would justify disclosure of the suppressed wiretaps 
none of the remaining arguments raised by defendants in favor of disclosure of the illegally obtained intercepts convince us that the district court abused its discretion in denying access of the materials to defendants.
next,gray and jackson challenge their convictions under the hobbs act on grounds of insufficient evidence.
we review de novo the district court denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal.united states mcauliffe,cir.the pertinent inquiry is whether,after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution and giving it the benefit of all reasonable inferences from the testimony,any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.id.
gray and jackson question the viability of their hobbs act convictions in light of our recent decision in united states brock,cir,which was issued after oral argument in our court on these consolidated appeals.defendants requested,and we permitted,supplemental briefing on the impact of brock on their hobbs act convictions.
the hobbs act,makes it unlawful to obstruct,delay,or affect commerce by robbery or extortion or attempt or conspire to do so a.section b defines extortion as the obtaining of property from another,with his consent,induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened force,violence,or fear,or under color of official right.b.rather than requiring an explicit promise,the elements of extortion are satisfied by something short of a formalized and thoroughly articulated contractual arrangement,merely knowing that the payment was made in return for official acts is enough.united states hamilton,cir quoting united states blandford,cir.
generally,to convict a defendant of aiding and abetting extortion,the government must prove that the defendant aided the inducement of a victim to part with property that he did so knowingly and willingly with extortionate means and that interstate commerce was affected.united states,cir.
under the color of official right theory that is alleged in the instant case,a public official obtains a payment to which he was not entitled,knowing that the payment was made in return for official acts.united states kelley,cir quoting evans united states,d.it is not essential that a public official have final authority t he hobbs act reaches anyone who actually exercises official powers.united states collins,cir internal citation and quotation marks omitted.
it is well settled in this circuit that a private citizen who is not in the process of becoming a public official may be convicted of hobbs act extortion under the color of official right theory only if that private citizen either conspires with,or aids and abets,a public official in the act of extortion.kelley,at quoting united states saadey,cir see also collins,at private individuals may be convicted of extortion under color of official right where the individual aided and abetted a public official receipt of money to which he was not entitled.the underlying rationale is that o ne who collects the extorted payments is no less guilty than the official he serves.collins,at internal citation and quotation marks omitted.
in brock,we examined closely the portion of the hobbs act that defines extortion as the obtaining of property from another,with his consent,b emphasis added.against the backdrop of charges of conspiracy to commit extortion under color of official right,we concluded that this statutory language is far more than mere surplusage.
the two defendants in brock were bail bond company owners who bribed a court clerk to prevent the collection of bonds when their clients absconded.they were convicted of conspiring with the clerk to extort property under color of official right,in violation of the hobbs act,a.brock,at.the defendants contended on appeal that the hobbs act did not permit them to be convicted of conspiring to extort their own property,and we agreed,reversing their convictions.we opined that 
t o be covered by the statute,the alleged conspirators must have formed an agreement to obtain property from another,which is to say,formed an agreement to obtain property from someone outside the conspiracy.yet that did not happen.these three people did not agree,and could not have agreed,to obtain property from another when no other person was the property,so far as the record shows,went from one coconspirator one of the brocks to another the court clerk.we see no reason to ignore the property from another requirement and ample reason to give it content 
in addition to requiring the conspirators to agree to obtain property from another,the statute requires the conspirators to obtain that property with the other consent.how do or why would people conspire to obtain their own consent 
id.at citation omitted.
we further explained,in broader terms,that 
t he hobbs act is meant to prohibit public officials from obtaining property from others by extortion.yet sweeping the brocks within its coverage through a conspiracy theory effectively transforms the act into a prohibition on paying bribes to public officials.while the definition of extortion under color of official right correctly extends to public officials who accept a bribe when there is a quid pro quo for the payment,see evans united states,d united states harding,cir,neither the supreme court nor our court has construed the statute to cover private individuals who offer a bribe to public officials.congress knows how to prohibit the giving or offering of bribes directly citing,and.having opted not to punish the giving of bribes directly,congress should not be treated as having prohibited them through the sleight of indictment of an extortion conspiracy.
we thus concluded that when the government chooses to indict what it believes is bribery of state officials under a hobbs act conspiracy,e ither the act picks up all perpetrators,acquiescors and victims,or it picks up none of them.we say it picks up none of them and would leave it to congress if it wishes to do what it has done before make it a crime to offer or give a bribe to a public official.id.at.
nonetheless,we reaffirmed the principle established in kelley and collins,that t he government remains free to charge private individuals with violating the hobbs act when they conspire with public officials or aid and abet them in an extortion scheme it just must satisfy the property from another and with his consent requirements in doing so.id.at 
gray and jackson argue that here,as in brock,the conduct underlying their convictions is not within the scope of the hobbs act.according to defendants,the evidence,at best,alleges a scheme to bribe state officials,but does not demonstrate that defendants conspired with,or aided and abetted,public officials in obtaining property from another,a third party.gray and jackson assert that no third party was ever coerced or asked to make a payment in return for an official act instead,taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,payments were made directly by defendants to public officials to gain favor and to improve their lot as consultants.
it is therefore incumbent upon us to evaluate the proofs pertaining to the discrete transactions in three different cities that are the bases of the hobbs act convictions against defendants we conclude that gray convictions on counts,and,and jackson conviction on count,must be reversed.
east cleveland,ohio 
gray was convicted on counts through of the superseding indictment,which alleged hobbs act violations as they related to gray transactions with emmanuel onunwor,the mayor of east cleveland from to and a former city councilman count averred a hobbs act conspiracy by gray,onunwor,and others,including public officials in east cleveland,gray clients,and gray consulting associates,stemming from an alleged agreement by gray and the others to provide things of value to public officials,including onunwor,in return for official acts involving the governance of the city of east cleveland.the related substantive hobbs act counts counts each alleged that on a specific date,gray and others,aiding and abetting each other,attempted to and did obstruct,delay,and affect commerce through extortion,by emmanuel onunwor obtaining,under color of official right,cash in an envelope from nate gray with his consent.
the evidence indicates that when onunwor began experiencing financial difficulties in,gray provided him with cash on several occasions,and,after onunwor was elected mayor,gray and onunwor formed a business relationship,pursuant to which onunwor received payments from gray to influence his decisions as mayor and steer municipal contracts to gray.at monthly meetings,recorded by a surveillance camera in gray office,gray handed onunwor envelopes containing to in cash.
onunwor testified that payments he received from gray after his election as east cleveland mayor were bribes that influenced his decision to make sure that those contracts went to gray.onunwor also testified that he took specific official actions in exchange for the payments.there was overwhelming evidence that gray monthly cash payments to onunwor were funded by entities seeking to obtain or retain contracts with the city.
in one instance,east cleveland contracted with a local law firm to assist in the collection of overdue income taxes.after gray discussed the law firm contract with onunwor,onunwor advised the law firm partners that if they wanted to keep the contract,they needed to work with gray.thus,in may,the law firm entered into a consulting agreement with gray,pursuant to which the firm made an initial payment to gray and monthly payments of thereafter,for a total of during the course of the agreement with gray.the law firm tax collection contract continued until,when it was phased out in response to a state audit,which found an alternative,less expensive agency to perform these functions.four days after the state audit report was issued,the law firm terminated its consulting agreement with gray.
gray also approached onunwor about finding municipal work for another client,ralph tyler company rtc,a cleveland engineering firm.in response,onunwor dismissed the company that had an existing engineering contract with the city,replaced it with rtc,and awarded engineering contracts to rtc.after the city professional services agreement with rtc took effect,gray increased the amount of his monthly payments to onunwor to.when onunwor asked gray for to to finance a trip to africa,gray responded that he would talk to ralph tyler about it and eventually gave onunwor the money.
another engineering firm,hill contracted with east cleveland to run the city water department after gray set up the initial meeting between representatives and onunwor.onunwor insisted that the city council approve the contract with without seeking bids from other companies.from january through early,paid rtc,which had no involvement in the water contract,a monthly fee for consulting services.rtc passed the payments directly to gray company,etna associates.initially paid rtc each month,and rtc added from its own account,paying gray.the monthly payments from eventually increased to,all of which went to gray.after the city contracted with,gray increased his payments to onunwor to each month.a state audit later determined that the city contract with cost more than twice as much as it would for the city to operate its water services internally.
this abundant evidence of gray illicit transactions with onunwor and third parties clearly shows that gray conspired with,and aided and abetted,onunwor extortion of property from another,with their consent,by funneling payments from gray clients,seeking municipal contracts,to onunwor while he was acting under color of official right.thus,the evidence is sufficient to sustain gray convictions on counts through of the superseding indictment.
houston,texas 
gray hobbs act convictions on counts through,and jackson convictions on counts and,stem from their interactions with monique mcgilbra,the director of building services for the city of houston,texas,and allegations that gray and jackson provided money and gifts to mcgilbra in exchange for mcgilbra assistance in securing municipal contracts for gray corporate clients and business associates.count alleged a hobbs act conspiracy between gray,jackson,honeywell corporation brent jividen,mcgilbra,and others,including gray clients and gray consulting associates,who allegedly provided things of value,including money,luxury items and food,to houston public officials mcgilbra and oliver spellman,in return for official acts intended to benefit gray,the gray businesses,jividen,and honeywell.
counts,and alleged that favors were provided to mcgilbra and her boyfriend,garland hardeman,in exchange for official acts.count related to a cleveland browns football weekend provided to mcgilbra and hardeman by gray and jividen,in return for her assistance in securing subcontracts from reliant energy for honeywell.count,the only substantive hobbs act count on which jackson was convicted,alleged that gray,jackson,and jividen provided mcgilbra and hardeman with an super bowl weekend in new orleans,louisiana,in exchange for mcgilbra use of her official position to ensure that honeywell was retained as a subcontractor on a houston energy contract.count arose out of gray purchase of a louis vuitton purse for mcgilbra.
at trial,the government presented substantial evidence supporting these charges.from to,gray was employed as a consultant by honeywell and received regular payments under a series of contracts with the company.in,honeywell expressed an interest in being hired as a subcontractor for reliant energy,one of the companies competing for a million contract to provide electricity and energy efficiency services to the city of houston,texas.mcgilbra,in her official capacity as director of building services,oversaw the energy contract.gray invited mcgilbra to attend a cleveland browns football game in october,telling her that he would take care of all expenses,including accommodations.mcgilbra and hardeman stayed at the ritz carlton hotel,charged a massage and flowers to the room account,and enjoyed a dinner paid for by gray.the next day,mcgilbra and hardeman attended the football game with gray and jividen.during the game,jividen discussed honeywell interest in securing energy contracts through the city of houston.
gray thereafter hired hardeman as a consultant to assist honeywell in obtaining a share of the houston energy contract.the consulting contract provided that hardeman would receive half of one percent of the gross revenue that honeywell received under the energy contract.mcgilbra subsequently demanded half of whatever compensation hardeman received,purportedly because she had directed hardeman to gray in the first place.mcgilbra thereafter told reliant that she wanted reliant proposal to the city to include honeywell as a subcontractor.reliant complied and added honeywell as a subcontractor for services.mcgilbra recommended to the mayor that reliant be selected as houston energy services provider,and reliant was in fact awarded the contract in december.
the evidence established that honeywell funded mcgilbra cleveland weekend.mcgilbra testified at the trial that she realized during the football weekend in cleveland in october that this whole thing was sort of a set up and that honeywell was involved in paying for the weekend.her suspicions were correct.the cleveland weekend expenses were charged to honeywell executive jividen credit card.mcgilbra knew that hardeman would be compensated under this agreement with gray and would share the money with her only if honeywell received payments under the houston energy contract.mcgilbra acknowledged that she used her official position with the city of houston to ensure that reliant was awarded the contract and that honeywell was selected as a subcontractor.
gray continued to provide mcgilbra with favors during the initial phase of the houston energy contract he purchased tickets and accommodations for mcgilbra and hardeman to attend the super bowl in new orleans in february,treated mcgilbra and her family to a dinner in florida,and purchased a designer purse for mcgilbra.mcgilbra testified that after buying the purse,gray questioned her about the status of honeywell houston contract and expressed concern about possible competition for the contract by another company.gray submitted the invoices for the super bowl tickets and accommodations directly to honeywell for payment.during this time period,honeywell was making monthly payments of to gray for his services as a consultant.the jury heard a taped discussion between gray and jividen,during which they talked about mcgilbra expenses for the super bowl trip and mcgilbra resultant indebtedness to them as honeywell representatives.
mcgilbra testified that at the time of the super bowl,she was supervising the energy contract in houston for reliant energy and that honeywell would not make money on the contract until it reached a second phase.thus,the jury could reasonably infer that gray,jividen,and jackson provided an incentive to mcgilbra,in the form of super bowl entertainment,to ensure her cooperation in expediting the contract.this evidence additionally indicated that honeywell was the source of the funds used by gray to finance the super bowl weekend and to purchase the designer purse for mcgilbra.
although jackson attempts to minimize his involvement with gray,mcgilbra,and hardeman during the super bowl weekend and suggests that he was merely being hospitable to guests,rather than aiding gray and jividen in the manipulation of municipal contracts,the government provided substantial evidence that jackson assisted in the scheme by delivering the super bowl tickets to mcgilbra hotel.a taped conversation between gray and jackson was played for the jury during the trial.in the conversation,jackson agreed to host mcgilbra during the super bowl weekend and told gray to tell hardeman that i have his tickets.jackson also stated that he planned to try to switch their tickets with somebody,and gray assured jackson that if there a cost associated with that just let me know and i take care of it.jackson entertained mcgilbra and hardeman by taking them out to dine on more than one occasion,including brunch with the mayor of new orleans.
gray paid jackson a monthly fee to assist gray in obtaining public contracts for corporate clients,including honeywell.gray told honeywell executive jividen that he had gilbert at.when jividen responded that too much for what he doing for us right now,gray insisted that he has done a lot.in light of this conversation insinuating jackson participation and jackson own comments,the jury was free to disbelieve the innocent explanation for the incriminating facts proved by the government.united states schreane,cir internal quotation omitted.
contrary to defendants claims,and unlike brock,where the illegal payments came from defendants own bank accounts or from their company bank account,at,the evidence showed that the payments and privileges bestowed upon mcgilbra did not originate with defendants.gray corporate clients,seeking government contracts,funneled the illegal payments through defendants to mcgilbra.we therefore conclude that the evidence was sufficient to sustain defendants convictions on these counts.
gray was convicted on two other substantive hobbs act counts,counts and,that alleged illegal transactions with oliver spellman,the chief of staff for houston mayor.count alleged that gray and others known and unknown to the grand jury,aiding and abetting each other,attempted to and did obstruct,delay and affect commerce and the movement of a good or commodity through commerce through extortion,by oliver spellman obtaining under color of official right approximately in cash from gray with his consent.count similarly charged gray and others with aiding and abetting each other and obstructing commerce through extortion by oliver spellman obtaining,under color of official right,a hotel stay in las vegas,nevada from gray with his consent.
the evidence bearing on these counts indicates that in,gray was part of a joint venture,first transit,that was bidding for a contract to operate a shuttle service at the houston airport.gray was concerned that houston mayor lee brown might favor a local contractor who was competing for the contract.gray paid spellman in cash in july and paid the hotel bill for spellman trip to las vegas in september.in exchange,spellman provided gray with information about the mayor position on the competing bids for the shuttle contract.gray also made regular payments to the mayor brother,earl brown.gray promised earl brown an incentive if he talked to the mayor about the shuttle contract earl responded that he would make that phone call.first transit was eventually awarded the contract.
however,although others were involved in the joint venture with gray,there was no evidence that the allegedly extortionate payments to and on behalf of spellman came from a source other than gray.the proof therefore can not support the convictions of gray on counts and,a point that the government concedes.as a result,gray convictions on counts and must be reversed.
new orleans,louisiana 
gray and jackson were both convicted on count,which alleges that gray,jackson,jividen,and others,including new orleans official vincent sylvain and gray clients,conspired to obstruct commerce by extortion by providing to sylvain cash payments and things of value,in return for official acts involving the governance of new orleans.
in early,honeywell sought a million contract to provide energy services to the housing authority of new orleans hano.gray informed jackson of honeywell interest in the contract,and jackson indicated that he could get the initial meeting but from that point on they got ta talk retainer.jackson told gray that this is money to you and i,to which gray responded that we can keep it real clean,real quiet and make some real money.
on february,gray and jackson conducted a conference call with honeywell representatives.jackson stated that he could arrange a meeting with new orleans housing officials,including hano director benjamin bell and sylvain,the mayor executive director of housing.in a private conversation shortly after the conference call ended,gray told jackson that he was going to send jackson to get this thing going a little bit.jackson informed gray that vince in the mayor office was the one pushing this for me,and stated,i gon na flip it to him.a check was drawn on gray etna account to jackson later that day.
jackson called gray the next day to report that he had a great meeting with bell,who had agreed to meet with honeywell representatives to discuss the contract.jackson informed gray that vince had called and that vince wants to be part of a long term thing.gray,in turn,assured jackson that if it did go out yesterday then it went out today for sure.a meeting occurred between jackson and housing officials,including vincent sylvain,but the energy services contract was ultimately not awarded because hano went bankrupt.
the government concedes,and we agree,that although defendants intention was to obtain the contract for honeywell,it has not been proven beyond a reasonable doubt that honeywell actually funded the payment,as opposed to gray making the payment in order to develop a potential business opportunity.because the proofs do not adequately show that gray conspired with sylvain to extort property from another,e,an unrelated entity outside of the conspiracy,the reversal of gray conviction is required.
for these same reasons,jackson conviction on count is likewise rendered infirm.in light of the deficiencies in the proofs regarding the source of the payment,the evidence is insufficient to show that jackson conspired with gray,sylvain,and others to obtain payment from another under color of official right and that jackson served as a conduit for this illegal payment.consequently,the brock error is not harmless and compels reversal of jackson conviction on count.
in their supplemental briefing,defendants argue that,in view of brock,the district court erred by using the word bribery in the jury instructions.the government responds to this argument and also suggests that the court may have erred by not reiterating the from another language in describing the elements of the offense but asserts that any error was harmless,at least as to most of the counts.
we review a district court choice of jury instructions for abuse of discretion.united states ross,cir.a trial court has broad discretion in drafting jury instructions.consequently,an abuse of discretion will be found only if the jury charge fails to accurately reflect the law.id.a judgment may be reversed based upon an improper jury instruction only if the instructions,viewed as a whole,were confusing,misleading,or prejudicial.id.internal citation and quotation marks omitted.
defendants objected to the district court use of the word bribery,but did not object to the court instruction with regard to the from another language.when a defendant fails to object to a final instruction,we review the instruction for plain error.united states blood,cir.
after explaining the statutory violation of a charged in the indictment,the district court instructed the jury on the statutory definition of extortion and twice used the statutory phrase from another with his consent.the from another language was omitted,however,at a later point in the instructions when the court explained the elements of the offense.certainly repetition of the phrase would have been preferable,and we assume for purposes of our analysis that the failure to include it at the later point was error.we agree with the government,however,that any error was harmless as to the counts of conviction supported by sufficient evidence.as to each of those counts,the government presented abundant evidence from which the jury could infer facts supporting a violation of a under brock,and we find no reason to conclude that a different instruction would have resulted in acquittal.
similarly,we find no effect on the verdict from the use of the term bribery in the jury instructions.the word was used only fleetingly as a shorthand way of referring to certain of the hobbs act charges in the indictment,during the part of the instructions describing the various counts of the indictment.the court did not use the word in its explanation of the law to the jurors,and there was no opportunity for confusion as to what conduct was prohibited by statute.if there was any error in the court use of the word,it was surely harmless.
in sum,our decision in brock highlights that where,as here,the government charges private individuals with hobbs act violations under a color of official right theory,it must satisfy the property from another and with his consent requirements of b.brock,at.the government did not meet this burden with respect to the charges against gray in counts,and,and with respect to the charge against jackson in count.we therefore reverse the convictions on these counts,but affirm the remainder of both gray and jackson hobbs act convictions.defendants remaining assignments of error concerning their hobbs act convictions are unfounded.
defendants raise many other issues in these appeals,including challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence regarding their rico and honest services mail and wire fraud convictions the district court denial of motions for severance,cont
