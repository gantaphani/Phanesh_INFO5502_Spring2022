paul johnson appeals his conviction for conspiring to and committing securities fraud in violation of and b,perjury in violation of a,and conspiring to and committing money laundering in violation of a a i and h,a b i and,and.
the evidence produced at trial established that johnson formed link express delivery solutions leds in october,a package delivery service describing itself as a competitor of federal express.johnson,an enterprising man,served as the president,majority shareholder,chairman,and chief executive officer of the company.at the same time that he incorporated leds,johnson also incorporated business management and put that company in the name of his mother,caterina johnson.
this case involves an extensive capital investment scheme whereby johnson procured over million in capital from hundreds of unwary investors through five private stock offerings between and.contrary to his representations to investors that their investments would be used exclusively for financing and operating leds,johnson absconded with over million,which he used to purchase homes,boats,cars,and plastic surgery for various girlfriends,as well as to fund his extensive interest in gambling.he also diverted money from leds to fund a nightclub called bacchanalia that folded three weeks after opening for defaulting on its lease payments.johnson eventually dissolved leds and notified investors that link worldwide logistics lwl,supposedly leds parent company,had taken its place.lwl operated under the same business plan as leds,and johnson once again was the president,chief executive officer,chairman,and majority shareholder.he thereafter convinced investors either to convert their leds shares to lwl shares for a fee of five dollars per share,or to exchange their leds shares for lwl shares without fees,contingent upon their investment of additional money into lwl.using these new investor funds in lwl,johnson purchased pony express,an express delivery service,out of bankruptcy after which it also started to fail as a result of johnson pilfering large amounts of cash from the company up until the point of his arrest in.
on appeal,johnson challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support his convictions,certain evidentiary rulings by the district court,and the denial of his motion to suppress evidence and his motion for continuance.johnson also contends that the district court incorrectly instructed the jury and that his sentence was improper.having reviewed the record,we find more than sufficient evidence to support johnson convictions for perjury and securities fraud.we further find no reversible error in the district court jury instructions,evidentiary rulings and denial of johnson motion to suppress and motion for continuance.finally,after due consideration,we affirm the money laundering convictions set forth in counts of the superseding indictment however,for the reasons set forth below,we vacate johnson money laundering convictions for counts.
money laundering 
with respect to the money laundering charges set forth in counts of the superseding indictment,the jury convicted johnson of laundering more than in proceeds from securities fraud in violation of counts,laundering the proceeds of securities fraud with the intent to conceal such unlawful proceeds by transferring them outside of the united states in violation of a b i and counts,and conspiring to launder the proceeds of securities fraud with the intent to promote such unlawful activity in violation of a a i and h count.
johnson submits that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his convictions for money laundering.sufficiency of the evidence is an issue that we review de novo to determine whether a reasonable jury,viewing the evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the government could find the defendant guilty as charged beyond a reasonable doubt.united states williamson,cir internal quotations omitted.we address the different money laundering provisions separately.
to obtain a conviction on a charge,the government bears the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that johnson knowingly engaged or attempted to engage in a monetary transaction in criminally derived property that is of value greater than and is derived from specified unlawful activity.see also,united states nolan,cir.a monetary transaction includes the deposit,withdrawal,transfer,or exchange,of funds or a monetary instrument by,through,or to a financial institution f.the term specified unlawful activity means any act or activity constituting an offense under.c a.section d includes any offense involving fraud in the sale of securities.
with respect to his convictions counts,johnson argues that the mere receipt of funds raised from his private stock offerings does not amount to money laundering and that the government failed to establish that he engaged in financial transactions involving criminally derived proceeds.after reviewing the record,we find the evidence presented at trial more than sufficient to support johnson convictions.johnson did more than merely receive the proceeds from his bogus stock offerings.the evidence at trial established that johnson knowingly engaged in securities fraud,a specified unlawful activity when he made numerous and extensive misleading false representations to hundreds of investors in order to raise capital for leds the jury also heard evidence from special agent stephen robinson,a criminal investigator with the irs,that johnson controlled approximately financial accounts,of which were used by johnson to deposit,withdraw,and transfer millions of dollars of fraudulently obtained investor funds.thus,the evidence was sufficient to prove that johnson conducted financial transactions in excess of with illicitly acquired funds that he knew represented the proceeds of unlawful activity,and that he therefore violated.
to establish the offense of money laundering concealment by use of an international transfer,the government must establish that johnson transferred funds from within the united states to a place outside of the country,knowing that the funds were proceeds of unlawful activity and intending to conceal or disguise the nature,location,source,ownership,or control of the illicit proceeds.a b i.with respect to counts,johnson argues that while the evidence demonstrated that funds were transferred to luxembourg from the united states,the government did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt either that he controlled or directed the transfers or that he attempted to conceal or disguise the source of these monies.we agree.
count charges johnson with money laundering concealment based upon a transfer of from a account in his mother name to an account in luxembourg,also in his mother name.counts charge him with money laundering concealment based upon five transfers from either leds or johnson personal accounts in the united states,exclusively controlled by johnson,to his mother account in luxembourg.
as to count the court finds the record insufficient to support the jury conclusion that johnson caused,directed,induced,or in any way controlled the particular transfer by his mother from her account in the united states to her account in luxembourg.the government does not point to,nor can we locate,any evidence suggesting that johnson had any involvement in this particular transaction.as such,we vacate johnson conviction under count of the superseding indictment.
counts involve five separate transfers of funds to luxembourg that originated out of two accounts in the united states that johnson controlled as we see it,the only issue requiring our consideration is whether the evidence demonstrated that johnson intended to conceal the origin of the illicit funds when he transferred them to his mother account in luxembourg evidence of concealment must be substantial.united states blankenship,cir.merely engaging in a transaction with money whose nature has been concealed through other means is not in itself a crime if transactions are engaged in for present personal benefit,and not to create the appearance of legitimate wealth,they do not violate the money laundering statute.united states majors,cir quoting united states,cir see also,united states magluta,cir p ayments for personal benefit out of previously laundered proceeds do not themselves constitute money laundering unless they are designed to conceal the nature or source of the money.relying on majors,at.
evidence to consider in determining whether a transaction was designed to conceal includes,among other things 
statements by a defendant probative of intent to conceal unusual secrecy surrounding the transaction structuring the transaction in a way to avoid attention depositing illegal profits in the bank account of a legitimate business highly irregular features of the transaction using third parties to conceal the real owner a series of unusual financial moves cumulating in the transaction or expert testimony on practices of criminals.
at majors,at.another important consideration is whether the money is better concealed or concealable after the transaction than before.blankenship,at.
after considerable review,we find the evidence insufficient to support johnson money laundering convictions set forth in counts of the superseding indictment.with respect to these five counts,the government presented no evidence of unusual secrecy,questionable structuring,highly irregular features of the transfers,or multiple movements of the same funds that assisted in concealing their original source.nothing about these transfers suggests that johnson attempted to avoid detection or attention.
the facts of other cases decided by this circuit assist us in reaching our conclusion.first,in united states magluta,at,we upheld a defendant money laundering conviction pursuant to a b i when the defendant facilitated multiple transfers of illicitly obtained cash between different associates before ultimately transferring the funds to israel and depositing them into a bank account bearing a fictitious name,after which the defendant paid his lawyers with checks from that foreign account held in the false name.we concluded that the defendant went to great lengths to structure these highly irregular transactions in a veil of secrecy to conceal the fact that he was using drug proceeds to compensate his lawyers and this behavior,therefore,satisfied the definition of money laundering under a b i.
in united states abbell,cir,two attorney defendants placed money into prisoner commissary accounts or gave individuals cash on behalf of a leader of the cali cartel,a drug smuggling empire.the evidence at trial established that the recipients of the cash either worked for the drug cartel or were family members of those employees and that the money was provided in exchange for their silence about the cartel.the defendants either first received cash from the cartel leader and then gave the money to the recipients,or they would front the cash and then bill the leader for the amounts disbursed.either way,the defendants disbursed the funds as if they were the providers,not the cartel leader.we found that the evidence supported the jury conclusion that the cash disbursements were designed to conceal that the cartel leader was the source of these funds and therefore amounted to a violation of a b i.
united states hasson,cir,involved a jewelry store owner who prepared false jewelry appraisals and misrepresented both his own qualifications and the quality of particular jewels in an effort to sell items to unsuspecting customers.in affirming his conviction for money laundering pursuant to a b i and h,we relied on evidence demonstrating that the defendant funneled proceeds from his fraudulent sales through multiple accounts bearing fictitious names and opened with forged documents,including an account for a shell corporation in the isle of man.we further considered that he lied to the fbi and the irs when questioned about his relationship with this shell corporation.id.
finally,in majors,at,the first opinion in which we closely examined the concealment element of a charge,we affirmed the defendants money laundering convictions in a securities fraud case where they sold millions of dollars of worthless securities.the evidence in majors demonstrated that the defendants transferred the proceeds from the scheme between multiple corporate bank accounts set up with multiple signatories in an effort to make it appear that the funds ultimately deposited into the defendants personal accounts were from a legitimate source.we concluded that moving the gains on multiple occasions between different corporate accounts,some of which were legitimate business accounts,using multiple signatories amounted to an effort to conceal the nature or source of the proceeds under the terms of the statute.id.at see also,blankenship,at reversing money laundering concealment conviction,concluding that defendant transfer of funds between two accounts at the same bank,both bearing his name,was insufficient to establish the element of concealment united states thayer,cir affirming money laundering concealment conviction where defendant funneled profits from an illicit scheme into various corporate accounts,some of which used fictitious names,before ultimately placing the money into her personal account see generally,donald samuel,eleventh circuit criminal handbook providing an insightful compilation and analysis of money laundering cases from this circuit.
in the examples set forth above,the suspect transactions involved either numerous transfers,multiple accounts,fictitious accounts,or the use of to effectuate the concealment of the actual source of the money.in this case,however,johnson simply transferred money from his own accounts to his mother account.these were simple and straightforward banking transactions,easily discovered through a cursory review of johnson bank accounts.see,united states esterman,cir c ases in which money laundering charges have not succeeded are typically simple transactions that can be followed with relative ease,at a ctions that are merely suspicious and do not provide substantial evidence of a design to conceal will not alone support a conviction.
our precedent discussed above demonstrates that a money laundering concealment conviction pursuant to requires evidence of something more than a simple transfer of funds between two accounts,each bearing the parties correct name.there must be some evidence that the funds are more concealed after the transaction is completed than before.decisions by our sister circuits also support this conclusion.see,at holding that transferring funds from an account in the defendant name to an account of a colombian national in florida was insufficient to support a money laundering conviction pursuant to a b i united states dobbs,cir reversing a money laundering conviction under a b i where the defendant deposited illicitly obtained funds into his wife bank account,after which she used the money to pay ordinary household expenses,by finding that this typical and straight forward banking transaction failed to demonstrate an intent to conceal the origin of the money consequently,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,we find ourselves constrained to conclude that no reasonable jury could find that the transactions set forth in counts of the superseding indictment constituted an effort to conceal the nature or source of the unlawful proceeds,and we accordingly vacate johnson convictions for these counts.
a a i and h 
h makes it unlawful to conspire to violate any provision of or.the jury convicted johnson of conspiring to launder the proceeds of securities fraud with the intent to promote such unlawful activity in violation of a a i count.to establish the offense of promotional money laundering,the government must demonstrate that the defendant conducted or attempted to conduct a financial transaction the defendant knew that the funds involved in the transaction represented the proceeds of illicit activity securities fraud in the present case the funds involved were in fact the proceeds of unlawful activity and the defendant conducted the financial transaction with the intent to promote the specified unlawful activity.united states carcione,cir.
