this appeal returns to us from the united states district court for the southern district of new york,paul crotty,judge,following an evidentiary hearing and findings on a jacobson remand from this court,see united states jacobson,cir,with respect to the district court denial of petitioner patrick bennett motion pursuant to to vacate his convictions following two trials for securities fraud,bank fraud,and money laundering on the ground that he received ineffective assistance of counsel.in support of that claim,bennett alleged that there were numerous defects in counsel performance he was granted a certificate of appealability to seek review with respect to two such allegations,to wit,that his attorneys overrode his desire to testify at his second trial,and that counsel interfered with his right to testify by failing to object to jury instructions on intent and good faith mens rea instructions.the district court,following its evidentiary hearing on remand with respect to those two issues,found that counsel had advised bennett of his absolute right to testify and to decide for himself whether or not to testify,and that bennett had accepted,without complaint,their advice that he not testify the court found bennett testimony to the contrary not credible.the court also found that the unchallenged mens rea instructions caused bennett no prejudice.on this reinstated appeal,bennett contends principally that the district court erred in its credibility assessments and that this court should grant him a new trial on the ground that his attorneys a failed to inform him that he had the rights to testify and to decide whether or not to testify at his second trial,b overrode his desire to testify at that trial,or c failed to protect his right to testify because they failed to object to the mens rea instructions.bennett also contends that the certificate of appealability should be expanded to encompass other alleged errors of counsel.for the reasons that follow,we reject his contentions and affirm the district court denial of the motion.
background 
the proceedings leading to this appeal beginning with a count indictment and including two trials before different judges resulting in bennett conviction on a total of counts,a motion and a supplement thereto before a third judge,three appeals,and two remands are summarized below.
bennett convictions and direct appeals 
bennett was the chief financial officer of a family business called bennett financial group bfg.the crimes of which he was convicted are described generally in united states bennett,cir.may,bennett i summary order,and united states bennett,cir bennett ii,cert.denied.
the indictment alleged offenses of four kinds.first,bennett allegedly ran a massive pyramid scheme through bfg,selling fictitious leases to investors and pledging or selling legitimate leases twice over to different parties.these pyramid scheme allegations supported mail fraud and securities fraud counts.second,bennett allegedly shifted the cash generated by pyramid sales into an unaudited shell company,supporting several money laundering counts.third,bennett allegedly inflated bfg profitability in financial statements submitted to banks and investors who loaned money to bfg.these allegations supported bank fraud and additional securities fraud counts.fourth,bennett deceived sec investigators,supporting public integrity counts such as perjury and obstruction of justice.
there have been two trials.at each trial,the government submitted evidence that would have permitted conviction on all the counts 
bennett ii,at.
at his first trial,which ended in march,bennett testified that in connection with an investigation into bfg by the securities and exchange commission sec he,inter alia,gave the sec sworn testimony that was false,submitted documents that he had fabricated or backdated,and instructed others to give false statements and fictitious documents.at that trial,bennett was convicted on one count of obstruction of justice,two counts of conspiracy to obstruct justice and commit perjury,and four counts of perjury,see generally id.at bennett i at.the jury was not able to reach verdicts on other counts,and a second trial on those counts was held in may june.at the second trial at which bennett did not testify the jury,although unable to reach verdicts on certain mail fraud and securities fraud counts,found bennett guilty on two counts of securities fraud,five counts of bank fraud,five counts of engaging in monetary transactions with criminally derived property,and counts of money laundering,see generally bennett ii,at bennett i at.following the second trial,bennett was sentenced principally to years imprisonment and was ordered to forfeit.
in bennett i,we affirmed bennett convictions,albeit not his sentence.we rejected all of bennett claims of trial error,including,as discussed in greater detail in part below,his contention that he was entitled to a new trial on the ground that the court at his second trial gave the jury erroneous or incomplete instructions with respect to mens rea on the fraud counts,see bennett i at.
simultaneously with our summary order in bennett i,we filed a published opinion vacating bennett sentence and remanding to the district court for resentencing,ruling that the trial judge had departed upward from the imprisonment range on an impermissible basis.see bennett ii,at.on remand,the court resentenced bennett,imposing the same nonincarceratory penalties but imposing a prison term of years rather than.this court affirmed the new sentence.see united states bennett.lexis cir,bennett iii summary order,cert.denied.
bennett motion claiming ineffective assistance of counsel 
at his first trial,bennett had been represented by david levitt and mark gombiner,attorneys from the federal defender division of the legal aid society legal aid at his second trial,he was represented by gombiner and legal aid attorney ian yankwitt.in,represented by new counsel,bennett filed a motion pursuant to which was supplemented in to add a claim that is not pertinent to this appeal,seeking to vacate his sentence and conviction on the principal ground that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel at his second trial.
in support of his or iac claim,bennett specified instances in which he claimed his attorneys performance had been deficient.items labeled errors alleged errors and omissions relating to the jury instructions errors asserted that counsel failed to object to mens rea instructions that did not inform the jury that in order to find bennett guilty on the bank fraud counts it must find an intent to harm the banks,and failed to object to the wording of an instruction on good faith as a defense.items labeled errors alleged errors and omissions relating to trial conduct,including alleged failures to object to the indictment,to government evidence,or to government conduct,and failures to recognize and present effective defenses.number asserted as follows 
error.defense counsels sic performance improperly interfered with movants sic constitutional right to testify at trial.
on the second day of trial,prior to any evidence being submitted against movant,a discussion took place at a social luncheon between the district court,then attorney for southern district of new york,mary jo white,and head of legal aid society,leonard joy concerning movant case.based on the version of this discussion relayed to movant by joy,movant became very upset and expressed his immediate concern to joy and gombiner,that movant felt the district court was predisposed of his guilt.neither joy,gombiner,nor anyone at legal aid society,advised movant,after expressing these concerns,of his legal right to immediately put this incident on the record to seek clarification from the district court and,or ask for recusal.movant fear of the district court predisposition of his guilt,became a primary reason movant did not testify at the second trial.see bennett affidavit.ultimately,a recusal request was filed months after trial,for the balance of the proceedings,and the district court put on the record,january,hearing,pages,the contents of the above discussion.movant has sworn that this was a materially different version from that told to him by joy,and that if the district court comments had been on the record immediately at trial,it would have clarified what took place,relieved movant concern,at the time,over the district courts sic predisposition.movant testimony was important to his defense,movant has stated,if made aware of his rights by counsel,he would have immediately requested this incident been sic put on the record.further,gombiner was sic further interfered with movants sic right to testify in erroneously advising movants sic early in the trial,that movant first trial testimony could and would be entered into evidence and as a result spent no time preparing with movant for his direct examinating sic,then informing movant at the end of trial,he had been mistaken and all of movant first trial testimony could not be entered into the record.
here,we have a unique set of circumstances.no speculation is needed as to how movant would testify or its probable results.movant had testified at his first trial.all second trial counts of conviction ended in jury deadlock and.
bennett motion,attachment a at emphasis added.
the bennett affidavit referred to in error stated,inter alia,that legal aid attorney joy told bennett and gombiner that at the luncheon in question,judge john martin,who was presiding over bennett second trial,suggested to joy and the united states attorney that bennett case should be resolved by plea of guilty and that a year sentence would be appropriate see affidavit of patrick bennett dated march,first bennett aff.or first affidavit.bennett stated that b ased on those events in paragraphs,i believed at the time that judge martin had a predisposition of my guilt.this haunted me throughout trial and greatly affected my decision not to testify at the second trial.id.see also id.my fear of the judge of my guilt weighed heavily in my decision not to testify at the second trial.
in a detailed memorandum decision and order dated march,judge crotty denied bennett motion.see bennett united states,civ.pac,wl,bennett iv.rejecting bennett claim in error that trial counsel interfered with his right to testify by leading him to believe that the court was predisposed to believe he was guilty and by failing to devote time to prepare him to testify,the court noted that bennett does not deny that he was aware of his right to testify or claim that counsel advised him that he could not testify.bennett iv at.the court found that counsel had competently recommended that he not testify 
in view of the fact that bennett had been found guilty of perjury and obstruction of justice,no competent lawyer would have recommended that he testify since he would have had to tell the jury that he had been convicted of these crimes.moreover,even if counsel had been ineffective in this regard there is no reason to conclude that,if bennett had testified,the result of the proceeding would have been different.strickland washington.
bennett iv at.as to bennett contention with regard to the trial court instructions on mens rea,the district court noted that those instructions had been challenged on bennett direct appeal and that this court had found no basis for reversal.see id.at.exploring all of the alleged defects in counsel performance,see id.at,as well as their cumulative effect,see id.at,the court concluded that,in light of the overwhelming evidence presented at trial,bennett could not show that the result of the trial would have been different but for the alleged errors,either individually as explained above or in the aggregate,id.at.
bennett appeal from the denial of his motion 
the district court declined to grant bennett a certificate of appealability or coa to appeal its denial of his motion.see bennett iv at.bennett thereafter applied to this court for a coa with respect to of the iac issues raised in his motion.this court,in an order dated january,granted a certificate limited to the two issues that bennett had described as errors and,to wit,
whether defense counsel was ineffective for allegedly overriding bennett desire to exercise his constitutional right to testify in his own defense and 
whether bennett was prejudiced by defense counsel alleged failure to ensure the right to testify when the issue is analyzed in connection with counsel failure to object to either the district court omission of an intent to harm instruction,or the wording of the instruction on the good faith defense,particularly in light of evidence of jury confusion as to intent 
following briefing and argument of the two certificated issues,this court ordered a jacobson remand to permit the district court to conduct an evidentiary hearing,including receiving testimony from bennett trial counsel,and to make findings with respect to those issues.see bennett united states,app x cir,bennett v.we stated 
we think it would be useful to us in deciding this appeal for the district court to determine,with the assistance of evidence,in affidavit form or otherwise,from the petitioner trial counsel,and such other evidence as may be available and relevant,the circumstances under which counsel undertook the actions and omissions that the petitioner alleges overrode his desire to testify.more specifically,we hesitate to determine whether counsel assistance was ineffective without first affording him an opportunity to be heard and to present evidence,in the form of live testimony,affidavits,or briefs.sparman edwards,cir per curiam.
bennett v,app x at.our order provided that,following those proceedings and findings,the appeal could be restored to this court.
d.the evidentiary hearing on remand 
prior to and during the hearing on remand,bennett attempted to expand the proceedings beyond the two issues as to which this court had granted the certificate of appealability and indeed beyond the issues as to which he had requested us to grant a coa and even beyond the iac issues raised in his motion.see generally bennett united states,civ.pac,cr.pac,wl,at,bennett vi id.at.for example,shortly after entry of our order in bennett v,bennett filed a supplemental affidavit alleging,for the first time,that 
a t no time did my court appointed attorneys or anyone else,advise me,or explain to me,that the ultimate decision to testify at trial was mine,and mine alone to make.
affidavit of patrick bennett dated december,second bennett aff.or second affidavit.in may,he moved to amend his motion to assert,inter alia,this failure claim,stating as follows 
bennett wishes to formally amend his petition to include as a basis for his ineffective trial counsel claim that it was improper for his attorneys to fail to inform him that it was his decision alone as to whether he could testify at trial bennett also asks that he be permitted to prove that his trial attorneys failure to advise him as to his right to testify constituted an independent ground unrelated to his ineffective assistance of counsel claim for which he is entitled to habeas relief.
petitioner memorandum of law in support of his motion pursuant to rule of the federal rule sic of civil procedure to amend his habeas corpus petition dated may,at.bennett argued that the failure to advise him of his right to decide whether or not to testify both constituted an independent ground for relief and supported his claim that counsel overall performance was ineffective.see id.at.
the district court denied bennett motion to amend his motion although it allowed evidence on,and eventually addressed,the new claim as part of the certificated issue as to whether bennett desire to exercise his right to testify had been overridden.the court held a hearing on june,at which it excluded most of the evidence proffered by bennett that was not relevant to the two certificated issues.see generally bennett vi at.the principal witnesses at the hearing were gombiner,yankwitt,and bennett.
the hearing testimony of gombiner 
gombiner,a trial attorney with some two decades of experience by the late,testified that he was one of the legal aid attorneys representing bennett in his criminal case from september or october through late june.hearing transcript tr,at.gombiner testified that,while he did not have a specific recollection of advising bennett of his right to decide whether or not to testify at the second trial,it was gombiner general practice,in any criminal case that might go to trial,always to discuss with the client the fact that he has the right to testify,the absolute right to testify.tr.gombiner stated that he would often advise against the defendant deciding to testify and would explain his reasons but i always tell them that they have the right to testify.id.
i always tell them that,look,this is one of the really few decisions that is up to you rather than up to me,the decision whether to plead guilty or to go to trial,that your decision.and,the decision whether to testify or not,that your decision.most of the other decisions,that going to be my call.
id.at emphases added.
gombiner testified that he might not have such a conversation in a case in which it was clear that there was going to be a plea rather than a trial b ut,if we are preparing for a trial,we have it well before the trial starts because you need to determine before the trial begins,you at least have to have a sense as to whether or not you are going to put your client on the stand because that going to dictate much of your other strategy.id.at.gombiner testified that before bennett second trial see id.at,i know we discussed the fact that it was up to him id.at.
gombiner doubted that he had had that discussion with bennett with regard to the first trial because,when gombiner joined bennett defense team,preparation for the first trial was underway and it had already been determined that bennett would testify at that trial.see tr.after the first trial,at which bennett was convicted of the perjury and obstruction offenses described above,levitt,who had led bennett defense at that trial,left the legal aid office and had no further involvement in bennett case.gombiner became lead counsel and was joined by yankwitt.there ensued discussions as to whether bennett should enter into negotiations toward a plea bargain rather than going through a second trial.gombiner testified that he and yankwitt,knowing that convictions in securities fraud cases were common,thought that bennett should take advantage of the negotiating leverage he had as a result of the jury inability to achieve unanimity on the fraud counts at the first trial.bennett,however,wanted to go to trial again,and the difference of opinion resulted in some rather heated discussion.id.at.it was decided that bennett would go to trial again because bennett wanted to,and that was obviously his right.id.
once bennett had decided to go to trial again,gombiner advised him not to testify.gombiner had interviewed the jurors after bennett first trial and learned that they were to for conviction and learned that none of the jurors,including the two jurors who were holdouts for acquittal,none of them said that bennett testimony was a factor that operated in his favor rather,some just said,you know,the guy was telling the truth.tr.
my advice to bennett was very strongly that he should not testify.i know i was basing that,one,on the results.
you know,we had an experiment sic now.generally you do get to do that when you make this decision but we knew how at least the first jury had reacted to it.
id.at.however,gombiner also knew that 
of necessity bennett pretty much had to testify the same way he had as the first trial.i mean,we could come in there like with some other totally different explanations or,you know,as to what was going on.that would obviously put you in a very poor position on i was very concerned about the 
id.at.stating that he thought the government at the first trial had been quite poor id.at,gombiner testified that he assumed the government would do a better job at the second trial because they had all of bennett testimony id.at he thought the cross examination at the second trial was likely to be more difficult to withstand id.at.
gombiner also believed it would be disadvantageous to have to ask bennett about his perjury at the first trial and for bennett to offer the same peculiar,explanation for having given the sec false statements and documents which was that he committed and suborned perjury because he had done nothing wrong before but thought the sec would not believe him 
i also felt that we were in an almost impossible position for bennett to testify now that he had actually been convicted of perjury and obstruction of justice.i mean,i had two concerns about that.one is just the fact that i would have had to elicit that on direct examination and although it was going to come into the trial anyway,i mean,it was putting bennett himself on the stand and saying bennett,have you ever been convicted of a crime 
and he would have to say perjury.
in what case 
i think that a very poor start to any witness sic testimony.
i was also concerned that,and i felt this at the first trial,too,that i thought his explanation for why he committed perjury and obstruction of justice,i not making any judgments about the veracity of it but the explanation essentially was i went before the sec and i committed perjury and i helped i falsified documents and i got other people to commit perjury and falsify documents and the reason that i did that was i had done absolutely nothing wrong but i did think the sec was going to believe me if i told the truth because i did think they would believe that people did dollar transactions with so little paperwork or backup.
i did think that was a good explanation.i did really want to get into that anymore than we had.i thought that would be a problem.
tr.italics in original see also id.at bennett did not give an innocent explanation rather,he admitted he did commit perjury and obstruction of justice.
in response to the government question as to whether gombiner had made it clear to bennett that,despite gombiner advice not to testify,it was ultimately bennett decision to make,gombiner testified that he did 
not have any specific recollection of any conversation where i sat down and said,bennett,under the due process clause and under the compulsory process clause,that you have a right to testify.i do recall any discussion like that.i doubt if i gave any speech about it like that but i know we discussed the fact that he would have had that it was up to him.i mean,i think that was actually implicit.he testified already so i was really that i do think that was probably foremost in my mind but to the extent it would have been my practice to tell him that.i sure he knew that already.okay,i not sure he knew it because i not bennett,but 
that best i can recollect about it.
q gombiner,what was the determination with regard to whether or not bennett would testify at the second trial 
a well,after he talked about it with me i know he talked about it with yankwitt,we determined that he was going to testify.
q and who made that decision 
a well,ultimately bennett made that decision but it was he certainly made it with my advice and yankwitt advice.
id.at emphases added.
gombiner testified that he had hundreds of discussions with bennett tr.and that,although discussions were heated as to whether bennett should negotiate for a plea of guilty id.at,gombiner did not recall,once bennett decided to go to trial,that there were any arguments with bennett about whether or not he was going to testify id.at.gombiner did not recall bennett ever disagreeing with counsel recommendation not to testify or indicating any adamant desire to testify at the second trial.see id.at.gombiner also testified that although he had some discussion with bennett as to how much of bennett testimony would be read into evidence by the government,gombiner never said that bennett entire testimony would be read into evidence at the second trial nor,being familiar with the rules of evidence,would gombiner ever have given such an opinion.see id.at.gombiner also did not recall bennett ever either expressing a view that judge martin was biased or stating that his decision not to testify was influenced by such a view.see id.at.gombiner did not prepare bennett to testify because bennett had decided not to testify.see id.at.
with respect to bennett contention that he received ineffective assistance of counsel by reason of failures to object to any aspect of the jury charge,gombiner testified that if he did not object it was not for any tactical reason but was because he thought the instructions were not legally incorrect.see id.at.
the hearing testimony of yankwitt 
yankwitt testified that he too,prior to the second trial see,tr,had discussed with bennett the right to testify and had conveyed to him my view that testifying at his second trial would be a really bad idea because yankwitt feared that an effective cross would be devastating to any chance of an acquittal id.at.yankwitt testified that,while making that recommendation,he always made clear to clients that it was their decision whether or not to testify id.at.he did not have a specific recollection of advising bennett that the decision of whether to testify was his and his alone id.at see also id.at,but he testified that it was his practice that he always said those things when he talked to a defendant about waiving significant rights id.at.yankwitt testified that a day or two after his pretrial discussion with bennett about testifying,gombiner informed yankwitt that bennett had decided not to testify.see id.at.yankwitt had no further discussions with bennett as to whether bennett would testify.
yankwitt reasons for viewing it as inadvisable for bennett to testify at the second trial were largely the same as those expressed by gombiner in his testimony,described in part.above.it was preferable for bennett not to testify because 
at the first trial pat had admitted to perjuring himself in a proceeding before the sec and had explained that perjury in a way that could in a way that could very well sound like he chose to lie because he believed that that would best serve his interests.
tr.and although the government could introduce evidence of bennett perjury and obstruction if bennett did not testify,yankwitt believed it would be less inflammatory for that evidence to come in through transcripts than through bennett live testimony.see,id.at.the court paraphrased 
the court i think you said,yankwitt,earlier,that it would be better for bennett convictions for perjury and obstruction of justice resulting from the first trial to come in without being hit over the head with it as he would have been had he testified to it and got on the stand.
the witness yes.
the hearing testimony of bennett 
bennett testimony at the june hearing differed substantially from that of gombiner and yankwitt.bennett testified,inter alia,that neither attorney discussed the issue of his testifying with him before the second trial see tr,and that the first such discussion did not occur until about a week into th at trial id.at see also id.the second day of trial.the discussion was held after legal aid attorney joy according to bennett told bennett and gombiner that judge martin at a luncheon had suggested that bennett should plead guilty and receive a sentence of years imprisonment.see id.at.bennett testified,consistent with the statements made in his first affidavit,that this report made him fear that the judge had prejudged his case and made him fearful of testifying.see id.at.
bennett testified that he expressed this concern to gombiner,and that gombiner stated that an alternative to bennett testifying would be to introduce the transcript of his testimony from the first trial.bennett testified that gombiner told him the entire testimony could be introduced see id.at,and bennett found that to be an acceptable alternative to testifying.so i went along with that id.at.bennett testified that it was not until this point,a week after the second trial had begun,that yankwitt had any conversation whatever with him about testifying.bennett testified that yankwitt explained why he thought bennett should testify but,according to bennett,at that point i listened to him,but it was a moot point.in my mind i was testifying now.my transcripts were coming in.id.at.
bennett testified that,about two days before the end of the second trial,gombiner told him that what gombiner had said about putting in all the transcripts was wrong,and that the entire transcript of bennett testimony in fact could not be introduced.tr.bennett responded to gombiner that he therefore wanted to testify but he testified at the hearing that he could not testify because gombiner told him 
well,there no time to prepare,you know,we have spent any time going over anything,getting ready,you know,we just do have time.and then he went into a long rant about his reason why he thought i should testify,which,you know,to me was just justifying the fact that he was prepared to do my testimony.
bennett testified that after the jury verdicts at the second trial,he was represented by new counsel and moved for judge martin recusal that motion was denied,as the judge stated that he had no predisposition as to bennett guilt or innocence,nor had he suggested a sentence id.at see id.at.consistent with his assertion in his first affidavit,bennett testified at the hearing that,if he had known the court had no such predisposition,he would have testified at the second trial so that the court could hear his explanation of his conduct.see id.at.
consistent with the alleged claim introduced in his second affidavit,bennett also testified that 
nobody ever from the legal aid office,ever,told me that i had a constitutional right to testify and that right was mine alone to make.no one ever said that to me,at any point in these proceedings,ever.i learned of that right doing law research at otisville law library.if i had known of that,or if i had known of they never sat down and explained all the elements of the charges to me.no one ever even did that.
tr.he testified that neither gombiner nor yankwitt at any time explain ed to him the parameters under which he could or could not testify.id.at.
bennett also testified that his decision not to testify would have been different if his attorneys had fully explained to him the charges against him see id.at,had informed him of the elements of those charges see id.at,had requested an instruction on intent to harm for bank fraud where it is an essential element id.at,had not erroneously requested an intent to harm instruction for securities fraud where it is not an element id,had properly informed him of the significance of the materiality element of the crime of securities fraud see id.at,and had properly objected to the district court instruction on his defense see id.at.
e.the district court findings 
the district court,after summarizing the testimony given at the june hearing,made findings with regard to,inter alia,the credibility of the witnesses,the substance and timing of advice given to bennett by the legal aid attorneys,and the basis for bennett decision not to testify at his second trial.it found that bennett statements about the legal advice he was given,when he was given such advice,and how he came to decide not to testify at his second trial are rejected as incredible.bennett vi,wl,at.
the court discredited bennett testimony that his attorneys never advised him a that he had an absolute constitutional right to testify and b that the decision whether or not to exercise that right was his and his alone.rather,t he court credit ed both yankwitt and gombiner testimony that,consistent with their practices,each advised bennett of his right to testify and that t hese conversations took place before the second trial commenced.id.at.the court found that i n any factual dispute between gombiner and yankwitt on one side and bennett on the other side,bennett is not credible.id.at.
the court also refused to credit bennett testimony that he was afraid to testify because he believed judge martin was predisposed against him or that bennett accepted his counsel advice not to testify only because gombiner assured him that the entire transcript of his testimony at the first trial would be used at the second trial.id.at.the court found that,given gombiner testimony and his skill,experience,intelligence and knowledge of the federal rules of evidence,
bennett claim that gombiner told him that the transcript of his testimony at the first trial would be received in evidence at the second trial is preposterous and is rejected,
id.at see also id.at bennett claim that his lawyers advised him that the entire transcript of his testimony from the first trial would be received in evidence is a fabrication.the court also found not credible bennett claim that he told gombiner at the end of the government case that he wanted to testify.id.at.the court stated that 
bennett testimony says more about his willingness to dissemble and distort in order to achieve his goal than it does about what happened prior to,and during his second trial.the same may be said of his fear that judge martin was predisposed against him and that predisposition forced him to accept gombiner proposal to use the transcripts of the first trial rather than testifying again.
id.at see also id.at the argument that bennett was afraid of judge martin and therefore acquiesced in the supposed use of the transcript is rejected.the court concluded that bennett argument that his counsel were ineffective because they overrode his desire to testify is rejected.id.at.as bennett has in the past,he lied again.id.at.
the district court also found that bennett right to testify at his second trial was not prejudiced by,inter alia,defense counsel performance with respect to the trial court mens rea instructions.it stated that the instructions in question had been found in bennett i not to be erroneous and that it was therefore hard to see how defense counsel failure to object could have prejudiced bennett.id.at.
in light of its findings,the district court concluded that bennett 
had effective defense counsel and they advised of his right to plead or to go to trial.having opted for trial,they advised him of his right to testify or not testify.they encouraged him not to testify,and they had good reason for that advice bennett knew he could not testify without exposing himself to substantial cross examination his counsel advised him not to testify he considered that advice and then he chose not to testify.
this court was given notice of the district court findings,and bennett appeal was restored to our calendar.supplemental briefs were submitted by the government and by the attorneys who had represented bennett at the june hearing.in mid,those attorneys were allowed to withdraw and bennett was permitted to proceed pro se.on march,bennett was granted permission to file,pro se,an additional supplemental reply brief.we have considered all of the submissions.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,bennett contends principally that he is entitled to a new trial,arguing that the present record establishes that his attorneys a failed to inform him of his right to testify and his right to decide whether or not to testify,and b overrode,through errors and omissions in their preparation for and conduct of the trial,his desire to testify.in addition,in both his posthearing counseled supplemental briefs and his posthearing pro se supplemental reply brief,bennett requests that the certificate of appealability be expanded to encompass other alleged errors.
bennett current request for an expansion of the certificate of appealability is his third such motion in this court.the first two motions were denied in orders dated april,and september.his present request is likewise denied,as his submissions fail to ma k e a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,c.
as to the issues covered by the coa that was granted,we reject bennett contentions for the reasons that follow.
bennett right to testify and to decide whether to testify 
with respect to the first issue as to which we granted a certificate of appealability,whether defense counsel rendered constitutionally ineffective assistance by overriding bennett desire to exercise his constitutional right to testify at his second trial,we begin by considering,as did the district court on the jacobson remand,the related issue of whether bennett was advised of his constitutional rights to testify at trial and to be the sole decider of whether or not to testify.bennett argues,inter alia,that because he testified at the hearing that he was not so advised and because neither gombiner nor yankwitt remembered a specific conversation in which bennett was so advised,the district court finding that he was in fact so advised should be overturned.under the standards established by strickland washington,for consideration of claims of ineffective assistance of counsel,we reject his argument and this facet of his iac claim.
at this point in the development of our adversary system,it can not be doubted that a defendant in a criminal case has the right to take the witness stand and to testify in his or her own defense.rock arkansas,see,harris new york.this right,which is one of the rights that are essential to due process of law in a fair adversary process,rock,at quoting faretta california,has its roots in several provisions of the constitution,including the due process clause of the fifth amendment,the fifth amendment guarantee against compelled testimony,and the compulsory process clause of the sixth amendment,see,rock,at.
our court framework for consideration of a claim that a defendant has been denied the right to testify at his criminal trial was established in brown artuz,cir.in brown,we held that the decision whether to testify belongs to the defendant and may not be made for him by defense counsel,id.at,and that defense counsel has a duty to inform the defendant of that right,see id.at.
d efense counsel bears the primary responsibility for advising the defendant of his right to testify or not to testify although counsel should always advise the defendant about the benefits and hazards of testifying and of not testifying,and may strongly advise the course that counsel thinks best,counsel must inform the defendant that the ultimate decision whether to take the stand belongs to the defendant,and counsel must abide by the defendant decision on this matter.
