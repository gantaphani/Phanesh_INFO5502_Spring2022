appellants victor and jose omar were the secretary and associate secretary of the puerto rico department of education prde when they devised an extortion and kickback scheme that allegedly involved fraudulent payments of more than million in cash and property from prde contractors.appellants entered into separate cooperation agreements with the government and pled guilty to several counts in exchange for what they hoped would be shorter sentences.those hopes were not realized,however,and appellants now raise a series of challenges to their sentences finding no reversible error,we affirm.
background 
we briefly summarize the relevant facts and procedural history,drawing from appellants cooperation agreements,and from the transcripts of their sentencing proceedings and fajardo bail revocation hearing.see united states mateo,cir.according to their agreements,fajardo recruited cruz to collaborate in a scheme to extort money from prde contractors initially for the purpose of financing their political party obligations and later for personal purposes.among other activities,the two administrators orchestrated the creation of a corporation to act as a front for their illegal activities.the corporation,research management group,submitted three contract proposals totaling more than million to the prde and also generated false invoices seeking payments from other prde contractors.fajardo approved the research management contracts and also awarded contracts to a number of companies whose as in the made payments to appellants.fajardo and cruz also ordered that invoices for their political party activities be distributed to various prde contractors for payment.in addition to the cash payments extorted from the contractors between and,appellants received items for personal use.hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash were kept in a safe in fajardo office,and appellants dipped into it for various political and personal purposes.
appellants were charged in january with fifteen in an indictment.in february,both men pled guilty to three counts counts one,five and eight pursuant to plea and cooperation agreements that specified the sentencing calculations that the government would recommend and provided that the government would file motions for downward departure if appellants provided substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of others.for cruz,the anticipated recommended sentence was set at months for fajardo,the recommendation was to be for months.fajardo paid in restitution before tendering his guilty plea cruz agreed to forfeit,of which approximately was paid before his cooperation agreement was signed.both testified before the grand jury and provided considerable information to authorities about their own activities and the activities of others.
in september,fajardo was called by the government as the first witness at the trial of three.on the fifth day of his testimony,during,the trial was aborted when the government accused fajardo of committing perjury and moved to revoke his bond,requesting in addition that the case be dismissed with prejudice as to all remaining defendants the three on trial as well as ten others.the district court granted the motions.maintaining that he had been truthful,fajardo moved for release on bail and also sought enforcement of the government obligations under the plea agreement.following a hearing in which the court explored the government allegations of untruthfulness,see infra at,the court denied fajardo motions.
sentencing for both appellants took place on december.without any benefit from their plea agreements,their terms pursuant to the sentencing guidelines were roughly twice as long as they had hoped to receive fajardo was sentenced to a term of months on counts one and eight and months to be served concurrently on count five.the court ordered restitution in the amount of million.cruz was sentenced to a term of months on the three counts,with the previously agreed upon forfeiture amount of.these appeals followed.
ii.appeal of 
cruz asserts generally that,in light of his substantial assistance to the government,he is entitled to be sentenced in accordance with his plea agreement.presumably recognizing that the district court was not bound by the agreement,he particularizes that contention by identifying three specific flaws in his sentencing he was improperly denied a downward departure for substantial assistance his sentence should not have been calculated based on the total loss alleged in the indictment,million and the court made several statements during sentencing that reflected bias toward him.we address each in turn.
downward departure.under cruz plea agreement,the government was obliged to move for downward departure under if prosecutors determine d that the defendant has provided substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense.the agreement also provided that it was conditioned upon the defendant providing full,complete,truthful and substantial cooperation,and that the government would be released from compliance if the defendant failed in any way to fulfill his obligations.
cruz acknowledged that,in one instance,he did not tell the truth,admitting in a sentencing motion that he had failed to remember a check that became important at trial and crucial to the position of the attorney.he consequently stipulated to a upward adjustment for obstruction of justice.
cruz maintains that this single episode does not negate the extensive cooperation he provided,which included substantial testimony before the grand jury and delivery of more than incriminating documents.he notes that he would have testified at trial as well had the proceedings not been cut short by the government.
although it appears that cruz provided significant assistance in the prosecution of this case,his cooperation agreement explicitly gave the government the authority not to request a downward departure in the event cruz failed to meet his obligation to be truthful.cruz does not dispute his lack of veracity or the relevance of his untruthfulness,seeking only to minimize its weight in light of his otherwise full cooperation with the government.whether or not we agree with the government judgment not to recommend a downward departure is of no consequence.in the absence of an unconstitutional motivation or arbitrariness,see united states davis,cir united states doe,cir,and in the face of cruz admitted obstruction of justice,the government decision was within its discretion.united states saxena,cir a defendant who has entered into a plea agreement with the government,and himself fulfills that agreement,is entitled to the benefit of his bargain.emphasis added see also davis,at government burden in defending a decision not to file a substantial assistance motion,at least where there is a plea agreement,is modest,only one of production,not of persuasion.
to the extent cruz separately challenges the district court denial of his motion for a downward departure under the general departure guideline,his claim is without merit.we repeatedly have stated that departures for substantial assistance must come within the confines of,united states sandoval,cir,and that a district court consequently is not empowered to independently grant a departure for that reason under,see,davis,at sandoval,at united states alegria,cir.the court therefore did not err in denying his motion.
calculation of loss.cruz maintains that the court improperly utilized the total loss alleged in the indictment,million,in calculating his sentence,resulting in an erroneous increase in his base offense level.see b h he contends that his sentence should have been based on the amount of loss attributed to him in his plea agreement,which would have triggered only a increase.
it is undisputed that cruz was not personally implicated in the full million loss charged in the indictment.at sentencing,however,the district court expressed its view that cruz and fajardo were equally culpable partners in crime.the court also noted that the factual allegations indicated that the money involved in the conspiracy significantly exceeded the million dollars reflected in the indictment,which simply was the amount the government felt it could prove beyond a reasonable doubt.because of the scope of the scheme and appellant admitted obstruction of justice,the court found that it was not bound by the plea agreement and that a sentence at the high end of the applicable range,based on the full million,was appropriate.the court noted that there were grounds for imposing an upward departure,but decided against doing so.
appellate review of a district court application of the guidelines typically involves a inquiry w e scrutinize the district court legal determinations de novo and check its factual determinations for clear error.mateo,at.here,cruz challenges the court factual finding that he is accountable for the full million loss.we see no clear error in that judgment.cruz pled guilty to count one,which charged a conspiracy to interfere with commerce by extortion,in violation of a.although cruz did not participate in each act allegedly a part of the conspiracy,it is well established that may be sentenced based on all reasonably foreseeable acts of others in furtherance of the,all relevant conduct under.see united states laboy,cir a b.based on cruz extensive involvement throughout the relevant period,as detailed in his plea and cooperation agreement,the court supportably found that he shared responsibility as a partner for the full amount of the loss.
judicial bias.cruz claims that two comments by the district judge,one at his sentencing hearing and the other at fajardo bail revocation hearing,reflected bias sufficiently prejudicial to warrant his by another judge.he points to the judge comment that fajardo,cruz and ruperto vazquez lopez operated like mafiosos,particularly when they allocated among themselves specific percentages of the illegal extortion and kickback proceeds they anticipated collecting.cruz also challenges the judge description of him as the enforcer in the conspiracy.
we need not dwell on this issue.first,cruz neither objected to these comments nor sought recusal of the trial judge based on partiality,limiting our review to assessing only whether plain error occurred.see,united states arache,cir.whatever one view of the judge rhetoric,we think it beyond debate that it reflected a assessment of the type of conduct in which the defendants engaged and not a fundamentally unfair bias toward cruz.
j udicial remarks during the course of a trial that are critical or disapproving of,or even hostile to,counsel,the parties,or their cases,ordinarily do not support a bias or partiality challenge.they may do so if they reveal an opinion that derives from an extrajudicial source and they will do so if they reveal such a high degree of favoritism or antagonism as to make fair judgment impossible.
liteky united states,d emphasis in original.the remarks here reveal neither,and cruz claim is thus unavailing.
iii.appeal of 
following an evidentiary hearing to explore the government allegations that fajardo had committed perjury and breached his plea agreement,the district court found that he was not entitled to enforcement of the agreement and subsequently concluded that his lack of truthfulness warranted an upward adjustment in his sentence for obstruction of justice.fajardo claims that he must be because it was the breached the agreement,and because the court imposition of a harsh sentence stemmed from violations of his fifth and sixth amendment rights.
the constitutional claims primarily arose from the district court requirement that fajardo answer a series of questions on at his trial after he had invoked the fifth amendment,without first allowing him to consult with his attorney the questions concerned a company created by his wife and for which he served as board president,community services training institute community,that was largely unconnected with the charged conspiracy but was the subject of a pending local investigation.it was fajardo answers to those questions,which sought to link community with research management the company formed to implement the extortion scheme,that prompted the government allegations of perjury and,in large part,triggered dismissal of the case.the government acknowledges that the testimony elicited after fajardo invoked his fifth amendment rights was improperly received,but it correctly points out that fajardo statements about community ultimately played no role in his sentencing.the district court relied on other factors to conclude that fajardo had breached the plea agreement and obstructed justice,and we therefore need not address the substance of the constitutional claims.
instead,we consider the three instances of untruthfulness on which the district court did we will detail conclude that the court did not err in finding that fajardo breached the plea agreement as we explain below,however,we are troubled by the manner in which the government achieved this result.we begin our discussion with some additional procedural background.
shortly after the trial was terminated and fajardo bail was revoked,an evidentiary a revocation hearing was held to determine if he had been properly returned to custody.the parties addressed the alleged perjury concerning community and,for the first time on the record,the government identified three additional instances of untruthfulness that it claimed justified withdrawal of the plea agreement,supported an enhancement for obstruction of justice,and contributed to the decision to end the trial and dismiss the case against the remaining defendants.
at the end of the hearing,the court ordered fajardo continued detention.a month later,the court issued an order finding that the government had met its burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that fajardo had substantially breached his obligation under the plea agreement to provide truthful,complete and accurate testimony and information.see united states tilley,cir.the court thus released the government from its obligations under the agreement.the court based its decision on the three alternative incidents of alleged untruthfulness,declining to address whether fajardo testimony on community constituted perjury.
the court relied on the following discrepancies fajardo acknowledgment on that he had committed criminal acts before,the year he became secretary of education,allegedly contradicted a prior statement to prosecutors that his criminal activity began when he assumed that position his testimony that a contractor had financed a trip to chicago conflicted with subsequently obtained documentary evidence showing that cruz had reimbursed the contractor for the expenses and his testimony on indicating that the contractors participated in the scheme under economic duress allegedly differed from earlier statements to prosecutors that the contractors were collaborators in a mutual business undertaking.
fajardo claims that,because the government was unable to substantiate the alleged perjury regarding community,it contrived these three inaccuracies as an alternative way to make him the scapegoat for its flawed investigation and prosecution.he complains that these vague and unannounced allegations his counsel at the revocation hearing.moreover,he maintains that none of the three claims has merit.
on the alleged contradiction regarding the use of economic duress against the contractors,fajardo asserts that he testified truthfully in response to technically framed questions that mirrored the language of the indictment,his plea agreement and the charging statute any problem,he insists,is attributable to the government case at the revocation hearing,his attorney observed that bribery might have been a more appropriate charge than one requiring fear of economic harm.moreover,fajardo points out,he was denied any opportunity to explain his,indeed,the government acknowledged at the revocation hearing that it initially anticipated being able to rehabilitate fajardo on the issue of duress on redirect.see infra at as for payment of the chicago expenses,fajardo discounts the importance of any error in his recollection of that one particular trip in light of the contr
