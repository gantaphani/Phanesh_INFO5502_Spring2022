the defendant,rex shelby,filed a pretrial appeal from an order by the district court that denied his motion to dismiss,on double jeopardy grounds,a seventh superseding indictment filed against him on november.presently before this court is the government motion to dismiss shelby appeal.the government contends that we lack jurisdiction over the appeal because shelby double jeopardy claims are not colorable and frivolous.for the reasons discussed below,we agree and dismiss the appeal.
background 
shelby trial,reindictment,and first motion to dismiss on jeopardy grounds 
shelby case relates to the collapse of the enron corporation and its subsidiaries.shelby was a senior executive at enron broadband services ebs,enron broadband and telecommunications unit.shelby,along with scott yeager and joseph hirko,were indicted in november on various counts of conspiracy to commit wire and securities fraud securities fraud wire fraud insider trading and money laundering.in july,a jury acquitted shelby on four of his insider trading involving trades made in the summer of the summer counts but hung on the remaining counts against him.the jury also acquitted or hung as to some counts against yeager and hirko.the district court declared a mistrial on the hung counts.the government subsequently obtained new indictments against all of the defendants,including the seventh superseding indictment against shelby.
the seventh superseding indictment recharged shelby with four insider trading counts relating to trades made in early the early counts on which the jury had hung.the indictment also charged one count of conspiracy and one of securities fraud.shelby moved to dismiss the indictment on double jeopardy grounds.the district court denied the motion,united states shelby,d,and we affirmed,united states yeager,cir yeager i,rev on other grounds.
in support of dismissal,shelby chief argument was that in acquitting as to the summer counts,the jury necessarily decided issues of fact that had preclusive effect as to the counts in the new indictment.specifically,shelby asserted that,by acquitting,the jury must necessarily have determined that he lacked the intent to defraud.the parties do not dispute that a finding that shelby lacked the intent to defraud would defeat a necessary element of the insider trading and securities fraud counts in the new indictment,therefore precluding prosecution as to these counts.see united states brackett,cir c ollateral estoppel will completely bar a subsequent prosecution if one of the facts necessarily determined in the former trial is an essential element of the subsequent prosecution.
the district court determined and we agreed,however,that in acquitting as to the summer counts,the jury did not necessarily decide that shelby lacked intent.rather,a fter an extensive examination of the record,we affirmed the district court conclusion that the jury acquittal could have hinged on the fact that the government had failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that shelby actually used or relied upon material nonpublic information in his possession at the time he made the element of insider trading.see yeager i,at.the district court observed that the government presented little to no evidence that defendant shelby made any material misrepresentations or acquired material information in june and july,the dates of shelby acquitted counts of insider trading.shelby,d at.the district court also noted that,by contrast,the government presented substantial evidence that defendant shelby either made material misrepresentations or acquired material information before the trades that were the subject of the early counts.id.at.
we agreed with the district court reasoning,noting also that shelby had specifically testified that he made the summer trades because he was uncomfortable with being in the stock market and in reliance on a friend advice on when to sell.yeager i,at.we held that the jury was properly instructed that a trade that used or was motivated by inside information was an element of insider trading.id.at.we concluded that the jury did not necessarily find that shelby used insider information in making the early trades 
in acquitting shelby of the later summer counts,the jury could have differentiated between the two different sets of trades.the jury could have found that shelby did not use insider information when he conducted the trades that underlie the summer insider trading counts but did use insider information when he conducted the trades that underlie the early insider trading counts.the evidence at trial supports this distinction.
id.at.we noted specifically that shelby trading patterns were markedly different between the early and summer trades.in the early trades,shelby exercised options that had vested in june.we speculated that f rom this delay,the jury could have rationally concluded that shelby purposely waited for the stock price to go up before exercising his options and that shelby knew the price would go up because of his knowledge of insider information.we noted that by contrast,with the summer trades,shelby exercised his options as soon as they vested.id.
three days after granting certiorari as to his yeager,yeager united states,the supreme court denied shelby petition for certiorari,shelby united states.reh g denied.
yeager trial,reindictment,and motion to dismiss on jeopardy grounds 
in yeager i,at,we also rejected the double jeopardy claims of shelby,hirko and yeager.at the trial,the jury acquitted yeager of securities fraud,wire fraud,and conspiracy but hung on counts of insider trading and counts of money laundering.the government reindicted yeager on the hung charges.
yeager moved to dismiss the new indictment,urging that double jeopardy barred the insider trading counts.yeager argued that in acquitting on the fraud and conspiracy counts,the jury necessarily decided that he did not possess insider information,an element of insider trading.we agreed that the jury,acting rationally,could have acquitted yeager on securities fraud only by concluding that he did not have insider information.id.at.we nevertheless concluded that collateral estoppel did not bar the insider trading counts.applying our precedent in united states larkin,cir,we considered the hung counts and observed that if the jury found that yeager did not have insider information,then the jury,acting rationally,would have acquitted him of insider trading and money laundering.instead,the jury hung.yeager i,at.we reasoned that the hung counts therefore created uncertainty about what the jury necessarily decided.id.in light of this uncertainty,we concluded that collateral estoppel did not apply.id.at.
the supreme court granted certiorari on yeager appeal.the court then abrogated our precedent in larkin and reversed,concluding that we erred in weighing the effect of the hung counts in determining the preclusive effect of the acquittals.yeager united states,yeager ii.the court held 
t he consideration of hung counts has no place in the analysis to identify what a jury necessarily determined at trial,courts should scrutinize a jury decisions,not its failures to decide.a jury verdict of acquittal represents the community collective judgment regarding all the evidence and arguments presented to it.even if the verdict is based upon an egregiously erroneous foundation,its finality is unassailable.thus,if the possession of insider information was a critical issue of ultimate fact in all of the charges against the petitioner,a jury verdict that necessarily decided that issue in his favor protects him from prosecution for any charge for which that is an essential element.
id.at internal quotation marks omitted.the court reasoned that a contrary conclusion would require speculation into what transpired in the jury room,and noted that i f there is to be an inquiry into what the jury decided,the evidence should be confined to the points in controversy on the former trial,to the testimony given by the parties,and to the questions submitted to the jury for their consideration.id.at internal quotation marks omitted quoting packet sickles,wall.on remand,we dismissed the indic
