rare is the person who relishes getting calls from those great patrons of the telephone,telemarketers yet many charities,especially small,obscure or unpopular ones,could not fund their operations without telemarketers.some professional telemarketers take the lion share of solicited donations,sometimes requiring and receiving commission rates of up to.most donors would probably be shocked or surprised to learn that most of their contributions were going to telemarketers instead of charitable activities.but the supreme court has held that,under the first amendment,the bare failure to disclose these high costs to donors can not,by itself,support a fraud conviction.madigan telemarketing,d.evidence of high fundraising costs may,nonetheless,support a fraud prosecution when nondisclosure is accompanied by intentionally misleading statements designed to deceive the listener.id.
in this appeal we consider,among other things,under what circumstances the government may introduce high commission rates as evidence in a criminal fraud case.timothy lyons and gabriel sanchez challenge their convictions for mail fraud and money laundering on the basis that they never lied,and never asked the telemarketers in their employ to lie,about the fact that around of donations to their charities were earmarked for telemarketing commissions.
lyons and sanchez did,however,misrepresent to donors how they spent contributions net of telemarketer commissions.their undoing was not that the commissions were large but that their charitable web was a scam.donors were told their contributions went to specific charitable activities when,in reality,almost no money did.we conclude that the government did not violate the first amendment by introducing evidence that over of donations went to telemarketers.
lyons and sanchez also claim error involving the admission of evidence and jury instructions.these claims lack merit.we affirm the convictions and order a limited remand pursuant to united states ameline,cir en banc.
background 
factual background 
we first describe the scheme lyons and sanchez devised,and then turn to the specific representations made to potential donors through both telemarketers and promotional pamphlets,and how lyons and sanchez actually spent the funds they received.
overview of the scheme 
around early,friends lyons and sanchez decided to form a business in which sanchez would run a church and lyons would supervise telemarketers to raise money for the church.sanchez formed the first church of life fcl,which had no congregation,services or place of worship its address belonged to the house of sanchez father.lyons formed a fundraising company called north american acquisitions naa.
in pursuit of their scheme,the pair created six charities under the fcl umbrella and selected names likely to attract sympathy and donations,including the aids research association,children assistance foundation,cops and sheriffs of america,handicapped youth services,firefighters,and veterans league.none of these charities had infrastructure separate from fcl.the groups also had little if any actual contact with the people or causes they purported to support.
naa outsourced most operations to telemarketers to solicit donations on behalf of fcl charities.donors usually sent checks,made out to the various fcl charities,to the telemarketers.on average,the telemarketers took of the donated funds as commission.naa kept another,and the last was deposited into the respective accounts of the six fcl charities.we explain later in greater detail how funds were distributed.
as a registered fundraiser,naa filed annual financial reports with the state of california and disclosed all funds collected and all fees that went to the telemarketers and naa.by december,fcl had lost its status in california,so sanchez registered a new church in nevada,christian outreach ministries,through which he ran the six charities originally under the fcl umbrella.
in,a california newspaper published articles calling sanchez operation a scam.sanchez left christian outreach ministries and began to work for naa.the operation of the charities fell to other.
lyons and sanchez went to nevada,where they incorporated yet another church,mercy ministries,later renamed glory ministries.the church became the umbrella organization for six new charities,which inherited money and names from the old charities 
in,lyons sold the assets of naa to roger lane.according to his employees,lyons kept operational control of naa.although employees were told to regard him as a consultant,lyons was still in charge and actively involved.
specific representations and funds spent 
during the course of the scheme,lyons and sanchez raised over million for the various causes.out of these millions raised on behalf of the six fcl charities,very little was spent on charitable to the government,about this amount is small,even as a percentage of the net donations received after paying telemarketers commissions.most of the charities funds actually went to sanchez personal rent,car payments,loan payments,legal expenses,medical expenses,and credit card payments.
nevertheless,lyons and sanchez wrote scripts for telemarketers to read to donors,as well as promotional pamphlets,that suggested otherwise every script and pamphlet mentioned a number of specific charitable activities purportedly funded by donors contributions.we review in turn each of the six charities,what each charity promised,and what each charity actually delivered.
aids research association claimed that its goals were to provide funds to local hospitals to help find a cure or at least to help funding of drug programs which may enhance or lengthen the life of patients,and to provide funds to local patients by giving care or just helping out families when a person dies of no evidence indicates that the association ever gave funds to hospitals,aids patients or their families.according to the government,the association raised in and but spent no money at all on charitable activities.
children assistance foundation claimed that its goal was to eventually open a facility for long term care for children and their families,and that its activities included relocat ing entire families and helping children and their families by providing food,shelter,medical care,and simple family expenses.the group did not help multiple families or children,though sanchez himself provided exactly one woman and her child food and shelter for several months.the foundation raised in and,but could document spending just on charitable activities.
cops and sheriffs of america claimed to finance various crime prevention and drug awareness programs throughout the country and provide police officers education on state of the art equipment and techniques.the group published a magazine annually containing paid advertisements.the charity changed its name to police and sheriff support fund,which purported to provide free classes,financial support for neighborhood watch programs and families of slain officers,and contributions to the national law enforcement officers memorial.of its advertised activities,the fund offered only a single class attended by a few naa or fcl employees.the group raised in and,with only spent on charitable activities.
handicapped youth services purported to help provide wheelchairs,crutches,walkers or any other equipment that these children may need but financially can not afford,and to take handicapped children to fairs,museums,and amusement parks to give some cheer to their lives.in and,the charity raised.the group documented spending no money at all on charitable activities.
the pamphlet for firefighters said that it funded various fire prevention and awareness programs throughout the country,including the education of professional and volunteer firefighters on equipment and techniques of firefighting and fire prevention.apparently,one person went to low income houses in orange county on behalf of the group,installed fire extinguishers and smoke detectors,left information,and gave away fire extinguishers.nothing in the record suggests that any firefighters were educated.in and,the group raised but could document only spent on its charitable activities.
veteran league claimed to provide clothing,food,shelter,and career counseling to homeless veterans and purported to have formed scholarships and grants for veterans.employees of sanchez and lyons testified that the charity carried out none of these activities.the league raised in and but spent just on charitable activities.
ii.procedural background 
in october,a grand jury charged lyons and sanchez,as well as roger lane and steven delatorre,with counts of mail fraud,counts of money laundering and one count of criminal forfeiture.lane and delatorre pleaded guilty just before trial.
at trial,the government introduced evidence of the misrepresentations lyons and sanchez made on behalf of each charity.the government introduced as exhibits the telemarketer scripts and promotional pamphlets prepared by lyons and sanchez,as described above.donors testified as to what they were told by telemarketers.the government also explained how lyons and sanchez,through their scripts and pamphlets,had misrepresented the nonprofit status of fcl and its charities 
evidence of the high commissions taken by telemarketers and how donations were actually spent formed a backdrop for testimony about the charities.former employees testified that very little money was spent on charitable work.some testified that sanchez did no work while at the office,where he talked on the telephone and played video games.former employees also testified that they had asked lyons and sanchez what precise charitable activities fcl engaged in.lyons admitted to an employee that fcl and its progeny did nothing for charity,and sanchez told another employee that it was none of her business what he did for charity.
the government presented that summarized the bank records of each of the six charities and how they spent donations received.each chart showed the total donations raised by each of the charities over roughly two years,between and.for instance,the chart for handicapped youth services showed that,from late to november,the organization received in donations.of this amount,the chart showed that or went to naa,and that eventually went to a new account for disabled children charity the second generation incarnation of handicapped youth services.of the available for the charity to spend on its activities not including returned deposits and funds for which records are missing,the government chart reflected that was spent on charitable activities.the government explained that sanchez actually spent the on his own expenses,including his own sports car,house rent,legal fees unrelated to naa or fcl,and personal medical bills.throughout the trial,as a foundation for its explanation that the charities established by lyons and sanchez spent almost no money on charitable activities,the government referred to the high commissions taken by telemarketers.the government opening argument is fairly representative of the way it treated the high telemarketer commission rate throughout the trial 
i like to talk now a moment about the money.
you will hear during the course of this trial that out of every dollar raised from donors,to percent went to,defendant lyon company.not a dollar of that money went for any charitable purpose whatsoever.
now,out of that money,to percent went to professional telemarketers.the rates varied depending on the firm.and he kept the rest himself.he used it to pay his salary,his personal expenses 
now,that leaves us with percent approximately.that percent was deposited into an account under the name of the purported charity for example,the handicapped youth services account.
those accounts were under the control of defendant sanchez.
but of this money you will hear that the vast majority of it went into the pockets of defendant sanchez and those that worked for to pay for their business expenses,their personal expenses,and other items.virtually no money went for any charitable purpose whatsoever.
in november,after a trial,the district court instructed the jury on the elements of mail fraud,liability,and the relevance of high costs to fraud 
in order for the defendant to be found guilt y of mail fraud as charged in counts through in violation of,the government must prove each of the following elements beyond a reasonable doubt 
first,the defendant knowingly devised or knowingly participated in a scheme or plan to defraud,or a scheme or plan for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses,representations,or promises 
second,the defendant knew that the promises or statements were false 
third,the promises or statements made or facts omitted were material,that is,they would reasonably influence a person to part with money or property 
fourth,the defendant acted with the intent to defraud and 
fifth,the defendant used or caused to be used,the mails to carry out or attempt to carry out an essential part of the scheme.
the phrases scheme to defraud and scheme to obtain money or funds mean any deliberate plan of action or course of conduct by which someone intends to deceive or to cheat another,or by which someone intends to deprive another of something of value.
the term false or fraudulent pretenses,representations,or promises includes actual direct false statements and includes the knowing concealment of facts that are material to the matter in question that were made or used with the intent to defraud.
each member of a scheme to defraud may be responsible for the actions of the other performed during the course of and in furtherance of the scheme.a defendant is responsible for a fraudulent acts if 
one,the defendant himself was a member of the scheme to defraud 
second,the defendant had the intent to defraud 
third,the acts of were performed during the course of and in furtherance of the scheme and 
fourth,the defendant personally made up or participated in the scheme.
high costs without more do not establish fraud.and mere failure to volunteer the fee when contacting a potential donee without more is insufficient to establish fraud.
the jury convicted lyons and sanchez on all mail fraud and money laundering counts.the district court denied lyons motion for a new trial and directed verdict.lyons and sanchez were each sentenced to months in prison and three years of supervised release.
lyons and sanchez challenge their convictions on constitutional and evidentiary grounds.they also argue that if their convictions stand,they are entitled to a remand under ameline,if not full resentencings.sanchez alone requests a remand to a different district judge.
first amendment and fundraising costs 
lyons and sanchez argue that their mail fraud convictions violated the first amendment because the district court allowed the government to use the high cost of fundraising as evidence of fraud even though they had not affirmatively misrepresented the cost of fundraising to donors.they raise a cluster of arguments,all premised on a similar misreading of madigan.
madigan established a default rule in criminal prosecutions for fraud involving telemarketing the bare failure to disclose the high cost of fundraising directly to potential donors does not suffice to establish fraud.at.that is,the mere fact that a telemarketer keeps of contributions it solicits can not be the basis of a fraud conviction,and neither can the fact that a telemarketer fails to volunteer this information to donors.this safe harbor stems from a trio of supreme court cases that barred states from adopting regulations either limiting the percentage of donations fundraisers usually telemarketers may take,or requiring fundraisers to tell donors about the percentage commission taken by fundraisers.see riley fed of the blind,d secretary of state of joseph munson,d schaumburg citizens for a better environment,d.the supreme court articulated the first amendment concern at stake in these fundraising cases this way our prior cases teach that the solicitation of charitable contributions is protected speech,and that using percentages to decide the legality of the fundraiser fee is not narrowly tailored to the state interest in preventing fraud.riley,at.
the limit of this principle may be seen in madigan holding that when nondisclosure is accompanied by intentionally misleading statements designed to deceive the listener,the high cost of fundraising may be introduced as evidence of fraud in a criminal case.at.riley foreshadowed this result by noting that fraud prosecutions were narrowly tailored enough to be in keeping with first amendment directives,and that the state may vigorously enforce its antifraud laws to prohibit professional fundraisers from obtaining money on false pretenses or by making false statements.at.
lyons and sanchez urge an extremely narrow view of madigan,arguing that madigan held that if the fundraiser affirmatively misrepresented the costs of the fundraising,then,and only then,evidence of the costs might be utilized to demonstrate the fraudulent nature of any specific misrepresentations.emphasis added.the apparent basis for this argument is that in madigan,the defendants directly lied to donors about the percentage of donations that went to charitable activities as opposed to fundraising thus,lyons and sanchez urge that unless the government could show that they lied to donors about how much the telemarketers would receive,the government was barred from introducing evidence of the high commissions paid to telemarketers.
madigan reach is not as narrow as lyons and sanchez suggest so long as the emphasis in the arguments made by the prosecution is on what the fundraisers misleadingly convey,and not on percentage limitations on solicitors fees per se,such actions need not impermissibly chill protected speech.madigan,at.the supreme court emphasized that the first amendment case law emphatically do es not require a blanket exemption from fraud liability for a fundraiser who intentionally misleads in calls for donations.id.at.madigan underscores that the state faces a high burden to demonstrate fraud,including the burden to prove that a defendant made knowing misrepresentations with the intent to defraud.see id.at.thus,e xacting proof requirements of this order,in other contexts,have been held to provide sufficient breathing room for protected speech.id.citing,inter alia,new york times sullivan,d.
in madigan,the defendants not only misrepresented the percentage of funds going to telemarketers,they also made false promises about how net of telemarketers to be spent.telemarketers told prospective donors their contributions would be used for specifically identified charitable endeavors,such as food baskets,job training,rent and bill payments,and rehabilitation for veterans of the vietnam war,even though donations did not pay for these activities.id.at.the government alleged that,even taking into account the fact that fundraisers received of donations,the charity itself spent only of all funds or only of net donation proceeds on providing charitable services.see id.at.the indictment charged that the charitable solicitation was a facade because a lthough the fundraisers represented that donated funds would go to the charity specific charitable purposes,the amount of funds being paid over to the charity was merely incidental to the fund raising effort,which was made for the private pecuniary benefit of the fundraisers and their agents.id.at.internal citations and quotation marks omitted.
with respect to lyons and sanchez,the government both alleged in its indictment and offered evidence at trial of specific misrepresentations and omissions they made regarding the use of donated funds.specifically,the government evidence underscored the fact that virtually none of the money that ended up in the bank accounts of the six fcl charities went to any charitable activities at all,let alone the specific charitable activities mentioned in the telemarketers calls or promotional pamphlets.these misrepresentations are nearly identical to the specific misrepresentations at issue in madigan.see id.at.misrepresenting that significant part of donations actually went to charitable activity when,even net of fundraising costs,very little did id.at.representing that donations would fund specific charitable activities for vietnam veterans that were never carried out.
neither madigan nor the first amendment insulates defendants from criminal prosecution for fraudulent misrepresentations about their charitable endeavors.rather,the government is constrained from charging that high fundraising costs per se are tantamount to fraud.our case is much like madigan.the fraud is banded by the blatant misrepresentations about the charities.however,admission of evidence regarding the fundraising costs was essential to understanding the overall scheme and the shell game of the multiple charities.the government did not violate lyons or sanchez first amendment rights by introducing evidence that telemarketers received of funds donated to the various fcl charities because the government had also shown that lyons and sanchez,through their respective organizations,had made fraudulent misrepresentations regarding disposition of the charitable funds.
ii.rule and fundraising costs 
lyons and sanchez argue that the government repeated emphasis throughout the trial on the cost of fundraising,specifically the high commissions received by telemarketers,constituted unfair prejudice substantially outweighing its probative value under federal rule of evidence under rule,unfair prejudice is an undue tendency to suggest decision on an improper basis.rule advisory committee notes.we review the district court rule decisions for abuse of discretion.united states,cir.
relying on selective excerpts from the record,lyons and sanchez claim that the government repeatedly emphasized the high commissions taken by telemarketers,as if this fact alone were sufficient to sustain a fraud conviction.a review of the record and trial as a whole shows the government did not solely or relentlessly focus on the high cost of fundraising to prove fraud.to be sure,the government asked many witnesses about the high fundraising costs,but the vast bulk of questions concerned misrepresentations or fcl failure to apply donated funds to charitable purposes.nor was the high commission rate itself a basis of the government fraud case.rather,the commission was a legitimate expense and part of the overall picture of how the money was allocated 
just as the government could not demonstrate fraud simply by showing that of contributions went to telemarketing fees instead of charity,neither could it prove fraud solely by showing that of donations were not spent on charity,without showing what happened to the remaining of the funds.
the evidence is overwhelming that between telemarketers fees and lyons and sanchez personal expenses,the six fcl charities spent virtually no money on charitable activities promised to donors.the district court did not abuse its discretion in overruling the rule objections regarding fundraising costs 
iii.jury instructions 
lyons and sanchez argue that the district court made four discrete errors,failing to instruct the jury as to the proper scope of madigan to be unanimous on the particular false representations made by lyons or sanchez to be unanimous on the theory of mail fraud because the government allegedly offered two theories false representations or scheme to defraud and as to the correct elements of liability.we review de novo whether the district court jury instructions accurately stated the law.united states stapleton,cir.
the following was,in relevant part,the district court jury instruction as to the rule in madigan high costs without more do not establish fraud.and mere failure to volunteer the fee when contacting a potential donee without more is insufficient to establish fraud.according to lyons and sanchez,the jury instruction allowed the jury to believe that it could convict based on the confluence of these two facts that,taken independently,could not support a fraud conviction.that is,they claim the jury could have convicted based on high fundraising costs and the failure to volunteer information about fundraising costs to donors.
lyons and sanchez posit that the district court should have directed the jury not to consider the high fundraising costs as any evidence of fraud whatsoever.alternately,they propose that the instruction should have told the jury that neither evidence of high fundraising costs nor evidence that such costs were not gratuitously disclosed,nor any combination of both,could be deemed any evidence of fraud absent proof of misrepresentations of these costs.
the difficulty with their challenge is that the court instruction was a nearly verbatim quotation from madigan.see at.it is difficult to understand the claim that the jury instruction was flatly prohibited by the supreme court in madigan when the instruction quite appropriately quoted the controlling law.
unanimity as to a particular false promise 
both lyons and sanchez claim that the district court should have instructed the jury that,to convict on mail fraud,it had to agree unanimously on the particular false promise or statement made by the defendants.thus,according to lyons and sanchez,different members of the jury could have convicted them based on different false promises.for instance,some jurors may have decided to convict because handicapped youth services did not provide wheelchairs to handicapped children as pamphlets promised,while other jurors may have convicted because the aids research association failed to provide any funds to hospitals or aids patients.
this argument is foreclosed by a long line of cases the jury need not be unanimous on the particular false promise.see,united states woods,cir under the mail fraud statute the government is not required to prove any particular false statement was made.the district court instruction was proper.
unanimity as to the theory of fraud 
the next challenge to the jury instructions is that the district court should have instructed the jury to be unanimous on the theory of fraud.lyons and sanchez claim that the instructions given suggest two conceptually distinct theories of mail fraud liability the scheme to defraud theory and the specific misrepresentation theory.because this issue was not raised at trial,we review for plain error.united states sanders,cir.
ordinarily,the general unanimity instruction suffices to instruct the jury that they must be unanimous on whatever specifications form the basis of the guilty verdict.united states kim,cir.a specific unanimity instruction is required if it appears that there is a genuine possibility of jury confusion or that a conviction may occur as the result of different jurors concluding that the defendant committed different acts.id.citing united states anguiano,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
nothing here suggests the jury might have been confused,nor do lyons and sanchez offer any evidence to suggest this was the case.see united states mastelotto,cir requiring special unanimity instruction when a variance occurred between the single scheme charged in each count of the indictment and the proof at trial which indicated the existence of two schemes.most importantly,though,the government did not present two theories of fraud.lyons and sanchez have miscast the jury instructions and created a false dichotomy between a scheme to defraud theory and a false promises theory.the jury instruction provided that,to prove mail fraud under,the government was required to show that a defendant knowingly devised or knowingly participated in a scheme or plan to defraud,or a scheme or plan for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses,representations or promises emphasis added.
thus,the alternate theories actually both involve schemes or plans.the jury instruction as given simply did not provide for mail fraud liability in the absence of a unifying scheme or plan.by following this instruction,the jury could not have convicted lyons and sanchez for making false promises in the abstract.
in any case,jurors need not be unanimous as to a particular theory of liability so long as they are unanimous that the defendant has committed the underlying substantive offense.kim,at i t was not necessary for the jurors in this case to unanimously agree on a specific classification of kim conduct.here,the scheme or plan to defraud and scheme or plan for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses both involve the same underlying statutory offense,a violation of.
finally,sufficient evidence presented at trial showed that both lyons and sanchez had both devised a scheme to defraud donors and a scheme to obtain money by false pretenses.under these circumstances,the district court did not commit plain error.see united states fredette,cir finding no plain error when the district court issued general unanimity instruction and ample evidence showed that defendant both devised a scheme to defraud customers and dealers and devised a scheme to obtain money by false pretenses.emphasis in original.
we next consider the final challenge to the jury instructions,namely that the district court did not instruct the jury as to all the elements of liability.the district court instructed that to convict on liability,the jury had to find that defendant was a member of the scheme he acted with intent to defraud the acts of the were during and in furtherance of the scheme and defendant participated in the scheme.the district court did not instruct the jury that,for a defendant to be vicariously liable for the acts of his,those acts must have been reasonably foreseeable and in furtherance of the scheme.see united states tarallo,cir.
the government argues that foreseeability is not an element of liability.but the very case it cites,stapleton,indicates that jury instructions must limit vicarious liability to acts of during the life of the scheme and acts that were reasonably foreseeable as a necessary and natural consequence of the fraudulent scheme.at emphasis added.stapleton affirmed jury instructions that explicitly made foreseeability an element of liability.id.at for a defendant to be found guilty of an offense allegedly committed by a coschemer as part of the scheme,the offense must be one which would reasonably have been foreseen to be a necessary and natural consequence of the scheme to defraud.emphasis added and original bolding omitted.thus,the district court erred by not instructing the jury that foreseeability is an element of liability.
the question,then,is the effect of this instructional error.although this instruction was not challenged at trial,the error was not plain and did not affect the substantial rights of either lyons or sanchez.see sanders,at.
lyons seeks to distance himself from liability for any misrepresentations in the brochures for charities,counts,all of which he argues were created after he had sold his business to roger lane.but lyons was still an active participant in the scheme,including the drafting of fraudulent pamphlets,long after he sold his business.lyons not only authored the brochures,he was still in charge of naa after lane purchase.because lyons was still actively participating in the fraud alleged,foreseeability was not an issue,and the district court error was not plain and did not affect lyons substantial rights.see stapleton,at noting that a defendant may only be vicariously liable for the acts of that occurred during the defendant knowing participation or were an inevitable consequence of actions taken while the defendant was a knowing participant.
as was the case with lyons,many of the mail fraud counts against sanchez are based on sanchez active participation in the scheme to defraud.they thus involve his liability as a principal the remaining counts in the indictment involve actions in furtherance of the fraudulent scheme that were reasonably foreseeable.the counts of mail fraud relating to actions that took place after sanchez left the scheme in late charged sanchez with actions executed by in accord with his explicit instructions.mail fraud that took place after,then,was an inevitable consequence of actions taken while sanchez was a knowing participant in the scheme to defraud.id.thus the district court error was not plain and did not affect sanchez substantial rights.
iv.sentencing 
lyons and sanchez request limited remands pursuan
