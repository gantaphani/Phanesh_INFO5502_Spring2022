the government indicted jones and clark on several charges because of their failure to disclose the relationship between the two organizations.they pled guilty to only one count of health care fraud under.prior to sentencing,jones and clark filed objections to the presentence report psr.the government and the defendants filed memoranda on the question of whether medicare suffered a loss from the offense.on july,the district court conducted an evidentiary hearing on the issue.the government offered the psr to prove the amount of loss to medicare.the psr listed the full amount of medicare reimbursements to riverbend for payments to health one,and payments to jones and clark,individually.
the defense experts testified that riverbend costs were reasonable and within the range of typical payments to organizations and individuals.one defense witness,the former director of a medicare fiscal intermediary,testified that trispan never reopened the previously settled cost reports or conducted an audit to determine the reasonableness of the cost reports.the government rebuttal witness,robertson,alleged that trispan could not identify comparable local facilities to riverbend.the government offered the salary of the chief operating officer coo of francis medical center in monroe,louisiana,a larger hospital,as a frame of reference for the district court to determine the reasonableness of riverbend costs.the government witness admitted that riverbend was not comparable to francis hospital.
the district court accepted the psr as evidence regarding the actual costs incurred by riverbend.the court then reduced the loss amount by the estimated value of performed services.the court again reduced the loss amount by the cost of bed leases evidenced in riverbend cost reports.in october,the district court entered judgment and sentenced clark and jones.pursuant to,the district court added a enhancement to clark sentence and a enhancement to jones sentence.the court gave additional enhancements for their roles in the offense and reductions for acceptance of responsibility.the district court sentenced clark to imprisonment and supervised release.due to his cooperation with the government investigation,jones received a lesser sentence of and imprisonment the district court also ordered jones and clark to jointly and severally pay restitution in the amount of,and clark to individually pay additional restitution in the amount of.jones and clark timely filed their notices of appeal.
iii.standard of review 
this court reviews the amount of loss,a factual finding,for clear error.united states sanders,cir.the finding must be plausible in light of the record as a whole.id.we review de novo the interpretation and application of the sentencing guidelines.the district court receives wide latitude to determine the amount of loss and should make a reasonable estimate based on available information.united states cothran,cir.we must determine in this appeal whether the sentencing court applied an acceptable method of calculating the amount of loss,which must bear a reasonable relation to the actual harm of the offense.united states randall,cir.
iv.discussion 
to impose a sentence enhancement,the government must establish that medicare suffered an actual loss.united states alfaro,cir.under,the amount of loss,in cases involving the diversion of government program benefits,equals the value of the benefits diverted from intended recipients.jones and clark argue that they should not be liable for the entire amount of medicare reimbursements because medicare would have paid health one actual costs notwithstanding disclosure of the relationship between health one and riverbend.moreover,the government failed to show either the differential between medicare reimbursements and health one actual costs or the reasonable value of health one services.accordingly,jones and clark should not receive an enhancement from the base offense level and restitution order.
