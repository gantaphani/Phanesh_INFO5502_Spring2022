a jury convicted defendant warren armstead of nine counts of bank fraud in violation of and one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud in violation of.on appeal,armstead contends that the district court committed numerous procedural errors during sentencing and that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because we agree that the district court miscalculated the number of victims under united states sentencing guidelines b and erred under b,we vacate armstead sentence and remand for resentencing.
factual and procedural background 
from to,armstead led a conspiracy to commit bank fraud.armstead recruited conspirators and paid them fifty dollars or gave them drugs in exchange for packets of stolen personal information.each packet contained an individual social security number,a bank account number or numbers,a credit card number or numbers,and blank checks.armstead and his stole these packets from individuals,their homes,and vehicles.
armstead gave the personal identification information to certain and directed them to create fake washington state driver licenses wsdls.each fake wsdl contained stolen personal information juxtaposed with a photograph of one of the conspirators.at armstead direction,his deposited stolen checks into bank accounts and withdrew funds from those accounts using the fake wsdls.conspirators also used the fake wsdls to take out lines of credit with general electric ge,home depot,and dania furniture and to purchase merchandise with that credit.armstead received fifty percent of all of the proceeds from the fraudulent schemes.
armstead was charged with nine counts of bank fraud under and one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud under.armstead nine pled guilty and they,as well as individuals from whom his stole personal information,testified against armstead at his trial.in submitting the case to the jury,at armstead request,the district court included on the verdict form the following interrogatory was the defendant warren eric armstead an organizer or leader of a conspiracy or a bank fraud scheme that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive the jury returned a guilty verdict on all ten counts and answered the interrogatory in the affirmative.
armstead presentence investigation report psr recommended a minimum loss amount.this amount included from a united states secret service loss calculation the secret service calculation in cash that armstead gave rusty hill,one of armstead that an individual testified was taken from her bank account and in loss to dania furniture.the secret service calculation was based on amounts conspirators took from accounts at thirteen banks and credit unions collectively,the banks.these accounts belonged to different individuals and businesses.the secret service calculation also included in losses to ge and home depot.
at sentencing the government argued that the loss amount should also include based on deposits made to armstead bank account during the course of the conspiracy.armstead argued that the loss calculation should not include any of the or the armstead gave to hill.armstead further contended that the number of victims should be limited to the number of and that the district court should not apply the enhancement for role in the offense.with regard to the a factors,armstead argued that his sentence should be comparable to that of his 
the district court agreed with the loss calculation in the psr but also added enough from the in deposits to armstead bank account to bring the total loss amount over.the court stated that it was extremely skeptical of counting percent of the funds,but concluded that enough of the funds came from criminal conduct to cross the threshold.the district court also found that there were more than fifty victims and,having submitted the question of armstead role in the offense to the jury,adopted its finding that armstead was a leader or organizer in the conspiracy.the district court calculated the guidelines range for armstead sentence as follows 
after calculating the guidelines range,the district court considered the a factors and sentenced armstead to a term of imprisonment,the top of the guidelines range.the district court did not credit armstead for the five months he had already served on an undischarged state sentence.armstead timely appeals.
ii.analysis 
standards of review 
when reviewing a sentence,we first consider whether the district court committed significant procedural error.united states carty,cir en banc citing gall united states,d.procedural errors include,but are not limited to,incorrectly calculating the guidelines range,treating the guidelines as mandatory,failing properly to consider the a factors,using clearly erroneous facts when calculating the guidelines range or determining the sentence,and failing to provide an adequate explanation for the sentence imposed.id.we review the district court interpretation of the sentencing guidelines de novo,the district court application of the guidelines to the facts for abuse of discretion,and the district court factual findings for clear error.united states garro,cir citing united states cantrell,cir.
if we discern no significant procedural error,we proceed to the second step and consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence.carty,at citing gall.at.we review the substantive reasonableness of a sentence for abuse of discretion.gall.at carty,at.
standard of proof 
a district court generally uses a preponderance of the evidence standard of proof when finding facts at sentencing.united states moreland,cir citing united states kilby,cir.only when a sentencing factor has an extremely disproportionate effect on the sentence relative to the offense of conviction must a district court find the facts by a clear and convincing standard of proof.id.quoting united states dare,cir.
because armstead did not object to the standard of proof below,we review for plain error.b see also united states,cir.for an error to be plain,it must be an error,that is plain,and that affects substantial rights.id.citing united states olano,d.moreover,we will not exercise our discretion to correct the error unless the error seriously affect s the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.id.alteration in original quoting olano,at.
armstead contends that the district court should have employed the clear and convincing standard of proof because enhancements for the amount of loss under b two levels number of victims under b two levels and role in the offense under four levels had a disproportionate effect on his sentence.without the disputed enhancements,armstead total offense level would have been instead of,and his guidelines range using criminal history category v would have been months,instead of months.
armstead argument fails for three reasons.first,the district court did not err by finding the number of victims by a preponderance of the evidence because sentencing enhancements based entirely on the extent of the conspiracy do not require the heightened standard of proof.see riley,at holding that enhancements for loss amount and possession of five or more means of false identification were based on the extent of the conspiracy to produce fictitious obligations and thus did not have a disproportionate effect on the sentence relative to the offense of conviction,at holding that the quantity of drugs in a conspiracy need only be established by a preponderance of the evidence.enhancements based on the extent of a conspiracy are on a fundamentally different plane than enhancements based on uncharged or acquitted conduct.riley,at quoting,at.due process concerns with regard to the former are satisfied by a preponderance of the evidence standard because the enhancements are based on criminal activity for which the defendant has already been convicted,at.
second,the jury found that armstead was a leader or organizer of the conspiracy beyond a reasonable doubt,a higher standard of proof than the clear and convincing evidence standard.by adopting the jury finding,the district court agreed that the government proved beyond a reasonable doubt that armstead was a leader or organizer of the conspiracy we thus conclude that the standard of proof argument is inapplicable to the enhancement for role in the offense.
finally,the remaining enhancement due to the disputed amount of loss did not have an extremely disproportionate effect on the sentence moreland,at quoting dare,at see also united states watts,d noting that a enhancement is not an exceptional circumstance that could warrant a higher standard of proof.accordingly,we hold that the district court did not err by applying a preponderance of the evidence standard to its enhancement findings 
loss calculation pursuant to b 
when calculating the guidelines range for bank fraud,a district court must determine the amount of loss caused by the fraud.b.the guidelines further direct that t he court need only make a reasonable estimate of the loss,cmt.c.we defer to the district court calculation because t he sentencing judge is in a unique position to assess the evidence and estimate the loss based upon that evidence.id.
armstead contends that the district court erred by including the following in its loss calculation in deposits to his bank account that hill testified armstead gave to him and in loss attributable to retail fraud.
armstead first argues that gain can not be used as a measure of loss when a court also uses actual loss in its calculations.the in deposits to armstead bank account and the that armstead gave to hill are better characterized as gain.the guidelines direct the court to use the gain that resulted from the offense as an alternative measure of loss only if there is a loss but it reasonably can not be determined,cmt.b.this note provides that it is only appropriate to use gain as an exclusive measure of loss when actual loss can not be determined.we do not read the note,however,to prohibit the use of gain as a proxy for a portion of the total loss where some,but not all,of the loss can be determined.
here,the district court used actual loss to estimate the vast majority of the total approximately.the district court found,however,that this loss calculation did not properly account for all of the loss caused by the conspiracy and used a small portion of armstead gain to account for a small portion of the loss.the nature of armstead crime,where money was fraudulently withdrawn from bank accounts,lends itself to this type of approximation because,as the district court reasonably determined,some of the money going into armstead account and the money armstead gave to hill corresponded with money lost by the banks.given that a court need only make a reasonable estimate of the loss,the district court method of calculation is not foreclosed by the guidelines.
armstead next argues that the district court erred by including in loss attributable to retail fraud.armstead concedes that this amount can be included if the retail fraud is relevant conduct under a,but he maintains that it is not.because armstead did not object to the loss calculation on this basis at sentencing,we review for plain error.see,at.
specific offense characteristics,such as loss,are determined by taking into account 
a all acts and omissions committed,aided,abetted,counseled,commanded,induced,procured,or willfully caused by the defendant and 
b in the case of a jointly undertaken criminal activity all reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity,that occurred during the commission of the offense of conviction 
all acts and omissions described in subdivisions a and b above that were part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction.
a.acts are part of the same course of conduct if they are sufficiently connected or related to each other as to warrant the conclusion that they are part of a single episode,spree,or ongoing series of offenses,cmt.b.acts are part of the common scheme or plan if they are substantially connected to the offense by at least one common factor,such as common victims,common accomplices,common purpose,or similar modus operandi,cmt.a.
the fraud perpetrated against ge,home depot,and dania furniture involved the same using the same personal identification information that was used to perpetrate the bank fraud.at sentencing,the government proffered that the secret service calculation,which included losses to ge and home depot,accounted for losses associated with the personal identification information recovered from armstead house,car,and hotel room and identifications used when conspirators deposited or withdrew money from the banks.additionally,armstead orchestrated the fraudulent purchase at dania furniture in the same manner as he directed the bank fraud he told to obtain credit at dania furniture using a fake wsdl and purchase items with that credit.because the retail fraud involved the same participants as the bank fraud,the same modus operandi,and was part of ongoing fraudulent transactions related to the stolen personal identification information and fake wsdls,the district court did not err by including the retail fraud loss in its calculations 
finally,armstead contends that there was an insufficient factual basis for including the and in the loss amount.armstead argues that the is suspect because it includes deposits from a family member and because of possible overlap between the and the secret service calculation.he seeks to exclude the from hill because the latter testimony was uncorroborated and not credible.the district court was extremely skeptical of counting all of the in the loss amount.nonetheless,the court determined that it was reasonable to include at least from armstead account the amount needed to push the loss total from the in the psr calculation to over because the evidence showed that at least some of the deposits were the fruit of criminal conduct.the district court did not separately comment on the.
the bank fraud conspiracy ran from through.the secret service calculation covers a period from september to september.from february to august,a period not covered by the secret service calculation,was deposited into armstead account,not including deposits from armstead relative.state employment records show that armstead only earned in wages from to.thus,the district court did not clearly err by including from the in deposits in the loss calculation.
with regard to the,we note that the sentencing judge also presided over armstead trial and thus observed the witness and heard hill testimony.hill testified that armstead gave him in or for safekeeping and that he knew that the proceeds came from the conspiracy.we reiterate that deference to a district court loss calculation is warranted because the district court is in a unique position to assess the evidence,cmt.c.the district court did not clearly err by giving credence to hill testimony and determining by a preponderance of the evidence that the corresponded to loss from the bank fraud.
in sum,the district court did not err by adding fourteen levels to armstead base offense level pursuant to b h for a loss amount of more than.
victim calculation pursuant to b 
when calculating the guidelines range for bank fraud,a district court must also determine the number of victims.b.the district court found that the bank fraud conspiracy involved over fifty victims and added four levels to armstead base offense level pursuant to b b.the district court arrived at this number by adding the number of banks and victims of retail fraud sixteen together with an unstated number of individuals and companies whose personal information was stolen by the conspirators.the government proffered at sentencing that the individuals and companies suffered pecuniary losses in the form of getting a new driver license,or having to figure out how to put a fraud alert on your account and spending money to correct credit.the district court offered little in the way of an explanation for its finding that there were more than fifty victims,but concluded that there were a substantial number of people involved.
armstead contends that the district court erred by counting as victims those individuals and companies whose losses were not included in the loss calculation.we agree.
the guidelines define victim as any person who sustained any part of the actual loss determined under subsection b,cmt.actual loss means the reasonably foreseeable pecuniary harm that resulted from the offense,cmt.a i.pecuniary harm means harm that is monetary or that otherwise is readily measurable in money,cmt.a iii.thus,in order to be counted as a victim,a person must have sustained a loss that is monetary or that otherwise is readily measurable in money and that loss must be included in the loss calculation.here,the loss calculated pursuant to b included only losses to the thirteen banks and three victims of retail fraud.while other persons conceivably may have sustained pecuniary harm in the form of time and money spent procuring new identification and credit cards,opening new bank accounts,and mending their credit,those losses were not included in the calculated loss amount.therefore,the district court erred by including those individuals in the calculation.
our conclusion is in accord with the other circuits that have considered the issue.the defendants in united states abiodun were convicted of,inter alia,conspiracy to commit fraud and wire fraud,cir.their fraudulent scheme involved stealing credit reports,obtaining credit cards with the information procured,and purchasing merchandise with the credit.id.at.the district court included in its victim calculation persons who had spent an appreciable amount of time securing reimbursement for their financial losses.id.at.the second circuit held that this was error because the losses attributable to these victims were not included in the loss calculation.id.at.the court noted that loss of time is a pecuniary harm because it can be measured in monetary terms,but that losses due to lost time were not included in the loss calculation.id.at.
the tenth circuit addressed the victim calculation in the context of a fraudulent scheme in which the defendant,a postal employee,stole mail addressed to a organization.united states leach,cir.the district court calculated the loss amount by taking the total donations the organization reported missing and subtracting replacement donations sent to the by the donors.id.at.the district court based its victim calculation on the over persons who reported that their donations had not been delivered.id.at.the district court found that those persons suffered losses because they had to write and mail replacement checks.id.the tenth circuit held that the donors were not victims under b.id.at.while the donors suffered pecuniary harm,their loss was not included as part of the actual loss determined under subsection b.id.at quoting,cmt.united states icaza,cir holding that each individual store was not a separate victim of shoplifting where all stores were owned by the same corporation.
over fifty persons in the present case conceivably may have suffered pecuniary harm.the loss calculation,however,only included losses to the thirteen banks and three victims of retail fraud.as a result,the district court erred in finding more than sixteen victims.see united states pham,cir holding that individual account holders can be counted as victims only if they sustained any part of the actual loss determined under b citing cmt.
the government counters that the loss calculation reflects more than fifty victims because the losses attributed to the banks were first held by the account holders prior to the reimbursement of funds.we have not fully addressed when persons whose losses are so reimbursed may be included in the victim calculation.
the sixth circuit addressed this issue in united states yagar,cir.like armstead,the defendant in yagar stole checks,deposited them into more than fifty accounts using stolen personal information and then withdrew the deposited funds from accounts.id.at.the district court counted eleven victims five banks and six account holders who had to purchase new checks.id.at.on appeal,the government argued that the district court should have found over fifty victims by including all account holders who temporarily lost funds.id.
the sixth circuit held that the account holders who did not purchase replacement checks were not victims because the temporary loss of funds did not amount to a pecuniary harm.id.at.the court reasoned that such a loss,which was immediately covered by a,had no adverse effect as a practical matter.id.the court declined to hold that a fully reimbursed loss is always a bar to including a person in the victim calculation,noting that there may be situations in which a person could be considered a victim under the guidelines even though he or she is ultimately reimbursed.id.
recently,the fifth circuit followed yagar in evaluating the number of victims in a credit card fraud scheme.united states conner,cir.the court concluded that credit card account holders could not be counted as victims because they were quickly reimbursed and there was no evidence that any account holder had to spend money or an extended length of time seeking reimbursement.id.at.the only victims were the five credit card companies that reimbursed the account holders.id.at.
more recently,we held in pham that an individual may be considered a victim even if the individual losses are fully reimbursed,provided the reimbursement was not immediate.at.we stated that a court can count both account holders and reimbursing banks as victims,even if the losses are ultimately traceable to the same fraudulently obtained funds,because both the account holders and the banks have suffered harms that are pecuniary and reasonably foreseeable and that are sufficiently distinct from one another to avoid a double counting problem.id at.we rejected the argument that a victim must suffer additional pecuniary harm other than the reimbursed loss.see id.at.
the guidelines direct the court to calculate victims by determining the number of persons who have suffered pecuniary harm.a loss that is reimbursed immediately does not amount to a pecuniary harm because the ultimate loss can not be measured in monetary terms.if,however,the reimbursement takes a longer period of time,it is conceivable that the individual may have suffered or sustained part of the loss.id.at.if that loss is included in the loss calculation,the victim associated with the loss should be included in the victim calculation.see id.
we thus decline to follow the approach taken by the eleventh circuit in united states lee,cir,and hinted at in yagar and conner,which would allow the district court to include as victims persons who were fully reimbursed if their losses were neither nor immediately covered by third parties without regard to whether their losses were included in the loss calculation.lee,at.the defendants in lee cancelled their checking accounts but continued to write personal checks,and,in that manner,purchased miscellaneous goods,cars,motorcycles,property,and paid off mortgages.id.at.when the checks were not honored,some entities wrote off losses,others received payment from defendants,some repossessed the merchandise,and a mortgage company foreclosed on one of the defendant homes.id.at.the district court calculated the loss at over and determined that the number of victims was between ten and fifty.id.at.
the defendants argued that the persons who offset their losses by repossession or other forms of reimbursement could not be included in the victim calculation.id.at.the eleventh circuit disagreed,and held that the district court did not err by including all of t
