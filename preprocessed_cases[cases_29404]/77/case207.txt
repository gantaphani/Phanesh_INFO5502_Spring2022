neal allen pled guilty,pursuant to a plea agreement,to one count of mail fraud in violation of frauds and swindles for having used the postal service when he provided false credentials to secure a contract.allen held himself out as a and remediation expert,which ultimately led the lac du flambeau band of the chippewa tribe ldf to secure his services.at sentencing,the district court ordered allen to pay restitution in the amount of.the court refused to reduce the amount by the value of the services the ldf received from allen both because the task of calculating that value would be burdensome,and because allen misrepresented himself as a licensed professional and thus was not entitled to such a reduction,see application note f v.we find that the application note does not apply to allen situation,and that the district court should have calculated the value of the services allen provided and modified his sentence accordingly.we therefore vacate the restitution portion of allen sentence and remand for a recalculation of restitution that reflects the actual loss suffered by the victims in this case.
neal allen marketed himself as an expert in mold remediation,and falsified his education and employment history on a pamphlet that was distributed to promote a mold seminar.an attorney for the ldf received a copy of the pamphlet,and the attorney contact with allen ultimately led the ldf to enter into a contract with allen,in september,for services.allen and his crew performed allen responsibilities under the contract and tested approximately ldf buildings for mold.allen sent the mold samples to aerotech laboratories,after committing to pay the laboratory for its analysis of the samples.allen collected full payment from the ldf approximately on december,and then promptly left the in the dominican republic,where he established residence.during that same time period,allen also became a naturalized citizen of costa rica,under a different name.allen never paid aerotech for testing the samples.
in october,allen was indicted by a grand jury in the western district of wisconsin on six counts of mail fraud,see.he was ultimately convicted,in march,of one count of mail fraud,to which he pled guilty.in the plea agreement,allen agreed 
to pay restitution for all losses relating to the offense of conviction and all losses covered by the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction.the exact restitution figure will be agreed upon by the parties prior to sentencing or,if the parties are unable to agree upon a specific figure,restitution will be determined by the court at sentencing.
at the plea hearing,allen stated to the court 
i falsified credentials to obtain a contract with the lac du flambeau tribe,and i used the federal mails or i used the fedex,which is considered federal mails,to send the lab samples to the lab.that what i did.
in exchange for his plea,the government agreed to recommend that allen sentence be reduced to the maximum extent possible for acceptance of responsibility,see a b,and that allen plea would resolve all possible criminal violations in the western district of wisconsin related to this course of allen criminal conduct.
in the presentence report psr and its addendums,the probation officer calculated allen base offense level as six and his criminal history category as i.the probation officer recommended a enhancement pursuant to united states sentencing guideline b g because the proposed loss amount was more than but less than enhancement for obstruction of justice,a decrease under a for acceptance of responsibility,and an additional decrease pursuant to b for timely providing information to the government timely notifying authorities of his intention to plead guilty.allen total offense level was.the probation offer proposed that allen be ordered to pay in restitution to the ldf,and to aerotech laboratories.
allen filed a written objection to the psr,specifically contesting the amount of loss attributable to him and the proposed restitution figures.allen position was that the loss figure could not exceed the amount of loss actually caused with respect to the ldf,the figure should have taken into account the value of allen work and should have been reduced in its entirety because the ldf did not suffer any monetary loss.with respect to aerotech,allen argued that the court should not include the unpaid balance to the laboratory because that figure merely reflected a breach of contract between allen and aerotech.
in response,the government argued that application note f v of did not allow for a reduction in the amount of loss for the value of services provided by allen to the ldf because allen held himself out as licensed professional when he deceived the ldf into contracting with him.at the sentencing hearing,the government reduced its proposed restitution amount by value of a microscope that had been seized and that allen agreed to turn over for restitution.
at sentencing,the district court adopted the calculations contained in the psr and its addendums,finding the total amount of loss attributable to allen to be.the court decided that the losses sustained by aerotech were direct and reasonably foreseeable pecuniary harm that resulted from allen offense.the district court also decided that allen was not entitled to have the loss amount reduced by the value of the services he provided to the ldf because he had misrepresented his credentials and made himself appear as a highly qualified expert microbiologist in the field of mold remediation.the district court explained to allen during the sentencing hearing 
although you suggested that the tribe pecuniary loss should be reduced by the actual value of the services provided,trying to calculate that value would place an undue burden on the court and it certainly unlikely that the purported value would exceed the approximately that the tribe expended to house its members who were displaced from their homes during the fraudulent remediation scheme and for which no restitution is being ordered because the costs can not be adequately verified.the fact is the tribe would never have agreed to pay you had it not been for your fraudulent misrepresentations.
the court applied the relevant enhancement,see b g,based on the psr proposed loss amount,and sentenced allen to months imprisonment.allen was ordered to pay as restitution to the ldf and to aerotech.allen filed a timely notice of appeal.
ii.analysis 
allen appeals the district court restitution calculation,arguing that the amount should have been reduced by the value of the services he performed the government argues that allen can not challenge the district court calculation of restitution both because he waived such a challenge by not raising it during the sentencing hearing,and because he delegated the restitution calculation to the plea agreement provided that if the amount of restitution could not be agreed upon by the parties,the court would determine the figure at sentencing.in any event,the government argues,the district court calculation of the restitution amount was correct because the tests allen conducted are useless to the tribe in light of the truth about he is not an expert in the field of mold remediation.
we will dispose of the government delegation argument first.a party that agrees to have the district court decide a restitution amount implicitly conditions his assent on the court calculation of that amount within the parameters of the law.the government cites united states peterson,cir,for the proposition that once a defendant grants the district court authority to calculate restitution,the defendant is bound by whatever amount the district court designates,regardless of how that figure was determined,in accordance with the law,or not.under the government position,a district court could arbitrarily choose a restitution figure out of thin,order that against a defendant who caused only million in actual losses,on the grounds that the defendant delegated the calculation authority to the court.peterson suggests nothing of the sort.see id.at.
in peterson plea agreement,he agreed to pay restitution for
