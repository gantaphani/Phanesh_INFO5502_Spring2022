three employees of general electric company ge conducted a scheme to fix rates on interest paid by ge to municipalities.when municipalities receive proceeds of bond issues,they invest those proceeds with ge and others until such time as the funds become needed for the underlying capital projects.to prevent abuse of municipal bonds for pure arbitrage,the internal revenue code and treasury regulations require a municipality to rebate to the treasury any excess over the municipal bond rate.to guarantee a market rate of interest on these investments,municipalities are required to use competitive bidding.the conspiracy between ge employees and brokers depressed the interest rate on the guaranteed investment contracts paid by unindicted ge each instance cheated either the municipalities or the treasury or both.
steven goldberg,peter grimm,and dominick carollo collectively,defendants were tried and convicted in the united states district court for the southern district of new york baer,of violating the general federal conspiracy statute.goldberg was sentenced principally to four years in prison,grimm and carollo to three.they appeal the judgments of conviction on the ground inter alia that the indictment is barred by the applicable statutes of limitations.the district court held that the statute of limitations continued to run during the period when ge paid the depressed interest to the municipalities,and that the interest payments could constitute overt acts.we conclude that those payments do not constitute overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy.
under the internal revenue code tax code,interest payments on qualifying municipal bonds are exempt from federal income tax.see a.often,municipal issuers issuers do not expend the proceeds immediately because the projects financed by the issue may take years to construct.to generate additional revenue before the funds are depleted,an issuer may invest in a guaranteed investment agreement or contract gic provided by a financial institution with a high credit rating provider.gics typically require periodic interest payments.although gics have a fixed maturity date,the issuer can usually draw down the thus terminate the any time 
to prevent arbitrage,the tax code limits the return that issuers can generate through gics.see.in general,any return in excess of the interest on the bonds must be paid to the treasury.f.an issuer thereby lacks incentive to maximize interest on a gic above a rate that equals or exceeds the interest rate paid on the bonds,and the arbitrage opportunities for a provider are obvious.
to prevent such abuses,treasury regulations require issuers to determine for each gic the fair market value,calculated as a function of the market interest rate,on the date of purchase.reg.d.market value is not easily determinable,however,because gics are not regularly traded.so the treasury regulations require as a safe harbor a competitive bidding process that,if followed,establishes the fair market value of the gic for tax purposes.reg.d iii.issuers hire third party brokers to solicit closed bids from at least three providers each provider offers an interest rate without knowing the rates offered by the other bidders and the winning bidder certifies in writing that it had no prior opportunity to review the bids of other providers.
in,carollo,goldberg,and grimm worked for the unit of ge that served as a gic provider.in,goldberg left ge and took a position at another provider,financial security assurance,fsa.between august and may,the defendants on behalf of their employers ge and fsa agreed to pay kickbacks to three,dunhill,rubin cdr investment management advisory group,image and ubs painewebber,ubs and the brokers obliged by rigging the bidding process in several ways.in some instances,the broker told a defendant what others were bidding,which allowed the defendant to lower an initial bid if it significantly exceeded the bid,or to raise the bid to a level just high enough to win the contract in another case,a broker agreed to keep competitive bidders off the bid list,which allowed the defendant to prevail with a low bid.and sometimes a broker would rig an auction by asking certain providers to submit intentionally losing bids.depending on the fraudulent bid rate,the municipal bond rate,and the market interest rate,each deal defrauded the municipality,the treasury,or both.
on july,a federal grand jury returned an indictment initial indictment charging carollo,goldberg,and grimm with ten conspiracies.a superseding indictment narrowed the charges.six counts charged a twoobject conspiracy in violation of to defraud i the issuers of money and property through the use of an interstate wire,in violation of,and ii the united states.count seven charged carollo and goldberg with a substantive wire fraud scheme in violation of.
defendants moved to dismiss the superseding indictment,arguing that the conspiracy and fraud charges were barred by the statute of limitations.in an august order,the district court dismissed the wire fraud charge because the government had not alleged any activity within the limitations period,but declined to dismiss the conspiracy charges,holding that the alleged conspiracies continued as long as unindicted ge and fsa made interest payments on the gics.united states carollo,et,cr hb,wl at.
after a trial and three days of deliberations,a jury convicted goldberg on four counts,grimm on three counts,and carollo on two counts.the district court denied defendants motions,reiterating that the conspiracy lasts so long as the conspirators obtain an economic benefit through artificially suppressed payments.united states carollo,et,cr hb,ecf at.
the applicable statutes of limitations are five years for general conspiracy,see a,and six years for conspiracy to defraud the united states by violating the internal revenue laws,see the initial indictment was returned on july.to satisfy the statute of limitations for general conspiracy,the government must establish that a conspirator knowingly committed at least one overt act in furtherance after july,to satisfy the statute of limitations for a fraud on the united states,the government must establish at least one overt act in furtherance after july.see united states salmonese,cir citing grunewald united states.
of the overt acts alleged in the superseding indictment,the only ones that involved conduct after july,were the periodic interest payments made by providers to issuers pursuant to the gics on numerous occasions,provider made payments to municipal issuers via interstate wire transfer at artificially determined or suppressed rates.superseding indictment f count one f count two f count three f count four f count five f count six the defendants argue that such interest payments can not serve as overt acts because the routine payments were scheduled to continue for years if not decades after the gics were awarded and after all concerted conduct had ended.we review this legal claim de novo.salmonese,at.
t he crucial question in determining whether the statute of limitations has run is the scope of the conspiratorial agreement,for it is that which determines both the duration of the conspiracy,and whether the act relied on as an overt act may properly be regarded as in furtherance of the conspiracy.id.quoting grunewald,at.here,the alleged purposes of the conspiracies were to deprive municipal issuers of money by causing them to award investment agreements and other municipal finance contracts at artificially determined or suppressed rates,and to deprive the municipal issuers of the property right to control their assets by causing them to make economic decisions based on false and misleading information and to defraud the united states and the irs by impeding the collection of revenue due from municipal issuers.superseding indictment.
in united states salmonese,we held that a conspirator receipt of anticipated profits from the sale of stripped warrants constituted an overt act in furtherance of an conspiracy.at.we explained that,where a conspiracy purpose is economic enrichment,the jointly undertaken scheme continues through the conspirators receipt of their anticipated economic benefits.id.at citing united states mennuti,cir.the government relies on that passage to support its view that each successive payment of interest by an unindicted coconspirator is another overt act.salmonese gets the government only so far.
salmonese followed the analysis set out in united states doherty,cir,and that analysis defeats the government argument in the circumstances of the current appeal.in doherty,police officers conspired to obtain copies of promotional exams,and thereby increased their salary payments,which continued for years after they were increased by means of the fraud.doherty nevertheless held that the continuing receipt of the salaries did not constitute overt acts,and therefore did not the limitations period.following doherty,salmonese reasoned that a conspiracy ends notwithstanding the receipt of anticipated profits where the payoff merely consists of a lengthy,indefinite series of ordinary,typically noncriminal,unilateral actions and there is no evidence that any concerted activity posing the special societal dangers of conspiracy is still taking place.salmonese,at citing doherty,at emphasis in original.conversely,payoffs could reasonably be viewed as part of a conspiracy where their receipt consists of one action,or a handful of actions,taking place over a limited period of time,or where some evidence exists that the special dangers attendant to conspiracies remain present until the payoff is received.id.citing doherty,at.
in salmonese,the sales of the stripped warrants were counted as overt acts because they were completed within ten weeks of the public offering and were hardly indefinite in number or lengthy in duration.id.that analysis here commands the opposite result.
doherty and salmonese list features to describe serial payments that do not constitute overt acts lengthy,indefinite,ordinary,typically noncriminal and unilateral.the list is descriptive rather than exclusive but generally,overt acts have ended when the conspiracy has completed its influence on an otherwise legitimate course of common dealing that remains ongoing for a prolonged time,without measures of concealment,adjustment or any other corrupt intervention by any conspirator.
the gic payments here fit that description in every particular.payments of interest on a gic are ordinary commercial obligations,made pursuant to a common form of commercial arrangement they are noncriminal in themselves they are made unilaterally by a single person or entity and they are made indefinitely,over a long time,typically up to years or more.some are still being paid.and since the government adduced no evidence of overt acts after july,other than the interest payments,there is no evidence that any concerted activity posing the special societal dangers of conspiracy is still taking place.salmonese,at citing doherty,at.
the government argues that the interest payments are not indefinite because each gic has a maturity date and prescribes the number of payments to be made.the government position must be that a conspiracy continues so long as a stream of anticipated payments contains an element of profit.but that proves too much.a conspiracy to corrupt the rent payable on a year ground lease would,under the government theory,prolong the overt acts until long after any conspirator or was left to profit,or to plot.
indefinite can not mean without end.even in doherty,the salary payments lasted only as long as the officers employment.payments can be indefinite either in the sense that they are of undetermined number or in the sense that they are prolonged beyond the near future.the gic payments are indefinite in both senses.
the interest payments continue indefinitely in the sense that they are prolonged.and the number of payments is not fixed because they end when and if 
the issuer demands the return of all of the principal to finance the capital project 
the gic is assigned with the prior written consent of the issuer or 
the provider credit rating falls below a specified level,at which point the issuer can terminate the gic and withdraw the funds for any purpose,including reinvestment.
in any event,when anticipated economic benefit continues,in a regular and ordinary course,well beyond the period when the unique threats to society posed by a conspiracy are present,the advantageous interest payment is the result of a completed conspiracy,and is not in furtherance of one that is ongoing as the supreme court has explained 
though the result of a conspiracy may be continuing,the conspiracy does not thereby become a continuing one.continuity of action to produce the unlawful result,or continuous of the conspirators to keep it up is necessary.
fiswick united states,citations omitted quoting united states kissel.the stream of gic interest payments does not raise the underlying concern of concerted action,and therefore is not a continuous action that prolongs the life of the conspiracy 
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we hold that the government did not allege overt acts within the limitations period.accordingly,we reverse the judgments of conviction,and remand to the district court for dismissal of the indictment.
i respectfully dissent from the majority decision to reverse the convictions of grimm,carollo,and goldberg defendants on grounds.in my view,a major flaw in the majority opinion is its failure to acknowledge the implications of the facts that the superseding indictment indictment alleged,and that the jury was instructed that in order to convict it must find,that the corporate organizations that won the described guaranteed investment contracts gics by engaging in the conspiracies which enabled them to,inter alia,pay interest to municipalities at artificially depressed rates for the duration of the gics were themselves coconspirators,albeit unindicted coconspirators.
at various stages of the bid rigging,all three defendants were employed by general electric or related companies,which were referred to in the indictment as provider the indictment alleged that provider b sold investment agreements and other municipal finance contracts through its business leaders and marketers,including grimm,carollo,and goldberg.see indictment.grimm and goldberg had authority to and did submit bids for investments and other municipal finance contracts on behalf of provider b carollo was a manager and supervisor with respect to that aspect of provider b business.see id.during the period,goldberg left provider b and joined financial security assurance,part of a group of related financial services companies that was referred to in the indictment as provider see indictment.as a vice president or director of provider a,goldberg had authority to and did submit bids for investment agreement s or other municipal finance contracts for provider id.
in light of the indictment allegations that grimm,carollo,and goldberg,in engaging in bid rigging,acted on behalf of providers who were coconspirators,several well established principles of conspiracy liability compel me to conclude that the statute of limitations did not bar the prosecution of these defendants.
t he crucial question in determining whether the statute of limitations has run is the scope of the conspiratorial agreement,for it is that which determines both the duration of the conspiracy,and whether the act relied on as an overt act may properly be regarded as in furtherance of the conspiracy.
grunewald united states,emphases added.in order t o constitute an overt act for purposes of the statute of limitations the act must involve some affirmative conduct or deliberate omission on the part of a defendant or her coconspirators,united states ben zvi,cir ben zvi see,united states salmonese,cir salmonese.however,t he overt act,without proof of which a charge of conspiracy under can not be submitted to the jury,need not be itself a crime.braverman united states.
foreseeable acts of one coconspirator in furtherance of the conspiracy are attributable to all coconspirators.see,pinkerton united states,united states milstein,cir.this principle is applicable even if the coconspirator who so acts is unindicted.see,united states grammatikos,cir acts of unindicted coconspirators may prove continued existence of the conspiracy see also united states matthews,cir.unindicted coconspirator overt acts within a district in furtherance of a conspiracy suffice to establish venue in the district,cert.denied,united states sandy,cir.overt acts alleged and proven to have been performed by an unindicted coconspirator sufficed to connect the defendants to the conspiracy,cert.denied.
conspiracy is a continuing crime that is not complete until the purposes of the conspiracy have been accomplished or abandoned.united states pizzonia,cir internal quotation marks omitted,cert.denied,see generally united states kissel,a conspiracy may have continuance in time.once a conspiracy is shown to exist,which in its nature is not ended merely by lapse of time,it continues to exist until consummated,abandoned or otherwise terminated by some affirmative act.united states rucker,cir rucker.
applying this principle,t his court has consistently ruled that where a conspiracy purpose is economic enrichment,the jointly undertaken scheme continues through the conspirators receipt of their anticipated economic benefits.salmonese,at quoting united states mennuti,cir,and citing united states laspina,cir ben zvi,at united states fletcher,cir,cert.denied,united states knuckles,cir,cert.denied,see also united states azeem,cir a conspiracy continues after the occurrence of the underlying offense and is not completed until the conspirators receive their payoffs.united states fitzpatrick,cir a conspiracy continues until the anticipated economic benefits of the defendant are realized.a bsent withdrawal,a conspirator participation in a conspiracy is presumed to continue until the last overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy by any of the conspirators.salmonese,at quoting united states diaz,cir,cert.denied.and e very act in furtherance of the conspiracy is regarded in law as a renewal or continuance of the unlawful agreement.rucker,at.
in the present case,the allegations in the five counts of the indictment on which defendants were convicted clearly delineate the scope of the conspiratorial agreements with respect to goals,memberships,and durations.as to the conspiratorial objectives,the indictment alleged that one of the goals of each of the conspiracies charged in counts i,ii,and iv was to defraud municipal issuers and to obtain money and property from municipal issuers by means of false and fraudulent pretenses indictment,increasing the profitability of investment agreements and other municipal finance contracts awarded to provider b by municipal issuers through the control and manipulation of bidding for investment agreements and other municipal finance contracts id.a,a,a emphases added.similarly,the indictment alleged that a goal of the conspiracies charged in counts v and vi was to increase the profitability of such contracts for provider see,id.a,a.
as to membership in the conspiracies,counts i and ii of the indictment alleged that all three defendants includ ed provider b indictment count i,id.count ii,and count iv alleged that grimm includ ed provider b indictment.counts v and vi likewise alleged that goldberg includ ed provider indictment count v,id.count vi.
as to duration,the indictment alleged that length of the investment agreements of the type that were subjected to bid rigging here varies from as short as one month to as long as thirty years.indictment.to the extent that the providers sought to enjoy the difference between a fairly market rate of interest and the fraudulently rate of interest to which the municipalities agreed as a result of the bid rigging,the providers would realize economic gains each time they made an interest payment to the municipal entity at the lower rate.see,united states walker,cir finding injury to victim of rigged contract with each of the defendant payments at a noncompetitive price,cert.denied.
with respect to overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracies,counts i,ii,and iv alleged,inter alia,that,provider b made its payments on the gics to the relevant municipal entities at artificially determined suppressed rates.indictment count,f id.count ii,f,g iii id.count iv,f,g iii.provider b was alleged to have continued to make such payments at least until approximately november,indictment count i,g iii,june,id.count ii,g iii,and november,id.count iv,g iii.counts v and vi similarly alleged that provider a made payments on the relevant contracts at interest rates that were artificially determined,and that those payments continued at least until october indictment count v,g iv,and april id.count vi,g iii.all of these dates were within the limitations period that ended with the return of the original indictment in this case on july.
whether the allegations in the indictment were proven including whether the unindicted corporate organizations,providers a and b,were coconspirators was of course a matter for the jury.a corporation can act only through its agents,and the acts of individuals on the corporation behalf may be properly chargeable to it.united states paccione,cir internal quotation marks omitted,cert.denied.
the jury here was instructed that the government must prove that there was a mutual agreement among the defendant under consideration and at least one other person,together with the respective corporate provider and the broker that they represent,to cooperate with each other to accomplish the objectives of each charged conspiracy.trial transcript tr.emphases added see also id.at ultimately,you must ask yourself if the government has proved beyond a reasonable doubt the conspirators in the count you are considering,acting on behalf of the named corporate provider and broker,came to an understanding to violate the law and to accomplish the unlawful objectives of the alleged conspiracy.emphasis added.
in finding defendants guilty on the five counts under consideration,the jury necessarily found that provider b conspired with the defendants charged in counts i,ii,and iv,and that provider a conspired with the defendant charged in counts v and vi.defendants have not challenged the sufficiency of the evidence to support such findings,and i see no basis for such a challenge.
whether an act by a coconspirator is in furtherance of the conspiracy is likewise a factual question to be determined by the jury.see,nye nissen united states,united states bruno,cir,cert.denied.the jury here was instructed that a n overt act was in furtherance of a conspiracy if the act was undertaken in order to advance an objective of the conspiracy.tr.emphasis added.it was also instructed that,in order to convict,it must find that at least one object of each conspiracy existed at some point in time,within the period alleged in each of the counts.tr.
in my view,it was permissible for the jury to find that a an objective of the conspiracies was,as alleged,to enable the providers to make their periodic interest payments at artificially suppressed rates,and b that objective existed within the limitations period.it was also permissible for the jury to find that all of the providers interest payments were acts in furtherance of the conspiracies.indeed,the payments were essential to the conspiracies success if the payments were not made,the providers would be in breach of the investment contracts and would cease to achieve their conspiratorial goals of economic gain through payments of interest below fair market rates.
the majority conclusion that the statute of limitations bars this prosecution is flawed,in my view,not only because of its disregard of the roles of providers a and b as coconspirators but also because of its misinterpretation of this court prior rulings and its reliance on inappropriate factors.for example,the majority points out that many of the investment contracts at issue are to be performed over a long time,typically up to years or more.majority opinion ante at.but the duration of the conspiracy is determine d by the scope of the conspiratorial agreement,grunewald,at and here the precise goals of the conspiratorial agreements were to have contracts award
