background 
washington mutual bank washington mutual or the bank is the nation largest savings and loans.its deposits are insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation.washington mutual provides mortgages to its customers who are buying or refinancing homes.in its mortgage loans were processed at three sites,including downers grove,illinois.
the mortgage loan processing was compartmentalized into discrete job functions similar to an assembly line.first,the loans were solicited by mailings to existing washington mutual customers.if a customer completed certain paperwork and returned it,employees at the downers grove facility put the customer personal information into a loan processing computer system called pronto.the mortgage loan application then went to openers,employees who were responsible for compiling required forms and documents for a particular loan and sending the loan on to the next stage of the process.the loan file next moved on to the underwriting department,where underwriters decided whether to approve,decline,or suspend the loan based on credit information in the loan file.if a loan was approved,then the loan file moved on to the processing department.employees in that department were responsible for gathering any additional information needed to complete the mortgage loan process.once all these steps were completed,the file moved to the closing department where employees called closers worked with title agents and attorneys to reconcile loan fees and balance and fund the mortgage loan.closers were responsible for preparing all legal documents for loan closing,many of which were prepared using the pronto system.openers and closers had no business reason to interact in order to complete their respective job functions.
one type of document that the closers were responsible for preparing was the wire transfer worksheet.these worksheets were used to initiate the actual transfer of funds from the bank to the specific closing location in order to fund a mortgage loan.the wire transfer worksheets contained information such as the loan applicant name,the loan number,the amount of the loan,and the location where the funds were to be sent.in and,after the closer prepared the wire transfer worksheet,washington mutual procedures required that two persons sign the worksheet before it moved on to the wire room for funding.the first person was the closer who had finalized the loan paperwork the second was a manager at the downers grove facility.in and,at the height of the mortgage refinancing boom,washington mutual employed closers,who were regular employees,and contract closers,who were brought in on a basis to assist with the increased volume of loan applications.closers were authorized to sign wire transfer worksheets contract closers were not.once the wire transfer worksheet had the required signatures,it was faxed from the downers grove facility to the washington mutual wire room in new york.employees in the wire room reviewed the worksheet for approvals and authorizing signatures and generated the actual disbursement or wire of bank funds to the settlement agent,usually a title company or attorney.wire transfers of bank funds for mortgage loans were almost never sent to the bank account of an individual borrower.
the pronto system also maintained an accounting of loans that had been approved and of bank funds that had been dispersed to fund those loans.pronto allowed wire transfer requests to be reversed.this could be necessary where a loan funding document was not executed properly or where a home sales transaction fell through at the last minute.the process of reversing a wire transfer was easy and only required a couple clicks of a button.the process could also be used to conceal a fraud.in this case,the defendants reversed wire transfers in pronto before the system completed its daily accounting,which allowed them to conceal their fraud for some time.but the process of reversing wire transfers left forensic evidence.one could determine which washington mutual employee reversed a wire transfer in pronto by examining the funding screen for that wire reversal and matching up the user identification number associated with the reversal with the master list of identification numbers for bank employees.every employee who reversed a wire transfer in pronto left a digital fingerprint of that activity.
in early may,tcf bank notified the loss prevention team at the downers grove facility of a large wire transfer of mortgage loan funds from washington mutual into the personal bank account of tcf bank customer yvette hulet.the may,wire transfer to hulet account was in the amount of.the wiring of such a large sum of mortgage money into a personal bank account immediately raised red flags.the loss prevention team began an investigation into the wire transfer and determined that no one with the name yvette hulet had a pending mortgage loan application with washington mutual.the team then found the wire transfer worksheet used to generate the hulet wire.examination of the worksheet revealed that it had been printed on the mortgage loan application of a person named percy williams.in other words,the worksheet had williams name and loan number on it,but hulet name was listed as the beneficiary of the wire and her tcf bank account was the account to be credited.
further examination of the worksheet revealed additional evidence of fraud.one of the authorizing signatures on the worksheet was stan zotas,who was no longer employed by washington mutual at the time of the loan.the washington mutual investigators determined that whoever generated the fraudulent wire transfer had cut and pasted the authorization signatures from a legitimate wire transfer worksheet onto the same section of the fraudulent hulet worksheet and then sent it to the wire room for funding.the investigators concluded that the fraud was an inside job because the hard copies of legitimate wire transfer worksheets were only accessible to any current washington mutual employee.the investigators also discovered that six wire transfers in hulet name had been printed through pronto in early may,though only one wire transfer worksheet had been faxed to the wire room in new york.in addition,these six wire transfers had been printed using hulet personal and bank information and a pending loan application,and the wires had been reversed in pronto.
washington mutual attempted to determine whether any other similar fraudulent wire transfers had occurred from the downers grove facility.an investigation disclosed that wire transfers of mortgage loan funds had been made from washington mutual to the personal bank accounts of pamela young,eddie jackson,and bruce jones.first,on january,a wire transfer of was made into young personal checking account at bank one.the wire transfer sheet contained young name,the name of her bank and her bank account number.the young wire transfer sheet had been printed on the pending loan application of washington mutual customer beverly emon,also a washington mutual employee.next,on april,a wire transfer of was made into jackson personal bank account at tcf bank.the wire transfer had been printed on the pending loan application of washington mutual customer frank knoll.then on april,a wire transfer of was made into jones personal bank account at bank one.this wire transfer had been printed on the pending loan application of washington mutual customer mark corvo.four other wires were printed with jones name,but were not sent to the wire room for funding and were reversed before a wire transfer took place.the washington mutual investigators also discovered five wires in pronto that had been printed in april in the name of george davis,defendant shaw husband,for amounts ranging from to a bit over.none of the davis wires were sent to the wire room for funding.
the washington mutual investigators took steps to determine whether the young,jackson,and jones wires were legitimate and found similar evidence of fraud in each of them.neither young,jackson,nor jones was a washington mutual mortgage loan customer in the winter or spring of,and the authorization signatures on each wire had been cut and pasted from legitimate worksheets.washington mutual investigation led to angela hubbard and ieanis shaw.hubbard had been a contract closer at the downers grove facility from september until april,her last day of employment.shaw was hired as a contract opener at the downers grove facility in late august and then made a employee in march.her last day of employment with washington mutual was may.
before the january wire transfer of into young personal bank account,young checking account had maintained very low or negative balances.her bank records show that the day after the transfer,january,she opened a new savings account at bank one in texas and transferred from her checking account into her new savings account.bank records further show that on january,was withdrawn from this new savings account.also on january,young wrote a personal check to bank one to obtain a cashier check made payable to angela hubbard in the amount of.the cashier check later was endorsed by hubbard.bank calumet records reflect that on february,hubbard deposited into her checking account,used to open a new savings account,and received cash.
young and hubbard are sisters.telephone records revealed that from january through january,they spoke on the phone only three times for a total of minutes.but during the ten days from january through february,the period surrounding the wire transfer,they spoke on the phone times for a total of minutes.in the remainder of february,they spoke eleven times for a total of minutes.
on april,was wired from washington mutual to a personal checking account at tcf bank opened by jackson on march.the account had very low or negative balances before the transfer.the same day as the wire transfer,jackson wrote a personal check on the account in the amount of payable to angela hubbard.on april,that check was deposited into hubbard personal checking account at bank calumet and hubbard wrote a personal check on her account payable to shaw for.this check was later deposited into shaw bank account.a week later hubbard wrote another personal check for payable to shaw.this check also was deposited into shaw account.jackson ran through the money he retained rather quickly on cash withdrawals,furniture,vehicles,and gifts to family and friends.on june,less than three months after the wire transfer,his account balance was near.
telephone records of calls between jackson and hubbard reveal a spike in activity in the time period surrounding the april wire transfer.in january and february,jackson and hubbard spoke nine and seven times,respectively,for a total of minutes each month.from march through march,they had sixteen telephone conversations for a total of minutes.however,during the ten days from march through april,they had telephone conversations for a total of minutes.
in april,shaw purchased two wedding rings from the jewelry exchange,valued at and,respectively.that same month shaw and her husband went on a honeymoon to jamaica at the cost of.then on may,shaw purchased approximately in furniture from harlem furniture.
on april,was transferred by wire from washington mutual to jones personal checking account at bank one.on may,jones obtained two cashier checks.the first,in the amount of,was made payable to hubbard the second,in the amount of,was made payable to shaw.jones testified that hubbard had instructed him to divide the proceeds of the wire transfer three ways and to obtain two cashier checks,one for her and one for shaw.he also testified that he had never met shaw before.jones used his share of the proceeds to buy some vehicles and pay off some bills.shaw bank records show that on may,she opened a new savings account at tcf bank with the cashier check.she then transferred from that account into her checking account.
washington mutual investigation revealed that the authorizing signatures on the jones wire transfer were identical to those on the worksheet involved in the hulet wire transfer that had prompted the investigation.five wires had been printed in jones name,but four were reversed before the real wire took place.hubbard user identification number was used to reverse the first four jones wires in pronto.shaw user identification number was used to reverse the real wire transfer on april,the day after hubbard employment at washington mutual ended.shaw user identification number also was used to reverse all five wires printed in her husband name and all of the hulet wires as well.the investigation also revealed that two wires had been printed in jackson name.the first was printed and reversed in pronto on march,shaw user identification number was used to reverse the wire.hubbard user identification number was used to reverse the real wire transfer on april.
on march,defendants hubbard,shaw,jackson,young,and jones were charged in a indictment with a scheme to defraud washington mutual and to obtain monies and funds owned by and under the custody and control of the bank in violation of and.the government alleged that shaw and hubbard generated false mortgage loan documents in order to wire transfer mortgage loan proceeds to the personal bank accounts of friends and family,including hubbard sister,young,and hubbard longtime friend,jackson.jones and hubbard entered into written plea agreements.on august,jones pled guilty to count three of the indictment which alleged the fraudulent wire transfer into his account.on october,pursuant to a written plea agreement,hubbard pled guilty to count one of the indictment alleging the fraudulent young wire transfer.
as part of her plea agreement,hubbard agreed to cooperate with the government and to provide complete and truthful information during its investigation and in preparation for trial of the.both in her proffer of her involvement in the scheme and in her plea agreement,hubbard implicated shaw in the young wire transfer.specifically,hubbard admitted certain facts as a basis for her plea in january she and shaw began talking about the possibility of attempting to fraudulently wire money from washington mutual into someone else bank account they agreed they would first attempt this scheme by wiring money to hubbard sister,pamela young after young provided shaw with her personal and banking information,shaw generated fraudulent mortgage loan documents in young name and sent a wire request for mortgage loan funds to be disbursed to young personal bank account and hubbard,shaw,and young executed the scheme on january,by causing a wire transfer of loan funds to young checking account and subsequently agreed on how to divide the proceeds from the scheme,with young keeping half and hubbard and shaw dividing the other half.
on january,shortly before the start of the scheduled jury trial,hubbard told the government that she had not been truthful in her proffer and plea agreement.she claimed that shaw had no active role in the young wire transfer.more specifically,hubbard said that it was she who contacted young about participating in the fraud scheme,obtained young bank account information,and generated the fraudulent wire transfer worksheet.however,hubbard also said that she and shaw had conversations about wiring money into people bank accounts and that shaw knew hubbard was involved in the wire transfer to young account.hubbard added that after learning how much money hubbard and young received,shaw said she would like to get involved.
the morning that trial was to commence,the government informed the court that hubbard had advised that information she previously had provided was not truthful.the government took the position that hubbard had lied in her proffers and in open court during her plea hearing and was no longer usable as a witness.the government moved to revoke shaw plea agreement and vacate her guilty plea.the district court granted these motions and continued the trial date.the government then moved to dismiss count one of the indictment involving the young wire transfer as to shaw.the district court granted this motion.on march,the grand jury returned a nine count superseding indictment against all defendants except jones,who by then had already pled guilty.the superseding indictment added money laundering charges in violation of.
after the superseding indictment was filed,the government filed a supplemental evidentiary proffer to admit statements.the district court previously had granted the government motion to admit statements based on a proffer that relied heavily,but not exclusively,on hubbard statements.the supplement proffered that jones would testify that hubbard told him that shaw was orchestrating the fraud and that hubbard could wire him money only if ieanis would do it.
defendants shaw,jackson,and young were tried by a jury and convicted on all counts.during trial,the government moved to preclude the defense from presenting evidence about hubbard january partial recantation through the of the government agent,mike clifford.shaw counsel argued that the evidence that hubbard recanted statements she had made to the government about shaw involvement in the young wire transfer was admissible as statements against interest under.b the district judge cautioned,just before me miss hubbard has said conflicting things.so for me to allow in some type of hearsay statement that miss hubbard made is going to take a lot of corroborating circumstances for that to come in.the court ultimately found insufficient corroborating circumstances to admit the hearsay,sustained the government objection and thus excluded the evidence.
at trial,consistent with the government proffer,jones testified that he knew shaw was involved in the fraud scheme because hubbard had told him so.he also testified that when he asked hubbard if he could get some money wired to him,she said that she could not do it,but she would check with ieanis to see if ieanis could do it.
shaw and young moved for a new trial.the district court treated the motions as made by all defendants and denied the motions.the defendants were sentenced to terms of imprisonment and ordered to pay restitution.at sentencing,shaw again raised the issue of hubbard recanted statements.judge castillo said with respect to hubbard,i think her credibility is zero at this point,as i seen her take inconsistent positions before this court during plea allocutions that occurred on the record under oath,and so i could not in good conscience admit any of her statements,and so that was the basis for that ruling shaw,jackson,and young timely appealed their convictions.their appeals were consolidated and are before us now.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,the defendants raise three challenges to their convictions.they first contend that the district court erred in excluding hearsay evidence that hubbard lied to the government about shaw role in the young wire transfer.they also challenge the sufficiency of the evidence of their guilt at trial.finally,the defendants contend that in rebuttal the government improperly commented on their decisions not to testify in violation of their fifth amendment right to remain silent.each of these challenges fails,as explained below,so we affirm.
exclusion of hubbard statements 
the defendants contend that the district court erred by excluding evidence that hubbard recanted prior statements and lied to the government about shaw involvement in the young wire transfer.they assert that the excluded evidence was essential to their case and,as a result,its exclusion denied them a fair trial.this court generally reviews a district court decision regarding the admission of evidence for an abuse of discretion.united states swan,cir.as noted,however,only shaw sought admission of hubbard january recanting statements jackson did not address the evidence and young actually objected to their admission.this is a clear case of waiver by young of any right to challenge the exclusion of the statements,see united states clements,cir waiver occurs when a criminal defendant intentionally relinquishes a known right,and a forfeiture by jackson of any such right,see id.forfeiture occurs when a defendant negligently fails to assert a right in a timely fashion.waiver extinguishes any error,precluding appellate review forfeiture,however,allows for plain error review.id.a plain error must be clear or obvious and affect substantial rights in order to warrant reversing the district court decision as to the admissibility of evidence.united states schalk,cir citation omitted.thus,we review the exclusion of this evidence for an abuse of discretion as to shaw and for plain error as to jackson.and because of young waiver,our review is precluded as to her.
prior to analyzing admissibility under rule b,we observe that by offering hubbard recanting statements,shaw sought,in effect,to impeach hubbard on a collateral matter.c ontradiction is a valid method of impeachment,but it is that one may not impeach by contradiction regarding collateral or irrelevant matters and that a party may not contradict for the sake of contradiction.united states bitterman,cir quoting united states kozinski,cir.we note that this rule ordinarily is utilized when a witness is testifying,and hubbard never testified as a witness.however,in our view,the rule is equally applicable where a party attempts to put a person statement before the trier of fact solely to impeach that person.the jury was not asked to determine whether shaw participated in the young wire transfer before trial the government had dismissed the young wire transfer count against shaw.furthermore,hubbard earlier statements that shaw participated in the young wire transfer were not before the jury.thus,in order for the jury to find that hubbard lied about shaw participation in the young wire transfer,the jury would also have to hear evidence that hubbard had made statements implicating shaw in that transaction.such evidence was irrelevant because shaw was no longer charged with any offense arising out of the young wire transfer.the only purpose of presenting evidence that hubbard recanted prior statements implicating shaw in the young wire transfer was to prove that hubbard was lying.but m erely attempting to prove that a witness is lying is not a proper purpose of impeachment by contradiction.kozinski,at.and the district judge could have excluded this collateral and irrelevant evidence under.because its tendency to mislead and confuse the jury outweighed its negligible probative value.all that said,we move on to consider whether the district court abused its discretion in excluding the evidence under rule b.
under.b,hearsay statements are not excluded by the hearsay rule if the declarant is unavailable as a witness,the statement was against the declarant penal interest when made,and corroborating circumstances clearly suggest that the statement is trustworthy.united states loggins,cir,cert.denied,d see also united states leahy,cir,cert.denied sub nom.duff united states,d.the proponent of the hearsay statement bears the burden of demonstrating that each of these elements is satisfied.united states robbins,cir.here,the district court the government does not hubbard was unavailable to testify because she would assert her fifth amendment right against.the government also concedes,and we accept,that hubbard recantation of her prior statements implicating shaw in the young wire transfer were against hubbard penal interest.hubbard stood to and did,in fact,lose the benefits of a favorable plea agreement and exposed herself to additional criminal charges.thus,the only issue is whether the defendants have shown that corroborating circumstances clearly suggest that hubbard january statements were trustworthy 
the district judge determination as to the trustworthiness of an statement is entitled to considerable deference and should be upheld unless clearly erroneous.united states amerson,cir see also united states hall,cir.we have emphasized that rule b expressly requires the exclusion of statements offered to exculpate the accused unless there are corroborating circumstances that clearly indicate the trustworthiness of the statement.hall,at quoting united states garcia,cir.the defendants submit that the statements in question were admissible based on consideration of the factors from united states nagib,cir.in nagib we identified three factors for district courts to consider when determining whether corroborating circumstances exist for rule b purposes the relationship between the declarant and the exculpated party whether the statement was voluntary and given after miranda warnings and whether there is any evidence the statement was made to curry favor with authorities.id.at citing united states garcia,cir.
these factors might seem to provide some weight in favor of finding corroborating circumstances here.hubbard and shaw did not have a close personal relationship which one would expect for hubbard to be motivated to falsely exculpate they were close enough to be involved in the fraudulent scheme together.hubbard had been advised of her miranda rights and made the statements in the presence of her counsel.it seems that her statements were voluntary the government does not suggest otherwise.nor is there anything in the record to suggest that hubbard recanted her prior statements in order to curry favor with the government.to the contrary,hubbard would have known that recanting her prior statements and admitting to having lied to the government in pretrial preparation,in her plea agreement,and even under oath at her plea hearing would result in the withdrawal of her plea agreement,at the least,and expose her to additional criminal charges.
we have never said,however,that the considerations we identified in nagib were the only factors to be weighed in determining whether corroborating circumstances exist.see am.auto.accessories,fishman,cir stating that the factors to consider in determining whether corroborating circumstances exist include the factors identified in nagib garcia,at indicating that the case law identifies some circumstances relevant to determining whether corroborating circumstances clearly indicate trustworthiness.other circumstances in this case strongly detract from any corroboration raised by the nagib factors.hubbard statements that shaw was not directly involved in the young wire transfer clearly contradicted her several prior statements to the government,in her plea,and affirmed under oath,that shaw was involved in the young wire transfer.we have concluded that similar circumstances justified the conclusion that a statement lacked the requisite trustworthiness for admission under rule b.united states groce,cir upholding district court conclusion that statement lacked the trustworthiness required under b where the declarant gave several conflicting statements,most of which contradicted the statement sought to be admitted.
the defendants argue that hubbard statements recanting her prior statements about the fraud scheme were corroborated by other evidence,but her prior statements implicating shaw were not.we disagree.specifically,the defendants point to the evidence that none of the other than hubbard knew shaw.while the government did not have evidence to suggest that shaw would risk being charged with a crime solely to benefit persons she did not know,it did offer evidence that shaw herself benefited from her participation in the scheme.the evidence allowed a reasonable jury to find that shaw received for her role in the jackson and jones wire transfers.this,and other evidence,for example,the use of shaw user identification number in fraudulent wire transfers,and the timing of the jones wire transfer and hulet wire transfers after hubbard had left washington mutual employ,corroborated hubbard earlier statements as to shaw involvement in the scheme to defraud.
as judge castillo explained,because hubbard made conflicting statements before him,a lot of corroborating circumstances would be required to admit her recanting hearsay statements.in effect,he was saying that her statements were so conflicting that her recanting hearsay statements were untrustworthy.the judge later reiterated that hubbard credibility was zero and he could not in good conscience admit any of her statements.the district judge did not err in finding that hubbard recanting hearsay statements lacked trustworthiness.and we can not disagree with his conclusion that a lot of corroboration would be needed to admit the recanting hearsay statements of an incredible and untrustworthy declarant.ultimately,judge castillo did not find sufficient corroborating circumstances to admit the statements.that was well within his discretion based on the entire record before him.and,as we have noted,rule b explicitly requires a judge to exclude an statement unless there are sufficient corroborating circumstances.hall,at.we thus uphold the judge decision to exclude hubbard recanting hearsay statements.
the defendants suggest that the district court relied on its inherent powers to exclude hubbard hearsay statements.they are incorrect.as explained supra,we do not quarrel with the district court conclusion that there were insufficient corroborating circumstances to indicate the trustworthiness of hubbard hearsay statements.thus,rule b expressly required the exclusion of those statements.see id.accordingly,the basis for the district court ruling was rule b,not its inherent powers.
the defendants cite taylor illinois,d,for the proposition that it is the jury role to assess the credibility of witnesses.but it is the judge role to determine the admissibility of evidence.see.a preliminary questions concerning the admissibility of evidence shall be determined by the court.united states collins,cir i t is the judge role to determine admissibility of evidence.a defendant right to offer testimony is not absolute.see united states scheffer,d holding military rule of evidence making polygraph evidence inadmissible in court martial proceedings did not violate the accused right to present a defense taylor,at.the accused does not have an unfettered right to offer testimony that is inadmissible under standard rules of evidence.malinowski smith,cir concluding the district court did not violate petitioner right to present a defense by excluding victim school counselor testimony at trial tyson trigg,cir a court does not violate the constitution every time it sustains an objection to the testimony of one of the defense witnesses,or for that matter every time it excludes one of those witnesses altogether.finally,the defendants reliance on united states peak,cir,is misplaced.the hearsay exception at issue there was the state of mind exception under rule.id.at.rule does not expressly require the exclusion of evidence absent corroborating circumstances clearly indicating the trustworthiness of the statement.rule b does.
the defendants argue that the exclusion of hubbard statements recanting her prior statements violated their sixth amendment right to confrontation.this court reviews de novo evidentiary rulings that affect a defendant sixth amendment right to confront witnesses.united states gilbertson,cir.the confrontation clause guarantees a defendant an opportunity for effective.delaware fensterer,d per curiam united states ghilarducci,cir,cert.denied sub nom.richardson united states,d,and cert.denied,d.there is no guarantee of to whatever extent the defense might wish.delaware van arsdall,d quoting fensterer,at.a district judge has wide discretion to impose reasonable limits on,and may do so based on concerns about,inter alia,prejudice,confusion of the issues,or questioning that is only marginally relevant.united states smith,cir.the defendants had the opportunity to effectively agent clifford,and did so.the district judge was well within his discretion in prohibiting shaw from questioning agent clifford about hubbard recantation of her earlier statements about shaw role in the young wire transfer.shaw was not charged with participating in the young wire transfer.thus,testimony that hubbard originally implicated shaw in that wire transfer and later said she had been untruthful about that would be only marginally,if at all,relevant.such testimony also had a strong potential for confusing the issues because shaw was not charged with the young wire transfer and hubbard credibility was not directly at issue.
furthermore,hubbard did not recant all of her prior statements regarding shaw role in the fraudulent scheme.had the district court allowed evidence of hubbard statements that were exculpatory as to shaw with respect to the young wire transfer,the other statements that hubbard made to agent clifford implicating shaw in the overall scheme may have been admissible on redirect.see united states glover,cir indicating that where a fragmentary statement is introduced.allows an adverse party to require the admission of any other part of the statement to clarify or explain the part already received so as to avoid any misleading impression created by offering the statement outside of context.additional statements made by hubbard,including other things she said on january,could have been offered to put the recanting statements in their proper context and to avoid misleading the jury into believing that shaw had no involvement in the fraudulent scheme.during the same january recantation exculpating shaw in the young wire transfer,hubbard reconfirmed that she and shaw had had several discussions about wiring money into other accounts and shaw knew that hubbard wired money into young account.hubbard further stated that after seeing that the wire transfer was successful and knowing how much money young and hubbard received,shaw said she wanted to get some money through a wire transfer.hubbard made several very damaging statements about young involvement in the scheme in the january statement as well.the admission of the remainder of hubbard statements to agent clifford may have been highly prejudicial to young and would have raised concerns about young confrontation rights.see crawford washington,d defendant right to confrontation violated by admission of testimonial statements if declarant was unavailable to testify at trial and defendant did not have a prior opportunity to the declarant united states james,cir citing crawford.
the defendants assert that it was inconsistent for the district court to allow hubbard statements to come in through jones testimony but to preclude of agent clifford about hubbard recantation of her prior statements about shaw.the confrontation clause is not violated by the admission of statements made in furtherance of the conspiracy such statements are not hearsay under.d e and not testimonial.united states hargrove,cir united states jenkins,cir.the government evidence supported the conclusion that hubbard and the defendants on trial were involved in a scheme to defraud washington mutual.hubbard statements to jones about shaw role in the scheme were statements of a made during the course of and in the furtherance of a conspiracy.thus,those statements were admissible under rule d e.hubbard recanting statements were not made during the course of or in furtherance of the conspiracy and thus do not fall within rule d e.moreover,a critical difference exists between rule d e and rule b.the former,unlike the latter,does not expressly require corroborating circumstances indicating a statement trustworthiness for admissibility.therefore,the district court did not make inconsistent rulings on the admissibility of hubbard various statements further,ms hubbard statements testified to by jones were the only statements introduced at trial and were a relatively small piece of evidence at trial.the admission of hubbard statements through jones testimony did not violate the confrontation clause.
the district court was well within its discretion to limit the of agent clifford by precluding inquiry into hubbard statements recanting her earlier statements about shaw role in the young wire transfer.the decision to exclude this evidence did not violate the defendants rights under the confrontation clause.we find no error,plain or otherwise,in the district court decision to exclude the evidence.
even if the district court erred in excluding such evidence,we will not reverse if the error was harmless.smith,at.the question is whether the erroneous exclusion of evidence had a substantial influence over the jury and the result reached was inconsistent with substantial justice.united states savage,cir quoting united states seals,cir.in determining whether an error was harmless,we consider factors such as the importance of the witness testimony in the government case,whether the testimony was cumulative,the presence or absence of corroborating or contradicting evidence,and the overall strength of the government case.smith,at.
according to the defendants,hubbard was essential to the government case.they contend that the government vehement argument to exclude her statements strongly suggests it knew the statements would undermine its case.it is difficult to discern how hubbard was essential to the government case when she never even testified.it seems likely that the government strenuously opposed introduction of evidence of her january statements because it believed then,as it argues now,that the statements were irrelevant.it is also difficult to see how the evidence of hubbard statements was essential to the defendants case when the jury was not charged with deciding whether only codefendant about whom hubbard recanted any guilty with respect to the young wire only wire transfer to which the statements at issue pertained.the excluded statements would not have been the even as to the defendants knowledge or intent.
here,the government case against shaw was overwhelming the government offered evidence that shaw user identification number was used to reverse several wire transfers in pronto,including the jones wire transfer,the hulet wire transfers,and the five wires printed in her husband name.furthermore,the evidence also included hubbard two checks for payable to shaw shortly after the jackson wire transfer and the check from jones,who testified he had never met shaw.the evidence of hubbard statements about shaw involvement in the scheme introduced through jones testimony was helpful,but not necessary to the government case.this circumstantial evidence corroborated hubbard statements about the scheme,particularly shaw direct participation in it.therefore,the exclusion of hubbard january statements recanting her prior statements of shaw involvement in the young wire transfer,even if erroneous,was harmless.
sufficiency of the evidence 
the defendants contend that the evidence at trial was insufficient to prove their knowledge and intent to defraud.their burden in doing so is heavy.united states useni,cir.when the sufficiency of the evidence is challenged,we review the evidence and all reasonable inferences from it in the light most favorable to the verdict.id.we will reverse only if no rational trier of fact could find the defendants guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.united states desilva,cir see also useni,at.
a conviction for bank fraud under requires proof of,inter alia,the defendant knowing participation in a scheme to defraud a bank,see united states yoon,cir united states ross,cir,cert
