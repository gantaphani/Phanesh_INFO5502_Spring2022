factual and procedural background 
livingston parish,louisiana,operates under a home rule charter providing that its citizens elect a parish president for a term.see.const.art.vi,livingston parish home rule charter.in,ratcliff was the incumbent livingston parish president and a candidate for reelection.
candidates for public office in louisiana must abide by the provisions of louisiana campaign finance disclosure act cfda.ann.the cfda prohibits any candidate for parishwide elective office,including the parish presidency,from receiving contributions,loans,or loan guarantees in excess of from any individual.id.b,h.candidates must also file campaign finance disclosure reports with the louisiana board of ethics the board or board of ethics.id.the reports are to detail all campaign contributions,loans,loan guarantors,and expenditures.id.
according to the indictment,ratcliff obtained several loans violative of the cfda from september to november.on september,ratcliff obtained a bank loan for the purpose of financing his reelection campaign.ratcliff had insufficient income and assets to qualify for the loan,and a local businessman with sufficient assets served as cosigner.one week later,on october,ratcliff obtained another loan with the same businessman as cosigner.the cosigner also assigned a certificate of deposit as collateral.
on october,ratcliff filed with the board of ethics a campaign finance disclosure report in which he disclosed the first loan and the businessman guarantee of that loan.on october,a staff member of the board advised ratcliff that the businessman guarantee possibly violated the cfda.in response,ratcliff informed the board that he had instructed the bank to prepare new loan documents for his signature alone.
on october,ratcliff obtained two new loans to pay off the loans that had been improperly guaranteed by the businessman.the indictment charges that the new loans were secured by a pledge of in cash,supplied by one of ratcliff wealthy supporters who had a financial interest in the transfer of a permit for operation of a landfill in livingston parish to waste management,waste management.the transfer,which was allegedly supported by ratcliff,was a major election issue.ratcliff obtained another loan on november,allegedly secured by a pledge of in cash supplied by the same wealthy supporter.the indictment asserts that ratcliff knew that his receipt of the cash for all three loans violated the individual loan limitation and that he did not report it in his campaign finance disclosure reports.
ratcliff was reelected as parish president on november.during the course of the campaign,ratcliff had contracted with a political consultant to help with his reelection bid,and by the time of the election,ratcliff owed the consultant over.on november,a waste management lobbyist allegedly gave ratcliff approximately in cash for ratcliff political consultant to hold as collateral until ratcliff paid the consultant the money owed.the indictment alleges that ratcliff knew that his use of the cash to secure a campaign debt violated the statutory limitation and that ratcliff did not disclose the illegal loan in his campaign finance disclosure reports.
in addition to ratcliff failure to report the amount and source of certain cash and loans he received,he allegedly misled the board of ethics during its investigation of his activities.specifically,the indictment alleges that ratcliff falsely represented that he had the creditworthiness to obtain the original loans on september and october,without a cosigner and that the replacement loans were obtained on the basis of his independent creditworthiness.and despite requests from the board for information on his use of collateral to secure the replacement loans,ratcliff allegedly failed to disclose that the collateral was borrowed cash.the indictment also asserts that ratcliff used the mails to submit a campaign finance disclosure report and two letters concerning the ethics investigation to the board of ethics,as well as to receive the financial benefits of office.
after ratcliff reelection as parish president,ratcliff served in office from january,to january.during this term,ratcliff allegedly received over in salary and employment benefits from the parish.
on november,ratcliff was charged by indictment with fourteen counts of mail fraud and one count of making a false statement to a financial institution with regard to the mail fraud counts,the government alleged that ratcliff used the mails in a scheme to defraud livingston parish of the salary and employment benefits of elected office through misrepresentations he made to the board of ethics concerning the financing of his campaign.according to the government,ratcliff secured his reelection as parish president by obtaining the illegal funding and concealing his violations from the board of ethics.
on march,ratcliff filed a motion to dismiss the mail fraud counts.after hearing oral argument on the motion,the district court granted the motion on may.the government appealed.
ii.discussion 
the government contends that ratcliff indictment sufficiently charged the offense of mail fraud because the salary and employment benefits of elected office constitute money or property under the mail fraud statute and because fraudulent job procurement can constitute mail fraud in the election context just as it can in the typical hiring context.ratcliff counters that any misrepresentations he allegedly made to the board of ethics,which is a state entity,were unrelated to the salary and benefits paid as a matter of course by livingston parish,which is a distinct,local entity.
we review the sufficiency of an indictment de novo,taking the indictment allegations as true.united states crow,cir.the federal rules of criminal procedure require that the indictment be a plain,concise and definite written statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged.c.the indictment is sufficient if it alleges every element of the crime charged and in such a way as to enable the accused to prepare his defense and to allow the accused to invoke the double jeopardy clause in any subsequent proceeding.united states bieganowski,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.when reviewing the indictment,we must keep in mind that the law does not compel a ritual of words and that an indictment validity depends on practical,not technical,considerations.crow,at quoting united states devoll,cir.and t he starting place for any determination of whether the charged conduct is proscribed by a criminal statute is a reading of the language of the charging instrument and the statute itself.united states white,cir second and third alterations in original quoting united states,cir.
to sufficiently charge the offense of mail fraud the indictment must allege that the defendant devised or intended to devise a scheme to defraud,the mails were used for the purpose of executing,or attempting to execute,the scheme,and the falsehoods employed in the scheme were material united states caldwell,cir.the first element includes a defendant scheme or artifice to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services,for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses,representations,or promises,or to sell,dispose of,loan,exchange,alter,give away,distribute,supply,or furnish or procure for unlawful use any counterfeit or spurious article.see caldwell,at.only the second type of scheme or artifice is at issue in this appeal,as ratcliff was charged with a scheme to defraud livingston parish of the money and property represented by the powers,privileges,salary,and other benefits of his elected office.
we do not dispute the government contention that a salary and other financial employment benefits can constitute money or property under the statute as the eighth circuit put it when discussing a scheme to defraud an employer of wages,m oney is money,and money is specifically mentioned in the statutory words.united states granberry,cir emphasis omitted see also pasquantino united states,d recognizing that money in the public treasury is the government money for purposes of the mail fraud statute.but the real question before us is whether the indictment alleges a scheme to defraud the alleged that money see united states rico,cir the mail fraud statute protects only against schemes or artifices to defraud the property rights of citizens.as the supreme court has explained,the words to defraud commonly refer to wronging one in his property rights by dishonest methods or schemes,and usually signify the deprivation of something of value by trick,deceit,chicane,or overreaching.mcnally united states,d quoting hammerschmidt united states.accordingly,in determining whether the indictment alleges a scheme to defraud livingston parish of money or property,we must look to whether the alleged scheme is one to deprive the parish of money or property through misrepresentations,thereby wronging the parish property rights see id.at.holding that the mail fraud statute is limited in scope to the protection of property rights see also cleveland united states,d recognizing the court r eject ion of the argument that the requirement does not limit schemes to defraud to those aimed at causing deprivation of money or property carpenter united states,d sections and reach any scheme to deprive another of money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses,representations,or promises.
applying these principles,it is evident that ratcliff indictment does not allege a scheme to defraud livingston parish of any money or property.according to the indictment,ratcliff devised a scheme to conceal campaign finance violations from the board of ethics,which would deceive the voting public about the campaign contributions he received,which would secure his reelection to office,which would cause livingston parish to pay him the salary and other financial benefits budgeted for the parish president.although the charged scheme involves ratcliff ultimately receiving money from the parish,it can not be said that the parish would be deprived of this money by means of ratcliff misrepresentations,as the financial benefits budgeted for the parish president go to the winning candidate regardless of who that person is.nor would the parish be deprived of its control over the money by means of ratcliff fraud,as the parish has no such control other than ensuring that the benefits are paid to the duly elected candidate.there are no allegations,for example,that the parish was deceived into paying the parish president salary to someone who did not win the election or to someone who failed to meet the parish minimum requirements for office indeed,there are no allegations that the parish would be deceived,either directly or indirectly,into taking any action at all rather,the indictment alleges a scheme to deceive the board of ethics and the voters.though the misrepresentations in a mail fraud scheme need not be made directly to the scheme victim,see,united states pepper,cir,the alleged scheme must nevertheless be one to defraud the victim.ratcliff indictment provides no basis to find a scheme to defraud livingston parish through misrepresentations made to the board of ethics.the misrepresentations simply did not implicate the parish property rights.
the sixth circuit recently reached a similar result in united states turner,cir.in that case,turner was indicted on charges that,inter alia,he engaged in a scheme to violate state campaign finance laws and to mail false campaign finance reports to the state in order to cover up the violations,thereby assisting the election of two state officials who received salaries from the state while in office.id.at.the sixth circuit surveyed the case law and concluded that applying the mail fraud statute to a case of election fraud based on a theory that the candidate attempted to obtain money in the form of a salary would be a novel application of the mail fraud statute.id.at.looking to the merits of the theory,the court determined that in the election fraud context,the government and citizens have not been deprived of any money or property because the relevant salary would be paid to someone regardless of the fraud.in such a case,the citizens have simply lost the intangible right to elect the official who will receive the salary.id.at.the court further decided that the allegedly defrauded state had no control over the appropriation of the salary beyond ensuring payment to the duly elected official,and that a lthough the salary comes from the public fisc,there is no discretion regarding either whether or to whom it is paid.id.at.accordingly,the court concluded that there is no resulting property deprivation from the alleged scheme.id.
the government makes several arguments seeking to avoid this conclusion here.first,the government contends that several courts in other circuits have embraced the salary theory,under which a mail fraud charge can be supported by a scheme to use deceit to obtain a job and the salary that comes with it.yet even if the salary theory were to be accepted in this circuit,the cases discussing and accepting the theory involve situations in which a job applicant falsely represented his qualifications or skills in order to obtain a job,deceiving the employer into hiring or promoting someone that he would not have otherwise hired or promoted in united states granberry,for example,the defendant obtained the job of driver by concealing a murder conviction,which would have prevented his hiring if known to the school district.at.the eighth circuit reversed the district court dismissal of the indictment,holding that the defendant alleged scheme deprived the school district of money because the district did not get what it paid driver who had not been convicted of a felony.id.at.the court also concluded that the scheme deprived the school district of the property right to choose the person to whom it transferred money.id.similarly,the defendants in united states doherty were boston policemen who schemed to steal copies of civil service examinations and sell them to other policemen so that they could cheat and obtain promotions,cir.the first circuit held that such a scheme fell within the prohibition of the mail fraud statute because it deprived the employer of control over how its money was spent.id.at quoting mcnally,at.unlike these situations,ratcliff charged conduct posed no harm to any of livingston parish property rights the parish does not bargain for elected officials of a particular quality such that ratcliff fraud could have denied it the value for which it paid,and the parish does not have control over the recipient of the parish president salary such that ratcliff misrepresentations deprived it of that control.as the sixth circuit summarized when distinguishing these cases,these examples,which address the government role as employer,where job qualifications can be economically quantified,are not analogous to an election fraud case,where the government role is purely administrative and the public role is a political one.turner,at.
responding to these distinctions,the government contends that if a job procurement theory can successfully support a charge of mail fraud when a government employer is making the hiring decision itself,the result should not change merely because the parish has effectively delegated its hiring decision to the electorate.we disagree,however,with the notion that the electoral process constitutes an effective delegation of hiring authority from the parish government to the voters.the power to select the parish president does not originate from the parish government,but rather is vested in the electorate
