may the payor of a bribe to a state official conspire with that official to extort property from himself in violation of the hobbs act we hold that he can not,and we thus reverse the convictions of michael and jerry brock.darrin webb unrelated challenges to his conviction and sentence,by contrast,do not have merit,and we thus affirm both of them.
michael brock and darrin webb are best friends with a long history.the two once operated video poker machines together in chattanooga,tennessee.michael brock eventually left that business to open brock bonding,a bail bond company,which he now runs with his brother jerry.webb remained in the video poker business after michael brock departure,and over the years he also developed a reputation as someone who had a way with fire.see ja,webb admitting that he had burned some buildings down in his past people pull your machines out,and y ou know,bad things happen.
in december,while webb was working on a poker machine at a local bar,the bar interested in burning down a rival him how to start a chemical fire.webb explained how to create a delayed reaction fire,using score hair gel,that would leave no trace.ja.despite webb assistance,the planned arson never took place.
in may,one of brock bonding clients skipped town,which as a business matter meant that brock bonding would have to pay the bond.to avoid having to make this payment,jerry brock approached scott simcox,a friend and the supervisory clerk for the criminal division of the county courthouse,who agreed to make the problem go away by removing the scheduled forfeiture hearing from the court calendar.ja.without the prompt of a hearing,as jerry brock well knew,the court would never order the brocks to forfeit the bonds entered on behalf of their clients.two days later,jerry brock called simcox and told him to swing by the office when he was heading home.there,jerry brock gave simcox a bill to thank him for helping out.id.
for the next years,simcox fixed the court date of the bond forfeiture hearing whenever a client of brock bonding fled the happened times.each time,jerry brock paid simcox of the face value of the bond that brock bonding would have forfeited.
on september,webb,who had learned about simcox from michael brock,paid simcox to erase several of his girlfriend traffic citations.
in early december,officers from the federal bureau of investigation approached simcox.when they told him that they knew what he was doing,simcox agreed to cooperate with them by recording his conversations with the brocks.ja.
on december,jerry brock contacted simcox about fixing another case.two days later,simcox wore a wire to a meeting with him,where jerry gave simcox for dealing with two prior cases and where they discussed another case involving a bond that might need to be fixed soon.
on february,simcox wore a wire to another meeting,where jerry brock gave simcox bills for taking care of prior cases.ja.jerry asked simcox to fix the case they had discussed back in december and one other case.jerry also asked simcox to help his brother get out of a traffic citation.
on march,simcox met with jerry brock at the office of brock bonding to discuss additional work that jerry needed to have done.michael brock stepped in and asked if simcox had taken care of his traffic citation.on march,jerry brock paid simcox another for his work.
even though the brocks and webb continued to pay him for his efforts,simcox stopped fixing cases after the fbi confronted him.in,jerry and michael brock noticed that one of the supposedly fixed cases kept popping back up on the list of upcoming hearings.on march,the brocks shared their concerns with simcox.ja.jerry brock reiterated his concerns to simcox on april and gave him a list of cases on the calendar that should have been fixed.and on april,michael brock again called simcox to discuss his traffic citation.
on december,the government filed parallel indictments against webb and the brocks alleging that they had conspired to bribe a public official simcox in violation of the hobbs act.webb indictment also charged him with illegally distributing information about an incendiary device to the employees of a local bar,see p,and the brocks indictment charged them with four counts of mail fraud,see.
michael brock and webb both retained fred hanzelik as counsel.jerry brock maintained separate counsel.the government wrote hanzelik a letter seeking to negotiate a plea agreement for michael brock,for webb or for a third client of hanzelik,dean difilippo.the letter,among other things,asked if webb would consider testifying against michael brock,asked if webb would consider testifying against difilippo or vice versa and noted that hanzelik continued representation of all three individuals might violate the tennessee rules of professional conduct.
the government filed a motion asking the district court to determine whether hanzelik representation of michael brock,webb and difilippo was appropriate,after which the district court held an evidentiary hearing.after hearing the testimony of two government witnesses,after observing that the government had filed an intervening indictment alleging that webb and the brocks had conspired together to bribe simcox and after questioning hanzelik extensively,the district court gave hanzelik four days to respond to the government contentions.
following the hearing,hanzelik stopped representing difilippo.and on february,michael brock and webb filed nearly identical affidavits,each stating that he was unaware of any conflict of interest,that he heard all of the things discussed in court and did not feel that any of those things presented a conflict,but that i f the court believes there is a conflict of interest in this case,actual or potential,each affirmatively waive d the conflict.ja.
on february,the district court disqualified hanzelik from representing both webb and michael brock because the situation was rife with potential conflicts of interest.ja.the court noted that it may be in the best interest of one of these clients to plead guilty and testify against the other and that,should they both be found guilty,hanzelik may be in a position of contending that one or the other of his clients should receive a mitigating role and thus a lesser sentence than the other.ja.and because the waivers did not acknowledge these potential conflicts,the district court found that brock and webb did not clearly comprehend the risks here and thus did not know what they were waiving.ja.
a federal jury convicted webb of illegally distributing information relating to a destructive device,and he later pleaded guilty to violating the hobbs act.after hearing extensive testimony about webb considerable additional criminal activity other than what he was convicted of in this case,ja,the district court decided that a sentence within the advisory guidelines range of months was not enough to deter criminal conduct,ja,and imposed a sentence.
although the court dismissed the charges against the brocks,the jury convicted the two of conspiring with simcox to extort money in violation of the hobbs act.after considering the advisory guidelines range of months along with the other a factors,the court sentenced each of the brocks to a prison term.
mike and jerry brock contend that the hobbs act does not permit them to be convicted of conspiring to extort their own property.we agree and accordingly reverse their convictions and sentences.
the relevant provisions of the hobbs act say 
interference with commerce by threats or violence 
a whoever in any way or degree obstructs,delays,or affects commerce or the movement of any article or commodity in commerce,by robbery or extortion or attempts or conspires so to do,or commits or threatens physical violence to any person or property in furtherance of a plan or purpose to do anything in violation of this section shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than twenty years,or both.
b as used in this section 
the term extortion means the obtaining of property from another,with his consent,induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened force,violence,or fear,or under color of official right.
the question is whether extortion,or a conspiracy to commit extortion,extends to the brocks scheme,which essentially amounted to the bribing of a clerk to prevent bail bonds from being collected when the brocks clients skipped town.all agree that the brocks did not commit a substantive act of extortion.they did not obtain property from another person.id.b.and they are not public officials and thus could not have obtained any property under color of official right,and did not otherwise use actual or threatened force,violence,or fear in the course of this bribery scheme,see evans united states,d.
that leaves the possibility of a conspiracy to commit extortion.the hobbs act prohibits conspir ing to affect commerce by extortion,a,and it defines extortion involving a public official as the obtaining of property from another,with his consent under color of official right,id.b.to be covered by the statute,the alleged brocks and simcox the court clerk must have formed an agreement to obtain property from another,which is to say,formed an agreement to obtain property from someone outside the conspiracy.yet that did not happen.these three people did not agree,and could not have agreed,to obtain property from another when no other person was the property,so far as the record shows,went from one coconspirator one of the brocks to another simcox.we see no reason to ignore the property from another requirement and ample reason to give it content.see jones united states,d judges should hesitate to treat statutory terms in any setting as surplusage,and resistance should be heightened when the words describe an element of a criminal offense.internal quotation marks,brackets and ellipses omitted.
in addition to requiring the conspirators to agree to obtain property from another,the statute requires the conspirators to obtain that property with the other consent.how do or why would people conspire to obtain their own consent and how could it be said that the brocks conspired with simcox to obtain their consent to give,say,bills to him,ja,money which came from their own pockets or at most from their own company,brock bonding the context in which the consent requirement appears confirms that it must be taken seriously.the hobbs act prohibits not only extortion but robbery as well what separates the two is the payor consent.compare b defining robbery as taking property from another,against his will,with id.b defining extortion as obtaining property from another,with his consent.failure to respect the consent requirement blurs the line between robbery and extortion.
these textual shortcomings underscore another concern.the hobbs act is meant to prohibit public officials from obtaining property from others by extortion.yet sweeping the brocks within its coverage through a conspiracy theory effectively transforms the act into a prohibition on paying bribes to public officials.while the definition of extortion under color of official right correctly extends to public officials who accept a bribe when there is a quid pro quo for the payment,see evans,at.united states harding,cir,neither the supreme court nor our court has construed the statute to cover private individuals who offer a bribe to public officials.congress knows how to prohibit the giving or offering of bribes directly.see,b making it an offense to give,offer or promise anything of value to any federal official id.making it an offense to pay or offer or promise any money or thing of value,to any person,firm,or corporation in consideration of the use or promise to use any influence to procure any appointive office or place under the united states for any person id.a making it an offense for an officer,director,or employee of a financial institution to loan or give money to a federal examiner who examines or has authority to examine such institution id.a making it an offense to compromise the security of any secure or restricted area or seaport by corruptly giv ing,offer ing,or promis ing anything of value to any public or private person.having opted not to punish the giving of bribes directly,congress should not be treated as having prohibited them through the sleight of indictment of an extortion conspiracy.indeed,under the government theory of prosecution,it is difficult to see what independent role these other federal statutes play.this is,in short,the seventh degree of separation.
two other interpretive principles undermine this prosecution.although we think it clear that the language of the hobbs act does not prohibit bribery either directly or indirectly through the contortion of an extortion conspiracy,one must acknowledge at a minimum that the text of the statute does not unambiguously support the government theory of,as we have shown,the law says that the conspiracy must extort property from another and do so with his consent,neither of which applies naturally to the conspirators own property or to their own consent.when there are two rational readings of a criminal statute,one harsher than the other,the rule of lenity tells us that we are to choose the harsher only when congress has spoken in clear and definite language.scheidler org.for women,d applying the rule of lenity to the hobbs act internal quotation marks and brackets omitted cleveland united states,d jones,at.congress did not clearly criminalize paying bribes to public officials by the mere act of adding a conspiracy clause to the hobbs act.the government remains free to charge private individuals with violating the hobbs act when they conspire with public officials or aid and abet them in an extortion scheme it just must satisfy the property from another and with his consent requirements in doing so.see united states collins,cir upholding a conviction of a kentucky governor husband for a conspiracy to extort political contributions and investments in a thoroughbred partnership in exchange for access to state contracts united states kelley,cir upholding the conviction of a county executive wife for conspiring with a public official to commit extortion where the public contracts were granted in exchange for private financial gain.
basic notions of federalism also undermine the government interpretation.u nless congress conveys its purpose clearly,it will not be deemed to have significantly changed the balance in the prosecution of crimes.jones,at.internal quotation marks omitted see bfp resolution trust,d will.dep t of state police,d united states bass,d congress has traditionally been reluctant to define as a federal crime conduct readily denounced as criminal by the states.rewis united states,d limiting reach of the travel act because congress would certainly recognize that an expansive interpretation would alter sensitive relationships,and could overextend federal police resources.no one doubts that the states have criminal laws prohibiting their citizens from bribing public officials.is there any reason to doubt the states willingness to invoke these laws when their citizens engage in schemes as brazen as this one we can not think of one,and we certainly can not think of one here.the tennessee authorities already have indicted the brocks for bribing a public official under state law.see mike brock br.addendum ann.necessity may well be the motherhood of invention,but it is not a guide for construing statutes it is not a guide for construing criminal statutes and it is still less a guide for inventing a construction that the bribes in this case do not even demand.
in urging us to uphold the brocks convictions,the government acknowledges that we have not decided this issue but suggests that we follow the reasoning of four other courts.see united states,cir united states spitler,cir united states wright,cir united states nelson.only one of the cases,spitler,analyzed an extortion conspiracy,and it did not consider the textual anomalies raised here.spitler involved a payor of bribes spitler and a public official who received them carpenter the point of the fraud scheme was for carpenter,an employee of the state of maryland,to approve the overbillings of the company for which spitler worked tei.the case did not address whether spitler had
