in,a jury convicted james phillips,a partner at the phillips and phillips chartered law firm,and his wife and secretary,alicia,of eight counts of willingly making a false statement to a federal agency in violation of and eight counts of immigration fraud in violation of a.both defendants appeal,arguing that the court improperly admitted several significant documents and that the conduct underlying the a convictions does not fall within the scope of that statute.phillips additionally argues that the evidence was insufficient to convict him on any of the charges.we agree that the defendants conduct does not fall within the plain language of a,but we reject the defendants evidentiary and sufficiency of the evidence challenges.we therefore affirm on some of the counts and reverse on some of the counts.
background 
james phillips ran a law firm of about fifteen employees,one of whom was alicia,his wife.during the relevant time period,he was the only lawyer at the firm.among other legal work,the firm assisted undocumented workers with preparing and filing applications for permission to remain in the united states for employment purposes.these forms,called applications for alien employment certifications or,are the means by which foreign workers initiate the process to obtain an visa from the united states department of labor.a a.filling out the is the first of three steps that must be completed before the alien can receive the visa.matovski gonzales,cir united states,cir.a successful applicant receives a certification from the department of labor informing the secretary of state and the attorney general that the alien fills a crucial niche in the american labor force that can not otherwise be met.only after the alien receives this certification can he apply for an visa.b c an immigrant visa may not be issued to an immigrant until the consular officer is in receipt of a determination made by the secretary of labor pursuant to the provisions of section a a of this title.
to obtain approval from the department of labor,the applicant must have a sponsoring employer who certifies that efforts were made,unsuccessfully,to recruit american citizens for the specific position.united states ramirez,cir.an attorney may act on behalf of the employer,but to do so must file an ins notice of entry of appearance as attorney or representative,with the department of labor.see,at.the applicant also must attest,on the form,that he or she is qualified for and willing to fill that particular position.after examining the application,the administering state agency,acting as an arm of the secretary of labor,must determine and certify to the secretary of state and to the attorney general that the employer claim is accurate,and that the employment of such alien will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of workers in the united states similarly employed.a a ii.the relevant certifying agencies here are the kansas foreign labor certification unit of the kansas department of corrections and the missouri foreign labor certification program.
on april,brought a stack of into the kansas foreign labor certification unit.according to manager jane burbridge,this was a particularly busy day,as it was the filing deadline prior to the expiration of the family life act,a federal law which allowed undocumented aliens to remain in the country while seeking lawful permanent residency through labor certification.remained in the office for several hours and worked on the applications,eventually turning in applications to burbridge.
in september of,the kansas certification unit began review of,including those submitted by the phillips law firm.burbridge noticed a discrepancy between some forms submitted by the phillips law firm and those submitted by another attorney group.specifically,the phillips law firm listed a considerably lower wage for practically the same job from the same company acme foundry than did another attorney group that submitted an application.burbridge also noticed that the employer signatures on the forms did not match despite the fact that they were allegedly from the same employer,jason zimmerman of the acme foundry company.puzzled,burbridge contacted zimmerman,who informed her that the signature on the submitted by the phillips law firm was not his,and that he had not authorized anyone at the firm to act as his agent or sign for him.
after reviewing several other applications from the phillips law firm that she did not think look ed right,burbridge contacted special agent kilcoyne at the united states department of labor.agent kilcoyne conducted an extensive review of all the submitted by the phillips law firm.the investigation eventually revealed fraudulent applications with forged signatures from six employers,as well as a forged signature on an application for asylum form.additionally,though employer albert kramer,originally signed an application,that form was returned to the phillips law firm because it was sent to the wrong office.when the law firm refiled the form,the signature date was altered.but by the time of the second filing,kramer was dead,making it impossible for him to have signed on the listed date.
during an arrest interview,admitted to signing some of the employer and alien names,though she claimed that she had been authorized by some of the employers to sign on their behalf.
on january,james phillips and alicia were indicted and charged with eight counts of knowingly and willfully making and using a false writing and document by presenting forms to the department of labor,knowing them to be false,in violation of.they were also charged with eight counts of knowingly and willfully forging and falsely making a document prescribed by statute and regulation for entry into and as evidence of authorized stay and employment in the united states in violation of a.each was charged with aiding and abetting the other conduct.
phillips and were tried jointly before a jury.the government introduced the testimony of six employers on behalf of whom the phillips law firm filed brian jennings of superior frame company,jason zimmerman of acme foundry,keith huffman of hill huffman construction,eric cromer of cromer livestock,kerry cromer of patty john quarter horses,and joe dodson,proprietor of an electric motorshop.all denied that they had authorized either of the defendants to sign the forms on their behalf.eric cromer testified that he had initiated the filing process for several employees by paying the firm and providing information about his company,but that he had not authorized the firm to sign the form on his behalf,nor was he aware that anyone at the firm had submitted the form until he was later contacted by investigators.kerry cromer testified that he had never spoken to the defendants and had no knowledge that the labor certification applications existed.brian jennings testified that he had met with twice and paid,but that he did not think that he had signed his name on any forms.dodson testified that while he had communicated with about getting legal status for an employee,he had not signed any forms nor authorized someone to sign for him.zimmerman similarly denied filling out any forms,as did keith huffman and joe dodson.
the government also presented the testimony of elpidia solorazano,who had hired the phillips law firm to help her obtain work and residency permits for her family.after meeting with,she paid the firm and agreed to pay an additional in the future.she later received a rejected application for asylum from the united states citizenship and immigration office in nebraska.solorazano testified that someone had forged her signature on the application and that she was never informed that the firm would be filing an asylum application on her behalf.
while many of these witnesses testified that they had contact with,none claimed to have met with or spoken to phillips.
the government also presented the testimony of a former paralegal from the law firm,odelia bryer.she testified that she was familiar with both phillips and handwriting,that the signatures on all of the were in handwriting,and that the handwriting on the application for asylum was phillips.dorothy billings,phillips,testified in rebuttal that the handwriting on the document was not phillips.
burbridge described the irregularities she discovered in the phillips applications.she informed the jury that when the agency received,her office sent postcard notices to the agents listed on the forms,notifying them that the paperwork was received.she also testified that she had spoken with phillips over the phone on occasion about some of the applications filed by his firm,though she could not remember the substance of those calls.special agent phil barbour also testified about his interview with on the occasion of her arrest.
at the close of trial,the defendants moved for a judgment of acquittal,which the court denied.the jury then convicted the defendants on all counts,and the district court sentenced each to three years probation,a downward departure from their guidelines range of months.phillips and appeal their convictions.
ii.analysis 
evidentiary issues 
we first address the defendants evidentiary claims.both argue that the district court violated the rule of completeness when it admitted a partial application the best evidence rule when it admitted a copy of the application and federal rule of evidence,governing the admissibility of public records,when it admitted copies of the.we review the district court evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion,and affirm those rulings in all respects.united states samaniego,cir.
rule of completeness 
the rule of completeness,as set forth in federal rule of evidence,provides that w hen a writing or recorded statement or part thereof is introduced by a party,an adverse party may require the introduction at that time of any other part or any other writing or recorded statement which ought in fairness to be considered contemporaneously with it.as the supreme court has explained,under this rule the opponent,against whom a part of an utterance has been put in,may in his turn complement it by putting in the remainder,in order to secure for the tribunal a complete understanding of the total tenor and effect of the utterance.beech aircraft rainey,d internal quotations omitted.the defendants argue that the district court violated rule when it admitted into evidence only four of the twelve pages of the document.
the defendants argue that the remaining eight pages of the form,which set forth personal information about solorazano that could only have been obtained had she been actively involved in the application process,would have benefitted the defense.app.br.that might be true,but it does not render admission of the incomplete document an error.rule does not prohibit admission of an incomplete document.instead,it allows the party against whom the document is introduced to place the remainder in evidence without additional evidentiary foundation.beech aircraft,at.if the defendants wanted the remainder of the document to be admitted,they should have offered it.as this court said in worden ins,cir,i t is fundamental that one side may introduce only a part of a document or deposition in evidence,but of course it is also well recognized that the other side may later introduce more or the rest of any such document or deposition which was not introduced in evidence.
best evidence rule 
invoking the best evidence rule,the defendants also challenge the admission of an application filed on behalf of solorazano,containing what she testified to be a forged signature.the best evidence rule,set forth in federal rule of evidence,holds that t o prove the content of a writing,recording,or photograph,the original writing,recording,or photograph is required,except as otherwise provided in these rules or by act of congress.this general provision is followed by a series of rules allowing the admission of duplicates under certain circumstances,unless a genuine question is raised as to the authenticity of the original or in the circumstances it would be unfair to admit the duplicate in lieu of the original.the district court found that two of these exceptions were applicable the original could not be obtained by any available judicial process or procedure,making the copy admissible under rule,and the application was an official record admissible under rule.
the district court found that there was no genuine question as to the authenticity of the admitted copies of the application and no unfairness in their admission,dist,at in his brief,phillips argues that it was not clear how the government obtained the copy of the application that was introduced at trial,raising a question as to its authenticity.but although he objected at trial to the document admission because it was a copy,he did not make any objection to its authenticity.defense counsel specifically stated the objection is that the document is the copy and it is not the complete document.vol.v,at.that was not sufficient to raise an issue regarding its authenticity.see tyson jones laughlin steel,cir.
in any event,the government adequately established the document authenticity.solorazano identified the document as the application she received from the citizenship and immigration office,and testified that the document offered at trial was in the same condition as when she received it.there is no reason to question the district court finding that there was no genuine issue as to the authenticity of the copy,and it was appropriately admitted under federal rule.
public records 
the defendants also object to the admission of copies of four handwritten,arguing that their entry into evidence violated the rule for admission of public records.federal rule of evidence holds that 
t he contents of an official record,or of a document authorized to be recorded or filed and actually recorded or filed if otherwise admissible,may be proven by copy,certified as correct in accordance with rule or testified to be correct by a witness who has compared it with the original.if a copy which complies with the foregoing can not be obtained by the exercise of reasonable diligence,then other evidence of the contents may be given.
no government witness testified to having compared the duplicates to the original,and the copies were not certified under federal rule of evidence.therefore,to admit the documents under rule,the government was required to prove that it could not obtain the original or a compliant copy through the exercise of reasonable diligence.
in response to the defendant objection to the admission of a copy,the district court held that as of the time of trial the originals were either lost or not obtainable through the exercise of reasonable diligence or available judicial process.dist.the defendants challenge that conclusion on appeal.we review the district court decision to admit the evidence for abuse of discretion,and its factual finding that the originals were not obtainable through the exercise of reasonable diligence for clear error.see united states samaniego,cir see also united states townley,cir.we find neither clear error nor an abuse of discretion.at trial,burbridge testified that her office had such a high backlog of applications immediately following the life act deadline that they were forced to send many applications to the dallas office of the department of labor for review.many of those filed by the phillips law firm were sent to dallas.the prosecutor informed the court that the government had tried to retrieve the documents and there just no way that we can get the original back,expressing his frustration that dallas was like a black hole.burbridge testified that while she could probably retrieve an original from dallas if it was requested,it might take awhile.the district court did not abuse its discretion when it found that the government exercised reasonable diligence in its attempt to obtain an original copy,and could therefore introduce a copy instead.
b.the scope of a 
in the indictment,the government charged the defendants with eight counts of knowingly and willfully forg ing and falsely ma king a document prescribed by statute and regulation for entry into and as evidence of authorized stay and employment in the united states,in violation of a.that section provides,in relevant part 
whoever knowingly utters,uses,or possesses any such visa,permit,border crossing card,alien registration receipt card,or other document prescribed by statute or regulation for entry into or as evidence of authorized stay or employment in the united states,knowing it to be forged,counterfeited,altered,or falsely made is guilty of a felony.
relying on united states,cir,the district court held and the government argues that a applies to forgeries not only of entry documents but of documents required to be submitted as a prerequisite to receiving entry documents.the defendants,by contrast,argue that the and the applications are not other document s prescribed by statute or regulation for entry into or as evidence of authorized stay or employment in the united states,and so their convictions under this statute must be vacated.reviewing this question of statutory interpretation de novo,united states moore,cir,we agree with the defendants that the forged documents in this case are not prescribed by statute for entry into or evidence of authorized stay or employment,and vacate the convictions obtained under a.
we first look to the statute plain language to determine its meaning.united states romero,cir.section a prohibits forgery of a document prescribed by statute or regulation for entry into or as evidence of authorized stay or employment in the united states.emphasis added.as explained above,filling out the is the first out of three steps that must be completed before the alien can receive a visa under a a i.it is this visa,not the,that has been prescribed for entry into,and stay or employment within,the united states.an alien seeking to cross the border or to prove eligibility for employment would get nowhere by flashing an.an is no more a document prescribed for entry or as evidence of authorized stay or employment than an application for a credit card is a credit card.similarly,an is a form used by an individual afraid for his life to appeal for prevention of removal to his home country.it is a prerequisite for obtaining legal status,but it does not grant or prove legal status.as the dissenting judge in put the point,the and forms are simply applications,representing nothing more than the applicant his employer desire that the applicant gain the right to enter or remain in the country legally,at williams,dissenting.
this interpretation of the statutory language is reinforced by the statute enumerated examples.before using the catchall phrase other document prescribed by statute or regulation for entry into or as evidence of authorized stay or employment in the united states,the statute enumerates certain documents whose forgery is proscribed any such immigrant or nonimmigrant visa,permit,border crossing card,or alien registration receipt card.a.each of these items is a document that provides proof that the individual has legal permission to be in the country.none of the enumerated items is merely an application or other prerequisite to obtaining such permission.see a defining immigrant visa id.a defining border crossing identification card id.d defining alien registration receipt card.under the venerable interpretive canons of noscitur a sociis and ejusdem generis,the meaning of a catchall phrase is given precise content by the specific terms that precede it.see united states williams,d begay united states,d hall street,mattel,d norton utah wilderness alliance,d.an application for a permit to remain in the united states,or to reenter the united states,is different in kind than the actual authorizing document.this statute applies to the latter,not the former.
it is also significant that a separate paragraph of a,under which the defendants were not charged,holds that 
whoever knowingly makes under oath,or subscribes as true,any false statement with respect to a material fact in any application,affidavit,or other document required by the immigration laws or regulations prescribed thereunder,or knowingly presents any such application,affidavit,or other document which contains any such false statement 
is subject to criminal punishment under the statute.a emphasis added.this bolsters our conclusion that congress did not intend to punish forged applications in the section charged in the indictment.if other documents in the first paragraph were interpreted to include not only final documents,but applications as well,there would be no need for congress to include paragraph four at all,let alone the specific reference to applications.we decline to adopt a reading that renders an entire paragraph of the statute superfluous.national association of home builders defenders of wildlife,d w e have cautioned against reading a text in a way that makes part of it redundant.see also trw andrews,d.additionally,the use of application elsewhere in the statute demonstrates that congress was aware of how to punish application fraud when it so intended.united states ron pair enterprises,d.
the district court followed the fourth circuit holding in,holding that congress clearly intended in a to proscribe all types of forgery and fraud in connection with immigration documents that could be used to gain entry or as evidence of authority to stay or work in the,and that f alsely made applications of this type can be ultimately used as a means to gain unlawful entry or to support an improper claim for authorization to stay or work in the united states.dist.op.at.according to the district court,filing an and an was a critical step toward obtaining entry,and so the statute applied.with all respect to our sister circuit,as well as the district court,we do not read the statute this way.a document for entry into or as evidence of authorized stay or employment into the united states provides proof of an individual right to either be in or enter into the country.the and do not provide this verification.the document itself does not authorize entry.it does not even indicate whether the dol has certified that the alien has acquired potential employment,or whether the ins has found that the individual life really is at risk if sent away.
the government points out that in,the supreme court interpreted a prior version of a,which held liable whoever knowingly forges another document required for entry into the united states.united states,d,as not applying to counterfeit alien registration cards.the court narrowly construed the phrase required for entry,stating t he language of denotes a very special class of entry whose primary raison is the facilitation of entry into the country.id.at.the court concluded that counterfeit alien registration cards did not fall within the statute scope because,while they could be used to reenter the country,their primary purpose was to effectuate the registration requirement for all resident aliens,and not to facilitate entry.id.at.in response to the court decision,congress amended and expanded,replacing the phrase,document required for entry into the united states,with the phrase,document prescribed by statute or regulation for entry.the government argues that,because congress intended to broaden the statute,we should read the amended statute to reach all documents that facilitate the alien ability to obtain legal entry in the future.
this argument is unpersuasive for several reasons.first,we do not look to congressional intent when the statute language is plain.going behind the plain language of a statute in search of a possibly contrary congressional intent is a step to be taken cautiously even under the best of circumstances.united states locke,d internal quotations omitted.the language must be ambiguous before we will consider such intent,and here,it is not.but additionally,we believe that our interpretation comports with congressional intent.the amended language is best read to include all documents that can be used to legally enter the country,even if the document primary purpose is not to facilitate entry.there is no reason to think congress intended to bring mere applications within its reach.this reading brings the alien residency cards at issue in within the statute ambit,without encomp
