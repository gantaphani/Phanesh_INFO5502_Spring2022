defendant charles junior johnson was charged in the eastern district of virginia with,inter alia,causing the filing of a false and fraudulent document with the securities and exchange commission.after a hearing,the district court granted johnson motion to dismiss the count for lack of venue.the government now appeals that decision.
in support of the district court holding,the defendant makes two claims.first,he argues that the electronic transmission of a fraudulent document to a computer server in alexandria,virginia,does not constitute a act.second,he contends that because he could not have reasonably foreseen that the form would be transmitted to the eastern district of virginia,venue can not lie in that district.
based on the plain language and underlying purposes of the governing venue provision,we reject both of these claims and find that the eastern district of virginia was an appropriate venue for this securities fraud offense.we thus reverse the district court dismissal of the aforementioned count for lack of venue.
this case arises from the prosecution of a corporate executive for securities fraud and other related offenses.on january,a federal grand jury in the eastern district of virginia returned a count indictment against johnson and five one of the counts,count,charged johnson with causing the filing of false and fraudulent documents with the securities and exchange commission sec in violation of b,and.specifically,it alleged that johnson caused his company to submit an sec form that contained fraudulently inflated revenue figures.
johnson was the chief executive officer and chairman of the board of directors of,purchasepro,a company based in las vegas,nevada,that sold internet procurement software designed to facilitate transactions online.in march,purchasepro established a commercial partnership with america online,to develop a marketplace.according to the indictment,johnson took personal control of purchasepro relationship with aol and subsequently worked to inflate purchasepro reported revenue figures.the government alleges that this was accomplished through various devices,including secret and undisclosed side deals,the use of contracts,and false entries in the company books and records.
under federal rules and regulations,purchasepro was required to file a quarterly revenue report,known as a form,with the sec.on may,purchasepro electronically submitted a form,containing its financial results for the first quarter of,to the sec through the electronic data gathering,analysis,and retrieval system edgar.according to the indictment,the filed documents contained false,misleading,and inflated revenue numbers.notably,edgar management office of information and technology and the system computer servers,which store the transmitted files and make them publicly available through the edgar website,are located in alexandria,virginia,in the eastern district of virginia.the transmission to the edgar servers represents johnson lone contact with the eastern district for the purposes of this offense.
after he was indicted in the eastern district for causing the fraudulent submission,johnson moved to have the count dismissed for lack of venue.specifically,he argued that the eastern district of virginia was an improper venue under,the applicable venue provision for securities fraud offenses.on may,the district court held a hearing to consider the motion,and on october,it issued an order granting the motion to dismiss count for lack of venue.
two days later,johnson trial on the counts began.the district court later declared a mistrial,and on november,the government filed a timely notice of appeal of the dismissal of count.this court has jurisdiction pursuant to.
we review briefly the relevant venue standards.the constitution has two provisions governing venue for criminal cases.article iii provides that criminal trials shall be held in the state where the said crimes shall have been committed.const.art.iii,cl.similarly,the sixth amendment requires that i n all criminal prosecutions,the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial,by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed.const.amend.vi.these constitutional safeguards are meant to protect the defendant from bias,disadvantage,and inconvenience in the adjudication of the charges against him.united states ebersole,cir see also united states smith,cir.
in accordance with these constitutional principles,congress may,if it so desires,prescribe specific venue requirements for a particular crime.if congress adopts such a statute,that provision must be honored assuming,of course,that it satisfies the constitutional minima.united states salinas,cir.if congress does not supply a specific venue provision,then venue is to be determined from the nature of the crime alleged and the location of the act or acts constituting it.ebersole,at quoting united states cabrales,d.it is that there may be more than one appropriate venue,or even a venue in which the defendant has never set foot,so long as it meets the relevant constitutional and statutory requirements.ebersole,at quoting united states bowens,cir.the government bears the burden of proving venue by a preponderance of the evidence.see ebersole,at.
for securities offenses,congress has provided a specific venue provision any criminal proceeding may be brought in the district wherein any act or transaction constituting the violation occurred.it is undisputed that this provision applies to count and thus governs the issue at hand.the controversy in this case centers on whether the facts alleged in the indictment satisfy the requirements of this specific venue provision.
johnson first argues that venue can not lie in the eastern district of virginia because the electronic transmission of the form to the edgar servers in alexandria,virginia,did not constitute a material part of the alleged offense.see in re aes.sec,d,holding that a act under need not constitute the core of the alleged violation,nor even be illegal,so long as it represents more than an immaterial part of the alleged violation quoting,fuqua inv,see also first fed.sav.loan of pittsburgh oppenheim,appel,dixon,finding that any act in the forum district which helps to accomplish a securities law violation is sufficient to establish venue under.
the essence of the charged crime,johnson asserts,is filing a fraudulent form with the sec in washington,not its servers in alexandria.moreover,the fact the sec channels the form to its edgar office for its own administrative ministerial purposes is of no substantial consequence and can not constitute a basis for venue.brief of appellee at citing united states bezmalinovic.holding that venue for a bank fraud offense was inappropriate in a district where the only contacts were a bank ministerial actions.thus,while johnson concedes venue may lie in the district of columbia,he argues that it can not lie in the eastern district of virginia.
we can not accept johnson contention.we therefore hold that causing the transmission of the form to the eastern district of virginia will suffice to sustain venue in that district.the notion that venue in securities prosecutions must be limited to where the essence of the offense exists finds no basis in the text of.to the contrary,this provision,whose language is manifestly broad,see aes,d at,simply requires that any act or transaction constituting the violation have taken place in the pertinent district,emphasis added.as a result,the act need not constitute the core of the alleged violation,but merely one that is material to the charged offense.aes,d at.
under that standard,causing the transmission of a false form to the eastern district of virginia satisfies the requirements set forth in.the violation with which johnson is charged is causing the filing of fraudulent documents with the sec.it is undisputed that the documents at issue were electronically transmitted to the eastern district of virginia and filed with the sec through edgar.moreover,this process was part of the sec normal course of business,see ebersole,at,as all such documents are filed,stored,and d
