a jury convicted flavio perez of two counts of filing false federal income tax returns.the district court sentenced perez to months imprisonment.perez appeals,claiming that the district court violated his right to be present at trial by conducting a jury instruction conference in his absence.he also challenges the district court failure to provide a jury instruction on the government net worth and expenditure method of proof,its limitation on expert testimony,and the sufficiency of the evidence.we affirm.
flavio perez ran a drywall installation company called chateau drywall,and a related sole proprietorship.the sole proprietorship received income from chateau drywall and in turn the sole proprietorship distributed payments to perez and other drywall installers who were classified as independent contractors.perez reported the income from the sole proprietorship on his schedule 
in and,perez declared on his federal income tax return filed jointly with his wife,sara bello total income of and,respectively.the income tax returns were prepared by tax preparers urbaldo rojas and arthur rubalcaba based on information bello and perez provided them.
the government believed that perez had purposely his income and charged him in a information with filing false individual federal tax returns in violation of perez pleaded not guilty and proceeded to trial.at trial,the government sought to prove its case using the net worth and expenditure method net worth method.under the net worth method,an individual actual income is estimated by comparing his net worth at the beginning of the tax year to his net worth at the end of the tax year,taking into account expenditures for basic living expenses and any sources of assets such as gifts,inheritances,and loans.see holland united states.explaining the net worth method of proof.
the government presented evidence that on december,perez net worth was approximately,that during,he had expenditures of about,and that by the end of the year his net worth increased to.because perez had reported income of only for,the government expert concluded that to increase his net worth by as much as he did in perez had unreported income of more than.for,the government expert determined that perez net worth increased from to,and that he had expenditures of approximately.because perez had reported income of only for,the government expert concluded that to increase his net worth by as much as he did in perez had unreported income of more than.
at trial,the government also presented evidence that perez gave clients discounts for cash jobs,paid some of his independent contractors in cash,and did not inform his usually provided the tax preparers with the financial information used to prepare the tax some of the jobs.additionally,the government presented evidence that perez provided the tax preparers with a list of deductions,without any supporting documentation,exceeding by more than the amount of deductions they had calculated using business records bello gave them.
perez presented his own expert witness who challenged numerous aspects of the government calculation of perez income under the net worth method.perez also elicited testimony from his expert that the net worth method is not the most accurate or reliable method for determining taxable income.the most accurate and reliable would be the specific items method that was mentioned by the government expert.the government objected to perez expert expressing general criticisms of the method and asked that the expert testimony be limited to specific criticisms about how the net worth method was applied in perez case.at side bar,the district court stated,h e just opined that the net worth analysis itself is somehow unreliable.what the basis of that opinion perez attorney responded based on his experience.the district court responded,no,and the prosecutor then said we would move to strike that.the district court then stated 
yes.you can render an can testify in the form of opinion if the testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data,the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods,and the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts.what testimony is he going to offer that would supply the data or facts to support that opinion,and what principles or methodology did he use to result to arrive at that opinion 
rather than respond to the district court questions,perez trial counsel stated,i just move on.the district court responded no,no,to which perez attorney said,we withdraw it.the district court then responded no.we going to sustain the objection,and i instruct them to disregard.perez attorney responded absolutely,judge.the court so instructed the jury.
bello also testified she testified that they had provided rojas and rubalcaba all relevant information and had relied on the tax professionals to prepare accurate income tax returns.bello explained that she had informed rojas and rubalcaba that perez had received a piece of land in payment of a business debt and that,unbeknownst to the perezes,rojas and rubalcaba had neglected to include that income on perez tax return.
after the close of evidence,the district court met with the attorneys in open court to discuss jury instructions.perez,however,was not present for this conference.the government offered a jury instruction explaining the net worth method,but perez attorney stated that the defense did not want the jury provided with a net worth instruction because by explaining the net worth method to the jury,i t basically the stamp of approval by the court.he also stated that perez defense was to challenge the accuracy and completeness of the net worth method.
the following day the judge revisited the issue,but perez was also absent for this conference.the judge began by noting that perez has the right to instruct the jury on the net worth method.the court then asked perez attorney d o you wish to give the instruction he responded no,your honor,we do not.the court then added you understand that you have an absolute right to give it,and you understand that if you offered such an instruction,i would give it.again,perez attorney responded yes,your honor,i do.the court further clarified perez intent by asking in representing your client,you choose to follow a strategy that would not include giving this instruction perez attorney responded correct,your honor.the assistant united states attorney at this point noted that perez was not present and the court followed up by asking perez attorney have you discussed this with your client as well perez attorney replied i have discussed it with him.i have discussed it in terms of explaining tolbert of course,and i will confirm this when he gets here.and if you would like,we can put it back on the record that i now explicitly told him that.the court decided instead to direct perez attorney to inform him of the court comments and to tell perez the court would give the instruction if he desired.the court then noted that at the completion of the closing arguments,if you do approach me and say you want the instruction given,i deem you to have waived whatever rights you have on behalf of your client with his concurrence to the giving of that instruction.is that fair enough and perez attorney responded fair enough,your honor.
after closing arguments,perez attorney did not ask for the net worth method instruction,and it was not given.the jury convicted perez on both counts,and the district court sentenced him to months imprisonment on count one and eleven months imprisonment on count two,to run consecutively.perez appeals.
on appeal,perez presents four challenges to his conviction.first,he argues that the district court violated his right under federal rule of criminal procedure to be present at trial by conducting the jury instruction conference in his absence.second,perez challenges the district court failure to provide a jury instruction on the government net worth method of proof.third,he argues the district court improperly barred his expert witness testimony concerning general flaws in the net worth method.finally,perez claims that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction.we address each issue in turn.
federal rule of criminal procedure 
perez first argues that the district court violated his rights under rule to be present at trial by conducting the jury instruction conference in his absence.rule provides that the defendant shall be present at every stage of the trial including the impaneling of the jury and the return of the verdict and at the imposition of sentence,except as otherwise provided by this rule.a.rule b,however,provides that a defendant need not be present when t he proceedings involve only a conference or hearing on a question of law.the government claims that because jury instructions concern questions of law,perez was not entitled to be at the jury instruction conference.perez responds that because the issue of whether to give the net worth instruction concerned a question of strategy rather than of law,he had the right to be at the conference.
perez argument is misplaced.courts are not in the business of holding hearings to oversee or approve a defendant trial strategy they hold hearings to address legal or factual issues or sometimes both or to establish case management schedules.true,trial courts often inquire into strategy to establish that waivers are knowing and voluntary and to preserve judicial resources by avoiding the potential for reversible error or collateral attack.but a court inquiry into a defendant strategy does not alter the purpose of the conference,which in this case was to determine the appropriate jury instructions.the content of jury instructions is a question of law,and as such the jury instruction conference,assuming arguendo it was a stage of trial,fell within the rule b exception for a conference or hearing on a question of law.united states rivera,cir the content of the instructions to be given to the jury is purely a legal matter,and a conference to discuss those instructions is thus a conference on a question of law at which a defendant need not be present.internal citations omitted united states sherman,cir we hold that a hearing outside the presence of the jury concerning the selection of jury instructions is a conference or argument upon a question of law united states graves,cir a defendant does not have a federal constitutional or statutory right to attend a conference between the trial court and counsel concerned with the purely legal matter of determining what jury instructions the trial court will issue.
perez also argues that because his trial attorney objected to the government net worth instruction based on strategy and not the law,rule required the district court to inform perez of the discussions that occurred during the jury instruction conference and ask perez his position on the issue.again,perez position is misplaced.while a defendant 
has ultimate authority to make certain fundamental decisions regarding the case,as to whether to plead guilty,waive a jury,testify in his or her own behalf,or take an appeal the remaining decisions are in the hands of counsel.it could hardly be otherwise,unless trials are to be indefinitely extended as judges ask the defendant whether each decision or omission meets with his pleasure.the process would be worse than cumbersome.it would undermine the defendant ability to entrust decisions to a legally trained person.
united states boyd,cir.
the right to specific jury instructions is one of those remaining decisions that rests in the hands of the attorney.thus,this court rejected the argument that a defendant must personally waive jury instructions in united states griffin,cir,holding 
the right to object to jury instructions on appeal is waived if the record illustrates that the defendant approved of the instructions at issue.we do not require the defendant personally to waive objection,nor is the district court required to address the waiver question directly to the defendant.the waiver must,however,arise out of voluntary affirmative conduct,consistent with the proactive description of waiver in johnson,at intentional relinquishment or abandonment.
griffin then concluded that the defendant waived any objection to the jury instructions when h is counsel explicitly confirmed the district court belief that the defendants would prefer instruction.id.see also united states babul,cir explaining that some rights are so important that only a defendant may personally waive them,but b y contrast,choices about trial practice and a given witness testimony be presented should a hearsay objection be made what language should be proposed for the jury instructions are committed to counsel,not only because they are numerous asking the defendant each time would be impractical but also because they are the sort of choices for which legal training and experience are most helpful emphasis added.
similarly,in this case,while it would have been relatively easy and prudent for the district court to obtain perez personal waiver on the record,the court was not required to address the jury instructions directly with perez.
net worth jury instruction 
next,perez argues that the district court failure to provide the net worth method instruction constitutes plain error which requires reversal of his conviction.this court has held that the complete lack of any instruction on the nature of the net worth method and its concomitant assumptions and inferences affects a substantial right of the accused and constitutes plain error and requires a reversal despite the lack of an objection by the defendant to such omission.tolbert,at.but while we may use plain error review to correct serious errors despite a defendant failure to object,such review can not be used for the purpose of revoking an otherwise valid waiver.united states lakich,cir.and here,perez unquestionably waived his right to the net worth instruction his attorney did not merely fail to object to the instruction,but rather insisted that the instruction not be given,even after having been expressly informed of the right to the instruction and that the court would deem the right waived because perez waived the right to the net worth instruction,there was no error.babul,at waiver means that there was no error even review is unavailable.boyd,at but steps the court takes at the defendant behest are not reversible,because they are not error even the plain error doctrine does not ride to the rescue when the choice has been made deliberately,and the right in question has been waived rather than forfeited.
moreover,even if perez had not waived the issue,he could not establish plain error because the lack of the net worth instruction in this case was harmless.see united states olano,d holding that under plain error review,the question of prejudice is the same as the harmless error analysis,except that here,the defendant bears the burden of persuasion with respect to prejudice.the reason the net worth instruction is so imperative is that the method requires assumptions,among which is the equation of unexplained increases in net worth with unreported taxable income.obviously such an assumption has many weaknesses.it may be that gifts,inheritances,loans and the like account for the newly acquired wealth.holland,at.thus,without guarding instruction,there is a great danger that the jury may assume that once the government has established the figures in its net worth computations,the crime of tax evasion automatically follows.id.at.but in this case there was absolutely no evidence that perez had inflows which could explain the increase in his net worth.accordingly,the failure to provide a net worth instruction would be harmless in any event.
expert testimony 
perez next argues that the district court erred in prohibiting his expert from testifying concerning flaws in the net worth method.however,as the trial transcript excerpted above makes clear,see supra at,after the government objected to perez attorney eliciting testimony from his expert on general flaws in the net worth method,perez attorney voluntarily abandoned this line of questioning.therefore,perez waived any challenge to the district court ruling.united states wilkins,cir holding that defendant in withdrawing his m
