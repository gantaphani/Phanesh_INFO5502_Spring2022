in what appears to be an ongoing trend,we again encounter a member of the oakley country club oakley,a private institution located in watertown,massachusetts,answering to criminal securities fraud charges on this occasion,a jury convicted robert bray of illegal insider trading after he received material,nonpublic information about a local bank from a fellow oakley member and then used that information to make a substantial trading profit.on appeal,bray insists that we set aside his conviction because the government presented insufficient evidence to support the jury verdict.bray also maintains that the trial court instructions allowed the jury to convict him without finding that he possessed the necessary mental state.see a requiring the government to prove that a defendant willfully violated the securities laws in order to sustain a criminal conviction.after careful review,we reject bray arguments and affirm his conviction.
facts background 
we recite the facts in the light most favorable to the jury verdict,reserving the detailed treatment of some points for later in this opinion.mcphail,at.bray and john patrick first met each other as members at oakley,a private establishment that provides tennis,swimming,golf,and other social activities to its members.though the disparity in their respective golf skills meant bray,a contractor and developer,and,an executive at eastern bank eastern,rarely played together,the two men often socialized with each other in oakley pub room and dined on occasion with one another at nearby bars and restaurants.over time,bray or bubba,as called him got to know family as well.he took a particular liking to son,matthew for example,bray gifted matthew his first set of golf clubs as a child,attended his high school graduation party at house,and gave him a check as a graduation present.bray later helped matthew get an internship with an architect,hired matthew to prepare architectural drawings for one of his own projects,and served as a reference when matthew applied for a job at a restaurant.
though bray and generally maintained a social relationship,the pair discussions occasionally drifted toward their professional lives,for instance,had some of bray associates refurbish the basement and roof at his house,while bray often asked for stock market and investment advice.in particular,bray leaned on professional experience and regularly asked him about what bank stocks he liked.always answered these questions by advising bray,based on information,to invest in small community banks that were likely merger or targets.
on june,however,and bray had a decidedly different conversation.while they were sitting together in the oakley pub room,just the two of them,bray said to that he needed to make a big score in order to help fund one of his real estate projects the watertown project and asked if had any bank stock tips for him.according to,bray had never sought a big score from him before or,for that matter,requested advice based on an express need for money,as he had done in the past,rattled off the names of several local banks.however,this time also took a napkin,penned the word wainwright on it,and slid it across the bar toward bray.as he did so,told bray that t his could be a good one,or at least something to that effect.bray wordlessly took the napkin,slipped it into his pocket,and did not mention or ask about its contents for the rest of the night.
at the time,knew that wainwright bank trust wainwright,a local,bank,had put itself up for sale.this information was nonpublic and eastern,employer,had told to perform due diligence on wainwright since it was a potential takeover candidate.before starting that task,had signed an agreement with eastern that required him to keep any nonpublic information he learned about wainwright confidential.did not explicitly inform bray about this agreement or the source of his wainwright tip.
when queried at trial as to why he had given bray this tip,answered 
i do know to this day,although i did want to help out bray,he had done stuff for me in the past and for my family and here was an opportunity for me to return the favor.i looked up to bray and i figured that doing this would enhance our relationship,he would think more highly of me.
then,when questioned about whether he expected bray to return the favor someday,replied 
well,we friends and that what friends do,they take care of each other.i did expect anything at that exact time,but down the road he did offer me an interest in the watertown project.
the day after receiving the tip,bray called his broker,e trade,to place an order for shares of wainwright stock.evidence at trial suggested that the size of bray trade was most unusual,as at the time of bray order,wainwright was a stock with an average daily trading volume of around to shares.when an e trade representative pointed out wainwright relative illiquidity,bray acknowledged that the trade might be crazy.nonetheless,bray proceeded to place the order,though the broker did manage to convince him to structure the trade as a limit order which spread the trade execution over multiple days.over the next two weeks,bray did two things.first,he liquidated a vast portion of his existing portfolio,generating approximately.second,he bought wainwright shares,which amounted to of the stock total trading volume between june and june.by that point,wainwright shares comprised around of bray securities portfolio.
on june,eastern publicly announced an agreement to acquire wainwright for per share,almost double the previous day closing price.after the announcement,bray met in the oakley parking lot,thanked him for the tip,and offered to bring into the watertown project.although bray had never previously offered an opportunity to invest in any of his projects,nevertheless declined the invitation on this first opportunity.when bray sold his shares under the terms of the acquisition agreement in november,he netted approximately.
before bray sold his shares,received an email from eastern legal department stating that the financial industry regulatory authority finra,a organization that regulates professionals and firms in the securities industry,had initiated an investigation into the trading activity in wainwright stock that occurred immediately before the june announcement.a list of individuals and companies accompanied the investigatory notice.finra asked eastern to circulate the list to its officers and directors if any eastern officer or director recognized a name on the list,finra requested that the bank advise it of the nature of the relationship between the employee and the listed name.finra also asked that the bank tell it whether any communications among those parties had taken place before the wainwright announcement.
seeing bray name on the list,panicked and rushed to oakley to look for him.on finding bray,stressed that he could lose his job over this.bray tried to calm down by assuring that he had not told anybody about the tip and that if the regulators c a me around asking questions,he would have them wishing that they had bought wainwright stock.
on august,the securities and exchange commission sec filed a civil insider trading action against and bray.bray initially filed a pro se answer where he denied receiving any tip from,and later insisted in his answers to the sec first set of interrogatories that he had bought wainwright shares because of the bank policies and good dividends.he later admitted that both these things were untrue,but asserted that had passed him the wainwright tip unprompted.
on december,the government charged bray with criminal securities fraud in violation of b and a,and conspiracy to commit securities fraud in violation of.at the close of his trial,the district court instructed the jury on the elements of both offenses.as relevant here,the court told the jury that in order to convict bray of securities fraud,it needed to find that he knew or under all the circumstances should have known that had breached a duty of confidentiality by giving him the wainwright tip.alternatively,the district court told the jury that it could find that bray possessed the requisite knowledge if he had willfully blinded himself to breach that is,if under all the circumstances a reasonable person in bray shoes would certainly have known that this information was being passed to him in violation of a duty of confidentiality.
on january,the jury convicted bray of committing securities fraud,but acquitted him of the conspiracy charge.the district court then sentenced bray to months in prison,followed by months of supervised release,and imposed a million fine.
ii.discussion 
the unlawful trading in securities based on material,nonpublic information,or illegal insider trading,is a violation of section b of the securities exchange act of and the securities and exchange commission rule.see united states salman,united states,dirks sec,chiarella united states,sec texas gulf sulphur,cir.en banc.in this case,the government premised bray prosecution on the misappropriation theory of insider trading liability.this theory posits that individuals entrusted with confidential information about a corporation can not secretly us e such information for their personal advantage,even when they do not owe any direct fiduciary duty to that corporation or its shareholders.salman,at.instead,those entrusted with such information have a duty to abstain from trading in that corporation securities or they must disclose the information ahead of time.id.thus,these individuals commit a fraud in connection with a securities transaction,and thereby violate b and rule,when they misappropriate confidential information for securities trading purposes,in breach of a duty to the source of the information,at.
the misappropriation theory can also apply when the misappropriator does not trade,but instead obtains a benefit by revealing the information to a third person who trades based on the misappropriated information.mcphail,at.in these tipping situations,the third person,or tippee,inherits the misappropriator,or tipper,duty if the tippee knows the information was disclosed in breach of the tipper duty and may commit securities fraud by trading in disregard of that knowledge.salman,at.liability therefore hinges on whether the tipper breached a duty of trust and confidence by disclosing the inside information,which in turn depends on whether the tipper personally will benefit,directly or indirectly,from the disclosure.dirks,at see also parigian,at stating that the personal benefit analysis seem s to call for the same answer in both a civil and criminal proceeding 
bray admits that he traded based on material,nonpublic information about wainwright,that owed eastern a duty of loyalty and confidentiality,at,and that breached this duty by giving the wainwright information to him.still,bray maintains that the government presented insufficient evidence proving that expected a personal benefit in exchange for the wainwright tip,that he knew anticipated such a benefit in exchange for the tip,or that he knew had breached a fiduciary duty by giving him the tip.bray also insists that the trial court plainly erred by instructing the jury that it could convict him if he should have known that had an obligation to keep the wainwright information confidential.he similarly claims that the trial court wrongly equated the concept of willful blindness,an alternative theory on which the government could prove bray knowledge,with negligence.we address each argument in turn.
sufficiency of the evidence claims 
this court reviews sufficiency of evidence challenges de novo.united states,cir.while doing so,we draw all reasonable inferences in the verdict favor.united states,cir.thus,i f a reasonable jury could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of all elements of the charged offense,we must affirm the conviction.united states,cir.d efendants challenging the sufficiency of the evidence face an uphill battle.united states,cir.quoting united states seng tan,cir.this battle,as it turns out,bray can not win.
tipping motivations 
to start,trial testimony provided a sufficient basis for the jury to infer that gave bray the wainwright tip with the purpose of obtaining a personal benefit.see dirks,at.when evaluating whether a tipper derived a personal benefit from his or her tip,we focus on objective criteria,whether the insider receives a direct or indirect personal benefit from the disclosure,such as a pecuniary gain or a reputational benefit that will translate into future earnings.id.at.however,a personal benefit can often be inferred where a relationship between the tipper and the recipient suggests a quid pro quo from the latter,or an intention to benefit the particular recipient.id.at see also sargent,at the benefit to the tipper need not be specific or tangible.quoting sec warde,cir.a personal benefit can likewise be inferred where a tipper makes a gift of inside information to a trading relative or friend.salman,at quoting dirks,at see also rocklage,at stating that the mere giving of a gift to a relative or friend is a sufficient personal benefit.
bray argues that an informational exchange between casual,as opposed to close,friends does not meet dirks personal benefit requirement without some other evidence of a quid pro quo exchange here,bray claims that the evidence at trial did not establish either that he and enjoyed a close relationship or that gave him the wainwright advice as a quid pro quo in expectation of a future benefit.these arguments,however,amount to an attack on the credibility of the witnesses who testified against him.as we have often stated,it is not the appellate court function to weigh the evidence or make credibility judgments,united states ortiz,cir.instead,we leave it to the jury to choose between varying interpretations of the evidence.see also,at testimony from even just one witness can support a conviction.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
to that end,testimony showed that it is at least plausible that he and bray had a close relationship.see ortiz,at.claimed that he and bubba were good friends who,at the time of the wainwright tip,had known each other for fifteen years.the two men often socialized with each other at the club,dined with each other at local bars and restaurants,and even took each other counsel.bray bond with matthew,son,similarly demonstrated that bray knew well enough to extend favors to extended family.in other words,the government presented enough evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude that bray and had a close relationship,and not one that was of a casual or social nature.newman,at see also sargent,at concluding that there was sufficient evidence from which a jury could conclude that a tipper benefitted by tipping,in part because the tipper and tippee were friendly,had done favors for each other in the past,and enjoyed relationships with one another extended families.
testimony also provided a sufficient basis for the jury to conclude that he disclosed the tip in expectation of a personal benefit.though initially testified that he did not know why he had given bray the wainwright tip,he then immediately said that he figured the tip would enhance his reputation with bray.while did not expect anything at the exact time he gave bray the tip,a reasonable jury could infer that he expected a benefit down the road.see united states riley,supp,the precise exchange need not be known by the parties at the time of the tip,aff,app x cir,cert.denied.bray later offers to bring into the watertown project for free further show that these expectations were warranted.
it bears emphasizing that our holding on this front is a narrow one.we need not determine,for instance,how close a relationship must be before a jury can infer a personal benefit.instead,we simply hold that the record evidence of and bray friendship,coupled with testimony that the tip might lead to certain future benefits,provided a sufficient basis for a reasonable jury to conclude that acted in expectation of a personal benefit.see parigian,at stating that anticipation of a personal benefit in return for a breach of duty surely suffices.
bray knowledge of anticipation of a benefit and fiduciary breach 
liability for securities fraud also requires proof t
