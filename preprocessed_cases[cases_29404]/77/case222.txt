jack straw owned and operated an insurance business in which he acted as a financial advisor,maintained trust accounts,and sold annuities and insurance policies to his clients.straw operated several fraudulent schemes in conjunction with his business.during the relevant period straw took more than in client funds which he claimed to invest in stocks,but which he actually used for his own purposes or to pay prior victims in order to conceal his fraud straw sold real property that he did not have permission from the owners to sell and kept the in purchase money straw forged client signatures on checks straw used a client bank account to make automatic payments of sixteen dollars per month on a life insurance policy for his on which his daughter was named beneficiary and straw held a financial planning seminar in which he offered to prepare wills for participants for a fee of per will.he collected money but never prepared the wills.straw defrauded a couple from that seminar of approximately in his annuities scheme.most of the money given to straw by his clients remains unaccounted for.
on december,straw was charged in a information four counts of wire fraud in violation of,one count of mail fraud in violation of,one count of making,possessing,and uttering a forged security,in violation of a,and one count of money laundering,in violation of.straw pleaded guilty to all charges.the district court found straw base offense level under the united states sentencing guidelines manual to be seven and imposed an increase for an intended loss of,a increase because the offenses involved more than fifty victims,a increase because one or more of the victims were vulnerable victims,and a increase for abusing a position of trust.straw was awarded a reduction for acceptance of responsibility.the district court found straw criminal history category to be i,and,using an offense level of thirty,calculated an advisory guidelines range of months.after considering straw request for a downward variance and all the a sentencing factors,the district court varied upward and imposed a sentence of months imprisonment followed by three years of supervised release and in mandatory special assessments.this timely appeal followed.
straw first challenges the district court decision to hear the testimony of straw cousin at the sentencing hearing.several victims testified at straw sentencing hearing in the midst of the testimony,straw cousin jodie hansen gave a brief statement indicating straw had defrauded their grandmother and had not come to see their grandmother the day she died.straw was charged with intentionally misappropriating the grandmother property in but the district attorney dropped the charges.
because straw failed to object to hansen testimony at the sentencing hearing,we review under the plain error standard.see united states shepard,cir united states montayne,cir en banc.straw argues his cousin should not have been permitted to testify because she is not a crime victim entitled to a right to be heard at public proceedings under the crime victim rights act.e.this provision defines a crime victim as a person directly and proximately harmed as the result of the commission of a federal offense.id.even though a grants a crime victim the right to be heard at public proceedings,the statute does not operate to exclude others from being heard at such proceedings.congress has provided that n o limitation shall be placed on the information concerning the background,character,and conduct of a person convicted of an offense which a court of the united states may receive and consider for the purpose of imposing an appropriate sentence.furthermore,in sentencing,a judge may appropriately conduct an inquiry broad in scope,largely unlimited either as to the kind of information he may consider,or the source from which it may come united states,cir quoting united states tucker,emphasis added.therefore it was not plain error for the district court to hear hansen statement because the statement concerned straw background,character,and conduct.
straw further contends the district court improperly considered hansen testimony as a victim impact statement.while the court and the prosecutor did refer to the cousin as a victim in passing,it is clear all parties were aware of who she was and who she represented.the district court spoke at length to explain the sentence and did not mention the prior conduct related to straw grandmother.we conclude the district court did not erroneously consider the cousin statement as victim impact testimony.
straw next challenges the district court enhancement of his offense level by four levels because his offense involved fifty or more victims.he contends the district court erred by counting the victims of his uncharged scheme and by counting each married couple as two victims.we review the district court interpretation and application of the guidelines de novo and its finding of fact for clear error.united states icaza,cir.section b of the sentencing guidelines provides if the offense b involved or more victims,increase by levels section,application note,defines victim as any person who sustained any part of the actual loss determined under subsection b person includes individuals,corporations,companies,associations,firms,partnerships,societies,and joint stock companies.
straw contends the district court incorrectly counted as victims the twenty people he defrauded in his scheme for the purposes of the b enhancement because the nature of the offense against those victims was different and because many of his egregious behaviors did not apply to those victims.a provides all acts or omissions that were part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction may be considered as factors that determine the guidelines range.offenses may qualify as part of the same course of conduct if they are sufficiently connected or related to each other as to warrant the conclusion that they are part of a single episode,spree,or ongoing series of offenses,application.in united states lewis,cir quoting united states derosier,cir,we stated that we take a broad view of what conduct and related loss amounts can be included in calculating loss,and we applied the same reasoning to a calculation of victims,rejecting a defendant contention that only victims named in the indictment should be counted for the purposes of b b.see also united states branch,cir considering testimony from victims of several of the defendant fraudulent schemes for the purposes of a.b b enhancement.
straw routinely used his financial seminars to meet and develop relationships with potential victims and to determine whether they possessed assets he could steal.once he found the assets,straw used one or more of his schemes to defraud his new clients.straw operated according to this pattern in,when he met twenty new potential victims at one of his financial planning seminars.straw falsely promised these individuals and couples he would provide wills for.straw collected their money and never provided wills,and he proceeded to defraud one of these couples out of nearly using his annuity scheme.given the fact that the victims of straw scheme overlapped with the victims of other schemes,and that straw used those seminars to find new victims for his other crimes and assess their financial situations,it was not clearly erroneous for the district court to determine they were part of the same course of conduct.therefore,the district court properly counted the twenty victims when it applied b.
