opinion of the court 
a indictment the indictment charges that from to united states senator robert menendez of new jersey solicited and accepted numerous gifts from his friend salomon melgen,a ophthalmologist.in exchange,senator menendez allegedly used the power of his office to influence,among other things,an enforcement action against melgen by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms and to encourage the state department and the customs and border patrol customs to intervene on melgen behalf in a multimillion dollar contract dispute with the dominican republic.
senator menendez appeals from the denial of his motions to dismiss the indictment.he argues that,as a united states senator,he is protected from prosecution under the speech or debate clause of our constitution.const.art.i,cl.though it states literally that members of congress shall not be questioned in any other place for any speech or debate in either house,its protections extend to legislative acts that members perform.senator menendez contends that protected acts form the basis of the indictment.he claims also that count of the indictment which charges him with knowingly or willfully falsifying,concealing,or covering up gifts from melgen in violation of the ethics in government act of the ethics act,app,and must be dismissed because it allows other branches of government to intrude on legislative branch matters a claim and was brought in the wrong venue new jersey instead of where it belonged the district of columbia.we conclude that senator menendez purportedly legislative acts are not protected by the speech or debate clause and that the indictment is not otherwise deficient.thus we affirm.
background 
senator menendez,and melgen dispute with cms 
at the stage,we generally accept as true the factual allegations in an indictment.see united states huet,cir.our statement of facts is therefore drawn from the indictment except where it is noted as drawn from evidence in the record.
in cms suspected that melgen had overbilled medicare for million from to by engaging in a prohibited practice known as.medicare policy required that each patient receiving the drug lucentis be treated using a separate vial,but melgen routinely used the extra solution from a single vial overfill to treat multiple patients.because he was reimbursed as if he used a separate vial for each patient,cms believed melgen was paid for more vials of the drug than he actually used.
before cms began formal proceedings against melgen,senator menendez instructed his legislative assistant to call the doctor about a medicare problem we need to help him with.indict.the legislative assistant replied that she and the senator deputy chief of staff called melgen twice and were looking into how they could be helpful.id.indict.alteration in original.after cms formally notified melgen that it may seek reimbursement for the suspected overbilling,the senator deputy chief of staff emailed the legislative assistant,i think we have to weigh in on melgen behalf to say they ca make him pay retroactively.indict.
senator menendez staff continued to work with melgen lobbyist on the cms dispute and eventually arranged for the senator to speak with jonathan blum,the then acting principal deputy administrator and director of cms.before that conversation,an official from the united states department of health and human services hhs wrote blum,we have a bit of a situation with senator menendez,who is advocating on behalf of a physician friend of his in florida.indict.meanwhile,senator menendez legislative assistant drafted talking points for the senator that,along with statements about policy,included statements like i was contacted by melgen regarding an audit by first coast,the medicare administrative contractor in florida,and i am not weighing in on how you should administer lucentis,nor on how his specific audit should be resolved but rather am asking you to consider the confusing and unclear policy on this issue and not punish him retroactively as a result.indict.ultimately,the conversation between senator menendez and blum did not resolve melgen dispute with cms.the following month,after more developments in the case,the senator noted that melgen was still in the non litigant stage and directed his chief of staff to determine who has the best juice at cms and hhs.indict.
almost three years later,in june,senator menendez discussed with marilyn tavenner,the administrator of cms.there is some evidence in the record suggesting that senator menendez and tavenner met to discuss her nomination to become the permanent administrator of cms.for example,the senator calendar noted that they were meeting about tavenner nomination before the senate finance committee.however,there is no evidence suggesting that her nomination was actually discussed when they met.see tavenner martino.
to prepare for the meeting,the senator met with melgen lobbyist.a handwritten note for senator menendez mentioned melgen and his lobbyist by name and reminded the senator to m ake the larger policy case to tavenner.on the other side,blum alerted tavenner to senator menendez interest in melgen case.
once together,senator menendez pressed tavenner about and advocated on behalf of the position favorable to melgen in his medicare billing dispute with cms.contemporaneous notes reported that senator menendez and tavenner discussed cms policy but made no mention of melgen or his case.
a call between senator menendez and tavenner took place a few weeks later.before the call,melgen lobbyist prepared a memorandum entitled talking points cms policy and shared it with the senator staff,who incorporated it into a separate memorandum prepared for senator menendez.indict.the latter memorandum noted that t he subject of the call wa s to discuss the issue of medicare reimbursement when a physician from a single dose vial,but it also made several references to melgen case,such as w e talking about payments made in and i t clear that cms is taking steps to clarify both from vials and overfills going forward.this is,in effect,admitting that these policies did exist before and do apply during the period.therefore they do have any bearing on the issue at hand.indict.to the government,the issue at hand was melgen.
during the call,tavenner said cms would not alter its position on and senator menendez threatened to raise the issue of directly with kathleen sebelius,the of hhs who oversaw cms.after the call,melgen lobbyist spoke with one of the senator staffers,and the staffer reported to the senator that the lobbyist was encouraged,but mainly because he increasingly confident they wo have a leg to stand on should melgen litigate.but we all hopeful it wo come to that.indict.the indictment does not allege specifically that senator menendez mentioned melgen by name to tavenner.
a week later,the scheduler for the leader of the senate,harry reid,arranged a meeting among senator reid,senator menendez,and secretary sebelius.senator menendez told his staff that he did not want to tell melgen about the arrangement so that i do raise expectation s just in case it falls apart,indict,though the senator met with melgen lobbyist before the meeting and received a summary of the latest developments in melgen dispute with cms.at the meeting with secretary sebelius and senator reid,senator menendez advocated on behalf of melgen position in the medicare billing dispute,focusing on his specific case and asserting unfair treatment of it.blum,who accompanied the secretary to the meeting on behalf of cms,later told the fbi he did not recall anyone mentioning melgen by name,but said it was clear to him that the senators were talking about melgen and that the issue with his billing was an isolated issue as opposed to a general problem.blum.senator reid told the fbi that melgen name probably came up during the meeting because his individual situation was clearly the purpose of the meeting and they would have otherwise been speaking in a vacuum.reid.secretary sebelius told senator menendez that because melgen case was in the administrative appeals process,she had no power to influence the matter.
senator menendez,port security,and melgen dispute with the dominican republic 
in february,melgen obtained exclusive ownership of a contract held by a company in the dominican republic named icssi.the contract gave icssi exclusive rights to install and operate imaging equipment in dominican ports for up to years and required all shipping containers to be at a tariff of up to per container.icssi and the dominican republic disputed the validity of the contract and had already begun litigating the issue.
the following month,a former menendez staffer who worked for melgen requested a phone call with assistant secretary of state william brownfield to discuss icssi contract.a state department official reported to the assistant secretary that the former staffer dropped the name of menendez pretty squarely as having an interest in the case.indict.that former staffer later met with the assistant secretary and represented that he the staffer spoke on behalf of a united states entity involved in a contract dispute with the government of the dominican republic concerning the screening of shipping containers at dominican ports.id.indict.he referenced new jersey connections to the dispute.
senator menendez senior policy advisor arranged a meeting in may between the senator and assistant secretary brownfield about policy relating to dominican port security.at the meeting,senator menendez advocated for melgen interest in his foreign contract dispute,questioning the assistant secretary about the dispute and expressing dissatisfaction with the state department lack of initiative in the case.assistant secretary brownfield later summarized the meeting in an email to his staff,noting that senator menendez allud ed to a particular company and that the senator threatened to call a hearing if there was no solution.indict.
in june,senator menendez senior policy advisor emailed assistant secretary brownfield staff for an update on the dominican port issue.a few days later,the assistant secretary told his staff that melgen case is the case about which menendez threatened to call me to testify at an open hearing.i suspect that was a bluff,but he is very much interested in its resolution.a reminder that i owe the senator an answer to the question what can we do to resolve this matter id.indict.assistant secretary brownfield later forwarded to his staff another email from melgen representative and wrote,more on senator menendez s favorite dr port contract case.indict.
senator menendez subsequently directed his chief counsel to ask customs about its rumored donation to the dominican republic of equipment for the monitoring and surveillance of shipping containers.the equipment would have made it easier for the dominican republic to increase port security without honoring its disputed contract with icssi.the senator chief counsel emailed a customs employee the following 
my boss asked me to call you about this.dominican officials called him stating that there is a private company that has a contract with the department of homeland security to provide container shipment in the dominican republic.apparently,there is some effort by individuals who do not want to increase security in the dominican republic to hold up that contract fulfillment.these elements possibly criminal want customs to give the government equipment because they believe the government use of the equipment will be less effective than the outside contractor.my boss is concerned that the customs equipment will be used for this ulterior purpose and asked that you please consider holding off on the delivery of any such equipment until you can discuss this matter with us he like a briefing.
id.indict.the employee responded that customs was not providing the dominican republic with any such equipment and confirmed with senator menendez chief counsel that the private company referred to was icssi.indict.
senator menendez financial disclosures 
under the ethics act,senators are required to file with the secretary of the united states senate in washington,an annual financial disclosure form reporting,among other things,income,gifts,and financial interests from the prior calendar year.while senator menendez was subject to that obligation,melgen and his companies allegedly gave the senator reportable gifts,including private,chartered,and commercial flights,a car service,and hotel stays in paris,france,and punta cana,dominican republic.indict.senator menendez did not disclose any reportable gifts from melgen in his filings during the relevant years.the indictment claims that the senator engaged in conduct in the district of new jersey and elsewhere to falsify,conceal,and cover up those allegedly reportable gifts.id.indict.
procedural history 
in late,two menendez staffers one current and one former invoked the privilege conferred by the speech or debate clause to withhold testimony before a federal grand jury investigating the senator dealings with melgen.the parties disputed how protective the privilege was,and the district court ultimately granted the government motion to compel the staffers testimony.on appeal,we ruled that the privilege did not necessarily protect senator menendez informal communications with executive branch officials,one of whom tavenner was at the time a presidential nominee whose nomination was pending before the united states senate.in re grand jury investig.menendez,app x,cir.however,we required additional to determine if the privilege applied.thus we remanded the matter to the district court for specific factual findings about the communications implicated by the grand jury questions and with instructions to separately analyze the contents and purposes of each disputed communication.id.on remand,the government presented the disputed evidence through a summary witness and the district court did not rule on the privilege issue again.
the grand jury decided to charge senator menendez and melgen,and the indictment issued in april.the senator moved to dismiss on several grounds,including the speech or debate privilege and,with respect to count alleging reporting violations under the ethics act,the separation of powers among the branches of government and faulty venue.the district court denied the motions.it held that senator menendez failed to prove that the indictment references any legislative acts covered by the speech or debate clause.it also ruled that the ethics act charge was consistent with constraints and that venue was proper in new jersey.
senator menendez then took this appeal.the government moved to dismiss parts of it for lack of jurisdiction,arguing that the district court denial of the motion to dismiss for lack of venue was not immediately appealable.see,in re global,cir.we agreed,but because the appropriate mechanism for reviewing an allegedly improper ruling regarding venue in the absence of an appealable final order is mandamus,sunbelt noble,denton,cir,we denied the government motion and restricted senator menendez to raising the venue issue only in the form of a request for a petition for a writ of mandamus concerning venue,order.
the district court exercised jurisdiction under.we have jurisdiction over the speech or debate clause issues under the collateral order doctrine.united states mcdade,cir.under the specific circumstances here,we have pendent appellate jurisdiction over senator menendez claims.see ctf hotel holdings,marriott int l,cir.and we have jurisdiction over senator menendez request for a petition for a writ of mandamus under a.
ii.standard of review 
o ur standard of review is mixed for motions to dismiss.huet,at.we review the district court legal conclusions de novo and its factual determinations,including its findings about the contents and purposes of the acts alleged in the indictment,for clear error.id.senator menendez argues that we should review the district court findings de novo as findings of constitutional fact,a fact whose determination is decisive of constitutional rights.zold twp.of mantua,cir.quoting citizen action edison,cir.but factual findings are not subject to plenary review simply because they are material to constitutional analyses.outside the unique first amendment context that requires independent appellate review of certain factual findings,bose consumers union of,we review findings of historical fact for clear error even when they affect constitutional rights,see ornelas united states,holding that findings of narrative or historical fact related to fourth amendment rights are reviewed for clear error see also united states renzi,cir.reviewing for clear error a district court findings of fact in the context of a motion to dismiss an indictment on speech or debate clause grounds.here the district court found historical facts,so we will review those findings for clear error notwithstanding their relevance to the constitutional analysis.
under the clear error standard,reversal of the district court factual findings is warranted only when the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.united states lowe,cir.i f the district court account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety,we will not reverse it even if,as the trier of fact,we would have weighed the evidence differently.united states price,cir.internal quotation marks omitted.although our review at this stage of a prosecution is ordinarily limited to the allegations in the indictment,see united states delaurentis,cir,we can consider extrinsic evidence to determine whether the speech or debate clause applies,see gov t of the virgin islands lee,cir.

iii.discussion 
a.the speech or debate clause 
to repeat,the speech or debate clause provides that for any speech or debate in either house members of congress shall not be questioned in any other place.const.art.i,cl.the central role of the clause is to prevent intimidation of legislators by the executive and accountability before a possibly hostile judiciary.in re grand jury,cir.quoting eastland servicemen fund.it was not written into the constitution simply for the personal or private benefit of members of congress,but to protect the integrity of the legislative process by insuring the independence of individual legislators.united states brewster,see also tenney brandhove,stating that legislators must be immune from deterrents to the uninhibited discharge of their legislative duty,not for their private indulgence but for the public good.
the supreme court has read the clause broadly to guarantee members of congress immunity from criminal or civil liability based on their legislative acts,gravel united states,and to create a privilege against the use of evidence of a legislative act in a prosecution or before a grand jury,united states helstoski,see gravel,at.but because the privilege was designed to preserve legislative independence,not supremacy,invocations of it that go beyond what is needed to protect legislative independence must be closely scrutinized.hutchinson proxmire.more specifically,the speech or debate clause must be read broadly to effect its purpose of protecting the independence of the legislative branch,but no more than the statutes we apply was its purpose to make members of congress,immune from criminal responsibility.brewster,at.a member seeking to invoke the clause protections bears the burden of establishing the applicability of legislative immunity by a preponderance of the evidence.lee,at citing in re grand jury investig.eilberg,cir.
in practice,the speech or debate privilege affords protection from indictment only for legislative activity.gravel,at see also united states johnson,united states helstoski,cir.legislative acts have consistently been defined as those generally done in congress in relation to the business before it.brewster,at.they do not include all things in any way related to the legislative process.id.at see gravel,at that senators generally perform certain acts in their official capacity as senators does not necessarily make all such acts legislative in nature.the takeaway is that t he speech or debate clause does not immunize every official act performed by a member of congress.mcdade,at.rather,it protects only acts that are an integral part of the deliberative and communicative processes by which members participate in committee and house proceedings with respect to the consideration and passage or rejection of proposed legislation or with respect to other matters which the constitution places within the jurisdiction of either house.gravel,at.
this plays out in a framework for identifying legislative acts protected by the speech or debate clause.first,we look to the form of the act to determine whether it is inherently legislative or.some acts are so clearly legislative in nature that no further examination has to be made to determine their appropriate status.lee,at.examples of manifestly legislative acts include introducing and voting on proposed resolutions and legislation,introducing evidence and interrogating witnesses during committee hearings,subpoenaing records for committee hearings,inserting material into the congressional record,and delivering a speech in congress.see id.listing cases.and even though such manifestly legislative acts may have been pursued and accomplished for illegitimate purposes,such as personal gain,the acts themselves are obviously legislative in nature.id.thus an unworthy purpose does not eliminate speech or debate protection.johnson,at quoting tenney,at see also eastland,at our cases make clear that in determining the legitimacy of a congressional act we do not look to the motives alleged to have prompted it.youngblood deweese,cir.concluding without any consideration of intent and motive that a legislator appropriation of state funds was legislative activity.
on the other side of the spectrum,some acts are so clearly that no inquiry into their content or underlying motivation or purpose is needed to classify them.examples include legitimate constituent services such as the making of appointments with government agencies,assistance in securing government contracts,preparing news letters to constituents,news releases,and speeches delivered outside the congress,brewster,at,and,of course,illegitimate activities such as accepting bribes in exchange for taking official action,id.at.even if these acts involve policy or relate to protected legislative activity,they are not protected.see hutchinson,at holding that newsletters and press releases are outside the scope of the speech or debate clause even if they address matters of legislative importance see also brewster,at in no case has this court ever treated the clause as protecting all conduct relating to the legislative process.
if an act is neither manifestly legislative nor clearly,then it is ambiguously legislative,and we proceed to the second step of the speech or debate analysis.there we consider the content,purpose,and motive of the act to assess its legislative or character.see lee,at.ambiguously legislative acts including trips by legislators and informal contacts with the executive branch will be protected or unprotected based on their particular circumstances.see id.at.in lee,for example,a legislator from the virgin islands faced criminal charges for a trip he took supposedly on the government behalf.he argued that legislative immunity barred the prosecution because he engaged in legislative during the trip.we first explained that there was nothing inherently legislative or about the trip because it was only legislative to the extent it involved legislative.id.at.rather,i t is the content of lee private conversations,and not the mere fact that the conversations took place,that determines whether lee is entitled to legislative immunity.id.we then determined that lee conversations were not in fact legislative in nature so as to trigger the immunity.id.to reach that conclusion,we considered the content of lee private conversations and his purpose or motive for engaging in them.id.at.
senator menendez proposes two alternative standards for distinguishing between legislative and acts at step two.he first argues that an ambiguously legislative act should be viewed objectively and,if it appears legislative,that should end the inquiry with the privilege upheld.menendez br.at.but lee expressly rejected the view that speech or debate immunity protects not only legislative acts,but also acts which are purportedly or apparently legislative in nature.at emphasis in original.rather,we consider a legislator purpose and motive to the extent they bear on whether certain legislative acts were in fact taken or whether acts are being misrepresented as legislative in order to invoke the speech or debate privilege improperly.id.at.only after we conclude that an act is in fact legislative must we refrain from inquiring into a legislator purpose or motive.id.lee holding is not limited to characterizations of acts as legislative,as senator menendez contends,nor does it suggest that the privilege prevents us from considering evidence of a purportedly legislative act true character.
the authority senator menendez cites to the contrary misses the mark.he cites a statement in united states mcdade for the principle that it is inappropriate to consider a legislator motives when determining the character of an ambiguously legislative act.mcdade considered whether the speech or debate clause protected a congressman two ambiguously legislative letters,one that openly lobbie d the executive branch on behalf of a particular business in his district and one that discussed a broader policy question without explicitly refer ring to any particular business.at.though the mcdade court suggested that the second letter appear ed on its face to be ambiguously legislative,it resolved the case without deciding whether the letters were legislative activity within the scope of the clause.id.the statement is thus a dictum,neither binding on us nor even a conclusive determination of the relevant legal issue.
senator menendez next cites three distinguishable cases from other circuits.two involve manifestly legislative activity rather than ambiguously legislative activity that might appear legislative on its face.see united states dowdy,cir.holding that actions pursuant to an investigation authorized by the chairman of the house subcommittee on investigations were legislative notwithstanding evidence that the investigation was performed in exchange for a bribe mcsurely mcclellan,cir.en banc per curiam holding that a congressman actions pursuant to an officially sanctioned congressional investigation would be legislative notwithstanding evidence of impure motive,but noting that his inquiry into private matters beyond the scope of the investigation were not see also lee,at treating dowdy as limited to cases involving admittedly legislative activity.and the third case is consistent with lee because it allows the government to inquire into the reasons for apparently legislative activity.see united states biaggi,cir.ruling that the government may properly present arguments about the non legislative reasons for the defendant purportedly legislative act see also id.at the fact that one of the purposes of the travel may have been the conduct of legislative activity does not preclude a conviction.we therefore reject senator menendez first argument that the speech or debate clause necessarily protects apparently legislative activity.courts may dig down to discern if it should be deemed legislative or.
senator menendez second alternative posits that the speech or debate privilege protects any effort by a member to oversee the executive branch,including informal efforts to influence it.see menendez br.at,see also hutchinson,at stewart,concurring in part and dissenting in part.that blanket approach is much too broad,as it would immunize many illegal acts that have only dubious ties to the legislative process.like all acts by members,oversight activities exist along a spectrum the speech or debate protection is obvious at the edges where they are manifestly legislative or clearly,but it is not obvious in the middle ground where they are ambiguously legislative and consideration of their content,purpose,and motive is necessary.see mcdade,at.senator menendez informal communications with executive branch officials are ambiguously legislative,so this case is fought on that middle ground,and claims of oversight do not automatically result in speech or debate protection.
the government takes a much harder line it argues that the speech or debate protection does not extend to legislative attempts to influence executive actions,as those actions are the domain of the executive.gov t br.at.though it concedes that the clause protects formal efforts to encourage or command the executive branch to do something,by voting for a resolution,preparing investigative reports,addressing a congressional committee,or speaking before the legislative body in session,id.at quoting youngblood,at,it nonetheless contends that any other attempts to influence the executive branch are categorically outside the scope of the immunity,see id.at t he speech or debate clause does not apply to efforts by members of congress to influence the executive branch.quoting mcdade at.
we disagree with the government position.consistent with our approach to speech or debate privilege determinations,informal efforts to influence the executive branch are ambiguously legislative in nature and therefore may or may not be protected legislative acts depending on their content,purpose,and motive.in general,efforts by legislators to cajole and exhort executive branch officials with respect to the administration of a federal statute are not protected.gravel,at.they include efforts to intervene in decisions pending before the executive branch that would mainly affect one particular party.see mcdade,at see also menendez br.at distinguishing protected oversight from unprotected oversight based on whether the member was simply assisting a particular person or was addressing a broader policy question internal quotation marks omitted.but informal attempts to influence the executive branch on policy,for actual legislative purposes,may qualify as true legislative oversight and merit speech or debate immunity.mcdade,at scirica,concurring see in re grand jury investig.menendez,app x at noting that informal oversight is not necessarily protected,but may be in some cases even though it is not manifestly legislative.like all inquiries into ambiguously legislative acts,that distinction will turn on the content,purpose,and motive of the communications at issue.the consequence of accepting the government position would be to place legitimate efforts under the specter of possible indictment.
senator menendez does not prevail,however,because the acts alleged in this case were essentially lobbying on behalf of a particular party and thus,under the specific circumstances here,are outside the constitutional safe harbor.he claims that the indictment improperly references five supposedly legislative acts his meeting with tavenner his call with her his meeting with secretary sebelius his meeting with assistant secretary brownfield and his staff communications with customs employees.senator menendez opening brief suggests that the district court erred in its treatment of several other acts alleged in the indictment,but he specifies in his reply brief that he is challenging only these five acts on appeal the district court found that these acts were informal attempts to influence the executive branch specifically on melgen behalf and not on broader issues of policy.see,senator menendez fails to meet his burden to demonstrate that the primary goal of these communications was not to lobby the executive branch to enforce melgen specific contract,a activity.the court finds that senator menendez does not meet his burden to establish that the predominant purpose of these emails was to gather information for a legislative purpose rather than to lobby for a postponement of planned official action.unless those findings were clearly erroneous,they require us to hold that the challenged acts are not legislative and that the speech or debate privilege does not apply to them.and for the reasons that follow,clear error is not evident.
senator menendez argues that the five challenged acts were legislative because they addressed questions of policy.he relies primarily on allegations from the indictment and evidence in the record showing that each of the challenged acts involved policy discussions.see,indict.senator menendez pressed tavenner about and medicare payments,and advocated on behalf of the position favorable to melgen.emphases added indict.alleging that the call with tavenner addressed cms position regarding billing and its decision to follow the cdc guidelines indict.alleging that senator menendez requested a meeting with assistant secretary brownfield to talk about dr cargo from dominican republic coming into us ports tavenner reporting that tavenner call with senator menendez addressed the policy regarding billing for vials blum reporting that the focus of the conversation at the sebelius meeting was the policy,and that senator menendez and senator reid told secretary sebelius they were not there to talk about a particular case they were there to talk about policy sebelius reporting that senator menendez and senator reid spoke broadly about healthcare providers.he also points to allegations and evidence suggesting that melgen was not mentioned by name in the supposedly protected communications.see,indict.alleging that the issue of a us company doing business in the dominican republic was only allud ed to at the brownfield meeting menendez br.at no participant stated that melgen or his case was mentioned.id.at n obody could recall melgen name being mentioned.menendez reply br.at t he indictment does not allege th e email to customs identified melgen or his company.emphasis in original.in light of these observations,senator menendez asserts that the district court clearly erred when it found that the challenged acts were informal attempts to influence the executive branch specifically on melgen behalf and not on broader issues of policy.
but the existence of evidence to support an alternative finding that senator menendez was concerned with broader issues of policy does not mean that the district court findings are clearly erroneous.see anderson bessemer city.for there is much to confirm that the district court account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety.id.first,evidence exists that melgen or his case was mentioned specifically during each of the challenged acts.see,sebelius reporting that secretary sebelius told senator menendez the case at issue,melgen case was no longer within her jurisdiction because it was in the appeals process emphasis added reid reporting that melgen name probably came up during the sebelius meeting because melgen individual situation was clearly the purpose of the meeting and they would have otherwise been speaking in a vacuum reid senator reid considered his role in setting up the meeting with secretary sebelius to be offering assistance to senator menendez in order that senator menendez might be able to offer assistance to melgen.indict.alleging that senator menendez questioned assistant secretary brownfield about the contract dispute between melgen and the dominican republic.the unrebutted allegations of the indictment and evidence in the record further suggest that participants in the challenged acts were aware that their policy discussions related specifically to melgen.see,tavenner reporting that blum told tavenner before her meeting with senator menendez that the senator was interested in melgen case indict.alleging that senator menendez focus ed on melgen specific case during the sebelius meeting and assert ed that melgen was being treated unfairly sebelius reporting that secretary sebelius told senator menendez at their meeting that she had no power to influence melgen case indict.alleging that assistant secretary brownfield was told before his meeting with senator menendez that the latter pretty squarely had an interest in melgen case indict.alleging that,after the brownfield meeting,assistant secretary brownfield referred to melgen case as the one about which menendez threatened to call me to testify and senator menendez s favorite dr port contract case.
in sum,evidence is plentiful that to most of those involved the focal point of the meetings with executive branch officials was melgen.that senator menendez framed those meetings using the language of policy does not entitle them unvaryingly to speech or debate protection.rather,for every mention of policy concerns there is substantial record support for the district court findings that those concerns were instead attempts to help melgen.the evidence in favor of senator menendez will no doubt channel forcefully his position at trial,where the burden will be on the government to convince jurors to find in its favor beyond a reasonable doubt.but at this stage the burden is on senator menendez.it was not clear error for the district court to find that the senator acted primarily for melgen.
second,there is evidence about the preparations for the challenged acts suggesting that melgen was the primary focus of the supposedly protected communications.unrebutted allegations in the indictment and materials in the record suggest that senator menendez prepared for the acts with an eye toward melgen specific situation.see,indict.alleging that senator menendez prepared for the tavenner meeting by speaking with melgen lobbyist indict.alleging that a memo prepared for senator menendez in advance of the tavenner call described the issue at hand as payments made in,the same years as melgen purported overbilling email from melgen lobbyist to a menendez staffer explaining the scope of melgen dispute with cms in advance of senator menendez call with tavenner indict.alleging that senator menendez did not tell melgen about the sebelius meeting so as not to raise his expectation s just in case it falls apart.we do not accept senator menendez suggestion that the speech or debate clause somehow prevents consideration of relevant circumstantial evidence simply because it predated the purportedly legislative act.see lee,at.
third,there are unrebutted allegations and materials in the record suggesting that melgen and his lobbyist were particularly interested in following up with senator menendez on all of the challenged acts.see,indict.alleging that melgen lobbyist wrote to a menendez staffer after the tavenner meeting that he the lobbyist was eager to learn how the call went today id.indict.alleging that melgen lobbyist told a menendez staffer that he the lobbyist was hopeful it wo come to litigation after the tavenner meeting indict.alleging that melgen lobbyist asked to be told when tavenner responded to senator menendez because at some point i have to make a decision whether to recommend to melgen to go to court rather than wait any longer.i did not want to take any action until i knew that other avenues were shut down indict.alleging that melgen lobbyist asked for further briefing on the sebelius meeting.while this could be seen as evidence of melgen interest in the outcome of a genuine policy discussion,it could also be viewed as his interest in the outcome of casework performed on his behalf.because the record supports both views,the district court findings were not clearly erroneous.
fourth,senator menendez ignores unfavorable aspects of the evidence on which he relies.for example,he cites a note that urged him to m ake the larger policy case at his meeting with tavenner,but that note also mentioned melgen and his lobbyist by name.see.far from showing that that melgen was clearly not discussed at the meeting,the note suggests that any discussion of policy involved melgen particular case.similarly,senator menendez points out that the i
