this consolidated appeal arises from five bribery and public corruption cases relating to the billion repair and rehabilitation of a sewer and wastewater treatment system in jefferson county,alabama.a second superseding indictment the indictment charged sixteen defendants eleven individuals and five corporate firms with conspiracy to commit bribery,substantive offenses of bribery,honest services mail fraud,mail fraud,and obstruction of justice.nine defendants appeal their convictions here.three of those nine defendants appeal their sentences.
specifically,the nine are two former county officials,three corporate contractors,and four individuals who owned these respective contractors.the two defendant county officials were in charge of the sewer program and received hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of bribes from the defendant contractors.in many cases,the contractors disguised these payments by altering invoices or hiding costs within their accounting systems.in turn,the defendant contractors obtained hundreds of millions of dollars worth of payments on construction and engineering contracts with the county.the county officials approved the contractors pay requests,change orders,time extensions,requests for field directives,all of which financially benefitted the defendant contractors.
after review and oral argument,we conclude the evidence at the trials overwhelmingly established the guilt,and they have shown no reversible error in the district courts rulings,or in the trials,in the cases consolidated on appeal.thus,we affirm all of the convictions except roland pugh construction,conviction on count,which is barred by the statute of limitations.we also affirm jewell chris mcnair sentence in full.we affirm jack swann sentence in part but remand for further proceedings as to the amount of the fine.as to the sentence of roland pugh construction,we affirm the district court findings of fact as supported by the record and conclude there was no error in the district court calculations under the sentencing guidelines but in light of the reversal of its count conviction,we vacate its sentence and remand for resentencing without count.

d.the indictment 
the indictment contained counts six of the counts charged a bribery conspiracy.specifically,counts against mcnair and the pugh,rast,and dougherty defendants,against mcnair and the usi defendants,against mcnair and the usi defendants,against swann and the pugh,rast,and dougherty defendants,except for roland pugh,against wilson and pugh,and against barber and the pugh defendants charged conspiracy to commit bribery under and.
counts,and charged one or more defendants with substantive bribery offenses or aiding and abetting bribery under.for the most part,these substantive bribery offenses were the overt acts charged in the conspiracy counts.
counts charged honest services mail fraud under and against defendants swann,yessick,and pugh.counts charged honest services mail fraud under and against defendants swann,wilson,ceds,fwde,and dougherty.counts charged mail fraud under against the dougherty defendants.counts charged obstruction of justice against certain defendants under.
some of these counts were dismissed before trial,and other counts were dismissed prior to jury deliberations.and some defendants,such as roland pugh,were dismissed from some of the counts that went to the jury.this opinion addresses only the counts that were actually submitted to the jury.
five trials 
the indictment was severed into five separate cases for trial mcnair,swann,barber,wilson,and usi the mcnair trial involved bribes by the pugh,rast,and dougherty defendants primarily to mcnair but also to chandler and ellis.the usi trial involved bribes to mcnair by the usi defendants.the other trials involved bribes to swann,barber,and wilson,respectively.
in the usi trial,defendants usi,key,and singh were convicted of,among other things,conspiracy to commit bribery and substantive bribery offenses for making payments to defendant commissioner mcnair and the jcesd chandler and ellis.this court affirmed defendants usi,key,and singh convictions and sentences in united states infrastructure,cir,cert.denied.defendant mcnair entered a conditional guilty plea to count conspiracy to accept a bribe from the usi defendants mcnair reserved the right to appeal the district court denial of his motion to dismiss count.mcnair appeal in the usi case has been consolidated with the present appeal.
nine parties to this appeal 
this present consolidated appeal involves not only defendant mcnair appeal in the usi case but also these defendants appeals in the other four trials 
mcnair trial defendants mcnair,pugh,roland pugh,rast,bobby rast,danny rast,fwde,and dougherty.defendant yessick president of pugh was convicted at trial and does not appeal.
swann trial defendants swann,pugh,rast,bobby rast,fwde,and dougherty.defendant yessick was convicted at trial and does not appeal.
barber trial defendant pugh.defendants barber and yessick pled guilty and do not appeal.
wilson trial defendant pugh.defendant wilson was convicted at trial and does not appeal.
albeit from five separate cases,the raise many of the same issues.we discuss the evidence in the mcnair,swann,barber,and wilson trials,and the issues commonly raised by the defendants,followed by certain issues pertaining to particular defendants.
ii.the mcnair trial 
the mcnair trial,held from april to,involved over in bribes the pugh,rast,and dougherty defendants paid to commissioner mcnair and in bribes they paid to county employees chandler and ellis.the government called witnesses,including chandler,ellis,dawson,creel,and grady pugh.the defense called witnesses.no named defendant testified.
the government witnesses described in great detail the bribes to mcnair,chandler and ellis,and how those three county officials financially helped the pugh,rast,and dougherty defendants in their contracts with and payments from jefferson county.because the defendant contractors in the mcnair trial claimed they paid mcnair only out of a friendship and lacked corrupt intent,the district court admitted certain evidence,under federal rule of evidence b,about how these same defendants bribed swann and other county employees in order to show the defendants corrupt intent and common plan.thus,our recitation of evidence in the mcnair trial covers bribes given not only to mcnair but also to swann and other county employees.
mcnair helps 
jefferson county was governed by five elected commissioners,each of whom had a different area of responsibility.defendant mcnair held office as a county commissioner from until his retirement in march.mcnair was responsible for overseeing the jcesd,which included the sewer systems.mcnair had authority to approve pay requests from the sewer construction contractors,to approve change orders increasing the contract price paid to those contractors,to approve change orders modifying the contract terms in favor of those contractors,to approve emergency payments to contractors,to select consulting engineers through a process,and to approve the engineers contracts and payments.although final approval required the vote of the entire commission,there was no evidence that the commission questioned or disapproved of any pay request or change order approved by mcnair or any selection or award of a contract recommended by mcnair.mcnair nickname among the contractors was big man.
mcnair approved payments in the hundreds of millions of dollars to the pugh,rast,and dougherty defendants the,approved change orders in the millions of dollars benefitting pugh and rast,and approved engineering contracts in the millions of dollars to fwde,all while these defendants were paying for materials and labor to expand and renovate mcnair photography studio.each item requiring commission approval,such as contract awards or modifications,needed mcnair to approve it first and then to put it on the commission agenda for further approval the sewer construction contracts were awarded through a sealed bid process and would go to the lowest bidder.but the prospective contractors had to satisfy technical standards set by the prc before they would be eligible to bid.
once a new contract was awarded and in place,chandler and other supervisors,such as ellis,could approve changed or additional work as field directives.if a requested change exceeded the original contract amount,chandler and ellis could recommend change orders requests for additional funds,which mcnair would then approve and place on the commission agenda,without further competitive bidding.the jcesd also could award emergency work to construction contractors without competitive bidding.for emergency jobs,barber typically selected the contractor,negotiated the price,and then sent the pay requests to mcnair,swann,and chandler for approval.together,mcnair,swann,and chandler approved a variety of contracts for the sewer project 
the construction contractors work was supervised by independent consulting engineers,whose jobs were to make sure the contractors performed according to specifications and to sign off on payments and requests for change orders.this supervision was provided by engineering firms such as fwde,usi,and dawson engineering.the engineering consultant contracts were awarded without bidding.swann and chandler selected engineering firms,negotiated their contracts,and recommended them to mcnair for final approval.
the county prc initially decided to qualify only three contractors to do work hailey hailey,insituform,and reynolds.because the traditional work was grouped with work for all the major construction contracts,this prc decision effectively limited the big jobs to only three bidders a joint venture,a joint venture,and reynolds,which did its own work.in late,the prc changed the criteria,making it more difficult for other contractors to for work,and potentially delaying by two years the qualification of otherwise qualified contractors 
contractor pugh ceo grady pugh admitted to receiving a general benefit from giving mcnair envelopes of cash,in that jefferson county treated us real well.we had an opportunity to do a tremendous amount of work there.the work that we did there generated huge profits i t took our company pugh from a normal struggling contracting company in the mid to late,to a thriving,wealthy,strong construction company.
during the relevant period,pugh dedicated about of its work to the jefferson county sewer rehabilitation and received tens of millions of dollars in revenue from that sewer work.in and,at the sewer rehabilitation outset,pugh made gross profits of,and as the project continued and payments were made to jcesd officials,the company sewer rehabilitation profits increased to in,in,and in,making pugh tens of millions of dollars each of these years.
rast also received tens of millions of dollars in revenue per year from its jefferson county sewer work.and the engineering firms,including fwde,received revenue in millions of dollars per year from their work on the sewer rehabilitation.mcnair made the decision every time fwde or dawson engineering was selected as the outside consulting engineer and awarded a professional service contract.after electrical contractor gus henson did some work for mcnair without charge,mcnair had swann arrange a county contract for him,even though the county did not normally hire electrical engineers for sewer work.
in total,from august to january,jefferson county paid million to pugh,million to rast,million to fwde,and million to dawson engineering.
bribes of mcnair 
mcnair owned a small photography business called mcnair frame photo art,mcnair studio.between and early,mcnair started a major expansion and renovation of the studio,which would more than double its size.mcnair expansion included adding extras to the studio,such as an apartment for his daughter,a deck,external stairs,a guard shack,and a security gate.
all in this case generously contributed to the renovation and expansion of mcnair studio.in,fwde president dougherty sent bill bailey,an fwde employee initially hired as an inspector for county jobs,to work as the construction superintendent for the studio renovation.fwde paid bailey for the approximately months he spent working at mcnair studio.during that time,fwde paid bailey.although some of his time was charged to administration,fwde president dougherty charged some of bailey studio time to a jcesd sewer project.mcnair was not charged for bailey work.as superintendent,fwde bailey oversaw construction at mcnair studio by numerous other contractors,including pugh and rast 
rast excavated for the expansion footings for mcnair studio.in july,pugh ordered concrete and for four weeks had a crew pour concrete walls and do other work on the studio,paying the crew.pugh crew supervisor talked to mcnair while the concrete work was in progress,but mcnair did not question why he was there or where he was from,nor did mcnair offer to pay for this work.
in late,fwde bailey asked barry mosley of mosley construction to do wood framing and other finish work at mcnair studio.mcnair initially paid mosley,first with a check and then with cash,but eventually mcnair stopped paying.bobby rast then told bailey that mcnair was running out of funds and that rast would begin paying mosley directly.from july to december,rast wrote checks totaling to mosley as his work at the studio progressed,and,at bobby rast direction,coded these payments as expenses on a jcesd sewer project.either bailey or someone from rast office,such as danny rast,brought mosley the checks.
in january,rast gave mosley two more checks totaling for work he and his crew did on the studio guard shack,a,x building designed by defendant dougherty,and built,in part,by defendants rast and fwde.bobby rast caused these payments to be coded as expenses on the upper valley rehab or kilsby contract,a jcesd sewer project.for tax purposes,all payments to mosley were deducted as business expenses on sewer projects.mosley did no work on those projects.after a local newspaper reported rast construction work at jcesd director swann home,rast amended its tax returns for and to eliminate these and other deductions.the deductions,which totaled over,were based on expenditures for mcnair studio and swann home that had been to sewer projects and treated as business expenses.
after the publicity,bobby rast told his bookkeeper in effect that we really did need any document invoices in the files with jack swann or chris mcnair shipping address on them.the bookkeeper then located and discarded several invoices related to work at mcnair studio and swann home.
rast furnished the labor and pugh furnished the materials to construct a deck for the rear of mcnair studio.bailey handwrote a list of materials and ordered the necessary steel.when besco steel supply besco delivered the steel,its delivery tickets identified pugh and yessick as its customers and indicated some of the steel was for the valley creek treatment plant,a jcesd sewer job on which pugh was the contractor and fwde the consulting engineer.in september,pugh paid besco and charged the jcesd for worth of steel with fwde approval,and rast poured the concrete deck and stairs,set the handrails,and built the steps.
around september,fwde employee dave bechtel ordered two sets of aluminum handrails for the studio deck and a staircase from thompson fabricating,which was directed to bill pugh.the invoice for the first set of handrails charged the work as performed on the valley creek treatment plant and falsely indicated that the handrails were shipped there.in february,an invoice for the second set of handrails referenced chris mc.as the customer,but also falsely indicated that the handrails were shipped to valley creek when in fact they were shipped to mcnair studio.pugh paid both invoices and billed the county for the first set of handrails after adding a markup and charges for labor and equipment.rast installed the handrails.
in may,at mcnair request to roland pugh,grady pugh flew 
mcnair daughter and fwde bailey on pugh airplane to georgia,where they picked out carpet for mcnair studio.before,roland pugh told his son grady pugh that mcnair has called again and says that he broke and he does have enough money to leave for the deposit on the carpet and s o,if you would,write a check for the deposit.grady pugh paid the deposit with a pugh check made out to the mill store and had it treated on pugh books as an expense on the last rehab contract.
fwde bailey hired subcontractor clint gilley to install the carpet at mcnair studio.in october,fwde bailey called rast to request checks for subcontractor gilley.after bobby rast was consulted,rast gave gilley two checks totaling for his work at mcnair studio.
in addition to paying for materials and providing work crews,pugh also made other contributions to mcnair studio.when the project began in,roland pugh told pugh other three owners,grady pugh,andy pugh,and yessick,they had to give money to mcnair because he was building a studio and,as owners of the pugh company,they had to kick in their share.grady pugh gave approximately in cash to roland pugh secretary that time 
mcnair also wanted a security gate for the studio.in august,danny rast hired subcontractor master access controls mac to install an electronic gate and agreed that rast would provide the electrical conduit,wiring,and concrete pad for the gate motor.mac met with fwde bailey at mcnair studio site,installed the gate,and sent its invoices to the attention of danny rast.rast paid the subcontractor.mcnair paid nothing.
also in december,at danny rast request,rast gave bailey sons bobcat service,owned by danny bailey,a check for landscaping at mcnair studio.however,rast records indicated danny bailey was working on a jcesd sewer project.although danny bailey had done work for rast before,he did not send the invoice for the studio work through regular billing,as he normally would,but instead sent it atten dan rast.
in november,mcnair asked dawson engineering to contribute to the studio renovation.after mcnair called william dawson,the founder of dawson engineering,the two met at mcnair studio.mcnair handed dawson a brochure for an audiovisual system and told dawson that,while mcnair had never asked dawson for anything before,he needed to ask dawson to help him with something.mcnair opened the brochure to a specific page,showed it to dawson,and indicated he wanted dawson to pay for the equipment and its installation.dawson went to holt audio video holt and purchased the equipment for.dawson testified he would not have done this for mcnair if mcnair had not been associated with the sewer rehabilitation process.when dawson saw the invoice indicated the bill was for dawson engineering but the shipment was for mcnair studio,he became uncomfortable with the whole situation and asked holt to alter the shipping information by putting a sticker over the mcnair studio address,which holt did.dawson later pled guilty to conspiring to commit bribery.
work at the studio continued after commissioner mcnair retired in march.fwde bailey hired buchanan plumbing and sewer service buchanan to plumb the guard shack.in november,fwde employees signed buchanan in invoices and sent them to rast,which paid them.rast recorded the payments as plumbing work at kilsby circle,a sewer project,even though buchanan never did any work there.
after mcnair retirement,roland pugh told grady pugh that gd sic mcnair has called again,and he wants us to do some work over in arkansas and surely this is the last time we have to do anything for him since he out of office.grady pugh flew with mcnair to arkansas to look at the site and plans.following this visit,pugh yessick hired george word,an arkansas building contractor,in august to build a retirement home for mcnair.both pugh and fwde paid for its construction pugh checkbook carried the notation gift per eddie yessick.no job.after mcnair retirement,rast also continued to perform work at mcnair studio and paid for mcnair and his wife to take a cruise to alaska in september 
bribes of chandler and ellis 
the pugh,rast,and dougherty defendants also gave,at no charge,goods,services,labor,materials,and other things of value to jcesd assistant director chandler,and jcesd engineer and prc director ellis.at a lunch,pugh president yessick offered to landscape chandler home.chandler at first refused,but weeks later yessick offered again,and chandler accepted.pugh provided crews and paid for the materials for the extensive landscaping,including grading,drainage work,and new sod,as well as construction of a patio,walkway,and retaining walls.chandler paid nothing for that work.
in october,yessick arranged and paid for a condo rental for the chandler family vacation at the pelican beach resort in destin,florida chandler asked for,and pugh delivered,a load of sand for chandler house for free.
in the spring of,chandler asked bobby rast to help with his expenses for a trip to europe to attend technical conferences.ellis planned to attend too.at rast office,bobby rast gave chandler an envelope containing in cash and told chandler to split the money with ellis.chandler had expected to and was uncomfortable and thought about giving it back,but he did.instead,chandler eventually gave half to ellis the dougherty defendants also gave chandler tickets to disney world and a trip to san antonio.
d.the defense 
for the most part,the defendants did not dispute that they provided,at no charge,these goods,services,labor,materials,and other things of value to commissioner mcnair instead,the defendants argued they lacked the corrupt intent necessary for bribery and that the government had failed to prove the required quid pro quo for the benefits provided to mcnair.the defendants also asserted they helped mcnair based on their friendship with him or for goodwill.in support,defense witnesses testified to mcnair friendship with roland pugh,dougherty,and the rast family,and described how the frequently performed work for mcnair at no charge.the also contended their experience,skills,and business reputation were strong enough so that they did not need to resort to bribery to win county contracts.
the defense spent considerable time attacking the credibility of grady pugh,including inconsistencies in his testimony.the defense suggested he was lying out of hatred for his father roland pugh and to obtain a favorable sentence recommendation from the government.
the government countered the defendants arguments by offering b evidence of similar items of value the same contractors had provided for swann,wilson,and barber who were not defendants in the mcnair trial.the government argued the large scale and overall pattern of these payments were inconsistent with the defendants claims that they were favors undertaken merely out of friendship for mcnair.the government also presented evidence that mcnair made numerous unexplained cash deposits 
jury verdicts 
before sending the case to the jury,the district court dismissed several substantive counts that charged bribes to mcnair after his retirement in march,and struck the corresponding overt acts from the conspiracy count count,reasoning that the bribery statute could not apply when mcnair was no longer a public official.
in the mcnair trial,the jury convicted defendants mcnair,pugh,roland pugh,yessick,rast,bobby rast,danny rast,fwde,and dougherty on count of conspiring to bribe mcnair.count alleged overt acts originally.several overt acts were dismissed,but count,as submitted to the jury,charged overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy.
as to bribes by the pugh defendants,the jury convicted defendant mcnair on these substantive bribery counts for hand railings and for hand railings.the jury convicted defendant pugh on count same hand railing facts as counts and.the jury convicted defendants pugh and yessick on count for chandler condominium rental.
as to bribes by the rast defendants,the jury convicted defendant mcnair on these substantive bribery counts for carpentry work by barry mosley,for security gate installation by master access controls,for carpet installation by clint gilley,for landscaping work by bailey sons,several thousand dollars for fabrication and construction of stairs,and several thousand dollars for concrete deck construction.the jury also convicted defendants rast and bobby rast on counts same facts as counts,respectively,cash to chandler by rast and bobby rast,and cash to ellis by rast and bobby rast.rast was also convicted on counts same facts as count and same facts as count.the jury convicted defendant danny rast on counts,and same facts as counts,and.
defendant mcnair was also convicted on counts by the dougherty defendants for project management and supervision by bailey and by dawson for installation of audio visual system.the jury convicted defendants fwde and dougherty on count same facts as count 
in summary,the jury convicted defendant mcnair on the bribery conspiracy count and ten substantive bribery counts.the jury convicted defendants pugh,roland pugh,and yessick on the bribery conspiracy count defendant pugh on two substantive bribery counts and defendant yessick on one substantive bribery count.the jury convicted defendants rast,bobby rast,and danny rast on the bribery conspiracy count defendant rast on eight substantive bribery counts defendant bobby rast on six substantive bribery counts and defendant danny rast on three substantive bribery counts.the jury convicted defendants fwde and dougherty on the bribery conspiracy count and on one substantive bribery count each.all defendants but yessick appeal all conviction counts.
iii.the swann trial 
the swann trial,held from september to october,involved more than in bribes paid to county employee swann by the pugh,rast and dougherty defendants.the government called witnesses,including wilson,chandler and ellis.the defense called witnesses,including grady pugh.no named defendants testified except for swann.
the government witnesses described in great detail the bribes to swann and how swann financially helped the pugh,rast,and dougherty defendants in their contracts with and payments from jefferson county.and to counter the defendants defense,the government introduced b evidence describing bribes that the same pugh,rast,and dougherty defendants gave to mcnair,barber,wilson and chandler 
swann helps 
jcesd director jack swann reported directly to commissioner mcnair.it was swann responsibility to implement the epa consent decree,which included recommending engineering firms to mcnair and negotiating the scope and price of engineering contracts,such as with fwde.swann supervised the sewer work and made recommendations to mcnair for payment approvals and change orders.swann also was able to grant time extensions and field directives that greatly benefitted rast and pugh.
for example,in may,the jcesd awarded the vestavia trunk sewer replacement project to pugh.pugh failure to meet the project may,completion date would trigger a liquidated damages clause,obligating pugh to pay per day.in march,pugh was running far behind schedule on this project and requested a extension to the may completion date.swann initially denied pugh request.
on june,pugh renewed its request,this time for a extension.on july days after pugh yessick hired guthrie landscaping guthrie to landscape swann granted pugh request for a extension to the may completion date.swann extension saved pugh in potential liquidated damages.
in july,the jcesd awarded the valley creek trunk relief tunnel project designed by fwde to rast and its joint venture partner hailey.in december,during the first phase of the project,rast machine became stuck in the ground.an independent engineer concluded the machine became stuck because rast may have discounted certain information in a geotechnical survey.and the jcesd supervising engineer faulted rast for using the wrong machine.nevertheless,swann authorized rast to remove the machine at a cost of million to jefferson county.
further,swann declined to invoke the performance bond against rast,which would have guaranteed the project completion at the original contract price of million.instead,rast won a for an additional contract worth million.consequently,the county effectively paid rast over million for work rast was obligated to perform under the original million contract.
swann also approved a lucrative field directive that benefitted pugh and three that benefitted rast.although in the county internal accounting system swann recorded the county payments to the joint venture for each of these field directives as payments for the valley creek tunnel relief project,none of the field directives involved work on that project.swann also exercised great influence over the selection of engineers,like fwde.
bribes of swann 
in,swann and his wife nila purchased a house two doors down from their own residence.the swanns lived in their residence while they renovated their new home.between september and june,the swanns put over worth of additions and improvements into their new home.fwde,rast,and pugh provided swann,at no charge,more than in goods,services,labor,and materials for that work.for certain improvements paid for by fwde,swann admitted he did not reimburse fwde or dougherty.as they had done for the mcnair studio project,the worked together on swann new home.while the work was going on,swann periodically came over to observe the work at the new home.while swann was recommending and approving jcesd actions worth millions of dollars,the were providing hundreds of thousands of dollars in materials and services to renovate and expand swann new home.
specifically,in the fall of,dougherty sent fwde supervisors wayne hendon and bill bailey to meet with swann and his wife about plans to remodel their new home.over the course of the project,fwde employees continually supervised the remodeling of the new home.from about october to march,fwde paid employee john stanger for his work at swann home.during that time period,fwde hendon spent half of every work day supervising other contractors at swann home and billed his time as a nonpaying job.fwde paid hendon for his work at swann home.in the fall of,fwde hired subcontractor dudley davis for framing,costing over.dougherty visited the site periodically.
in the winter of,bobby rast sent rast superintendent luke cobb to supervise rast crews who did demolition work and poured concrete for swann new home.bobby rast had rast employee derek houston serve as a point of contact for rast suppliers and subcontractors for swann home and paid houston for his work there.in,rast paid its employees in miscellaneous labor costs for their work on swann home and mcnair studio.rast avoided using swann name on invoices,delivery tickets,and internal accounting reports,instead using his nickname,little big man.
rast also bought bricks and other materials,and paid different subcontractors for installation of hardwood floors and stairs and exterior brickwork,plumbing work,and painting.rast paid for flooring and stairs installation that don carpet one performed at swann new home in or.in the fall of,rast paid for brick and mortar work by alabama brick delivery.in the fall of,rast paid kimro painting services,kimro painting for painting work at swann new home.in may,rast paid to sherman international for concrete work.the delivery ticket for concrete rast purchased from sherman international directed delivery to the swann address but identified it as the rast residence.in october,rast paid brown mechanical contractors,brown mechanical for worth of plumbing work performed at swann new home.bobby rast had the payments to brown mechanical coded as expenses to rast jefferson county contracts for annual rehab and minor pump station.
in the summer of,pugh began contributing to swann new home remodeling.pugh president yessick hired subcontractor aquatic gardens to install a waterfall and koi pond at a cost of.yessick told aquatic gardens to send its invoices to pugh and not mention swann by name.
yessick hired other subcontractors for various work after swann claimed to have overpaid for the remodeling.yessick hired guthrie to help landscape swann new home,and in july guthrie gave an initial estimate of.pugh book entries and invoices for guthrie work on swann home were never kept in swann name,but always under some other code.yessick had pugh accountant charge guthrie expenses to metro park roadway,a jefferson county job.by december,pugh had paid guthrie for its landscaping work at the swann home,which included a month for ongoing weekly yard maintenance.
in january,pugh president yessick asked guthrie to stop submitting invoices to pugh and instead pugh advanced guthrie for three years worth of landscaping and maintenance on swann new home and guthrie performed about worth of work.although pugh manager of accounts testified she filed guthrie invoices regularly and that pugh kept these records for to years,the invoices were not found during the government investigation in december,yessick used a pugh check to buy worth of bookstore gift certificates for swann 
in august,after grady pugh and yessick heard rumors of a government investigation,guthrie was asked to stop working on swann property,even though there was a balance remaining on the advance yessick had given to guthrie.at that time,yessick directed his assistant to send an invoice to swann for for tree removal and remodeling work.in september,yessick instructed his assistant to create an invoice,this time to swann mother,for of landscaping work.in november,the swanns paid pugh this amount with checks drawn from joint checking accounts the swanns had taken out with their mothers,after taking out two home equity loans in each of their mothers names 
c.the defense 
in the swann trial,the defense basically was that the defendants lacked the corrupt intent to commit bribery and acted at all times in good faith.the contended they performed work on swann home out of goodwill and without expecting anything in return.swann argued he did not have an intent to be influenced by the things the gave him.
in addition,the defendants presented evidence showing that nila swann swann wife had an engineering background,acted as her own general contractor,hired and supervised subcontractors,and initially paid the bills for the work on the swann home.swann testified that nila handled all of the couple financial matters and that he assumed she was paying for the work.according to swann,nila frequently changed her mind,was not a good manager,and disputed the cost and scope of the work with the subcontractors.dougherty and the rast brothers were longtime friends of nila and jack swann.swann stated that dougherty and the rast brothers stepped in only to offer advice and take over supervision to make the work go more smoothly.the claimed that they paid several of these disputed bills to preserve their own business relationships with the subcontractors and their expectation was that the swanns would eventually reimburse them.however,with the sole exception of pugh belated invoices to swann for landscaping and remodeling work,there was no evidence that the swanns paid the for the work at their new home.
as to the conspiracy charge,the defendants also claimed that the government had not presented sufficient evidence to show an unlawful agreement between swann and any of the.
in the swann trial,the government presented b evidence about similar items of value the same had provided to mcnair for his studio,their help with mcnair home in arkansas,and other benefits they provided for mcnair,barber,and chandler.
jury verdicts

iv.the wilson trial 
in the wilson trial,held from june to,defendants wilson and pugh were charged with conspiring to commit bribery count.defendant wilson was charged with accepting from pugh a bribe in the form of a scholarship for his son to attend the university of alabama at birmingham uab count.the defense argued that the scholarship was not intended as a bribe.
the government called witnesses,including chandler,grady pugh,and roland pugh secretary janice kuykendall.the defense called witnesses.
wilson helps pugh 
defendant wilson was the chief civil engineer for the jcesd and served on the prc.as chief civil engineer,wilson was in charge of all sewer line work.wilson was also the project engineer on several construction contracts,including some of pugh.as project engineer,defendant wilson approved all sewer contractor pay requests,which were submitted monthly,before sending them on to chandler,the jcesd assistant director.project engineers also approved requests for extensions of time to complete contracts.contractors were subject to a penalty of per day if they failed to complete a contract on time.
on july,pugh submitted to outside consulting engineer for the village east request for a extension to complete work on the project.the completion date was may.on july,usi forwarded the request to defendant wilson.when pugh requested the extension on july,it was already days overdue.pugh was at risk for a penalty in liquidated damages for each of the days.
on august,defendant wilson faxed grady pugh a letter instructing him to send to uab for wilson son.on august,defendant wilson approved the extension.this saved pugh not only the penalty for the delay from may to july but also per day for each day until pugh completed the job.on august,pugh sent a check to uab for wilson son.
in addition,defendant wilson served on the prc,which set technical standards for constructions firms who bid on contracts for the county sewer project.some of the projects called for cip or trenchless techniques for replacing existing sewer lines.in the late,this was a relatively new technology,and only a handful of contractors had the expertise to do it properly.like other municipalities,jefferson county required contractors to meet specified minimum requirements for prior experience before they were permitted to bid on cip work.
in september,the prc significantly tightened these requirements,making it more difficult for new contractors to.however,the three contractors who were already doing cip work in jefferson county were grandfathered in and did not have to go through the process.two of those three cip contractors were joint venture partners with rast and pugh.although the three contractors did compete against each other in a sealed bidding process,jefferson county qualification requirements cut down the number of competitors and enabled these cip contractors to charge jefferson county higher prices than they could charge other municipalities for similar work.when two competitors finally qualified to join the bidding in,prices quickly dropped from over per linear foot to about.
the government also offered b evidence showing certain items of value that pugh provided for mcnair,chandler,and barber,and that rast provided for wilson and the favorable decisions pugh obtained from the jcesd.grady pugh offered similar testimony,and,as in the mcnair trial,the defense again attempted to impeach grady pugh by pointing out inconsistencies in his testimony,his hatred of his father roland pugh,and his efforts to obtain a favorable sentencing recommendation from the government.
bribes of wilson 
sometime in,defendant wilson complained to grady pugh over lunch about the cost of college and that he might not be able to afford to send his son justin to uab for the upcoming semester fall.grady pugh responded that pugh had done a lot for colleges and education and suggested pugh might sponsor a scholarship,but wanted to make sure we could get in any trouble for it.sometime in august,wilson called grady pugh to accept the scholarship offer.
as noted above,on august,defendant wilson used a jcesd fax machine to send grady pugh a letter expressing his gratitude and instructing him to send a check to uab to credit wilson son account.pugh sent the check to uab four days later.there was no evidence that the son ever sent pugh an application for the scholarship.grady pugh secretary typed the letter and signed grady pugh name.grady pugh never met nor spoke with wilson son before sending the check to uab on august.the accompanying letter simply asked uab to credit the payment to wilson son account and gave no other instructions.although pugh had made charitable contributions to schools and colleges,including uab,it had never previously awarded a scholarship to an individual student.grady pugh thought the money would go toward books and tuition but could not remember exactly what wilson had said to him.
grady pugh was unaware that fwde had already paid wilson son tuition and fees for the school year uab applied pugh scholarship money to wilson son account in four quarterly installments of per installment,as was its standard practice for scholarships when a donor did not instruct otherwise.uab took about one third of the pugh money to cover the son housing and other fees,and disbursed the remainder of the pugh money directly to the son each quarter.the installments were disbursed to the son in september,december,march and june.wilson son signed a receipt each time.grady pugh testified that he never did anything after august to follow up on the scholarship and he did not know that uab would defer full payment into the following year.the government did not present any evidence that wilson was aware of uab payment arrangements.
grady pugh explained his intent in giving the scholarship to wilson son 
when you offer somebody something like that you expect them to help you if they can.and when i did that for wilson,i felt like if he got a chance to help us,he would.
grady pugh explained that giving things of value to county employees provided pugh with the general benefit of hav ing preferential treatment and,you know,if we had problems it would help resolve the problems.numerous ways that things could be made easier.
jury verdicts 
the jury convicted defendants wilson and pugh on count and defendant wilson on count.wilson has not appealed.pugh appeals as to count 
v.the barber trial 
in the barber trial,held from january to,defendants barber,pugh,roland pugh,and yessick were charged with conspiring to bribe barber by,among other things,pugh paying and barber accepting in real property and nearly in trips to casinos and beaches count.defendants pugh and roland pugh were also charged with bribing barber by giving him that property count,and defendant pugh was charged with paying for these trips counts 
defendants barber and yessick pled guilty to count.only pugh and roland pugh went to trial.the government called witnesses,including chandler,grady pugh and yessick.the defense called witnesses,including barber.
barber helps pugh 
barber supervised the jcesd county inspectors.barber was responsible for hiring sewer contractors to do emergency work,approving contractors paperwork,and certifying their expenses before sending the expenses to jcesd assistant director chandler.
in january,barber determined the sewer pipes in the paradise lake subdivision should be replaced on an emergency basis instead of being repaired.on january,barber told city inspector hodges that barber had chosen a contractor who could do the job in about days.pugh president yessick sent barber a letter,dated january,offering that pugh could do the job for about million.that same day,yessick also sent hodges a letter,dated january,stating that pugh would be performing the job.given that emergency work contracts were limited to or less,pugh eventually received a field directive in the amount of,on which pugh made a profit.however,because barber had classified the work as an emergency,there was no contract for paradise lake on which to put the field directive.the emergency work contract therefore was placed on the unrelated cahaba river project.
bribes of barber 
beginning in and continuing through,pugh president yessick caused pugh to pay to send barber on an annual beach resort or casino vacation in locations including orange beach,alabama and biloxi and vicksburg,mississippi.pugh paid for barber stay in vicksburg,for his stay in biloxi,and for his stay at the phoenix iii condominiums in orange beach,alabama.pugh recorded the payments for the trips to orange beach and biloxi in pugh books as sewer rehab projects.
in the spring of,barber asked pugh yessick if he would find and purchase a piece of property in mccalla,alabama on which barber could retire.yessick consulted a realtor for this purpose,visited several properties himself,and,in november,signed a contract to purchase land in the name of roland pugh for.the next week,yessick gave the realtor a check for,signed by pugh cfo lorelei heglas.in anticipation of the cost pugh would incur for the land purchase,yessick instructed pugh cfo heglas to charge to the paradise lake project.
however,days before closing,roland pugh administrative assistant janice kuykendall told yessick that pugh no longer intended to buy the land in pugh name but instead planned to give barber a cashier check to buy the land in his own name.pugh assistant kuykendall told yessick to travel to tuscaloosa to get the check and then take back from the realtor all documents referring to pugh.
pugh yessick got the check,which was made out to the settlement attorney for,and on which the name of remitter line was left blank.yessick then gave barber the check.barber closed on the land contract in his own name on december.yessick also gave barber a cashier check for to replace the check he gave to the realtor.the realtor prepared papers to refund pugh deposit.
in september,a newspaper article revealed an investigation into pugh and barber.six months later,over a period,barber sent pugh a series of checks amounting to.yet barber paid no interest,and there was no evidence of any document indicating a loan.
at trial yessick testified that he paid the charged bribes in the hope that barber,who supervised the jcesd inspectors,would assist if pugh were to have a problem with an inspector being irrational.counsel for pugh and roland pugh argued that they did not provide things to barber with the intent to influence him the government presented b evidence showing that pugh yessick paid for chandler to go on a fishing vacation,that grady pugh bought a carpet for mcnair,that grady pugh made cash payments to mcnair,and that pugh worked on mcnair home in arkansas.
jury verdicts 
the jury convicted pugh on counts bribery conspiracy,in real property,and trips.roland pugh was acquitted on counts and,the only counts against him in the barber trial.pugh appeals all conviction counts.
vi.quid pro quo issues 
all argue that their bribery convictions under must be vacated because the indictment failed to allege,and the government failed to prove,the gave specific benefits to county employees in exchange for,and with the intent that,the employees perform a specific official act,termed a quid pro quo the also argue the district court erred,at a minimum,by refusing to charge the jury that the government must prove a specific quid pro quo.we begin by reviewing the relevant parts of 
section proscribes theft and bribery in connection with programs of local governments receiving federal funds section a b criminalizes a local government employee corruptly soliciting or accepting a bribe 
being an agent of a local government,or any agency thereof 
b corruptly solicits or demands for the benefit of any person,or accepts or agrees to accept,anything of value from any person,intending to be influenced or rewarded in connection with any business,transaction,or series of transactions of such government,or agency involving anything of value of or more or 
shall be fined,imprisoned not more than years,or both.
a b.defendants mcnair,swann,wilson and barber,as jefferson county employees,violated a b if they solicited or accepted anything of value with the corrupt intent to be influenced or rewarded in connection with any business,transaction,or series of transactions of jefferson county involving anything of value of or more id.the counts in the indictment as to mcnair and swann track the language of the statute.
section a also criminalizes corruptly offering or giving a bribe to a local government employee 
corruptly gives,offers,or agrees to give anything of value to any person,with intent to influence or reward an agent of a local government,or any agency thereof,in connection with any business,transaction,or series of transactions of such organization,government,or agency involving anything of value of or more 
shall be fined,imprisoned not more than years,or both.
id.a.the,roland pugh,rast,bobby rast,danny rast,fwde,and a if they gave to a county employee anything of value with the corrupt intent to influence or reward them in connection with any business,transaction,or series of transactions of jefferson county involving anything of value of or more.id.the counts in the indictment as to these also track the language of a.
it is well established in this circuit that an indictment is sufficient if it tracks the language of the statute and provides a statement of facts that gives notice of the offense to the accused.see united states jordan,cir united states walker,cir united states sharpe,cir united states ndiaye,cir.by listing the items of value received or given by the defendants,each count of the indictment provides sufficient facts and circumstances to give adequate notice of the charges to be defended against.thus,we readily determine the indictment itself was not defective for failure to allege a specific quid pro quo.
paradies and us infrastructure decisions 
nonetheless,this does not resolve whether the language in a b or a effectively requires the government to prove a specific quid pro quo to obtain a conviction.this question has been before this court twice before but only under plain error review,and even then,we did not squarely answer it.see united states infrastructure,at united states paradies,cir.
in paradies,the defendant claimed that the district court erred in failing to charge the jury that a quid pro quo was an element required to convict under id.at.this court did not decide if quid pro quo was an element but concluded there was no reversible jury charge error because the jury charge tracked the statutory language of and the defendant did not object to the charge.id.
the paradies court also rejected a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence.id.the paradies court stated the evidence at trial was sufficient for a jury to find that jackson the official accepted payments for his votes and his influence upon the city council and the administration,and s uch a finding would satisfy any quid pro quo requirement under the statute.id.in other words,paradies concluded that even if requires a quid pro quo,that requirement is satisfied by showing a series of payments intended generally to influence the official decisions.
subsequently,our united states infrastructure decision involved an appeal from the fifth trial the usi trial,that arose out of the indictment here.us infrastructure,at.the defendants in us infrastructure argued the jury charges on the counts were erroneous because they did not include their proposed instruction that the jury must find a specific quid pro quo to convict under.id.at.this court concluded that the district court did not commit plain error by refusing defendants quid pro quo jury instruction.id.at.as its sole basis for this conclusion,us infrastructure stated this court had already rejected this argument in two prior cases this court has rejected the argument that the government must show a direct quid pro quo relationship between the defendants and an agent of the agency receiving federal funds.us infrastructure,at quoting united states castro,cir,and citing paradies,at.however,as shown above,paradies did not actually make a holding to that effect.neither did united states castro nonetheless,us infrastructure itself holds a specific quid pro quo is not required for a conviction.because us infrastructure was only plain error review,we now make the same holding but under de novo review.
we begin with the statutory language itself importantly,a b and a do not contain the latin phrase quid pro quo.nor do those sections contain language such as in exchange for an official act or in return for an official act.in short,nothing in the plain language of a b nor a requires that a specific payment be solicited,received,or given in exchange for a specific official act.to accept the defendants argument would permit a person to pay a significant sum to a county employee intending the payment to produce a future,as yet unidentified favor without violating.
the requirement of a corrupt intent in does narrow the conduct that violates but does not impose a specific quid pro quo requirement.in all the trials consolidated in this appeal,the district court jury charge,with slight variations,defined corruptly as follows an act is done corruptly if it is performed voluntarily,deliberately and dishonestly for the purpose of either accomplishing an unlawful end or result or of accomplishing some otherwise lawful end or lawful result by an y unlawful method or means.it is acting corruptly dishonestly seeking an illegal goal or a legal goal separates permissible from criminal.the addition of a corrupt mens rea avoids prosecution for acceptable business practices 
for all of these reasons,we now expressly hold there is no requirement in a b or a that the government allege or prove an intent that a specific payment was solicited,received,or given in exchange for a specific official act,termed a quid pro quo.
as to the defendant county employees,the government must show only what a b says that a county employee corruptly accepted anything of value with the intent to be influenced or rewarded in connection with any business,transaction,or series of transactions of the county.and as to the,the government must show only what a says that the defendant corruptly gave anything of value to a county employee with the intent to influence or reward that person in connection with any business,transaction,or series of transactions of the county.
to be sure,many bribery cases will involve an identifiable and particularized official act,but that is not required to convict.simply put,the government is not required to tie or directly link a benefit or payment to a specific official act by that county employee.the intent that must be proven is an intent to corruptly influence or to be influenced in connection with any business or transaction,not an intent to engage in any specific quid pro quo 
c.other circuits 
in concluding does not require a specific quid pro quo,we align ourselves with the sixth and seventh circuits.see united states abbey,cir,cert.denied.stating the text says nothing of a quid pro quo requirement to sustain a conviction and while a quid pro quo of money for a specific legislative act is sufficient to violate a b or a,it is not necessary quotation marks omitted united states gee,cir holding that a quid pro quo of money for a specific legislative act is not necessary under a b and that an exchange of money for the official influence was enough united states agostino,cir we decline to import an additional,specific quid pro quo requirement into the elements of a.but see united states jennings,cir concluding the corrupt intent element in requires the government to prove a quid pro quo,but stating the quid pro quo requirement is satisfied so long as the evidence shows a course of conduct of favors and gifts flowing to a public official in exchange for a pattern of official actions favorable to the donor and the intended exchange in bribery can be this for these or these for these,not just this for that citations omitted.
the second circuit decision in united states ganim,cir,also supports our analysis to some extent the defendant ganim challenges to the jury charge primarily relate d to a single issue namely,whether proof of a government official promise to perform a future,but unspecified,official act is sufficient to demonstrate the requisite quid pro quo for a conviction under a b.id.at.although accepting a quid pro quo requirement for a bribery conviction,the second circuit rejected ganim claim that a direct link must exist between a benefit received and a specifically identified official act.id.at.the second circuit held that the requisite quid pro quo for the crimes at issue which included a b may be satisfied upon a showing that a government official received a benefit in exchange for his promise to perform official acts or to perform such acts as the opportunities arise.id.emphasis added.the second circuit added that so long as the jury finds that an official accepted gifts in exchange for a promise to perform official acts for the giver,it need not find that the specific act to be performed was identified at the time of the promise,nor need it link each specific benefit to a single official act.id.at.
the second circuit also explained that requiring a jury to find a quid pro quo ensures that a particular payment is made in exchange for a commitment to perform official acts to benefit the payor in the future,and o nce the quid pro quo has been established,however,the specific transactions comprising the illegal scheme need not match up this for that.id.at.the second circuit analysis lies somewhere beyond a pro quo requirement,as adopted by the sixth,seventh,and now the eleventh circuits,and the fourth circuit requirement.while the second circuit requires a quid pro quo,that requirement is satisfied by a quid thing of value in exchange for a promise to perform an unidentified,official act at some point in the future.id.at.in other words,in the second circuit the quo need not be specific or even identifiable at the time of the quid,and to that extent the second circuit arguably supports our conclusion.and to some extent,confusion reigns in this area because courts often use the term quid pro quo to describe an exchange other than a particular item of value for a particular action.
because there is no support for the quid pro quo argument in the text of,they rely on how the supreme court interpreted a different criminal statute,in united states growers of california.however,does not address,and there are significant differences in the text of the two statutes and.
the defendant was a trade association convicted of providing illegal gratuities under c a for having given tickets,meals,and other items to the federal secretary of agriculture.id.at.at.section c illegal gratuity provision prohibited from giv ing anything of value to any public official for or because of any official act performed or to be performed by such public official c a emphasis added in,the district court charged the jury it could convict if it found provided the secretary with unauthorized compensation simply because he held public office,and that t he government need not prove that the alleged gratuity was linked to a specific or identifiable act or any act at all.id.at.at emphasis added.the point in controversy was that the jury instructions suggested that an illegal gratuity did not require any connection between defendant intent and a specific official act.id.at.at.
the supreme court in concluded that c did require a link between the gratuity and a specific official act because the statutory text prohibited gratuities given or received for or because of any official act performed or to be performed and then defined official act as any decision or action on any question,matter,cause,suit,proceeding or controversy id.at.at quoting c a and a.and it was specifically this text of the illegal gratuity statute for or because of any official act that the supreme court in found to be pregnant with the requirement that some particular official act be identified and proved.id.at.at emphasis added.in stark contrast,none of these phrases are used in a b or a.
we recognize that the supreme court in also distinguished between a b bribery crime and a c illegal gratuity crime.id.at.at.the supreme court pointed out that bribery in b requires a showing that something of value was corruptly given,offered,or promised to a public official as to the giver or corruptly demanded,sought,received,accepted,or agreed to be received or accepted by a public official as to the recipient with intent,inter alia,to influence any official act giver or in return for being influenced in the performance of any official act recipient.id.at.at quoting b.the supreme court explained that t he distinguishing feature of each crime is its intent element.id.at.at.the supreme court explained further that in 
bribery requires intent to influence an official act or to be influenced in an official act,while illegal gratuity requires only that the gratuity be given or accepted for or because of an official act.in other words,for bribery there must be a quid pro specific intent to give or receive something of value in exchange for an official act.an illegal gratuity,on the other hand,may constitute merely a reward for some future act that the public official will take and may already have determined to take,or for a past act that he has already taken.
id.at.at emphasis added the supreme court also stated the district court instructions in this case,in differentiating between a bribe and an illegal gratuity,correctly noted that only a bribe requires proof of a quid pro quo.id.at.at.
although b requires that a bribe be given or received to influence an official act or in return for an official act,sweeps more broadly than either b or c.section requires only that money be given with intent to influence or reward a government agent in connection with any business,transaction,or series of transactions.a b a.section does not say official act but says any business,transaction,or series of transactions.id.section does not say in return for or because of but says in connection with.id.
more importantly,the supreme court in was concerned with accidentally criminalizing legal gratuities under c,such as giving a ball cap,a sports jersey,or token gift to the secretary of agriculture based on his official position and not linked to an identifiable act.id.at.at see ganim,at undergirding the supreme court decision in was a need to distinguish legal gratuities given to curry favor of an official position from illegal gratuities given because of a specific act.that concern is diminished here because contains a corrupt intent requirement.in any event,as reasoned by the second circuit,there is good reason to limit s holding to the statute at issue in that case,as it was the very text of the illegal gratuity statute for or because of any official act that led the court to its conclusion that a direct nexus was required to sustain a conviction under c a.ganim,at.nor is there any principled reason to extend holding beyond the illegal gratuity context.id.
rule of lenity 
we also reject argument that the rule of lenity requires us to read a specific quid pro quo requirement into.the rule of lenity may apply in a number of different circumstances.for example,t he rule of lenity is applied when a broad construction of a criminal statute would criminalize a broad range of apparently innocent conduct.united states svete,cir en banc quoting liparota united states,cert.denied.however,t he simple existence of some statutory ambiguity is not sufficient to warrant application of that rule,for most statutes are ambiguous to some degree.united states muscarello.the mere possibility of a narrower statutory construction by itself does not make the rule of lenity applicable.svete,at.application of the rule requires a grievous ambiguity.muscarello,at.at the rule of lenity applies only if,after seizing everything from which aid can be derived,we can make no more than a guess as to what congress intended.citation omitted.
the rule of lenity does not apply here because fail to identify a grievous ambiguity in a b or a,or to show that the statutory language criminalizes innocent behavior.section a b and a criminalize only those acts done corruptly,and,indeed,provides a defense for bona fide salary,wages,fees,or other compensation paid,or expenses paid or reimbursed,in the usual course of business.c.
defendants proposed jury charges 
in the mcnair,swann,barber,and wilson trials,all requested jury charges that included a quid pro quo requirement 
in the mcnair trial,the district court rejected the proposed quid pro quo instructions,gave the eleventh circuit pattern jury instructions for as to corruptly giving bribes,telling the jury 
as i said,the defendants,other than jewell chris mcnair,are charged in various counts of violating a portion of title,section,which makes it a federal crime or offense for anyone to corruptly give,offer or agree to give anything of value to anyone who is an agent of a local government receiving significant benefits under a federal assistance program intending to reward or influence that agent in connection with any business,transaction,or series of transactions of such local government involving anything of value of or more.
fifth and this is another thing that the government would have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt.
that each such gift,offer or agreement to give,that by each of those gifts,offer or agreement to give,the defendant corruptly intended to reward or influence jewell chris mcnair in connection with a transaction,or series of transactions,with jefferson county,alabama,which transaction or series of transactions involved something of value of or more.
sixth that in doing so,the defendant acted corruptly.
an act is done corruptly if it is performed voluntarily,deliberately,and dishonestly,for the purpose of either accomplishing an unlawful end or result or of accomplishing some otherwise lawful end or lawful result by an unlawful method or means 
the district court also gave the pattern jury charge,with slight variations,as to corruptly receiving bribes.the judges in the subsequent trials swann barber and wilson agreed with the district court ruling in the mcnair trial and gave jury instructions that did not include requested quid pro quo instructions 
given our conclusion that a b and do not require proof of a specific quid pro quo,proposed jury instructions containing that requirement were incorrect statements of law.thus,the district courts did not abuse their discretion in refusing them.see infrastructure,at determining omission of a specific quid pro quo requirement in jury instruction was not plain error paradies,at same.
in the mcnair trial,all also requested that the jury be instructed that if a thing of value was given out of friendship or merely to foster goodwill and not to corruptly influence or reward,then a verdict is required.after that request,the district court in the mcnair trial supplemented the pattern instructions with this 
section does not prohibit all gifts by or to a public official,does not prohibit all not prohibit receipt of all gifts by or to a public official,but only gifts received with the corrupt intent to be influenced or rewarded by that governmental official in connection with a business or transaction or series of transactions of that governmental entity involving or more.
after the insisted the district court specifically identify friendship and goodwill gifts as legal gratuities,the court responded if it corrupt and dishonest,it not for good will,is it the district court explained that giving instruction would carr y with it some sort of suggestion that i adopting that idea that that what these payments were.this exchange then took place 
the court what if it good will and corrupt 
roland pugh counsel it ca be.
the court okay.that your answer.
a finding that a gift was made or accepted with corrupt intent necessarily excludes friendship and good will gifts.there is no reversible error in the court charge in this regard 
vii.sufficiency of the evidence 
conspiracy and corrupt intent 
all challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to support their convictions on various counts defendants primary arguments are the government failed to prove a conspiracy among the defendants as to counts,and or any corrupt intent as to all the bribery counts 
to sustain the conspiracy convictions,the government must prove the existence of an agreement to achieve an unlawful objective,here,giving things of value to county employees with the corrupt intent to influence or reward them the defendant s knowing and voluntary participation in the conspiracy and an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy.us infrastructure,at see also united states jennings,cir.defendants argue the government failed to present any evidence of an agreement among them.
the problem for defendants is direct evidence of an agreement is unnecessary the existence of the agreement and a defendant participation in the conspiracy may be proven entirely from circumstantial evidence.united states massey,cir.a defendant may be found guilty of conspiracy if the evidence demonstrates he knew the essential objective of the conspiracy,even if he did not know all its details or played only a minor role in the overall scheme.united states guerra,cir.the government need not show each defendant had direct contact with each of the other alleged.id.it is not necessary for the government to prove that a defendant knew every detail or that he participated in every stage of the conspiracy.united states jones,cir.for a wheel conspiracy to exist those people who form the wheel spokes must have been aware of each other and must do something in furtherance of some single,illegal enterprise.united states fernandez,cir quotation marks omitted.a common purpose or plan may be inferred from a development and collocation of circumstances.us infrastructure,at quotation marks omitted.
extensive witness and documentary evidence firmly established that the things of value described in the conviction counts were given by the and accepted by mcnair,swann,barber,wilson,and other county employees.the defendants in the mcnair and swann trials mainly dispute whether the government proved they acted with corrupt intent versus for friendship,and in agreement versus independently.the government presented more than sufficient evidence of both corrupt intent and a conspiracy agreement.
first,ample evidence showed that the worked together on mcnair studio and swann home and that they did so with a common purpose of providing sizable benefits to influence mcnair and swann in the billion dollar sewer rehabilitation program.there was no evidence of gifts to these friends before the sewer projects began.instead,the gifts to mcnair and swann and other county employees were made during the same time period of the sewer projects.the large in bribes and sewer a common scheme of all to receive county sewer money through illegal means.the jury was free to disbelieve the defendants claims of gifts for friendship and to find corrupt intent to influence mcnair and swann in connection with the county massive sewer payments to the.the juries could readily believe the gifts worth hundreds of thousands of dollars to mcnair and swann after the sewer work began were actually bribes intended to make sure the contractors profited excessively from the work.in fact,the evidence recounted above showed pervasive and entrenched corruption.
second,the evidence of how the divided up and coordinated their work on the same personal projects for mcnair his studio and swann his home during the same time frame is strong evidence of a conspiracy.for example,fwde bailey supervised the construction of mcnair studio while pugh and rast provided labor and materials.rast furnished the labor to build the deck and pugh furnished the materials.rast excavated for the footings,and pugh ordered the concrete and poured concrete walls.fwde paid mosley construction for the wood framing initially,and then rast began paying mosley.fwde ordered the aluminum handrails,pugh paid for them,and rast installed them.the same pattern of dividing up the work was followed for the swann home.for example,an fwde employee supervised the work at swann home.pugh yessick hired a company to install a koi pond for swann,and pugh listed danny rast as a point of contact 
third,the extent to which the parties went to conceal their bribes is powerful evidence of their corrupt intent.for example,evidence in the mcnair trial showed fwde employed bailey as a construction superintendent for the mcnair studio renovation and reported bailey time as purportedly performed on a jcesd sewer project.fwde concealed a payment dougherty made to subcontractor george word construction for building mcnair arkansas retirement home fwde has no record of the transaction at all.the only existing record of this transaction was made by a bookkeeper,who copied the invoice and check and kept them at home because of his suspicions.fwde also supplied a construction superintendent,hendon,for swann home remodel.for nearly two years,hendon was on fwde payroll but actually spent half of every workday at swann home.fwde stanger replaced hendon for an additional nine months.dougherty was aware of this work at swann home.fwde paid a subcontractor over checks signed by frame the addition to swann home.
likewise,rast paid nearly for materials and subcontractors for mcnair studio.rast also supplied significant amounts of labor for mcnair studio,including excavating for the footings and constructing its deck and metal steps.rast hid these expenses by coding them to jcesd projects.
after a newspaper article revealed rast work on swann home,bobby rast told his bookkeeper that they did need any document invoices in the files with jack swann or chris mcnair shipping address on them,causing her to discard these invoices.before the article,rast had treated its payments to mcnair and swann as business expenses,deducting them on its tax returns.after the article,rast amended several years returns to eliminate more than of those deductions 
similarly,rast crews performed demolition work and poured concrete for the basement,walls,stairs,and elevator pit at swann home.rast also spent more than purchasing concrete and bricks and paying subcontractors to repair the plumbing,paint swann home,and install hardwood floors and stairs.as with mcnair,rast concealed its work for swann,in particular avoiding the use of swann name on invoices,delivery tickets,and accounting reports,and coding the work and expenses either to miscellaneous or jcesd projects.
pugh also concealed its work on mcnair studio.for example,when besco delivered steel to mcnair studio,besco delivery tickets identified pugh and yessick as its customer and indicated that some of the steel was for the valley creek treatment plant,a jcesd sewer job on which pugh was the contractor and fwde the consulting engineer.
defendants claim they could not have intended to corruptly influence mcnair because his authority was purely ministerial,since he only ratified what jcesd officials below him such as swann had already approved.given mcnair ultimate authority and responsibility,a jury could infer mcnair became a for the defendants pay requests,field directives,and contract modifications that crossed his desk because of the large sums in goods and services he received from the.and because he was responsible for placing sewer items on the county commission weekly agenda,mcnair controlled every sewer matter requiring commission approval 
pugh challenges to counts and 
pugh challenges the sufficiency of the evidence as to its bribery conspiracy convictions on count the wilson scholarship and count land and vacations for barber.however,ample evidence supports both convictions.
the evidence established that when grady pugh gave wilson son the scholarship,he expected wilson to return the favor.grady pugh testified that when he provided the wilson scholarship,he felt like if wilson got a chance to help us and return the favor,he would.only three days after wilson faxed grady pugh information as to where pugh should send the scholarship the day before grady pugh sent approved pugh request for a time extension that had been sitting on wilson desk for four weeks.when pugh submitted its extension request,pugh was already exposed to liability of in liquidated damages.the amount of exposure exceeded by the time wilson actually granted pugh request.
the evidence also supports the verdict that pugh and yessick conspired to bribe barber.barber oversaw all of the jcesd inspectors and awarded the emergency work contracts.in,and,pugh paid for barber vacations,but hid the payments in the company books.pugh readily agreed to barber june request to buy him a lot for a retirement home.pugh yessick contracted for the lot in roland pugh name but charged to the paradise lake project to pay for it.then,just before the closing,pugh instead gave barber a cashier check to buy the lot in his own name.the remitter name was left blank on that check.yessick was told to retrieve all evidence that pugh was ever involved.this required the realtor to fabricate a fictitious house sale to refund the original deposit.
moreover,just months before barber solicited pugh for the purchase of the lot,barber designated the paradise lake project as an emergency.because the cost of the project exceeded barber emergency work approval limit,and because there was no paradise lake contract on which to grant a field directive,the work was performed as a field directive on the unrelated multimillion dollar cahaba river project.pugh netted a profit of more than.
pugh argues the wilson scholarship and barber land transaction are not bribery conspiracies,but merely transactions.pugh relies primarily on two drug cases,united states mercer,cir cash for drugs,and united states dekle,cir sex for drugs,for the proposition that there is no conspiracy where there is merely a transaction without an agreement to join together to accomplish a criminal objective beyond that already being accomplished by the transaction.mercer,at quotation marks omitted.pugh argues that there was nothing agreed upon with wilson or barber outside of the one gift or one transaction.the drug cases of mercer and dekle are materially different from bribery conspiracy cases.in a drug deal,once the sale is complete,there is no further criminal objective.in cases,once the gift is made,the defendant typically intends to corruptly influence the county employee future actions.see united states tilton,cir bribee conspired with briber in part because of common goal of increasing their personal wealth.in cases,the defendants share both an anticipation of future action and a common goal of increasing their wealth illegally 
swann and pugh challenges to counts 
in the swann trial,swann,pugh,and yessick were convicted of eleven counts of honest services mail fraud under and.the convictions involve swann receiving landscaping services worth from pugh and yessick.on appeal,swann and pugh claim the evidence was insufficient to support their convictions

section adds honest services language to the offense,providing that the term scheme or artifice to defraud includes a scheme or artifice to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services.to prove honest services mail fraud,the government must show that the accused intentionally participated in a scheme or artifice to deprive the persons or entity to which the defendant owed a fiduciary duty of the intangible right of honest services,and used the united states mails to carry out that scheme or artifice.united states browne,cir.when a public official secretly makes his decision based on his own personal when an official accepts a bribe or personally benefits from an undisclosed conflict of official has defrauded the public of his honest services.united states,cir.
here,swann received approximately in landscaping and lawn maintenance from a company pugh that he had the power to favor in the sewer rehabilitation program.in the summer of,after swann told pugh yessick he had overspent in remodeling his house,yessick hired guthrie landscaping to landscape swann two properties.by december,pugh had paid guthrie more than,including per month in for lawn maintenance.in january,yessick asked guthrie to stop submitting invoices to pugh and instead advanced guthrie for three years of landscaping and maintenance.pugh paid a total of approximately to guthrie for landscaping work for the swanns 
although swann contends there was no bribe and none of this was done in secrecy,the evidence shows pugh and swann took steps to conceal any record of the services provided to swann.guthrie mailed its invoices to pugh and,at yessick request,identified the work by job number only.yessick directed pugh controller to charge the expense to the metro park roadway,a county job.guthrie invoices were never found in pugh files.
after swann and yessick learned of the investigation,guthrie was abruptly asked to stop working at swann home,even though there was a balance remaining on its advance.in august and september,approximately two years after hiring guthrie,yessick directed his assistant to create invoices to swann mother and for landscaping,tree removal,and remodeling work.the swanns then took out home equity loans in the names of their mothers,and wrote two checks to pugh totaling approximately on joint accounts they held with their mothers.yessick gave these checks directly to pugh controller,telling her they were partial payment for in landscaping work pugh had done,which work he had previously directed her to record as miscellaneous ar.yessick told the controller to credit the in checks to pugh as miscellaneous income and to write off the approximately that remained.
swann contends that pugh merely located the landscaping contractor and that he always intended to reimburse pugh for payments to guthrie.however,pugh and swann concealed the landscaping arrangement.the concealment itself is strong evidence that swann accepted these services not as a loan,but as a bribe.see united states hunt,cir,cert.denied.united states dial,cir.
swann also claims he was unable to,and did not,assist pugh in any way.yet,five days after pugh president yessick hired guthrie to landscape swann two properties,swann granted a extension for pugh joint venture on the vestavia trunk project.that extension saved pugh joint venture in potential liquidated damages.two months earlier,swann had denied a extension request on the same project,noting that timely completion of the project was a requirement of the specifications.and in,swann approved a field directive for pugh paradise lake project and caused it to be charged to the unrelated cahaba river project.as noted earlier,barber had designated the project as an emergency,and then swann later approved this field directive.
the evidence fully supports the jury guilty verdict on counts as to swann and pugh 
roland pugh arguments 
roland pugh challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction for conspiracy to commit bribery of mcnair count.roland pugh also argues the government failed to prove a wheel or hub and spoke conspiracy because there was no evidence he knew the rast and dougherty defendants the other spokes were bribing mcnair the hub.
this ignores the fact that roland pugh directed grady pugh to fly mcnair daughter and fwde superintendent bill bailey who was overseeing construction at mcnair studio on the pugh company airplane to georgia to pick out carpet for mcnair studio.before,roland pugh told grady pugh that mcnair has called now and says that he broke and he does have enough money to leave for the deposit on the carpet.so,if you would,write a check for the deposit.grady pugh paid the deposit with a pugh check and had it treated on the company books as an expense on the last rehab contract.
roland pugh also gave mcnair money in connection with the project to develop mcnair studio.when the project began,roland pugh told pugh other three owners,grady pugh,andy pugh,and yessick,that they had to give money to mcnair because he was building a studio and,as ten percent owners,they had to kick in their ten percent.grady pugh gave approximately in cash to roland pugh secretary that time to give to mcnair 
on another occasion,roland pugh collected money from the three other pugh owners to give to mcnair for his studio.on july and,three of them wrote checks to cash in proportion to their ownership interests.roland pugh,andy pugh,yessick.roland pugh gave grady pugh an envelope of money and asked him to give it to mcnair.grady pugh took it to mcnair studio where he saw fwde bailey and told bailey he grady pugh was there to help mcnair,and that it was financial help that mcnair needed at that time.grady pugh then visited with mcnair for a few minutes and set the envelope down between the seats of the van they were in as mcnair watched.after mcnair retired,roland pugh complained to grady pugh about mcnair demand for help building a retirement home,saying that surely this is the last time we have to do anything for him since he out of office.
later,after mcnair asked roland pugh to pay for the studio air conditioning system,roland pugh gathered funds by writing checks to his and to cash.once again,grady pugh delivered an envelope of cash to mcnair,this time at his house.
as a result,there was sufficient evidence for the jury to convict roland pugh and to find that he was aware of at least some of the other,such as fwde and fwde bailey,given that they were working on separate parts of a larger project.accordingly,we reject roland pugh sufficiency of the evidence challenge to his conviction on count.
the cases roland pugh relies on are inapposite.in united states chandler,cir,the hub of the conspiracy ensured there was no connection whatsoever between the various spokes,and the spokes knew nothing about each other.the evidence here shows that roland pugh was aware not only of pugh,yessick,and grady pugh involvement in the mcnair project,but also that of the dougherty and rast defendants involvement.for the same reason,united states glinton,cir,is not on point.id.at concluding hub and spoke conspiracy must have some interaction between those conspirators who form the spokes of the wheel as to at least one common illegal object quotation marks omitted.
mcnair arguments regarding dawson 
the evidence at the mcnair trial showed mcnair conviction for accepting a bribe from dawson is adequately supported.dawson firm received millions of dollars in engineering contracts from mcnair,and the vast majority of dawson work was on jcesd contracts.mcnair solicited the studio system from dawson.dawson was uncomfortable with the whole situation and would not have agreed if mcnair was not part of the sewer rehabilitation process,so he had the store conceal the delivery address on the invoice.
viii.b evidence 
all challenge the admission of other bad acts evidence under federal rule of evidence b specifically,they contend the district courts erred by admitting,for example,evidence in the mcnair trial and evidence in the swann trial.
federal rule of evidence b provides 
evidence of other crimes,wrongs,or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.it may,however,be admissible for other purposes,such as proof of motive,opportunity,intent,preparation,plan,knowledge,identity,or absence of mistake or accident 
b.this court uses a test to determine whether other bad acts are admissible under rule b 
first,the evidence must be relevant to an issue other than the defendant character second,the act must be established by sufficient proof to permit a jury finding that the defendant committed the extrinsic act third,the probative value of the evidence must not be substantially outweighed by its undue prejudice 
united states matthews,cir quotation marks omitted.i n every conspiracy case,a not guilty plea renders the defendant intent a material issue.evidence of such extrinsic evidence as may be probative of a defendant state of mind is admissible unless the defendant affirmatively takes the issue of intent out of the case.id.at alterations and internal quotation marks omitted.
moreover,rule b does not exclude evidence that is inextricably intertwined with evidence of the charged offense.united states wright,cir united states aleman,cir.rule b does not exclude evidence that is linked in time and circumstances with the charged crime or that forms an integral and natural part of an account of the crime to complete the story of the crime for the jury.wright,at quotations omitted united states edouard,cir.
we conclude the contested evidence was admissible for three reasons.first,the evidence was inextricably intertwined with evidence of the charged bribery offenses.second,even if not inextricably intertwined,this evidence was relevant to show corrupt intent and admissible under b.expressly argued they lacked corrupt intent and gave gifts to mcnair and swann out of friendship and good will evidence that the gave things of value to swann in mcnair trial and to mcnair in swann trial was highly probative of the intent.see edouard,at concluding extrinsic evidence is relevant where the state of mind required for the charged and extrinsic offenses is the same.moreover,evidence of similar conduct that occurs during the same time period has heightened probative value.jones,at.indeed,the district court judge,in the mcnair trial,explained in a order 
while the jury might conceivably find that the defendant felt such a strong sense of friendship with mcnair that they would give him substantial gifts or make him substantial loans,the fact that they gave alleged gifts or made loans to others involved with the same or similar projects would certainly be relevant to the issues of motive and intent.it could also bear on plan and i f the projects are the same or similar,they may well be a part of the same series of transactions.w hat might arguably be a gift to one person becomes less likely a gift if the gifts are widespread to others involved with the same or similar projects.
similarly in the swann trial,another district court judge found that this sort of evidence of intent is exactly what b testimony is here for.
third,the evidence was admissible under b to show the common plan and motive.specifically,the evidence showed a common plan of bribing county officials controlling the sewer projects by providing them with work on their personal homes or businesses and working together to do so during the same time frame of the sewer projects.for example,in the mcnair trial,evidence as fwde bailey was supervising,and rast and pugh were providing labor and materials for the mcnair studio stanger was supervising and using a rast credit card to purchase materials for swann separate home renovation.similarly,in the swann trial,the evidence showed that rast sent luke cobb to pour a concrete foundation for mcnair studio,just as he had done for the expansion of swann home,and that pugh had provided chandler with landscaping,just as it did for swann.indeed,the evidence recounted at length above gives repeated examples of how the b evidence was relevant to show both corrupt intent and a common plan and motive.
furthermore,the district courts in both the mcnair and swann trials gave limiting instructions for the b evidence several times during the trials.see united states,cir concluding prejudice could be mitigated by giving a cautionary instruction on the limited use of such evidence.in the mcnair trial,for example,after testimony of dougherty contributions to swann remodeling,the court instructed in part 
this evidence is being allowed for the limited purpose,with respect to dougherty,as to what dougherty intent may have been at the time that he may have made payments,or contributions,or gifts,to mcnair.not that mcnair is charged with receiving anything in connection with swann house.
but the evidence is allowed for the purpose of your considering that if dougherty was making some sort of payments,or contributions,or gifts,on behalf of mcnair and if he was also making some sort of gifts,or payments,or contributions on behalf of swann,you can consider that combination with regard to your determination,which will be a necessary determination for you to make,as to what dougherty and his company intent was,and the nature of that intent,whether it be corrupt or otherwise,at the time he made gifts,or contributions,or payments,on behalf of mcnair.
in the swann trial,the court gave similar limiting instructions several times 
and the jury acquitted some defendants on some counts while convicting them on others.this further demonstrates the jury was not confused and could segregate the b evidence from other evidence.united states prosperi,cir a discriminating acquittal also can signal that the jury was able to sift through the evidence properly.united states coy,cir concluding that a split verdict demonstrates absence of confusion for b purposes 
claim that the b evidence should have been excluded under rule lacks merit too.under federal rule of evidence,evidence must be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.wright,at.rule is an extraordinary remedy that must be used sparingly because it results in the exclusion of concededly probative evidence.us infrastructure,at.this court in us infrastructure rejected defendant usi argument that certain b evidence of a bribes of mcnair was inadmissible on rule undue prejudice grounds,stating in cases where this court has found other acts evidence inextricably intertwined with the crimes charged,the court has refused to find that the evidence should nonetheless be excluded as unduly prejudicial id.t he test under rule is whether the other acts evidence was dragged in by the heels solely for prejudicial impact.id.quoting united states veltmann,cir.because the other acts evidence was inextricably intertwined with the charged crimes,it was not excludable under rule.in any event,its probative value substantially outweighed any undue prejudice.
appellant mcnair also points out that the government did not introduce any evidence that mcnair knew about,condoned,arranged,or otherwise sanctioned any of the transactions constituting b bribe evidence against swann.however,the swann evidence was inextricably intertwined with the case against mcnair because sewer rehabilitation decisions went through two or three stages of review in some situations,and thus the evidence showed the were giving things of value to county employees at every level of the jcesd.for example,pay requests,contract modifications,and change orders were sometimes approved at the lower levels by the jcesd assistant director and engineers or by private engineers like fwde and dougherty,and then,when necessary,sent to swann as the jcesd then passed on to mcnair for approval or submission to the county commission with mcnair recommendation.the bribery of other county employees shown in the mcnair and swann trials was an integral part of the overall bribery scheme because it showed a common plan and motive of the and completed the story.the government amply showed linkage between bribes to mcnair and those to swann and other county employees and vice versa.while the usi trial considered in us infrastructure involved b testimonial evidence by electrical contractor henson,which is not at issue in this appeal,this court analysis in us infrastructure is apt here henson testimony was relevant to the chain of events surrounding the charged crimes,including context and setup us infrastructure,at 
finally,point out that the two trials were severed and that s everance under rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure is warranted only when a defendant demonstrates that a joint trial will result in specific and compelling prejudice to his defense.argue that,because the district court severed the case,it must have found that the jury would be unable to consider the evidence separately as it pertained to individual defendants.
this argument is unavailing.the district judge who severed these cases stated in a later telephone conference that,perhaps some of these cases did even call for severance,but i leaned toward trying to avoid as much confusion as i could.in the same teleconference,the district court ruled that b evidence of other bribes was relevant and that jury instructions would prevent improper use of that evidence.i going to assume that if i tell them three or four times,they understand it.at the beginning of the mcnair trial,the court stated the cases were severed because it would be cumbersome to try them together,but t hat does necessarily mean that evidentiarily,they not related.during the mcnair trial,the district court again rejected argument that severance of the counts meant that evidence related to the severed counts was irrelevant,stating 
but that does have anything to do with whether or not something is or is not relevant evidence to some other situation.that like saying,they indicted them for a bank robbery thing but you ca show that they spent some of the cash over here in another deal or something.
cite no legal support for their argument that severance per se means other bribe evidence can not be admitted.that the district court gave the defendants the benefit of trying mcnair and the in one trial,and then swann and the in a separate trial,does not mean all evidence about bribes to swann could not be introduced in the mcnair trial and vice versa.
ix.prosecutorial misconduct in mcnair trial 
as to their convictions in the mcnair trial,defendants pugh and roland pugh argue that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct by failing to correct grady pugh false testimony,and eliciting additional false testimony from grady pugh,thereby violating their due process rights specifically,these defendants argue that at trial grady pugh falsely denied having previously said he delivered cash bribes to mcnair before a may,trip to buy carpet and falsely testified that he delivered the money after that may,trip.
these cash bribes were part of counts and.during the mcnair trial,the time line of these events was at issue because it determined whether counts and were barred by the statute of limitations the jury acquitted pugh and roland pugh on counts and while the acquittal moots the statute of limitations issue,the time line of the cash bribes remains relevant only as to count bribery conspiracy and only because those cash bribes were alleged as overt acts in furtherance of the overall conspiracy to bribe mcnair,for which pugh and roland pugh were convicted.on appeal pugh and roland pugh argue grady pugh false testimony about the time line goes to his credibility and that if the jury knew he was lying,this could have affected the guilty verdict on count 
to establish prosecutorial misconduct for the use of false testimony,a defendant must show the prosecutor knowingly used perjured testimony,or failed to correct what he subsequently learned was false testimony,and that the falsehood was material see united states woodruff,cir united states dickerson,cir united states alzate,cir see also napue illinois.perjury is defined as testimony given with the willful intent to provide false testimony and not as a result of a mistake,confusion,or faulty memory.united states ellisor,cir.
when a government lawyer elicits false testimony that goes to a witness credibility,we will consider it sufficiently material to warrant a new trial only when the estimate of the truthfulness and reliability of the given witness may well be determinative of guilt or innocence.united states cole,cir quotation marks and alteration omitted.in other words,t he materiality element is satisfied if the false testimony could reasonably be taken to put the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict.dickerson,at quotation marks omitted.the false testimony is deemed material if there is a reasonable likelihood the false testimony could have affected the judgment of the jury.alzate,at united states barham,cir.
in addition,a prior statement that is merely inconsistent with a government witness testimony is insufficient to establish prosecutorial misconduct.united states michael,cir we refuse to impute knowledge of falsity to the prosecutor where a key government witness testimony is in conflict with another statement or testimony.hays alabama,cir determining there was no due process violation where there has been no showing that the witness later,rather than earlier,testimony was false united states gibbs,cir though knowing prosecutorial use of false evidence or perjured testimony violates due process it is not enough that the testimony is inconsistent with prior statements.united states brown,cir d ue process is not implicated by the prosecution introduction or allowance of false or perjured testimony unless the prosecution actually knows or believes the testimony to be false or perjured it is not enough that the testimony is challenged by another witness or is inconsistent with prior statements.
grady pugh testimony about cash deliveries 
the false testimony claim stems from notes the prosecutor made during grady pugh two meetings with the prosecutor for plea negotiations on june and.an fbi agent,counsel for grady pugh,and separate corporate counsel for pugh were also present.the prosecutor notes refer to grady pugh two cash deliveries to mcnair and his trip to georgia where grady purchased carpet for mcnair on may,for which grady signed a pugh company check bearing that date.the government disclosed the prosecutor notes to defense counsel several months before trial.
at the mcnair trial,grady pugh testified he delivered two envelopes of cash to first at mcnair studio and the second at mcnair home at christmas after he grady pugh took a flight to georgia to purchase the carpet on may.in response,pugh counsel sought to impeach grady pugh using the prosecutor notes,attempting to show the notes reflected grady pugh gave both cash envelopes to mcnair before grady pugh purchased the carpet on may.pugh counsel showed grady pugh the notes of the june,meeting indicating grady delivered two cash envelopes to mcnair 
grady pugh it says in here that i delivered money to the studio and to his house,in these notes 
pugh counsel does it not say,the next time that roland pugh asked grady pugh to deliver an envelope of money,it was to mcnair,was at mcnair studio 
grady pugh it says that,yes,sir.
pugh counsel okay.despite that,that does not refresh your recollection 
grady pugh despite what it says,it not true 
pugh counsel then showed grady pugh the prosecutor notes from the june,meeting and asked if he recalled that he told the prosecutor the two cash deliveries were before the carpet trip,but grady replied he did not recall saying it in that order as follows 
pugh counsel i want to direct you to the portion of the prosecutor notes which read,grady pugh delivered the second envelope of cash to mcnair at the studio.
pugh counsel and after that,i want to direct your attention to the portion of the prosecutor notes that say,bill bailey was there.and it continues,quote best i recall close quote,this was the first time grady pugh met bill bailey and then it continues.months later,grady pugh flew to georgia for the carpet does this refresh your memory that when you met with the prosecutor and an fbi agent,that the sequence you provided was that the first delivery was to the house,the second delivery was to the studio,and they were both done months before you flew to georgia for the carpet 
grady pugh i do recall saying it in that order.the order that i remember it in,is the order that i told you friday.i went to the studio first,then i went to the carpet,and then i went to mcnair house and that the way i remember it.that the way it happened.
pugh counsel suggested to the district court that he might call the prosecutor as a witness.the court responded i think whatever you be calling him for does amount to a hill of beans,and i not going to let it be done just to cause friction or embarrassment or whatever.so my strong inclination will be not to allow it.the defense did not call the prosecutor to testify.
in closing argument,pugh counsel argued grady pugh lied about the time line of these events,that his cash deliveries occurred outside the statute of limitations,and that the prosecutor notes supported this argument.pugh counsel also recited portions of the prosecutor notes 
we conclude defendants pugh and roland pugh have not met their burden to show grady pugh testimony was actually false,much less that the government knew it was false.first,the notes themselves are in bullet form and contain no dates nor any explicit indication that they were necessarily intended to be read in chronological order.at trial grady pugh agreed he had a clear recollection of what he said during the meetings.at trial grady pugh reviewed the notes on defense counsel instruction and stated that the notes were not laid out in the order that things happened,that he did not recall saying it in that order,and,d espite what it says,it not true.
importantly,the documentary evidence is consistent with grady pugh trial testimony that he delivered the money after the carpet purchase.the government introduced these checks on may,grady pugh signed a pugh check made out to the carpet store on july,grady pugh,roland pugh and yessick signed checks to cash totaling and from december to,roland pugh signed in checks to roland pugh and to cash.further,other witnesses corroborated grady pugh trial testimony.for example,bill bailey testified he flew with grady to pick out carpet and saw him again at the studio,where they talked about airplanes for a second before bailey asked grady if he was here to help chris mcnair again,to which grady answered yes.
even assuming that grady pugh denials of prior inconsistency were false or his time line of events was false,defendants,at a minimum,have not shown the prosecutor knew grady pugh testimony was false,especially given how the documents and other witnesses corroborated his testimony.
in any event,defendants have shown no reversible error.the jury heard the relevant portions of the notes read into the record when pugh counsel was grady pugh.during closing arguments,pugh counsel argued that the prosecutor notes contradicted grady pugh trial testimony and again recited relevant portions of the notes.defense counsel thoroughly and exhaustively grady pugh.defense counsel pointed out other inconsistencies within grady pugh trial testimony and in his grand jury testimony.the jury was also well aware grady pugh had made a plea deal and that the government assessment of his cooperation would impact his eventual sentence.the jury had the information it needed to make an informed decision as to grady pugh credibility.see united states calderon,cir c redibility determinations are the exclusive province of the jury.quotation marks omitted.therefore,because we find that the uncorrected,allegedly perjurious statements do not undermine confidence in the verdict,we reject defendants prosecutorial misconduct claims.dickerson,at citations omitted 
grady pugh testimony about 
defendants pugh and roland pugh also claim the prosecutor intentionally elicited from grady pugh the false testimony that everyone was taking notes at the meetings,even though the prosecutor knew he had instructed the fbi agent not to take notes 
at trial the prosecutor asked grady pugh about the 
q and when you signed that plea agreement,pugh,had you already met with us on two occasions at the fbi office 
q and when you met with the fbi and myself,was your lawyer there 
q and was the company lawyer there 
q and was everybody taking notes 
on,the defense attempted to clarify this assertion,but grady pugh stated that it looked to me like everybody was taking notes.pugh corporate counsel asked grady pugh,a nd do you remember that i objected and i indicated that i would take notes 
the foregoing colloquy is ambiguous as to whether the prosecutor was referring to the lawyers in the room or also to the fbi agent.grady pugh reasonably could have taken everybody to mean the two lawyers about whom the defense had just asked.moreover,while the record shows the fbi agent was not taking notes,defendants submitted no evidence that grady pugh counsel or pugh counsel were not taking notes in sum,the defense has not met its burden to show the prosecutor believed or knew grady pugh testimony was false.in any event,the defendants have not shown a reasonable likelihood that correction on this particular point,even if it did constitute false testimony,could have changed the jury evaluation of grady pugh overall credibility.therefore,it does not undermine confidence in the verdict.see dickerson,at.
statute of limitations in wilson trial 
in the wilson case,defendant pugh claims the district court erred by denying its motion to dismiss count as under the statute of limitations.see count charged that from about august and continuing though june,defendants pugh and wilson as jcesd chief engineer entered into a bribery conspiracy whereby wilson corruptly solicited and accepted,and pugh corruptly gave,a payment in the form of a bogus scholarship for wilson son with the intent of influencing and rewarding wilson for supporting pugh interests in connection with the jcesd sewer rehabilitation reconstruction program.count alleged that an object of the conspiracy was for wilson to enrich himself and that pugh and wilson conspired to conceal pugh payment to wilson by having it disguised as a bogus scholarship to uab.
pugh argues that count falls outside of the limitations period because the latest overt act by a charged in the pugh sending a check to committed no later than august,which was outside the limitations period of february,to february,the government responds that the indictment charged wilson receipt of the benefit of uab four quarterly disbursements to his son as four separate overt acts,and the last two disbursements march and june,were made to the son within five years of pugh indictment on february.in reply,pugh stresses that it is undisputed that uab and wilson son were not members of the bribery conspiracy,and thus there was no overt act by a within the limitations period.
in a conspiracy prosecution brought under the government in order to avoid the bar of the limitation period of must show the existence of the conspiracy within the five years prior to the return of the indictment,and must allege and prove the commission of at least one overt act by one of the conspirators within that period in furtherance of the conspiratorial agreement.united states davis,cir see grunewald united states,addressing a limitations period and concluding the government must prove that conspiracy was still in existence at beginning of limitations period and that at least one overt act was performed after that date united states dynalectric,cir stating if an overt act is necessary for the commission of the conspiracy,then the indictment must charge and the evidence at trial must show that an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy was made within the limitations period.
by contrast,for conspiracy statutes that do not require proof of an overt act,the indictment satisfies the requirements of the statute of limitations if the conspiracy is alleged to have continued into the limitations period.united states gonzalez,cir citation and quotation marks omitted determining rico conspiracy statute,unlike the general federal conspiracy statute,does not require an overt act.unlike conspiracy statutes that do not require proof of an overt act the conspiracy statute pugh was charged under,does require proof of an overt act.see requiring that one or more do any act to effect the object of the conspiracy.
as recounted above,wilson solicited the bribe to help pay his son college expenses in,and grady pugh mailed a check to uab on august.because the tuition had already been paid by fwde,wilson did not actually receive the full benefit of the check until uab disbursed the final installment to wilson son in june.the money disbursed to the son was a benefit to wilson because he would otherwise have paid his son expenses himself.furthermore,where enrichment is an object of a conspiracy,the conspiracy continues until the conspirators receive the full economic benefits anticipated by their scheme,and a conspirator receipt of a benefit can be considered an overt act.see united states anderson,cir united states girard,cir.for example,in anderson,the defendants conspired to obtain contracts by rigging bids in violation of antitrust laws and.id.at.although the contracts were beyond the limitations period,the final payment on one of the contracts came within it.id.at.the defendant anderson contended that the final payment was not an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy but merely the result of the conspiracy.id.this court held that a conspirator acceptance of payment on the illegally obtained contract constituted an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy and brought the conspiracy within the statute of limitations.id.
although acceptance or receipt of a benefit can be an overt act,that overt act must be an act that is knowingly committed.see united states hogue,cir stating as an essential element of a offense that the overt act was knowingly committed eleventh circuit pattern jury instructions criminal cases at an overt act under is any transaction or event which is knowingly committed by a conspirator in an effort to accomplish some object of the conspiracy.the jury in the wilson trial was correctly instructed on this point.
the problem for the government is the last two disbursements in were from a uab to another the son,and the government presented no evidence that defendant pugh through grady pugh or wilson knew that wilson was receiving part of the benefit of the in march or june,rather than all at once in august.there is also no evidence that grady pugh or wilson gave any direction to uab after august.at trial,grady pugh testified he was unaware of uab disbursement arrangements,and no evidence contradicted him on that point.likewise,there was no evidence that wilson was aware of the timing of the disbursements or that wilson had any communications at all with uab after the check was sent on august.accordingly,wilson receipt of the benefit of the march and june disbursements can not be considered overt acts knowingly committed by him,and the bribery conspiracy in count was beyond the statute of limitations 
for these reasons,we reverse pugh conviction on count.
xi.wharton rule 
defendants argue they can not be charged,convicted or sentenced on both conspiracy to commit bribery and the substantive offenses,and thus their convictions violate wharton rule.roland pugh additionally claims his sole conviction on count is barred by wharton rule.
as the supreme court noted in iannelli united states,ordinarily a defendant can be convicted of both conspiracy to commit a crime and the substantive crime itself.id.at.at.historically,wharton rule was only a narrow common law exception that provided that a defendant can not be punished for conspiracy and a substantive offense if the substantive offense itself requires the participation of two persons.see iannelli,at.at.the basic idea of wharton rule is that where a substantive crime requires a plurality of agents for its commission,a charge of conspiracy can not be used to impose a heavier penalty.united states collins,cir.
wharton rule reflects an era where conspiracy law was still developing,and it traditionally applied to offenses such as adultery,incest,bigamy and dueling that were characterized by the general congruence of the agreement and the completed substantive offense iannelli,at.at.wharton rule,however,is not grounded in the constitution or in double jeopardy law and has current vitality only as a judicial presumption,to be applied in the absence of legislative intent to the contrary.collins,at quoting iannelli,at.at accord curtis united states,cir.the former fifth circuit did not generally favor wharton rule,and it expressed doubt that it could ever be applicable to a conspiracy to distribute narcotics.collins,at citing curtis,at see united states previte,cir stating wharton rule is,to some extent a relic of the discredited merger doctrine and should be interpreted narrowly and explaining the rule does not forbid charging both a conspiracy and the substantive offense,even when it applies as it merely forbids sentencing on both counts.
in iannelli,the supreme court held that wharton rule did not apply to an illegal gambling statute.iannelli,at.the supreme court determined congress intended that conspiracy to violate and the substantive offense should be separate crimes,stating,h ad congress intended to foreclose the possibility of prosecuting conspiracy offenses under by merging them into prosecutions under,we think it would have so indicated explicitly.id.at.at.
we have already rejected,albeit without discussion,a wharton rule challenge to a conviction for conspiracy to commit bribery.united states evans,cir see united states finazzo,cir holding wharton rule does not apply to a conspiracy to commit bribery,noting the consequences of bribery not only affect the parties to the crime but have a negative effect on society at large,and pointing out the agreement connected with the substantive offense of bribery poses the distinct kinds of threats to society that the law of conspiracy seeks to avert quoting iannelli,at.at.
other circuits have concluded wharton rule does not preclude a conviction for conspiracy to violate a b.see united states bornman,cir united states hines,cir,cert.denied.
we now hold wharton rule does not apply to crimes for two reasons,either one of which is sufficient alone.for starters,congress has not expressed any intent that crimes and crimes for conspiracy to violate should merge.if congress had intended to foreclose prosecuting conspiracy offenses in crimes,it could have said so or merged the offenses.defendants point to nothing in the legislative history that suggests any intent to depart from the established general rule that a court can impose separate sentences for conspiracy to commit bribery and the substantive offense itself.
second,the effect of the crime of bribery is not limited to the and recipient,as the crime involves public corruption,which harms society as a whole.the purpose of,to protect the integrity of federal funds,indicates that the immediate consequences of the behavior it proscribes rest on society at large,in this case,on the federal government and the people of jefferson county.hines,at quotation marks omitted.accordingly,we reject defendants claims based on wharton rule 
xii.mcnair 
mcnair was sentenced to concurrent sentences on one bribery conspiracy count count and ten substantive bribery counts counts,from the mcnair trial and one bribery conspiracy count from the usi case count the district court ordered mcnair to pay restitution of to the jefferson county commission and a special assessment of but no fine.this restitution represented in bribes to mcnair by dawson and the pugh,rast,and dougherty defendants,and in bribes to mcnair by the usi contractors on appeal,mcnair challenges only the restitution part of his sentence 
presentence report 
mcnair presentence investigation report psi assigned mcnair a base offense level of,pursuant to added levels because mcnair conduct involved more than one bribe,pursuant to b and added levels because the net profit or benefit to the contractors in connection with their bribes of mcnair was between million and million,pursuant to b m and b a a total offense level of and a criminal history category of i yielded an advisory guidelines range of months imprisonment.
the psi pointed out the total value of the bribes received by mcnair was and that restitution was mandatory,pursuant to a.the psi reviewed mcnair financial records and determined his net worth was,calculated as follows 
cash assets 
checking accounts 
insurance,cash surrender value 
unencumbered assets 
motor vehicles 
equity in other assets 
mcnair investments mcnair studio 
total assets 
unsecured debts 
credit card debt 
internal revenue service 
total unsecured debts 
notably,mcnair net worth is largely due to his equity of in mcnair studio building that was improved with the bribe money 
the psi stated that mcnair monthly household income was,with monthly expenses of,resulting in net monthly cash flow of,calculated as follows 
defendant social security 
defendant jefferson county retirement 
spouse social security 
spouse teachers retirement 
total income 
necessary living expenses 
home mortgage 
groceries,supplies 
transportation 
auto insurance 
credit card minimum payments 
total expenses 
net monthly cash flow 
mcnair filed three sets of written objections to parts of the psi,and the psi was revised twice,resolving some objections.mcnair main unresolved objections were his claims that the government failed to show that there was any victim owed restitution and that was the amount of loss incurred by jefferson county.in his written objections,however,mcnair did not claim that he lacked the financial ability to pay restitution at all or in the amount of 
sentencing hearing 
at sentencing,mcnair again claimed the government failed to identify any victim and failed to show any identifiable losses by jefferson county or any connection between the bribes and the county losses.mcnair ultimately conceded he had received in things of value but only for purposes of the guidelines imprisonment calculations 
mcnair maintained that no restitution should be awarded,because the government had not shown the county suffered a loss in that amount or any amount for that matter.mcnair counsel argued that under title,the mandatory victims restitution act,that the government is required to show losses connected to victims,and that the amount of bribes paid to mcnair does not constitute losses to victims,and that there been no showing of that mcnair contended the amount of bribes paid to us is in no way connected to whatever losses these victims may or may not have sustained.mcnair claimed there was no showing that was the loss to the county.citing b ii twice,mcnair also argued the district court should not order restitution because the complexity and prolongation of the sentencing process in identifying victims and determining the amount of losses attributed to those victims outweighed the need to provide restitution.we pause to point out here that is the victim witness protection act vwpa,not the mandatory victims restitution act mvra,and the substance of mcnair argument comes from the vwpa and as discussed later,the district court judgment effectively refers to the vwpa.
during the sentencing hearing,mcnair again did not claim he lacked the financial ability to pay restitution at all or in the amount of referenced in the psi.ultimately,the district court found the jefferson county commission was the identifiable victim and found the amount of loss suffered was,reasoning 
c ommon sense seems to me that,in any business,it does intentionally go into business for the purpose of losing money that the evidence in all of these cases clearly shows that there was a great deal of profit to be earned from these sewer contracts.and it seems to me,commonsensically,that if you pay a certain amount of money as bribe money,whether it cash or for services performed,you going to add that back into the contracts or the bills submitted to the jefferson county commission which pays the bills,in the first instance.
it is how they do business.stated more clearly,it is a cost of business,a direct cost of business that it paid and made up for,at some point,by the jefferson county commission directly,and then indirectly to the rate payers of jefferson county.
recognizing the sewer construction contracts were awarded through a bidding process,the district court found that the benefit to the bribe payors did not necessarily accrue in the awarding of those contracts in the first instance,but,rather,the benefit accrued during the performance phase of the work that they were engaged to perform through change orders,through agreements to additional payments due to change orders,and things of that nature.the district court also found,a t some point,any direct cost of business is going to be added back by the bribe payors in the bills,the padded bills,that are submitted to the jefferson county commission,and therefore,the jefferson county commission,in the first instance,which paid those bids,is an identifiable victim.
the district court reduced mcnair total offense level by levels from in the psi to.specifically,the district court reduced the enhancement in the psi to a enhancement under b a and b h.for the b a calculation,the district court used the in bribes the contractors made to mcnair,not the in net profits or benefits the contractors received after determining mcnair offense level was and criminal history category was i,the district court determined that the advisory guidelines range was to months imprisonment 
the district court sentenced mcnair to months imprisonment for each count,to run concurrently,followed by two years supervised release,and ordered restitution of to the jefferson county commission and a special assessment of.although the advisory guidelines fine range was to,the district court did not impose any fine.after noting its review of the psi financial information,the district court stated it imposed restitution but no fine,as follows 
i reviewed the financial information provided in your presentence investigation.and in reliance upon that information,i find that you do not have the financial ability to pay even a minimum guideline fine.further,the imposition of such a fine would unduly burden your wife,who is totally dependent upon you for not just physical and spiritual,but financial support.therefore,no fine will be imposed.
i do order,however,as i must order,that you pay to the united states a special assessment in the aggregate amount of.you also are ordered to pay restitution in the amount of.that is due to the jefferson county commission at the address shown in paragraph of your presentence report.
at sentencing,the district court did not expressly state the statutory basis for its order of restitution.however,the district court judgment states that,pursuant to the victim witness restitution act,the court finds the jefferson county commission is a victim of mcnair criminal conduct,has sustained a loss in the amount of,and orders restitution in the amount of 
restitution for victim loss 
the vwpa,provides that 
the court,when sentencing a defendant convicted of an offense under title other than an offense described in section c,may order that the defendant make restitution to any victim of such offense,
b i the court,in determining whether to order restitution under this section,shall consider 
i the amount of the loss sustained by each victim as a result of the offense and 
ii the financial resources of the defendant,the financial needs and earning ability of the defendant and the defendant dependents,and such other factors as the court deems appropriate 
for the purposes of this section,the term victim means a person directly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of an offense for which restitution may be ordered including,in the case of an offense that involves as an element a scheme,conspiracy,or pattern of criminal activity,any person directly harmed by the defendant criminal conduct in the course of the scheme,conspiracy,or pattern.
the government bears the burden of demonstrating the amount of the victim loss by a preponderance of the evidence.united states futrell,cir citing e,which states,any dispute as to the proper amount or type of restitution shall be resolved by the court by the preponderance of the evidence.however,t he burden of demonstrating the financial resources of the defendant and the financial needs of the defendant dependents shall be on the defendant.e see united states twitty,cir stating the burden rests on the defendant to demonstrate lack of financial resources by a preponderance of the evidence.
county losses 
mcnair argues that the government failed to prove any losses suffered by the county.we disagree.for starters,the evidence showed mcnair received in goods,services,labor,materials,and money as a result of the bribery scheme.further,during the same time period,the received hundreds of millions of dollars in payments under their county contracts and made millions of dollars in profits 
and the district court did not clearly err in finding that the contractors essentially recouped their bribe money by adding it back to their sewer and engineering contract bills as a cost of doing business with the county.see united states devegter,cir assuming the bribe achieves its intended result,the benefit would usually exceed the bribe.see also futrell,at concluding the district court did not abuse its discretion in ordering restitution under the mvra based on approximation of loss resulting from defendants fraud.
the district court determination is consistent with supreme court precedent stating that when a public official acquires an benefit as a result of his office,the government suffers losses in that amount.see united states carter,
mcnair next contends the district court erred by failing to consider his financial ability to pay restitution and by not making an explicit finding that he had the financial ability to pay restitution of.we can locate no place in this voluminous record where mcnair claimed in the district court that he lacked the financial ability to pay restitution or the amount of restitution recommended in the psi and sought by the government.see jones,at.because mcnair raises this issue for the first time on appeal,we review it only for plain error.united states rodriguez,cir.we may not correct an error the appellant failed to raise in the district court unless there is error,that is plain,and that affects substantial rights.id.quoting united states cotton.if the preceding three conditions are met,we may exercise discretion to correct a forfeited error,but only if the error seriously affects the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.id.quotation marks omitted.
mcnair has not shown plain error for several reasons.first,d istrict courts are not obliged to make explicit factual findings of a defendant ability to pay restitution if the record provides an adequate basis for review.united states dabbs,cir quoting twitty,at accord united states fuentes,cir united states remillong,cir united states hairston,cir stating,i f the record provides an adequate basis for review,the court need not assign specific reasons for its decision to order full restitution.if the record is insufficient,reasons must be assigned.quotation marks omitted in order to warrant a reversal of the restitution order,the challenging party must show that the record is devoid of any evidence that the defendant is able to satisfy the restitution order.dabbs,at quoting united states davis,cir.however,we will not uphold the district court exercise of discretion if the record is devoid of any evidence that the defendant is able to satisfy the restitution order.remillong,at.
second,the record is not devoid of any evidence of mcnair ability to satisfy the restitution order.the psi set forth mcnair finances in detail,the district court said it had reviewed that financial information,and mcnair did not contest the facts as to his finances.there is no dispute that mcnair has equity of in his studio building,which was built in part using the bribe money.the studio value could reduce the restitution from to.
in addition,mcnair has a net cash flow of per month,which is about the size of his monthly jefferson county retirement check of.that retirement check alone permits mcnair to pay annually toward the restitution.five years of payments annually would equal over in restitution.the unique problem in this case,however,is that mcnair is now years old although the psi states mcnair reports no current medical problems or prescription medications taken on a regular basis,it would take mcnair years at per year to pay the remaining left in restitution.therefore,the record does not necessarily show that mcnair has the financial ability to pay the full in restitution.
nonetheless,under the fourth prong of plain error review,we conclude any error does not seriously affect the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings because mcnair,not the government,has the burden to prove lack of financial ability to pay the restitution in full the district court did not impose any fine but only restitution mcnair does not dispute that he received in goods,services,materials,labor,and other things of value no one,not even the district court if we remanded for further findings,knows how long mcnair will live and continue to receive his monthly jefferson county pension and thus be able to pay some restitution each month and the party owed this restitution is the same party currently paying mcnair per month,making it eminently fair to recapture these payments as restitution for as long as they are made.given all of the unique circumstances in this case,mcnair has not shown plain error in the district court restitution order.
mcnair also challenges the restitution order on the ground that united states booker,requires that the factual predicate for restitution be found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.mcnair booker challenge is foreclosed by our precedent.united states williams,cir booker does not apply to restitution orders,abrogated on other grounds by united states lewis,cir.we thus reject this argument 
for the first time on appeal,mcnair also claims the district court erred in ordering any restitution because roland pugh was not ordered to pay restitution.we review this claim for plain error.see united states rodriguez,cir.seven of mcnair were ordered to pay restitution,to wit pugh,bobby rast,danny rast,rast,swann,fwde,and dougherty.mcnair has shown no plain error in this regard 
for all these reasons,we affirm the restitution order as to mcnair.
xiii.swann sentence 
swann was sentenced to months imprisonment,followed by three years supervised release,on one bribery conspiracy count count,six substantive bribery counts counts,and,and eleven counts of honest services mail fraud counts.the district court ordered swann to pay restitution of and a fine of.on appeal,swann challenges the imprisonment and his fine but not the restitution.
presentence report 
the psi assigned swann a base offense level of,pursuant to added levels because swann conduct involved more than one bribe,pursuant to b added levels because the net profit or benefit to the contractors in connection with their bribes of swann was between million and million,pursuant to b a and b l and added levels for obstruction of justice,pursuant to a total offense level of and a criminal history category of i yielded an advisory guidelines range of to months imprisonment.
the psi provided a detailed financial analysis of swann assets,including his cash,checking and savings accounts,savings bonds,deferred compensation account,debt,investments,income,and living expenses.the psi reported swann had in assets,including in deferred compensation,in debt taxes and attorneys fees,and a net worth of.the psi stated swann monthly income was in jefferson county pension and salary for niece trust fund.thus,at the time of the psi,swann had an annual income of.
the psi reported that swann total monthly expenses were,calculated as follows 
necessary living expenses 
home line winwood 
home line winwood 
includes all credit card purchases 
other than medical 
auto insurance 
life insurance 
home maintenance insurance 
dry cleaning 
otc grooming 
lawn maintenance 
internet service 
total expenses 
the psi noted swann wife was retired from bellsouth,their newly remodeled home at winwood drive was in her name,and she owned their former home,at winwood drive two doors down,jointly with her mother and paid that mortgage according to the psi,swann wife had refused to provide any additional financial information for the psi.swann claimed he had no knowledge of the value of his wife investments,nor of the income generated from her investments or retirement.
in calculating swann fine under d the psi stated the gross loss amount was the benefit the contractors received.based on this information,the psi determined the guidelines fine range was to,double the gross loss amount pursuant to.the psi stated based on his financial condition it appears that the defendant swann could pay a fine within the guideline range or make a payment toward restitution shortly after sentencing through use of liquid assets.the psi noted that swann future ability to make payments on an installment basis will be dependant sic on several factors including the sentence in this case,his family situation,and his ability to contain monthly expenses.
the psi stated that restitution was mandatory under a the mvra and that the county had requested restitution.
swann objected to the increase to his offense level under b a,arguing his offense level should be based on the amount of bribes rather than the net profits or benefits the contractors received.section b a provides 
if the value of the payment,the benefit received or to be received in return for the payment,or the loss to the government from the offense,whichever is greatest i exceeded but did not exceed,increase by level or ii exceeded,increase by the number of levels from the table in theft,property destruction,and fraud corresponding to that amount.
b a swann argued there was no evidence of a causal connection linking any bribe to the award of any contract,and therefore,the adjustment under b a was improper.even if a quid pro quo is not required for a conviction,swann claimed evidence of a quid pro quo was necessary under b a to increase his offense level.
sentencing hearing 
at sentencing,swann objected to the psi on the ground that rast,bobby rast,and danny rast offense levels were based on the amount of bribes given,not the financial benefit or profit to them.swann also objected to any obstruction of justice enhancement.the district court sustained swann objection to the obstruction enhancement 
the district court,however,concluded the benefit,not bribe,amount should be used under b a and found the evidence was absolutely clear that there is at least million dollars that was benefit to the contractors.as support for the million figure,the district court cited instances where swann decided not to invoke the performance bond against rast,allowed rast to rebid the valley creek job for an additional million,and was involved in granting rast a million change order when rast boring machine became stuck.the district court found that a preponderance of the evidence established that the million benefit to the was a direct result of that influence of rast bribes.the court also pointed out that swann granted pugh joint venture a extension just days after pugh yessick hired a landscaper for swann property,saving pugh joint venture in liquidated damages.at sentencing,the district court expressly found a direct connection between the bribes to swann and the financial benefit to the contractors,stating 
i think it is absolutely clear that there is at least million dollars that was benefit,for instance,to rast,two change orders being million of the digging out of the boring machine and pulling out a boring machine and rebid of that job,million.the testimony as i recall it at trial and the testimony that was presented today,i conclude,based on the burden of proof that required,not beyond a reasonable doubt but by a preponderance of the evidence,that that is due to be calculated at as a gain of over million dollars,that because of the decision by swann that i believe was a result of the bribes and stuff that was provided him by rast,i think that that was a direct result of that influence of those bribes.and i am not going to go through the others.like for instance,the extensions,just one example is with regard to exhibit,the extension that was granted to pugh.a thousand dollars a day is what i recall the evidence to be that it would have been if they were granted that extension and that.i am not even necessarily having to go to the aspect of whether or not because swann was wilson supervisor the effect of the contracts or the approval of the committee because i find i am going to,for calculation of fine purposes,set that amount at million and one dollars.more than million,i am going to set it at million and one dollars as fact,actually i think i figured it at million at the bottom end,but i am going to set it at million and one dollars for the purpose of calculating the fine range,and i will ask him that you do that for me,and we need to recalculate the other.
the district court found that swann base offense level was,added levels because swann offenses involved multiple bribes,and added levels because the benefit to the contractors was between million and million,resulting in a total offense level of.see b a,b.this total offense level of and a criminal history category of i yielded an advisory guidelines range of to months imprisonment.
in considering the factors,the district court found that swann was not credible in stating his wife was the one responsible and he did not know that these contractors were doing the work and what was going on,had not indicated any remorse whatsoever,and refused to accept responsibility.the district court also considered that it was bribery on a large scale of a public official that had affected many people.the court noted the need to reflect the seriousness of this offense and to promote respect for the law and to provide just punishment for this offense.the court also commented that,because swann held a position of public trust,he was different than the that were bribing him.the district court stated it had considered all of the factors.citing swann history and character,the district court varied downward from the to months range and imposed a sentence of months imprisonment,followed by years supervised release 
importantly,the district court also stated that,even if it had adopted swann view that the b a calculation should be based on the bribe amount swann received instead of the net benefit to the contractors and even if swann total offense level was and his guidelines range was months,it would nonetheless vary upward on swann sentence,explaining 
c ounsel has urged me to utilize the guideline range that would result from considering the bribes of in calculating your sentencing range and indicated that if i used that,it would result in a guideline offense level,criminal offense level of when combined with a criminal history category of roman numeral one would result in imprisonment range of to months.i am going to state for the record that if i used that,i would nonetheless vary upward because i would believe that would not be sufficient to account for the other factors in that i am charged with the responsibility of weighing,including the nature and circumstances of this particular offense,as well as the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense,provide respect for law.i would have varied upwards,in other words,on that sentence.so if the eleventh circuit has any question about that when they get this on appeal which i suppose they will,if they ask or wonder what i would have done had i went that way,that what i would have done.i believe that appropriate and i have given that weight.i have actually considered that,and i started to just go ahead and do that.but i thought it appropriate in this instance because i think it is very clear that at least the million dollars that i discussed earlier was a correct calculation.
emphasis added.although the district court did not say the precise words i would impose the same months sentence the record is patently clear that is what the district court meant.
as to restitution,swann disputed that the amount of the bribes paid was,but conceded that,if restitution was owed,it should be based on the amount of bribes paid.based on the evidence,the district court found the total bribe amount swann received was.the district court rejected swann argument that restitution should be only the total bribe amount referenced in the conviction counts counts,that the jury found swann received beyond a reasonable doubt.the district court ordered swann to pay restitution of to the jefferson county commission.
as to the fine,swann pointed out he has no money,that his house was transferred to his wife name before he became aware of the subpoenas in the investigation,and that he lost the respect of his community and thereby lost his ability to earn a living.swann argued for a reduced fine but did not propose any specific fine amount.
after determining the advisory guidelines fine range was to,the court imposed a fine and a special assessment.as to the fine,the district court stated 
you are ordered to pay a fine in the amount of.i do know whether that collectable or not.i do think it is,but i think it appropriate considering the circumstances.
guidelines range calculations 
on appeal swann claims the district court improperly calculated his guidelines range because t he court utilized a net benefit approach instead of the amount of the alleged bribes in calculating the base offense level.this is a challenge to the procedural reasonableness of swann months imprisonment sentence 
as noted earlier,the bribery offense level is calculated using the greater of the value of the bribe payment or the benefit received in return.see b a.the value of the benefit received or to be received means the net value of such benefit.cmt.the net value of the improper benefit need only be estimated,and the bribe amount should be used only when the net value can not be estimated.devegter,at.the net value need only be a reasonable estimate given the information available to the government.united states cabrera,cir 
on appeal swann does not claim that the bribe amount he received was greater than the net benefit amount over million the received rather,swann argues that,to use the net benefit approach,the government first must show a connection,a quid pro quo between a particular bribe and a particular contract or action by a public official.swann claims the government evidence failed to show the requisite causal connection.
in this regard,swann first argues there is no connection between the bribes he received and the contractors revenue because he had no authority to award the sewer or engineering contracts.alternatively,swann claims,there was no tie or connection of any kind between any alleged bribe and any contract awarded even if appellant swann could have influenced the award of the contract.therefore,swann says,the proper loss amount to be utilized under was the amount of the alleged bribes paid to appellant swann and the court erred in failing to utilize said amount.swann points out that had the bribe amount been used as opposed to the million benefit amount,the district court would have added only levels not under,resulting in a total adjusted offense level of not.
this court has not addressed what type of connection under b a the government must establish between the bribe given and the benefit received.section b a does speak in terms of the value of the benefit received or to be received in return for the payment b a.other circuits have held that the threshold for establishing a causal connection under b a is low.see united states sapoznik,cir concluding that t o show that the bribes benefitted the people paying them the bar gambling,it is enough for the government to show that the bribes facilitated the gambling operations.united states kinter,cir stating t he threshold for the causation inquiry for calculations is relatively low.in sapoznik,the seventh circuit explained that the question of causation between the bribe and the benefit is different from the question of quantification of the actual benefit received,concluding the government had established a causal connection between the bribe and the benefit even though it had not shown the precise amount of the benefit to the.sapoznik,at.and the bribes need only contribute or facilitate the business activity involved.id.
here,given the wealth of evidence in the record,we readily conclude the district court did not clearly err in finding that the benefits the contractors received such as the rast revenue from the million change order,the rast job rebid for an additional,and the pugh time extension on the vestavia trunk sewer replacement project were a result of the corrupt bribes to swann.this amply satisfies any causal connection requirement in b a accordingly,we find no reversible error in the district court calculations adding levels under b a to swann offense level.
the district court alternatively stated that even if it used the bribe amount approach and not the net benefit approach,it would vary upward from the lower range to months urged by swann based on other factors in usc section that i am charged with the responsibility of weighing.therefore,we also conclude any error in the guidelines calculations as to swann was harmless.see united states barner,cir where a district judge clearly states that he would impose the same sentence,even if he erred in calculating the guidelines,then any error in the calculation is harmless.united states dean,cir,aff,dean united states.united states keene,cir.
substantive reasonableness 
swann also argues his sentence was substantively unreasonable because the district court impermissibly considered that swann showed no remorse,and because he was a public official,swann was more culpable than the contractors and,without his conduct,the could not have committed the crime 
this court considers the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed by inquiring whether the sentence is supported by the a factors.gall united states,
the district court need not discuss each of the a factors.united states talley,cir n othing in booker or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the section a factors or to discuss each of the section a factors.quotation marks omitted.the district court acknowledgment that it considered the defendant arguments and the factors in a is sufficient.id.
the district court consideration of swann lack of remorse was not improper.a district court is permitted to consider lack of remorse in its a analysis as to several factors,such as the characteristics of a defendant,the need to promote respect for the law,and the need to protect society.see united states kapordelis,cir stating district court did not abuse its discretion by considering defendant lack of remorse and affirming where district court found upward variance was necessary to protect society because it was unlikely that the defendant would be rehabilitated given his attitude and lack of remorse,cert denied.united states,cir upholding consideration of lack of remorse as a permissible factor under a as to the characteristics of a defendant,under a a to promote respect for the law,and under a c to protect the public from future crimes of the defendant.the district court also did not err in considering swann was a public official,another characteristic of the defendant.see a.
swann further argues there was an unwarranted disparity between his sentence and those of his bobby rast months,danny rast months,and dougherty months.swann claims bobby and danny rast received lower sentences because the district court sentenced them using the bribe amount not the net benefit amount in calculating their guidelines ranges under swann argues that in using the net benefit in his case,the district court created sentencing disparity with similarly situated because it had utilized different methods to calculate the guidelines range for various.this ignores a number of factors that differentiate swann from these particular swann was a public official and the private contractors were not,swann took bribes not just from the rast defendants but also from the pugh and fwde defendants,the district court found swann not credible in stating he did not understand the home remodeling work was intended to influence him,and swann showed a lack of remorse.simply put,swann has not proved he and these particular are similarly situated.
as to fwde and dougherty,swann also argues they received lower sentences because the district court applied an earlier edition of the sentencing guidelines.as to fwde,swann is incorrect because the psi and the district court applied the guidelines to calculate fwde sentence.as to dougherty,the guidelines were used.under the guidelines,a million net benefit resulted in a increase,rather than the increase in the version.compare b q,r with b l,m that a district court may have used the wrong version of the guidelines in a separate sentencing to the benefit of a defendant does not make another defendant sentence under the correct version unreasonable in any way.in addition,the dougherty defendants profits were much lower than the pugh and rast defendants,who also gave bribes to swann.also,swann ignores the fact that the district court granted a downward variance to months from his advisory guidelines range of months.swann has shown no reversible error in his sentence based on disparity with his.
swann fine 
the district court ordered that swann pay a fine of,based on a fine guidelines range of to approximately million.see.swann argues that the district court erred in not considering any of the fine guidelines factors,including swann ability to pay.
the sentencing guidelines require courts to impose a fine in all cases,except where the defendant establishes he is unable to pay and is not likely to become able to pay any fine.a.the defendant has the burden of proving inability to pay a fine.united states mcguinness,cir 
after determining a fine is appropriate,the district court shall consider these factors in fixing the amount of the fine 
the need for the combined sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense including the harm or loss to the victim and the gain to the defendant,to promote respect for the law,to provide just punishment and to afford adequate deterrence 
any evidence presented as to the defendant ability to pay the fine including the ability to pay over a period of time in light of his earning capacity and financial resources 
the burden that the fine places on the defendant and his dependents relative to alternative punishments 
any restitution or reparation that the defendant has made or is obligated to make 
any collateral consequences of conviction,including civil obligations arising from the defendant conduct 
whether the defendant previously has been fined for a similar offense 
the expected costs to the government of any term of probation,or term of imprisonment and term of supervised release imposed and 
any other pertinent equitable considerations.
while some circuits require that the district court make specific findings,we have adopted the less rigid approach,and do not require the sentencing court to make specific findings of fact with respect to the sentencing guideline factors as long as the record reflects the district court consideration of the pertinent factors prior to imposing the fine.united states hernandez,cir citations and quotation marks omitted see united states lombardo,cir holding that where the record contains sufficient information with respect to the factors to permit us to find that the district court did not clearly err in imposing or in setting the amount of the fine,we will not reverse merely because the district court failed to make specific findings on each of the factors.explicit findings on these factors are not required united states khawaja,cir.we have applied this rule to uphold a fine where the district court did not make explicit findings of fact as to the defendant ability to pay.united states long,cir.however,i f the record does not reflect the district court reasoned basis for imposing a fine,we must remand the case so that the necessary factual findings can be made.united states gonzalez,cir quotation marks omitted.
swann claims the psi said swann could pay a fine within the guidelines range or make a restitution but not both.that is not correct.we quoted the psi earlier as it says that swann could pay a fine or make a payment toward restitution shortly after sentencing with liquid assets,and then states it does not determine swann future ability to pay a fine or further restitution on an installment basis.
furthermore,the district court adopted the factual findings in the psi,which included numerous findings relevant to swann current income and future earning capacity.the psi set forth swann net worth,educational background,work history,and monthly income of,yielding annually.swann holds two bachelors degrees,one in civil engineering and one in textile management,and a masters degree in sanitary engineering.swann has retired from jefferson county but submitted no evidence to show he had tried and failed to gain employment.swann already has an annual retirement income of even without social security or future wages from working 
although swann makes two mortgage payments on the two winwood drive residences and pays over in monthly home utility,lawn,pest control,and maintenance expenses,the homes are in his wife name and she lives there too.the record shows swann can pay at least some fine.the record also shows swann counsel argued for a reduced fine and the district court considered the pertinent factors.as the district court reviewed the psi before imposing the fine and heard argument of counsel about the fine,we infer without hesitation that the district court considered the pertinent factors prior to imposing the fine.khawaja,at.
although swann has shown no clear error in the district court imposition of some fine,the record is not sufficient to permit us to say there is no error in the amount of the fine.as to the amount,the district court remarked i do know whether that collectable or not.i do think it is we can not glean from the record the basis for this statement or how the court determined that the fine should be as opposed to or,especially given the fine guidelines range goes up to million.thus,we vacate and remand as to the amount of the fine.see khawaja,at requiring remand where record does not reflect court reasoned basis for amount of fine.
xiv.pugh sentence 
pugh was sentenced to months probation on four bribery conspiracy counts counts involving mcnair,involving swann,involving wilson,and involving barber,nine substantive bribery counts,counts,and eleven counts of honest services mail fraud counts.the district court ordered pugh to pay a million fine,a special assessment of,and in restitution to the jefferson county commission.on appeal,pugh challenges only the fine.
presentence report 
the psi stated that pugh performed nearly million worth of construction work for sewer projects for jefferson county between and and that a majority of this work was for projects.the psi listed bribes given by pugh to mcnair,swann,chandler,barber,and wilson,totaling the psi stated that pugh had this net income million in,million in,million in,million in,and million in.pugh federal tax returns reported net income of million in,million in,million in,million in,and million in.
according to the psi,pugh received more than million in jcesd contracts related to the bribery conspiracy from august to june.this million reflected only pugh portion of its joint venture work for jefferson county.the psi determined that from to pugh earned an average profit of and that pugh profit from county contracts was million 
the psi assigned pugh a base offense level of,pursuant to a added levels because the offense involved more than one bribe,pursuant to b and added levels because the net profit to pugh was between and million,pursuant to b a and b l yielding a total offense level of under the d table,this total offense level of required a base fine amount of million.
however,the psi determined pugh pecuniary gain under a was its million profit from the county contracts.under a,the base fine amount became million,because pugh million pecuniary gain was greater than the million amount from the d fine table and greater than the pecuniary loss of suffered by the victim county.
the psi determined pugh culpability score was under,because pugh had or more employees and individuals with substantial authority board chairman roland pugh,ceo grady pugh,and president yessick participated in the offenses.this culpability score of resulted in a minimum fine multiplier of and a maximum multiplier of,under.based on these multipliers and the base fine of approximately million,the psi calculated the guidelines fine range to be to.
the statutory maximum fine was,pursuant to b,d,double the pecuniary gain of million.thus,the psi concluded pugh advisory guidelines fine range was to.
the psi stated pugh appeared unable to pay a fine within that million to million guidelines range and recommended the district court reduce the fine if it determined pugh was unable to pay the minimum fine amount.the psi noted that,under,the guidelines fine could be offset by,because pugh was a closely held organization,three of pugh owners roland pugh,yessick,and grady pugh whose total interests amounted to had already been fined for the same offense conduct,and one owner andy pugh had a interest and was not convicted in the bribery scheme.
pugh objected to the psi calculation of profits or pecuniary gain.pugh argued there was no evidence that pugh obtained any contracts,or the million in profits,because of its bribes.pugh contended its base offense level should be based on the amount of bribes pugh paid,which would result in a total offense level of and a base fine of million 
supplemental briefing before sentencing 
the district court ordered briefs addressing the fine amount.pugh brief reiterated its challenge to the psi calculations,arguing there was no evidence the county suffered any pecuniary loss from the bribery scheme.
the government recalculated pugh pecuniary gain based on a analysis of pugh contracts with the county.the government submitted a list of bribery and jobs,which showed the revenue earned,gross profit,gross profit percentage,and improper gain for each job.the government calculated an average unit price for items used by pugh in eight of its projects over a period from to and then compared those prices for this time period to the average unit price pugh charged the county for these items during the bribery period of to.the government determined pugh improper gain was million,while pugh made about million in normal profit.based on the improper gain of million and applicable multipliers,the government concluded pugh guidelines fine range was million to million 
pugh reply brief then challenged the government recalculation for failing to account for a price increase that occurred in and for using artificially low prices in and.pugh claims this skewed the government analysis of pugh profits to reflect greater profits during the bribery period.pugh also claimed that,to prove pugh profited from the bribery scheme,the government had to show that pugh bribes caused the prc to limit the number of contracts.
sentencing hearing 
the district court conducted a lengthy sentencing hearing,including two days of evidence and a partial day of argument on evidence assessment and factual determinations.the government presented evidence as to the bribes pugh paid and the revenue and profits pugh earned from its county contracts during the bribery scheme.for example,fbi agent tom mayhall calculated pugh improper gains by comparing the average unit price of items on invoices for sewer rehab jobs pugh submitted to the county during the bribery scheme through the end of with the average unit price of items on eight sewer rehab jobs pugh performed in and.based on this comparison,agent mayhall concluded pugh improper gain was approximately million agent mayhall testified about pugh bribes to county employees and the benefits pugh received from its county contracts and as a result of the prc decisions.pugh maintained that the increase in profits was not substantial and was based on areas of pugh business other than its work for the county.
the district court rejected the government pricing analysis,finding that the evidence failed to show the line items in pugh contracts were affected by the bribes pugh paid.the court found pugh paid bribes to county employees because pugh was afraid of what might happen if it did not do so and that what might have happened is that pugh might have lost all its contracts,those current and future,with the county and the profits associated with those contracts.the court further found,for example,that the swann bribes were designed to ensure that pugh stayed in good favor with swann so that pugh would have and continue to have the opportunity to receive contracts and be paid on contracts from jefferson county.the court later stated there was an expectation that if you do business with the county,you expected to do this.and i think that the reason pugh did it was because others were doing it and it wanted to protect the contracts it had.
the court also found that,beginning in august,pugh started making bribes too in order to maintain its standing in the revenues and profits realized in the contracts awarded by jefferson county and,indeed,they became extremely high profits during that bribe period.
the district court found that pugh made its first bribe in august and its final bribe in september.the court found that from september,to december,pugh benefitted from the bribes,during this period pugh generated from its county contracts a total profit of and given pugh in revenues,this profit was a profit margin during that period.using that profit to calculate the base fine amount,the district court determined the guidelines fine range was to.see.after considering pugh ability to pay,the district court reduced the fine to million.the district court then gave a million offset for fines paid by individuals who owned at least of pugh,which resulted in a final fine of million.
challenges to million fine 
on appeal,pugh primarily raises objections to the manner in which the district court arrived at the million fine,but none of them have merit.the psi contained extensive financial information about pugh revenue and profits.the district court are supported by the record and undisputed facts in the psi,and pugh has shown no clear error in any of them.pugh also has shown no legal error in any of the district court calculations regarding the advisory guidelines fine range or in any other matters under the sentencing guidelines.
pugh brief as to the fine mainly resorts to claiming pugh did not have adequate notice of certain arguments or adequate opportunity to respond.the record refutes those claims too.the parties submitted numerous sentencing briefs and offered a substantial amount of evidence as to pugh revenue and profits.pugh claims it did not know the district court would consider that the bribes were paid out of fear of losing contracts or future payments thereon.however,pugh counsel,in arguing that the bribes were unrelated to the prc,relied on the fact that the contractors feared what would happen if they did not pay bribes 
l et me explain to the court why i think the contractors make such payments to public officials.
t he best testimony that i heard about that was from william dawson.dawson was an engineer,independent,who was doing work for jefferson county mcnair invited him to come by the studio.and when he got there,mcnair said,dawson i never asked you for anything before,but what i would like is for you to buy me an equipment,some sort of a projector or something of that nature,and he had a book.and he said this is the model and this is what i would like to have.well,dawson did want to do that.and he went home and he thought about it and finally he did it.and he did it because he was afraid of what chris mcnair would do to him if he did.
so when these people come and put the touch on a contractor or someone,i think it the fear of the unknown.
in closing arguments,pugh trial counsel maintained that any benefits pugh provided to the county employees were given purely out of friendship.pugh can not now claim it had an inadequate opportunity to explain its motivation in paying bribes or to prepare for the ultimate approach the district court took in deciding on the amount of the fine.if anything,counsel argument succeeded in reducing the amount of the fine imposed to well below the advisory guidelines range of to.pugh has shown no reversible error in any procedural aspects of the sentencing proceedings before the district court in pugh case.
xv.conclusion 
we affirm all of the convictions except pugh conviction on count,which we reverse.we affirm mcnair sentence.we affirm swann sentence except as to the amount of the fine.while there was no legal error in the imposition of some fine for swann,we vacate and remand as to the amount of the fine.as to pugh sentence,we affirm the district court findings of fact as supported by the record and conclude there was no error in the district court calculations under the sentencing guidelines but in light of the reversal of its count conviction,we vacate pugh sentence and remand for resentencing without count 
affirmed in part,reversed in part,vacated and remanded in part.
