ira klein,a physician,treated a number of patients who had contracted hepatitis c.a jury convicted him of eighteen counts of mail fraud in violation of and counts of health care fraud in violation of for submitting false claims for many of those hepatitis c treatments.the jury also returned a special verdict finding that klein had received million in gross proceeds from the fraud underlying his convictions.klein was sentenced to months imprisonment,the bottom of his guideline range,which had been enhanced based on the amount of the loss,the number of victims,the violation of a position of trust,and obstruction of justice.the court ordered restitution.we affirm the convictions but vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing.
the typical hepatitis c treatment was a regimen that required three shots of interferon per week and daily ingestion of ribavirin.the treatments had various side effects that often required administration of various other drugs.regular blood samples were also taken to monitor the patients progress.
the patients typically visited klein office each monday,and he or one of his assistants would administer the first of the three interferon shots.during this visit,blood was usually drawn,and the patient was given a week worth of ribavirin capsules and two syringes so the patient could the other two shots during the week.klein frequently did not collect for these weekly visits but would submit insurance claims for the office visit,the lab work,the medications,and the administration of the medications.
two days later,klein would submit insurance claims for the medication and the administration of the medication that the patients.two days after that,he again would submit claims for the third shot.if the patient received additional medicine to treat,klein would file claims for those medications.
when billing for the medications he distributed,klein did not claim the wholesale price of the drug.a particularly egregious example involved his purchase from the manufacturer of kits that packaged interferon and ribavirin together.these kits were intended to allow patients easily to the drugs at home.instead of claiming the wholesale price of the kit,klein broke the kits down,distributed the components,and charged the insurance companies for the separate prices of the components.for example,in at least one instance klein purchased the kit for approximately but billed the insurance companies for providing the medications and administering the injections.
in addition to claims for medications and for drug prices,klein for certain procedures.for example,he would submit claims for routine venipunctures coded as though the procedure required a physician skills,instead of using the code for routine venipuncture.he also used the code appropriate for a detailed examination when the actual exam was a brief.there was also evidence that he filed the same claim for the same patient with multiple primary insurers.
the government presented the testimony of don mcwhorter,an investigator with the texas department of insurance,to establish the amount of klein fraud.mcwhorter concluded that klein had fraudulently billed and received from the insurance companies.mcwhorter based his testimony on patient interviews and an extensive review of klein patient records and insurance billing records and the insurance companies records.
mcwhorter calculated the amount of klein intended fraud by totaling the amount billed for patients on days for which there were no progress notes in the patient file.in other words,mcwhorter took the absence of a progress note as evidence that the patient did not visit klein office and therefore received no treatment,rendering klein claim to the insurance company fraudulent.mcwhorter did not offset the total intended fraud by the value of the medications on those days.
the district court sentenced klein based on a total offense level of and a criminal history category of i.the presentence report psr began with a base offense level of,then increased the offense level by twenty based on the amount of the intended loss,the psr added two levels because there were more than ten victims the nineteen insurance companies and two levels for violating a position of trust in relation to the insurance companies.the psr did not add two levels for obstruction of justice,so the total offense level was,with a range of to months imprisonment.
following argument from the parties,the court adopted the psr but found that klein had obstructed justice and therefore added the enhancement.with a new offense level of,klein range was to months.the court sentenced him to the bottom of the range.
the obstruction enhancement resulted from a series of events after being indicted,klein was released on bond.during this time,his wife said she intended to divorce him.believing she had traveled to their home in florida,klein flew there and,not finding her at home,set the house on fire.he was trapped in the garage,had to be rescued,and was subsequently arrested and charged with arson.the court revoked his bond,and he was put into a federal detention center.
while there,klein spoke with several inmates about the possibility of hiring someone to kill his wife and,if necessary,her parents and a friend.he also discussed having the prosecutor the ausa and the fbi agent on his case murdered.after klein spoke with two inmates,they reported the conversations to the fbi.an undercover agent then posed as the cousin of one of the inmates and as someone who could arrange the murders.in two recorded conversations,klein indicated a desire to go ahead with the murder of his wife and parents and friend,if necessary to prevent her from testifying at a deposition in their divorce proceedings.he expressly told the undercover fbi agent not to touch the ausa or the fbi agent until he directed them to do so.apparently,to avoid suspicion,klein did not want them harmed too close in time to his wife death.at some point,he wired to an account set up to finance the assassinations.
the psr did not include the enhancement for obstruction of justice,because the probation officer believed that the threats against klein wife were not attempts to obstruct justice in light of the fact that she was not noticed as a potential witness in klein criminal trial at that time.with respect to the ausa and the fbi agent,the probation officer concluded klein had merely discussed killing them but had not taken affirmative steps toward their murder the affirmative steps klein did take were directed toward his wife death,which was not related to his indictment.
finally,the court ordered klein to pay in restitution.the court based this amount on mcwhorter calculation and additional claims by the sheet metal workers local health and welfare fund and shbf.
klein contends that the court erred by refusing two of his proposed jury instructions.first,the court denied an instruction defining a scheme to defraud as one that is reasonably calculated to deceive persons of ordinary prudence and comprehension.second,the court declined an instruction that named as a specific element of health care fraud that the victims,the health insurance companies,must have affected interstate commerce.
we review alleged error in jury instructions for an abuse of discretion,reversing only when the charge as a whole leaves us with substantial and ineradicable doubt whether the jury has been properly guided in its deliberations.a district court abuses its discretion in omitting a requested jury instruction only if the requested language is substantively correct is not substantially covered in the charge given to the jury and concerns an important point in the trial so that the failure to give it seriously impairs the defendant ability to present effectively a particular defense.

according to klein,the failure to instruct the jury that a scheme to defraud must be reasonably calculated to deceive persons of ordinary prudence and comprehension impaired his defense that he acted in good faith and was not attempting to deceive the insurers,but instead that he informed them of how and where he treated his patients.essentially,klein claim is that,though his insurance claims may have been false,they were not calculated to deceive.
the court instructions detailed the elements of mail and health care fraud mail fraud requires,inter alia,that the defendant knowingly created a scheme to defraud and acted with a specific intent to defraud health care fraud requires,inter alia,that the defendant executed a scheme to defraud and acted knowingly and willfully,that is,with intent to violate a known legal duty.the court included that intent to defraud means an intent to deceive or cheat someone.and instead of adopting klein proposed instruction for scheme to defraud,the court used a definition substantially similar to the one in the fifth circuit pattern jury instruction a scheme or artifice to defraud includes any scheme to deprive another of money,property,or of the intangible right to honest services by means of false or fraudulent pretenses,representations,or promises.
the instruction did not seriously impair klein defense that he did not deceive the insurers because they were aware of where and how he treated his patients.klein counsel could have used the intent to defraud definition given by the court by arguing that klein lacked the intent to deceive because the insurers were aware of how and where he treated his patients.the instruction did not mislead the jury or impair klein defense.
section makes it a crime to defraud a health care benefit program,which is defined as any public or private plan or contract,affecting commerce b.klein avers that the failure to instruct the jury that affecting interstate commerce is an element of health care fraud under mandates that we overturn his convictions for health care fraud,at least where the government can not prove the error was harmless.
we first address whether affecting interstate commerce is an essential element of the federal crime of health care fraud we previously have said that it is probably correct that the jurisdictional element of is an essential element of that offense.united states hickman,cir in analogous situations,we have held that affecting commerce language is an element of the crime that the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt in light of our precedent,the language in does create an element,which the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt 
the district court instruction,however,arguably included the requirement.though the court did not expressly identify an effect on commerce as an element,it closely followed its statement of the elements,which included the language to defraud any health care benefit program,with the definition of such a program any public or private plan or contract,affecting commerce,under which any medical benefit furthermore,the court included a general explanation of interstate commerce.
klein concedes all of this but urges that the failure to include affecting commerce as an element misled the jury.we need not decide whether the failure specifically to name affecting commerce as an element was error,because klein contention that the court abused its discretion fails on the third prong of the test.
klein made no argument in the district court or now that the denial of his proposed instruction seriously impair ed his ability to present effectively a particular defense.lucas,at.klein failure to brief this issue adequately constitutes waiver.see united states martinez,cir.additionally,the court instruction included a discussion of affecting interstate commerce such that klein could have made the only argument that hinges on that the insurance companies did not affect interstate commerce.in light of the latitude given the district court formulation of jury instructions and klein failure to demonstrate how his defense was impaired,the court did not err by denying the proposed instruction.
klein argues that there is insufficient evidence of effect on interstate commerce for counts and.these eight counts concern klein treatment of three patients,who he claims were insured by companies that the government failed to prove affected interstate commerce,namely cigna healthplan of texas cigna and blue shield of texas.
we review the district court denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal de novo.united states leed,cir.our review for sufficiency of the evidence following a conviction is narrow.we will affirm if a rational trier of fact could have found that the evidence established the essential elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.westbrook,at citations omitted.we must consider the evidence,all reasonable inferences drawn therefrom,and all credibility determinations in the light most favorable to the prosecution.id.
there is more than sufficient evidence from which the jury was entitled to conclude that both of these insurers affected interstate commerce.we note several examples.
there is evidence that cigna provided medical benefits to the employees of scientific drilling international,and the policy included specific riders for employees living outside texas there is also evidence that cigna provided benefits for mariner post acute network,of atlanta,georgia,and the mila managed health care trust fund headquartered in new york,new york.
additionally,a blue shield of texas special investigator testified that blue shield of texas had reciprocal agreements with blue shield entities in other states.the witness explained,by way of example,that if you in michigan and you come to texas and you have services,they would bill the texas plan.but the michigan plan would reimburse texas for it.from this and other evidence,a rational trier of fact could conclude that cigna healthplan of texas and blue shield of texas affect interstate commerce.
klein contends that the probation officer,in preparing the psr,and the court,in adopting it,erred in their calculation of the amount of loss suffered by the victims,the insurance companies.though we review a sentence for abuse of discretion,gall united states,d,we review the district court application of the guidelines de novo and its findings of fact at sentencing for clear error.see united states olis,cir.an error in applying the guidelines is a significant procedural error that constitutes an abuse of discretion.see gall.at.
the amount of loss calculation should account for the fair market value of the property returned and services rendered,by the defendant to the victim before the offense was detected.cmt.e i.the psr primarily relied on mcwhorter testimony and calculations in determining the amount of intended loss.the psr loss calculations exactly match mcwhorter except for the addition of the claims made by the sheet metal workers local health and welfare fund and shbf 
mcwhorter led the investigation of klein for the texas department of insurance and testified that he calculated the amount of intended loss by totaling the amount billed by klein for patients on days for which there were no progress notes in the patient file.mcwhorter took the absence of a progress note as evidence that the patient had not visited klein office and therefore received no treatment.thus,mcwhorter concluded the total billed on those days was fraudulent.he acknowledged that,on those days,klein patients various drugs klein had dispensed,but mcwhorter calculation did not credit klein for the value of those drugs.
no one disputes that the patients needed those drugs and that the insurers would have had to pay for the drugs had klein merely written prescriptions.thus,klein contends the psr overstates the amount of loss,and we ought to vacate his sentence and remand for the district court to calculate the amount of loss properly.
the government concedes that the amount of loss adopted by the court does not give klein credit for the value of the drugs his patients the government,however,characterizes the loss amount as a finding of fact that we ought to review for clear error.furthermore,it contends that the court need only have made a reasonable estimate of the loss.cmt.c.and,because t he sentencing judge is in a unique position to assess the evidence and estimate the
