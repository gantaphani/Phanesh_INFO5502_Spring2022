background 
on september,a grand jury indicted gross on four counts of attempting to evade or defeat the payment of tax for the tax years.the charge relating to the tax year,however,was dismissed before trial.gross was also charged with three counts of making and subscribing to a false tax return and one count of presenting a fictitious financial instrument,although none of these charges are at issue on appeal.
with respect to the charges,the evidence presented at trial established the following undisputed facts.from through,gross worked as an electrician at highgate electric highgate,during which time highgate regularly withheld funds from his paychecks for his federal income taxes.gross total federal income tax liability was in,in,and in.in march,gross submitted a form to highgate on which he claimed to be exempt from withholding for the tax year.gross submitted another such form in may,though he used a form.as a result,highgate deducted no taxes from gross paycheck during some of,nor did it deduct any taxes for any of the tax years,or.furthermore,gross did not file federal income tax returns for,and,despite the fact that the income he received was well over the amount needed to trigger the filing requirement.at trial,an expert determined that gross federal income tax liability for those three years would have totaled.the expert calculated this amount,in part,by looking at the forms obtained from highgate.
at the close of the government case,gross moved for a judgment of acquittal,arguing,in part,that the filing of a false form did not amount to an affirmative act of evasion for purposes of and that the paperwork reduction act pra rendered gross failure to file a form legally inadmissible.dist.doc.trial tr.vol.iv at.the district court deferred ruling on the motion until after the jury returned a verdict.the jury subsequently convicted gross on all counts.shortly thereafter,gross renewed his motion for a judgment of acquittal,and the district court denied the motion.
the probation department subsequently completed a presentence investigation report psr,which determined that the tax loss with respect to gross convictions amounted to.this amount included the that gross owed for the tax years,plus the that gross owed for the tax year.when combined with the tax loss stemming from the other offenses for which gross was convicted,the total tax loss amounted to.based on this amount,the psr assigned gross a base offense level of,which ultimately became his total offense level.because gross had no criminal history,his criminal history category was i,and his guidelines range was to months of imprisonment.
gross submitted numerous objections to the psr.furthermore,prior to the sentencing hearing,gross filed two motions to dismiss.one of the motions was again based upon the pra and the other argued that the district court lacked jurisdiction.at the sentencing hearing,the district court summarily rejected gross objections and motions,and sentenced gross to months of low end of the guidelines range.gross appealed.
ii.analysis 
overview of applicable law 
on appeal,gross challenges only his three convictions pursuant to for attempt to evade or defeat tax.under the government must prove willfulness,the existence of a tax deficiency,and an affirmative act constituting an evasion or attempted evasion of the tax.boulware united states,internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.this offense is distinct from the willful failure to file misdemeanor under which requires the government to prove only that the defendant willfully failed to pay income tax or perform one of the other requirements specified under that section.sansone united states.
taking gross arguments in a logical order,we first address his claim that the district court lacked jurisdiction for purposes of venue,appellant br.at.we are unclear as to what precisely gross is arguing.as best we understand it,gross claims that s ince october,no internal revenue districts existed which included the eastern district of michigan or elsewhere.id.at.as a result,gross asserts that there was no place to which gross could submit his tax returns,so that he never incurred a tax deficiency as required by.as the government correctly observes,however,gross never challenged venue prior to trial despite the fact that the alleged defect was readily apparent on the face of the indictment.as a result,gross has waived any objections.see united states grenoble,f d,cir 
gross also argues that,because the internal revenue service irs obtained copies of gross forms from highgate,gross was not required to submit a tax return.it is unclear,however,which district court order he is challenging or whether he ever even raised this issue below.in any event,under any standard of review,gross argument is without merit.
we first note that gross was not convicted of failing to file under,but rather was convicted of affirmatively attempting to evade payment of his taxes by filing false forms.therefore,it is not entirely clear what gross achieves by proving that he was not required to file a tax return.even under,however,a form obtained from an employer is not a substitute for a tax return.gross is correct that something short of a form may be adequate for a taxpayer to escape criminal liability.see united states patridge,cir,cert.denied,section requires a return but does not define that word or require anyone to use form,or any official form at all.in re hindenlang,cir,cert.denied,applying a test in determining whether a document constitutes a tax return.nonetheless,a return must still contain sufficient information given from which the irs can calculate tax liability based on the circumstances of the taxpayer income year.united states grabinski,cir hindenlang,at see also united states saussy,cir,cert.denied,u.approving jury instructions containing similar language.as the government correctly observes,a form merely lists income derived from an employer and provides no information regarding other sources of income,possible deductions,or other information that might be relevant to the calculation of an individual tax liability.see bachner comm r,cir.furthermore,even if his employer forms supplied sufficient information from which tax liability could be determined,gross never actually submitted this form to the irs.see united states stillhammer,cir t he test is whether the defendants returns themselves furnished the required information for the to make the computation and assessment,not whether the information was available elsewhere.therefore,we conclude that,under either or,a taxpayer is not excused from filing a tax return simply because the irs obtained that taxpayer form from his employer.indeed,to our knowledge,every court to have addressed this issue,including our own in an unpublished decision,has reached a similar conclusion.see,united states boling,wl,at cir,unpublished decision,cert.denied,united states bennett,app x,cir unpublished decision stillhammer,at.
paperwork reduction act 
gross next argues that,because of the paperwork reduction act pra,et,he was not required to submit a tax return.presumably,gross is challenging either the district court denial of his motion for a judgment of acquittal or its denial of his motion for dismissal.in either case,this court reviews the decision de novo.united states utesch,cir district court legal conclusions in denying a motion to dismiss are reviewed de novo united states.burchard,cir denial of a motion for acquittal reviewed de novo with evidence considered in the light most favorable to the government.
