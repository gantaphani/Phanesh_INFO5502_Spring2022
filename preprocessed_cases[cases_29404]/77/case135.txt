appellant mark phillips was convicted,after a jury trial in the district of maryland,of securities fraud,mail fraud,wire fraud,and access device fraud.he now appeals his conviction,arguing that the district court erred under the fourth amendment in denying his motion to suppress evidence seized pursuant to a search warrant.according to phillips,the agents executing the search warrant exceeded the warrant scope by seizing items not expressly named therein.
after careful consideration,we reject phillips claim.we hold that the warrant inclusive language was reasonably read by the agents to encompass the seized evidence and that the agents seizures were therefore permissible.accordingly,we affirm the judgment.
in early,the united states postal inspection service began a fraud investigation of appellant mark phillips.the investigation revealed that over a period of approximately three years,phillips had fraudulently applied for several credit cards,using his father identity and declaring a false income.phillips then used those fraudulent credit cards to make expensive purchases.among other items,phillips bought several pieces of stereo,exercise,and computer equipment,collectible coins,a pool table,a telescope,and a samurai sword.ultimately,phillips accumulated hundreds of thousands of dollars of credit card bills and either did not attempt to pay those bills or attempted to pay with bad checks.
investigators at the postal inspection service also uncovered other fraud perpetrated by phillips.for example,phillips possessed two driver licenses,each with his own photograph,address,and date of birth,but each with a different name mark le roy aaron and mark edwards phillips.additionally,investigators learned that phillips had opened an account for frequent gamblers at an atlantic city casino using his father social security number and had made over in cash withdrawals on that account.a criminal search history revealed that phillips had previously been arrested on state charges of theft by deception and issuing bad checks.
during the course of the investigation,postal inspection agents also became aware that phillips was the ceo and founder of a business called phydea,which provided online financial stock reports.some of phillips fraudulent purchases helped to fund phydea.for example,he used a fraudulent credit card to pay interland web hosting for the hosting and maintenance of his business website,and he used a fraudulent card to purchase advertisements for phydea,which appeared in investor business daily.also,phillips frequently used phydea corporate name in connection with his credit card fraud.for instance,phillips bought entertainment equipment with a fraudulent visa card using the internet address phillips made a purchase on ebay using the address phillips fraudulently applied for an american express card using the address ceo phydea.com and when applying for the same american express card,phillips misstated his income as million and misstated phydea annual revenue as million.unbeknownst to the postal inspectors at the time,however,phillips was using phydea in connection with more than just credit card fraud he was also using it and a related investment vehicle,phydea equity fund,as part of an elaborate securities fraud scheme.
in july,the postal inspection service sought a search warrant for phillips maryland residence.the magistrate judge approved the search warrant,finding probable cause for violations of access device fraud,fraud in connection with identification documents,and bank fraud.
the search warrant and incorporated affidavit authorized the seizure of a wide range of items and documents.specifically,part i of attachment a described items and services purchased using fraudulent credit cards.it contained a number of specific examples,including but not limited to p ayments to interland web hosting for the hosting of a webpage titled.part ii of attachment a listed i tems that relate to or constitute evidence,fruits,or instrumentalities of violations of,or,as described in the affidavit.like part i,part ii listed numerous examples including but not limited to the following relevant categories 
category a mail,books,records,receipts,notes,ledgers and other papers relating to fraudulent conduct and financial crimes,including but not limited to those documents and records relating to payments to interland web hosting for the hosting of a webpage titled.
category c books,records,receipts,bank statements and bank records relating to fraudulent conduct and financial crimes.
category d checks,pass books,bank checks and any other items evidencing the obtaining,secreting,transfer,concealment expenditure of money.
category j c redit cards,in any form and credit card account numbers,payment device account numbers of any kind.
the affidavit also set forth additional details relating to phillips case and the evidence of his fraud.
prior to executing the search warrant,inspector judy starliper,the head of the investigation,thoroughly briefed all agents on the facts of phillips case.her operations plan summarized the investigation and informed the agents that phillips has a webpage called and uses the same address to make his purchases.each agent was provided a copy of attachment a listing the items to be seized.during this briefing,another agent,inspector david reardon,informed the team that he had received a complaint from an aggrieved investor in phydea equity fund,an entity related to phydea,and therefore requested that the agents alert him if they saw anything relating to phydea or phydea equity fund during the search.
immediately following the briefing,the postal inspection service team executed the search warrant.during the search,inspector reardon himself identified several documents relating to phydea and phydea equity fund.he noted that these documents contained personal identifying information which was in many regards what inspector starliper was looking for in an identity fraud situation and potentially related to many of the fraudulent credit card purchases made using phydea name.to err on the side of caution,inspector reardon brought the documents to the attention of his superiors,and inspector starliper telephoned the united states attorney office to seek guidance on whether the phydea and phydea equity fund documents were seizable.after reading the warrant and accompanying affidavit,the assistant united states attorney concluded that the warrant authorized their seizure.
in executing the warrant,the agents seized a number of documents and records that not only helped confirm the investigators suspicions of credit card fraud but also revealed to the investigators for the first time the full extent of phillips securities law violations involving phydea and phydea equity fund.among these seized documents and records are several categories of evidence that phillips now contests documents and records relating to phydea,including invoices for the phydea advertisements appearing in investor business daily documents and records relating to phydea equity fund,including the files of individual investors and some of phillips own financial records,including his bank statements.
in april,the united states charged phillips with counts of securities fraud b,mail fraud,wire fraud,and access device fraud a.a federal grand jury indicted phillips on all counts.prior to trial,phillips filed a motion to suppress the evidence seized pursuant to the search warrant.he argued that the contested seizures fell outside the scope of the warrant,because the warrant did not explicitly mention those items.
following a evidentiary hearing,in which the district court heard testimony from a number of witnesses,the district court denied phillips motion to suppress.in reaching its decision,the district court made the following findings.first,it found that the seizure of documents was proper,because those documents were seized in connection with the credit card investigation.in so finding,the court noted that phillips had used several fraudulent credit cards to make purchases in connection with phydea and that phillips had misstated phydea income on a fraudulent credit card application.second,the district court held that the agents were justified in seizing documentation relating to phydea equity fund,because at the time of the search,it was unnecessary to draw fine distinctions between the two entities of phydea and phydea equity fund.third,the district court concluded that phillips personal financial records were seizable,because they were relevant to demonstrating his income,which he misstated on a fraudulent credit application.significantly,the district court concluded that the seizing agents at all times throughout the search acted in good faith and acted responsibly,reasonably and sensibly.
following the district court denial of phillips motion to suppress,the seized evidence was admitted,and phillips was tried by a jury.ultimately,phillips was convicted on all counts and sentenced to months in prison.phillips now appeals his conviction,arguing that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress.
in reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress,we review the district court legal conclusions de novo and its factual findings for clear error.united states neely,cir.
phillips makes a variety of claims,some of which appear to merge and overlap.phillips contends that the postal inspectors seizures exceeded the scope of the search warrant.the gist of his argument is that the warrant authorized the seizure of items on the basis of probable cause for criminal charges relating to credit card fraud and identity fraud.therefore,phillips claims,the seizure of items relating to securities fraud was not authorized by the terms of the warrant.this argument fails for reasons of both law and fact.
a search conducted pursuant to a warrant is limited in scope by the terms of the warrant authorization.walter united states,d plurality see also united states squillacote,cir.however,a search warrant is not a constitutional strait jacket.united states dornhofer,cir citation and internal quotations omitted.in interpreting search warrants,we must heed the supreme court reminders to employ a commonsense and realistic approach,united states ventresca,d,and avoid hypertechnical scrutiny lest police officers be encouraged to forgo the warrant application process altogether.united states robinson,cir citing illinois gates,d.these fundamental legal principles apply not only to determining the validity of a warrant but also to assessing its scope.united states srivastava,cir.
mindful of these considerations,we are confident that the contested seizures in this case fell comfortably within the warrant scope.even those seized documents forming the cornerstone of phillips securities law violations were authorized by the language of the warrant,which is broad and permissive.part i of attachment a,for example,contains an extensive list of fraudulently purchased items,including,among other things,a morgan silver dollar,a celestron nexstar gps telescope,a canon chip camcorder,a pool table,and a player.part i does not stop there,however.it includes not only the items themselves but also evidence of appliances,devices,furniture,equipment,property,items generally,and services that represent purchases using credit cards obtained by fraud proceeds of other forms of fraud or financial crimes.emphasis added.because phillips purchased phydea advertisements in investor business daily with a fraudulent credit card,the invoices relating to the purchase of that advertising service thus fall within the scope of part i as evidence of services that represent purchases using credit cards obtained by fraud.
the language used in part ii of attachment a is even more comprehensive,describing i tems that relate to or constitute evidence,fruits,or instrumentalities of violations of,or.part ii gives some specific examples of such evidence but cautions that those examples do not constitute a complete listing,using the phrase including but not limited to.moreover,the categories of evidence in part ii are broadly inclusive,describing,among other types of documents,m ail,books,records,receipts,notes,ledgers and other papers,computerized electronic records,bank statements and bank records,and c hecks,pass books,bank checks.
the remainder of the contested seizures falls within the ambit of part ii inclusive language.for example,phillips personal financial records were seizable because they were evidence that phillips did,in fact,misrepresent his individual income on a credit card application.phillips claims that,because he applied for the credit card in his father name,he misstated only his father income,which could not be verified with his own financial records.however,officers could not be expected to parse that sort of distinction on the spot,especially since phillips added himself as an authorized user to the same credit card.similarly,many phydea and phydea equity fund documents fall within the broad language of part ii,since these documents were relevant to proving that phillips misstated not only his personal income but also his company income on a credit card application.the individual investor files,for example,were relevant to this inquiry,because the amount that investors invested in phydea or phydea equity fund was tied directly to the companies revenue and expectations of revenue.
further,because phillips used his personal bank accounts to write bad checks,and,moreover,wrote bad checks to credit card companies,the agents were justified in seizing his bank statements and bank records.in cases of financial fraud,the financial records of a suspect may well be highly probative of violations of a federal fraud statute.srivastava,at citation omitted.to be sure,not every item that falls within the language of the warrant will prove probative in a future criminal prosecution,but that is not the point.the language of the warrant is inclusive for this very reason,namely that the evidentiary significance of each and every item may not be instantly apparent.
phillips,however,urges a reading of the warrant language that defies the commonsense and realistic interpretation demanded of us.his position would require us to hold that an item reasonably encompassed by the terms of the warrant somehow falls outside its scope because the item is probative of charges other than those initial charges set forth by the warrant.in his case,phillips argues that because the warrant was issued for various credit card offenses,the seized items relevant to securities fraud as well should somehow be suppressed.this is not the law.courts have never held that a search is overbroad merely because it results in additional criminal charges.see,andresen maryland,d.often,a single piece of evidence will be probative of multiple crimes,especially in cases like this one,which involve intricate,interweaving,and extensive financial fraud schemes.
our recent opinion in united states srivastava,cir,is instructive.there,we addressed a situation in which officers execution of a warrant issued for medical billing fraud turned up evidence of tax fraud.id.at.the defendant cardiologist contested the seizure of personal tax records under a warrant issued to investigate his business medical billing practices.id.at.the court found this argument unpersuasive in light of the significant nexus between his personal and business operations.id.noting that the defendant operated his business as a subchapter s corporation,thereby passing business income through to himself as an individual for tax purposes,we explained in such circumstances,it is difficult to realistically define a bright line between personal financial records and business records.rather,it is consistent with both common sense and realism to deem the financial records relating to the medical practice as being nearly synonymous with the financial records of him individually.id.
here,too,phillips fraudulent schemes were interrelated and the evidence of each intermingled.the various schemes were mutually reinforcing phillips misrepresentations of his own identity,among other things,enabled him to obtain fraudulent credit cards his credit card fraud underwrote his securities fraud,facilitating the purchase of advertisements intended to lure i
