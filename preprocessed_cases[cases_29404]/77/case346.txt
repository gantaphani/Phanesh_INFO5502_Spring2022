in these writ proceedings,petitioners iar systems software,iar and valla and associates,valla,seek a writ of mandate ordering the trial court to vacate its finding of june,that valla,a law firm,should be deemed part of the prosecution team prosecuting nadim shehayed for embezzlement.in addition,petitioners request that we set aside the related order granting the motion of defendant and real party in interest,nadim shehayed defendant to order valla,as part of the prosecution team,to disclose material,exculpatory evidence in its possession in accordance with brady maryland brady.for reasons addressed below,we agree the trial court erred,first,in imposing a duty under brady to disclose material,exculpatory evidence directly on valla,as opposed to on the prosecution,and,second,in finding valla to be part of the prosecution team.accordingly,we grant the requested relief.
factual and procedural background 
defendant served as chief executive officer of iar for nearly years sometime around,iar discovered evidence that defendant had embezzled large sums of money from the corporation by,among other things,paying personal debts from the corporation bank accounts and paying salary and retirement benefits to his wife,who was not an iar employee.accordingly,on september,iar,represented by valla,filed a civil lawsuit against defendant in san mateo county superior court.in october,valla,on behalf of iar,made contact with the foster city police department to report the suspected crime s.trial in the civil case was then set for september.just days before this first trial date,the san mateo district attorney district attorney charged defendant with felony embezzlement 
on may,following an extensive preliminary hearing,the people filed this criminal action,charging defendant by information with six counts of embezzlement pen.code,enhanced with allegations of excessive taking within the meaning of penal code sections,subdivision a,and,subdivision a 
on july,defendant served its first subpoena on valla,requesting categories of documents.on august,at a scheduled hearing,valla responded in part to this subpoena by producing over documents in electronic form,while moving to quash other document requests on privilege grounds.the motion to quash was ultimately resolved when defendant agreed to narrow his document requests.he then filed a second subpoena on september,that demanded production of documents relating to a february,email from the district attorney to valla.valla,in turn,responded by moving for a protective order with respect to documents protected by either the or privilege.
on december,defendant filed the motion at the heart of these writ proceedings,seeking an evidentiary hearing to determine whether valla was part of the prosecution team and,as such,subject to the brady disclosure requirement of producing any material and exculpatory evidence in its possession notwithstanding the privilege.the motion for protective order was thus taken off calendar and a new hearing was scheduled on february,to permit the people to file a written opposition.at this hearing,the court summarily scheduled an evidentiary hearing with respect to the brady issue for april.
on march,petitioners filed a petition in this court requesting that we set aside and vacate the february,order for an evidentiary hearing,arguing that this hearing would violate the constitutional right of a victim to wit,iar to reasonably confer with the prosecutor regarding the charged offenses,as well as iar right to the protection of the and privileges.in addition,petitioners argued that,as a matter of law,the attorney for a crime victim can not be deemed part of the prosecution team.we denied this writ petition without prejudice,advising petitioners of their right to renew it if appropriate after the scheduled evidentiary hearing.
the evidentiary hearing was thus held on may and june.among other things,antonio valla,the founder of valla,testified that the firm did not conduct legal research or investigate the charged offenses solely at the request of the police or district attorney or take any action with respect to defendant other than in its role as attorneys for iar.to the contrary,valla merely turned over information to law enforcement that it had independently obtained in discovery in the civil action brought against defendant.further,michael purcell,a legal associate at valla,testified that the firm did not ask the police or district attorney for assistance in the civil discovery process or in its legal research in the civil matter,nor did the firm have any sort of agreement with these agencies.rather,the firm arranged and scheduled meetings between the police and district attorney and its client,iar,and provided these agencies with information that was already in its or its client possession.
both elizabeth nardi and kimberly perrotti,san mateo county deputy district attorneys,confirmed this testimony.while it was standard procedure for the district attorney office to communicate with a crime victim here,iar through its attorneys,they did not ask valla in this case to gather evidence,interview witnesses or find specific witnesses on its behalf.similarly,detective william beck of the foster city police department testified that the police conducted its own investigation without guidance from valla,and did not ask valla to gather specific evidence,make specific discovery requests or talk to specific witnesses.valla did,however,forward a copy of defendant deposition transcript to the police.
with respect to iar selection and hiring of a forensic accountant,deputy district attorney nardi wrote an email to valla on june,noting the financial complexity of the case against defendant and describing the impediments her office faced in determining whether to bring charges against him 
obviously,an embezzlement case of this magnitude which spans nearly a decade involves a lot of paperwork and financial analysis.our office does not have the resources to interpret the voluminous financial documents nor is that our role.our role is sic take what documents other evidence a police agency presents to our office in any criminal matter murder,embezzlement,dui,and determine if there is enough evidence to prove to a jury of twelve beyond a reasonable doubt that a crime has been committed.
as such,a case of this complexity is impossible to prove without an independent financial audit.i can not compel you to hire an auditor nor can i direct foster city pd to hire an independent financial auditor.while our office works with police agencies,we are not their boss and can not direct them on how to conduct a criminal investigation.the district attorney role is to take the information that is presented to us and make a determination if we can pursue criminal charges.that being said,if iar does go forward with an independent financial audit,the company needs to hire someone who will be available to testify in san mateo county.while iar is a global company the forensic auditor would be our star witness at the preliminary hearing stage as well as a jury trial should the case come to that and needs to be available to testify.
at the hearing,valla testified his understanding of deputy nardi email was that the district attorney was requesting that iar provide information and expertise from an independent financial auditor retained by iar.detective beck,in turn,testified that the responsibility for obtaining and paying a forensic accountant was delegated to iar via valla iar asked steven smith,who had provided basic accounting and tax services to iar since,to provide the needed information and expertise to understand defendant crimes.subsequently,iar,not valla,retained smith to serve as expert witness in the civil action against defendant smith testified at the preliminary hearing in this matter,after being prepared to do so by the district attorney.iar paid smith for his services in both the criminal and civil matter,which mainly consisted of reporting on defendant credit card expenses and identifying which were likely personal in nature as opposed to business in nature.
the evidentiary hearing revealed several instances of cooperation between the police or district attorney and valla.for example,on july,purcell,a legal associate at valla,emailed detective beck,asking for penal code citations for the offenses that would likely be charged to defendant,explaining that the firm might try to work the elements of the charged offenses into its upcoming deposition of defendant.the police thereafter responded with two penal code citations,but did not suggest or request any particular deposition questions relating to these provisions.later,valla provided the district attorney with a copy of defendant deposition transcript with portions underlined however,there was no evidence that the district attorney requested this evidence,or that valla underlined portions of the transcript for,or at the request of,anyone in law enforcement.
in addition,on february,the district attorney emailed the firm to request that,at an upcoming meeting,iar employees be available to discuss,among other things,how the civil code sections relating to ratification may or may not affect sic the ratification defense.my office has concerns about this possible defense since shehayed was able to get away with misappropriating funds without anyone noticing.hopefully,the iar employees will be able to shed more light on this area.this request from the district attorney followed her receipt of a communication from defense counsel in which counsel argued that defendant alleged acts of embezzlement had been authorized or ratified by iar.
the record reflects that the ratification defense was later discussed in a phone call between the district attorney and valla associate,michael purcell.following this call,the district attorney,who lacked a background in civil law,asked for citations to the cases and statutes that purcell mentioned were on point with the shehayed criminal case,and valla complied by emailing the district attorney copies of statutes from the civil code that included case citations.at the hearing,valla explained that it had spent only five or ten minutes crafting this response,as the firm had already researched these statutes in connection with the civil case against defendant.
following the evidentiary hearing,the trial court granted defendant motion.specifically,on august,the court issued an order finding valla to be a part of the prosecution team,noting,in particular,the email correspondence between valla and law enforcement relating to the hiring of a forensic accountant,and to the identification and exchange of legal authority.the court thus ruled that valla associates are required to comply with brady requirements.informal discovery requests can be sent to them,and they will be expected to respond accordingly.
in august,valla and iar filed this petition for writ of mandate asking this court to direct the trial court to vacate its determination that valla is part of the prosecution team,and to enter a new order denying defendant motion.the people subsequently joined in their request for relief arguing,like petitioners,that the court finding that valla was part of the prosecution team for purposes of brady is erroneous as a matter of law.
discussion 
petitioners seek writ relief on the ground that the trial court erred as a matter of law in concluding that valla,attorneys for iar,the victim of defendant financial crimes,is part of the prosecution team for purposes of the duty under brady to disclose any material,exculpatory evidence in its possession.specifically,they challenge the trial court finding that valla is part of the prosecution team because,in their zeal to represent their client,iar us,valla and associates interjected themselves into and made themselves part of the prosecution team.and in some cases it would appear that their interjection was welcomed by the district attorney office.for reasons set forth below,we agree the trial court erred 
in making the determination that valla is part of the prosecution team and requiring valla to comply with brady,the trial court relied primarily upon three factors.first,the court relied upon email correspondence between the district attorney office and valla beginning on february,described above,in which the deputy district attorney asked valla to provide case citations for the ratification defense,which defense counsel had indicated that it would assert.second,the court relied upon the july correspondence between valla associate,michael purcell,and detective beck,wherein purcell asked for a list of the crimes that would likely be charged to defendant so that valla could explore the elements of them in defendant upcoming deposition in the civil action.and lastly,the court relied upon ongoing communications between valla,the police and the district attorney relating to the government need and inability to pay for a forensic accountant to analyze the complicated financial data that would establish defendant guilt.at the same time,the court declined to rule on the related issue of whether the privilege or doctrine would ultimately override any obligation to disclose evidence under brady.
we address the trial court order,first,to the extent it requires valla to make disclosures in accordance with brady and,second,to the extent it relies on these particular three factors,after first setting forth the applicable legal framework.

generally speaking,a trial court ruling on discovery matters is reviewed for abuse of discretion.people ayala cal th.d iscretion is abused whenever the court exceeds the bounds of reason,all of the circumstances being considered.citations.people giminez cal d.however,the duty to disclose under brady is not a discovery rule,but a due process requirement the brady rule is based on the requirement of due process.its purpose is not to displace the adversary system as the primary means by which truth is uncovered,but to ensure that a miscarriage of justice does not occur.united states bagley,see also weatherford bursey,there is no general constitutional right to discovery in a criminal case,and brady did not create one the due process clause has little to say regarding the amount of discovery which the parties must be afforded.as such,the abuse of discretion standard for discovery rulings does not apply.rather,whether brady applies is a legal matter,reviewed de novo.people uribe th.at the same time,the trial court factual findings are,as usual,reviewed for substantial evidence.people superior court hartway cal d,fn.
ii.brady maryland brady.
the prosecution has a duty under the fourteenth amendment due process clause to disclose evidence to a criminal defendant when the evidence is both favorable to the defendant and material on either guilt or punishment.citations.evidence is favorable if it hurts the prosecution or helps the defense.citation.evidence is material only if there is a reasonable probability that,had it been disclosed to the defense,the result would have been different.citations.people earp cal th,d,see,united states bagley,d.bagley brady,supra,at in re sassounian cal th,d.people superior court meraz th.
a prosecutor duty under brady to disclose material exculpatory evidence extends to evidence the prosecutor or the prosecution team knowingly possesses or has the right to possess.the prosecution team includes both investigative and prosecutorial agencies and personnel.citation.in kyles whitley,ed,the supreme court held that a prosecutor has a duty to learn of favorable evidence known to other prosecutorial and investigative agencies acting on the prosecution behalf,including police agencies.the scope of the prosecutorial duty to disclose encompasses exculpatory evidence possessed by investigative agencies to which the prosecutor has reasonable access.citation.people superior court barrett th,barrett.
a prosecutor has a duty to search for and disclose exculpatory evidence if the evidence is possessed by a person or agency that has been used by the prosecutor or the investigating agency to assist the prosecution or the investigating agency in its work.the important determinant is whether the person or agency has been acting on the government behalf kyles whitley,supra,at at or assisting the government case.citation.conversely,a prosecutor does not have a duty to disclose exculpatory evidence or information to a defendant unless the prosecution team actually or constructively possesses that evidence or information.thus,information possessed by an agency that has no connection to the investigation or prosecution of the criminal charge against the defendant is not possessed by the prosecution team,and the prosecutor does not have the duty to search for or to disclose such material.barrett,supra,th at.
t he duty to disclose exists regardless of whether there has been a request by the accused,and the suppression of evidence that is materially favorable to the accused violates due process regardless of whether it was intentional,negligent,or inadvertent.citations.citation.people superior court meraz,supra,th at.
applying these legal principles to the record before us,we first find error in the trial court order to the extent it purports to require valla as opposed to the prosecution to comply with brady requirements by responding to informal discovery requests sent directly to them.t he supreme court has unambiguously assigned the duty to disclose under brady solely and exclusively to the prosecution those assisting the government case are no more than its agents.kyles,supra,at.at citations.by necessary implication,the duty is nondelegable at least to the extent the prosecution remains responsible for any lapse in compliance.since the prosecution must bear the consequences of its own failure to disclose citations,a fortiori,it must be charged with any negligence on the part of other agencies acting in its behalf citations.accordingly,the risk and consequences of nonreceipt must fall to the prosecution.in re brown cal th.although rigorous,we do not perceive the duty imposed by brady as too onerous.citations.obviously some burden is placed on the shoulders of the prosecutor when he is required to be responsible for those persons who are directly assisting him in bringing an accused to justice.but this burden is the essence of due process of law.it is the state that tries a man,and it is the state that must insure that the trial is fair.citations.this obligation serves to justify trust in the prosecutor as the representative of a sovereignty whose interest in a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case,but that justice shall be done.kyles,supra,at.at it also tends to preserve the criminal trial,as distinct from the prosecutor private deliberations or some other agency independent assessment of materiality,as the chosen forum for ascertaining the truth about criminal accusations.citations.kyles,supra,at.at alvarez cir,supra,at.in re brown,supra,cal th at.as such,we conclude the trial court committed legal error by imposing any duty under brady to disclose material,exculpatory evidence directly on valla,as opposed to on the prosecution.as explained above,brady is not a discovery rule,but a requirement of due process.united states bagley,supra,at.
at the same time,however,there remains at play the separate issue of whether valla may be deemed part of the prosecution team for purposes of brady,such that the prosecution can be required to search for and disclose brady materials under valla possession or control.the trial court,in finding valla to be part of the prosecution team for purposes of brady,and,as such,under a duty to disclose exculpatory evidence,employed the totality of the circumstances test set forth by the federal district court for the southern district of new york in united states meregildo d meregildo.there,the defendant called upon the district court to find that a cooperating witness was part of the prosecution team.in declining to do so,the court first made the point that the disclosure requirements under brady stem from the unique role the government plays in criminal prosecutions.id.at brady obligations prevent the government from exploiting its position to obtain an unfair advantage at trial see also strickler greene,w ithin the federal system,for example,we have said that the united states attorney is the representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy,but of a sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at all and whose interest,therefore,in a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case,but that justice shall be done.then,following a lengthy discussion of the relevant case law,the district court ultimately identified the following legal framework there is no clear test to determine when an individual is a member of the prosecution team.see united states zagari,fn.cir.the extent to which knowledge may be imputed from one federal investigative agency to another for brady purposes is as yet unclear.citations.a prosecution team may have many members with different responsibilities.at its core,members of the team perform investigative duties and make strategic decisions about the prosecution of the case.see,kyles,at police investigator giglio,at fellow prosecutor.the prosecution team may also include individuals who are not strategic.see,united states bin laden d,finding that agents of the united states marshals service witness security program were members of the prosecution team because,at the prosecutors request,the agents installed and continuously operated equipment in order to further the government investigation.those may include testifying police officers and federal agents who submit to the direction of the prosecutor and aid in the government investigation.pina henderson cir,at bin laden,d at.but the prosecution team does not include federal agents,prosecutors,or parole officers who are not involved in the investigation.locascio cir,at quinn cir,at pina,at.and,even when agents are involved in the investigation,they are not always so integral to the prosecution team that imputation is proper.see united states stewart,d,declining to impute knowledge of a forensic expert from the secret service lab who provided trial support for the prosecution and testified as an expert see also,united states persico,cr.jfk,wl,at,declining to impute a case agent knowledge of a government witness illegal actions.meregildo,supra,d at.accord barnett superior court cal th,borrowing the following brady inquiry from federal case law when deciding the analogous issue of whether a defendant sentenced to death was entitled to postconviction discovery under section whether the party with knowledge of the information is acting on the government behalf or is under its control the extent to which state and federal governments are part of a team,are participating in a joint investigation or are sharing resources and whether the entity charged with constructive possession has ready access to the evidence.citations.
the federal district court also identified several limitations on whether an individual or entity could be deemed part of the prosecution team under the test interacting with the prosecution team,without more,does not make someone a team member.stewart,d at.instead,under the totality of the circumstances,the more involved individuals are with the prosecutor,the more likely they are team members.stewart,d at.among many others,these circumstances include whether the individual actively investigates the case,acts under the direction of the prosecutor,or aids the prosecution in crafting trial strategy.see,united states diaz,cir.in some cases,when an individual is significantly involved with the prosecution,the presence of a single factor may warrant imputation.united states stein,d,holding that materials in corporation files are within government control for rule purposes because of cooperation agreement.in other cases,when an individual involvement is minor,even the presence of many factors will not warrant imputation.see,stewart,d at.ultimately,no single factor is the touchstone for imputation.bin laden,d at.meregildo,supra,d at.we find the federal court analytic framework persuasive.
to begin with,we accept petitioners point that there is no published decision in california or elsewhere holding that a private party that is also a crime victim qualifies as a member of the prosecution team for purposes of brady.indeed,defendant has directed us to no such case nor have we found one.this likely reflects two factors.first,as noted above,the brady rule arises from the unique role prosecutors and their agents play in our criminal justice system,which courts have recognized justifies brady heightened disclosure requirements,strickler greene,supra,at.however,crime victims and their attorneys,like iar and valla,are also uniquely positioned in our criminal justice system.as petitioners point out,the california constitution affords crime victims certain unique rights,including the right to refuse to cooperate with the prosecution and,of particular significance here,the right to reasonably confer with the prosecuting agency,upon request,regarding,the arrest of the defendant and the charges filed cal,art.i,subd.b.given these circumstances,petitioners contend that,as a matter of law,crime victims and their legal representatives can not be deemed part of the prosecution team for purposes of brady.as the people argue,to impose on the victim law firm the moniker of prosecution team is to impose on the a status limiting the victim constitutional rights and limits the agent lawyer ability to take actions on the principal own behalf to secure recovery that may well conflict with the prosecution interests.
however,whatever the wisdom of petitioners proposed rule that a victim attorney can not,as a matter of law,be deemed part of the prosecution team,we conclude that the particular facts of this case demonstrate that valla can not be deemed part of the prosecution team.as the meregildo court aptly explained when distinguishing between government agents and cooperating witnesses for the purpose of determining whether an actor may be deemed part of the prosecution team at bottom,imputation involves a question of agency law should a prosecutor be held responsible for someone else actions citation citing restatement second of agency.an agency relationship is limited in scope and defined by control.restatement second of agency.a principal has the right to control the conduct of the agent with respect to matters entrusted to him.and an agent duties are limited by the scope of the agency relationship.restatement second of agency.generally,a principal is responsible for the knowledge of an agent when that agent has a duty to give the principal information or when the agent acts on his knowledge regarding a matter that is within his power to bind the principal.restatement second of agency.an agent duty to disclose is thus linked to his power to bind the principal.because a prosecutor exercises greater control over federal agents than cooperating witnesses,the agency relationship between a federal agent and a prosecutor is strong.by contrast,the scope of the agency relationship between a cooperating witness and a prosecutor is narrower and warrants imputation in fewer circumstances.this comports with sound policy and common sense.it does not require an analysis of agency law to determine that a police officer or federal agent is in a better position than a cooperating witness to bind the federal government.meregildo,supra,d at italics added.
as this discussion by our federal colleague in meregildo reflects,the issue,in essence,is whether the prosecution has exercised such a degree of control over the nongovernmental actor or witness that the actor or witness actions should be deemed to be those of the prosecution for purposes of brady compliance.further,this framing of the issue fits well within the broader standard,set forth in the california case law,requiring a prosecutor to search for and disclose exculpatory evidence if the evidence is possessed by a person or agency that has been used by the prosecutor or the investigating agency to assist the prosecution or the investigating agency in its work,such that the person or agency may be deemed an agent of the prosecution for purposes of the matter at hand,barrett,supra,th at see also kyles whitley,supra,at t he important determina tion is whether the person or agency has been acting on the government behalf accord restatement second of agency a principal has the right to control the conduct of the agent with respect to matters entrusted to him.given the record at hand,we conclude the answer in this case is,no.quite simply,valla involvement with the prosecution as a cooperating witness in this matter has not been significant enough to warrant the trial court finding that valla files should be deemed under the district attorney control for purposes of brady.
in so concluding,we again note that,below,the trial court relied primarily upon the sharing of legal citation and analysis between valla and the police or district attorney,and the delegating by the district attorney to valla of the task of hiring and paying for a forensic accountant to prepare a report and testify regarding the factual basis for the charges against defendant.however,based on our own review of the record,we conclude the evidence is in fact much more benign than the trial court ruling would suggest.for example,with respect to the sharing of legal authority,it appears valla did no more than share a handful of legal citations relating to the ratification defense based on the research the firm had already undertaken in the civil action it was pursuing against defendant on its client behalf a task that took only about five or minutes.contrary to the trial court finding,however,the firm did not undertake on behalf of,or provide to,the district attorney any legal analysis,the sort of cooperation that,under the case law,might place a private party under the umbrella.
next,the trial court accurately found that the district attorney suggested to valla,as legal representative to iar,that it select and hire a forensic accountant to examine and then testify regarding the financial evidence of defendant crimes.however,this circumstance,if anything,reflects the complex nature of these crimes rather than any submission of valla to the direction of the prosecutor.as deputy district attorney nardi readily acknowledged to valla,her office had insufficient experience and resources to adequately investigate an embezzlement case of this magnitude,particularly in light of the complex global corporate structure of iar and the extent of defendant alleged wrongdoing spanning nearly a decade.further,the accountant ultimately retained by iar,steven smith,had provided routine accounting and tax services to iar since to wit,before law enforcement began investigating the underlying crimes in this case,and had been designated by iar as an expert witness in the civil action against defendant according to smith testimony,he,at valla request,independently took the data,the credit card receipts and created our own report for iar.then,once smith completed his report,he sent it to valla and iar finance manager before the report ultimately found its way to the district attorney.while smith later testified at the preliminary hearing for the prosecution,he did not consider his work to be for or at the direction of the prosecution rather,he worked independently for iar.nor did deputy district attorney nardi understand smith to be part of the prosecution team,much less exert the degree of control,direction or assistance over his work as would be necessary to trigger the prosecution disclosure obligations under brady.given this record,we conclude the fact that law enforcement may have obtained more specialized information and expertise from the crime victim,iar,in this case than it would have in a more ordinary criminal case does not,without more,prove valla and the prosecution were team members for purposes of brady.see meregildo,supra,d at at its core,members of the team perform investigative duties and make strategic decisions about the prosecution of the case.
finally,with respect to valla request for information from the district attorney office about the crimes with which they intended to charge to defendant,the record reflects that valla made this request in order to prepare questions regarding the elements of these crimes for defen
