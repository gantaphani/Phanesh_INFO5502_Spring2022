ellis morganfield and leroy thomas were each convicted on one count of conspiracy to violate a,and one count of aiding and abetting the violation of a and.morganfield was also convicted on two counts of aiding and abetting bank fraud in violation of and.they appeal their convictions.we affirm in part,reverse in part,vacate morganfield sentence,and remand for resentencing.
ellis morganfield and leroy thomas were key participants in a simple but effective check cashing scheme.the scheme essentially operated in four steps.first,registering an entity with a local authority,they obtained a certificate for the business.there was no business,however,just a nonexistent shell company.second,the conspirators used the certificates to open commercial checking accounts in the names of the shell companies,making a small initial deposit.the banks would assign account numbers and issue checks in the names of the shell companies.the conspirators used the personal identifications of other persons,which were bought or stolen,when opening the checking accounts.third,the conspirators would make the shell company checks,styled as payroll checks,payable to fake payees using the names of persons whose identifications they also had either bought or stolen.the checks were signed with the name of a nonexistent person,often with a signature stamp.the amounts the checks were drafted for would exceed the value of the deposit used to open the checking account.finally,the conspirators would cash the checks at unsuspecting grocery and convenience stores.
morganfield and thomas,along with gordon dunn,alexis morganfield,reggie president,shalita williams,ebonie toye,and douglas jones,were indicted by a grand jury sitting in the western district of texas.count one charged morganfield and thomas with conspiracy to utter a fictitious instrument in violation of a count two charged them with aiding and abetting the uttering of a fictitious instrument in violation of a and.counts five and six charged morganfield with aiding and abetting bank fraud in violation of and.
morganfield and thomas were tried by jury in april,and found guilty on all counts.numerous members of the conspiracy testified against morganfield and thomas.
the district judge sentenced morganfield to months imprisonment on count one and months imprisonment on each of counts two,five,and six,to run concurrently,and supervised release.thomas received a sentence of months imprisonment on count one and months imprisonment on count two,to run concurrently,and supervised release.thomas sentence was enhanced for using a minor,his girlfriend,in furtherance of the scheme.
morganfield and thomas now appeal.they first contend that there was insufficient evidence to find them guilty on counts one and two because a check,even if it is worthless,is not,as a matter of law,a false or fictitious instrument.we agree 
morganfield raises three challenges to his bank fraud convictions the government failed to prove the use of false or fraudulent pretenses,representations,or promises to obtain funds intent to defraud financial institutions and that any financial institution faced a risk of loss or civil liability.he also alleges that statements in the prosecutor rebuttal argument were improper and require reversal of his conviction and a new trial.we disagree with all four contentions.
morganfield and thomas argue that,as a matter of law,there was insufficient evidence to sustain their convictions on counts one and two because a applies,in the words of morganfield brief,to the passing of wholly nonexistent types of financial instruments,not the passing of worthless checks.
section a provides that 
w hoever,with intent to defraud,passes,utters,presents,offers,brokers,issues,sells,or attempts or causes the same,or with like intent possesses,within the united states,any false or fictitious instrument,document,or other item appearing,representing,purporting,or contriving through scheme or artifice,to be an actual security or other financial instrument issued under the authority of the united states,a foreign government,a state or other political subdivision of the united states,or an organization,shall be guilty of a class b felony.
terms in a are defined by reference to c section c a defines a security as including a check.neither nor c define what constitutes a false or fictitious instrument,document,or other item.
as the ninth circuit noted,is a relatively new statute under it,prosecution appears to be infrequent.as such,there is not a wealth of case law interpreting it.the legislative history is helpful in interpreting its scope.according to alfonse floor statement introducing the legislation 
this legislation combats the use of factitious sic financial instruments to defraud individual investors,banks,pension funds,and charities.these fictitious instruments have been called many names,including prime bank notes,prime bank derivatives,prime bank guarantees,japanese yen bonds,indonesian promissory notes,treasury warrants,and dollar notes.
because these fictitious instruments are not counterfeits of any existing negotiable instrument,federal prosecutors have determined that the manufacture,possession,or utterance of these instruments does not violate the counterfeit or bank fraud provisions contained in chapters and of title of the united states code.the perpetrators of these frauds can be prosecuted under existing federal law only if they used the mails or wires,or violated the bank fraud statute.
president,we have worked closely with the treasury department and various attorneys offices to prepare the financial instruments act of.this bill makes it a violation of federal law to possess,pass,utter,publish,or sell,with intent to defraud,any items purporting to be negotiable instruments of the government,a foreign government,a state entity,or a private entity.it closes a loophole in federal counterfeiting law 
the ninth circuit decision in united states howick offers the most thorough analysis of the section scope.in howick,the defendant was convicted of,among other things,possessing with intent to defraud and federal reserve notes in violation of a.the federal reserve had never printed notes in those denominations.after quoting the section legislative history,the court explained that a counterfeit obligation is a bogus document contrived to appear similar to an existing financial instrument a fictitious obligation is a bogus document contrived to appear to be a financial instrument,where there is in fact no such genuine instrument,and where the fact of the genuine instrument nonexistence is presumably unknown by,and not revealed to,the intended recipient of the document.in other words,according to the court,false or fictitious instrument in section refers to nonexistent instruments,whereas the phrase falsely made,forged,counterfeited,or altered obligation in section refers to doctored up versions of obligations that truly exist.other courts have similarly interpreted a 
the government argues that the dichotomy between existent and nonexistent securities is too formalistic.instead,the government urges that the proper inquiry is whether through scheme or artifice the defendants have sought to create a false or fictitious obligation,not whether they used an ostensibly genuine piece of paper.
in support of its argument,the government first points to the section title,fictitious obligations.this argument is not helpful on two accounts.first,the section heading is itself question begging.the american heritage dictionary defines obligation as including both a legal agreement stipulating a specified payment or action and the document containing the terms of such an agreement.while the former supports the government position,the latter supports the construction of the statute urged by morganfield and thomas.for interpretative purposes,titles are of use only when they shed light on some ambiguous word or phrase.second,and more important,headings and titles are not meant to take the place of the detailed provisions of the text.the text of a,while not an exemplar of precise drafting,supports the ninth circuit,and other courts,view that the statute concern is nonexistent instruments.
most basically stated,the statute prohibits the use of false or fictitious instruments,documents,or other items that appear,represent,or purport to be actual securities.the statute thus contemplates two universes of instruments false or fictitious ones and actual securities.false and fictitious have overlapping definitions.according to the american heritage dictionary,false and fictitious both can mean not real or imaginary both words can also mean deceptive while the broader definition of deceptive lends some support to the government argument,the choice of the word actual to modify security counsels otherwise.actual means existing in fact or reality.the use of actual thus focuses the inquiry on the character of the,does this type of security exist.the statute,then,prohibits the use of a not real or imaginary type of instrument that purports to be an existing type of security.
the legislative history supports this construction.senator floor statement explains that fictitious instruments are not counterfeits of any existing negotiable instrument he lists as an example of such instruments kits that provide the materials and instructions to produce phony money order sic and securities.
the government cites a number of cases in support of a broader construction however,none of those cases are on point as each involves situations where a fake instrument was used,the defendant had pleaded guilty and was not challenging the scope of a,or some combination thereof moreover,the government discussion of the case law fails to discuss the portion of howick that draws the distinction between nonexistent and existent instruments.
the government final argument is textual,but meritless.section b incorporates definitions from c.section c defines forged as a document that purports to be genuine but is not because it has been falsely altered,completed,signed,or enhanced,or contains a false addition thereto or insertion therein,or is a combination of part of two or more genuine securities.the government asserts that the definition of forged in c describes precisely what occurred in the scheme here,and thus pulls this scheme into a.the definition of forged does appear to describe what happened in the scheme here however,a nowhere mentions the word forged,and b specifically limits the definitions it incorporates to any term used in this section.
the actions of morganfield,thomas,and their are plainly illegal however,as the government final argument regarding the definition of forged in c suggests,the government charged morganfield and thomas under the wrong section.the checks in this case were,on their face,genuine.the checks were actual negotiable instruments that were issued by legitimate banks where actual checking accounts existed.morganfield and thomas subsequent actions may well have created forged or counterfeit obligations,but their actions did not turn otherwise real checks into a nonexistent type of security.this is not to say that a scheme that involves wholly fake checks necessarily falls outside a we conclude only that,where the underlying instruments are facially genuine checks,a is not applicable.
accordingly,we reverse morganfield and thomas convictions on counts one and two.
morganfield next challenges his bank fraud convictions under and.we are concerned only with,as the district court only instructed the jury on it section provides 
whoever knowingly executes,or attempts to execute,a scheme or artifice to obtain any of the moneys,funds,credits,assets,securities,or other property owned by,or under the custody or control of,a financial institution,by means of false or fraudulent pretenses,representations,or promises shall be fined not more than or imprisoned not more than years,or both.
morganfield raises three separate sufficiency of the evidence arguments the government failed to prove that he obtained funds by means of false or fraudulent pretenses,representations,or promises,that he had the intent to defraud financial institutions,and that any financial institution faced a risk of loss or civil liability.
generally,when reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence,we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict and determine whether a rational jury could have found the elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.however,where a defendant has failed to properly preserve his objections,our review is limited to plain error under the plain error standard,we reverse a conviction only to avoid a manifest miscarriage of justice.such a miscarriage would exist only if the record is devoid of evidence pointing to guilt,or because the evidence on a key element of the offense was so tenuous that a conviction would be shocking.
the parties disagree over whether proper motions for judgment of acquittal were made at the close of the government case and at the close of all of the evidence we need not pause at this dispute.even if all required objections were made,the evidence is sufficient to sustain morganfield convictions.
the nub of morganfield first claim is that the presentation of a check that draws on an account which the defendant knows to contain insufficient funds is not a false or fraudulent pretense,representation,or promise under.morganfield relies on the supreme court decision in williams united states and this court decision in united states medeles however,his reliance on these cases is misplaced.
in williams,the court considered a conviction under,which prohibits the use of any false statement or report for the purpose of influencing in any way the action of an enumerated financial institution,including federally insured banks.the defendant had engaged in a scheme,whereby he had deposited several checks in various bank accounts knowing that the checking accounts had insufficient funds to cover the checks the government argued that presentation of a check with knowledge that the checking account had insufficient funds constituted a false statement or report.the court,however,rejected this broad reading of the statute,explaining that,
a lthough the defendant deposited several checks that were not supported by sufficient funds,that course of conduct did not involve the making of a false statement,for a simple reason technically speaking,a check is not a factual assertion at all,and therefore can not be characterized as true or false.
that is,e ach check did not,in terms,make any representation as to the state of defendant bank balance.the court went on to explain that false statement is not a term that,in common usage,is often applied to characterize bad checks.the trial evidence being limited to depositing the bad checks,the court reversed the defendant conviction.
similarly,in medeles,this court considered whether a scheme could be prosecuted under former a medeles deposited a series of checks at various banks knowing that there were insufficient funds to cover the checks the appeal turned on whether depositing checks with the knowledge of insufficient funds constituted a false or fraudulent pretenses,or representations,as there was no evidence or allegation that the defendant made any other representation or pretense.following williams,this court concluded that depositing of bad a series of bad not a representation if the deposit of a check is not an assertion about the balance in the account,then it seems to us that known insufficiency in the account when the check is deposited can not of itself constitute the deposit a false or fraudulent pretense or representation.accordingly,this court reversed the defendant conviction.
had the scheme in the present case simply involved the presentation of checks for payment drawn on accounts with insufficient funds,the holdings in williams and medeles might have purchase.the scheme,however,was not so simple rather,it was built on a series of misrepresentations before a bad check was ever presented for payment.
for example,douglas jones testified that morganfield directed him to obtain certificates for nonexistent business entities,or shell corporations,because the banks would not open checking accounts without the certificates.jones also testified that morganfield provided him with identification to open bank accounts.in opening the checking accounts,at least two separate false or fraudulent representations were made to the banks that the businesses existed,which they did not,and that the person opening the account was someone else bank representatives testified that a certificate was necessary to open a checking account,as was valid personal identification.the misrepresentations by morganfield and his,then,directly influenced the banks decisions to open checking accounts in the names of the shell companies 
as this court and others have recognized,williams and its progeny do not immunize every scheme that involves the use of checks or an equivalent from federal prosecution a reasonable juror could conclude that morganfield aided and abetted in the making of false or fraudulent pretenses,representations,or promises separate from the simple presentation of bad checks.
morganfield next argues that the government failed to prove that he had specific intent to defraud a financial institution.in particular,morganfield asserts that the banks were nothing more than incidental players in the check funds scheme rather,the true targets of the scheme were the grocery and convenience stores where the checks were cashed.and,according to morganfield,there was no evidence proving that the use of nonexistent business names and false identifications to open checking accounts was done with the intent to defraud the banks,and that the accounts here were,at least temporarily,active accounts that could be drawn on.
this court previously explained that,under,t he requisite intent to defraud is established if the defendant acted knowingly and with the specific intent to deceive,ordinarily for the purpose of causing some financial loss to another or bringing about some financial gain to himself.
morganfield relies solely upon the fourth circuit decision in united states orr in orr,eugene elkins used false identification to open a checking account under the name eugene rogers.elkins and orr subsequently negotiated checks for merchandise in excess of the value of the checking account orr was convicted of bank fraud under the fourth circuit reversed the conviction 
no evidence has been produced to show that the use of the name rogers as opposed to elkins was done with intent to defraud the bank.the initial deposit was in cash.the account was,albeit for a short time,an active account,traded upon in proper fashion until its funds ran out.whether the account was in the name of rogers,or elkins,was not of significance to the giving of checks payable to certain payees and the return of such checks for reasons of insufficient funds 
in sum,the court reasoned that congress had not intended to create a national bad check law under.
the fourth circuit has,however,interpreted orr narrowly.in united states where the defendant stole blank checks,forged the signatures,and used the checks to purchase items from court explained that w e view orr as establishing merely that a routine bad check case does not come within the scope of where the defendant passes to a merchant a check from an account for which the defendant is an authorized signatory and the drawee bank refuses to honor the check for lack of sufficient funds.
the fourth circuit,along with other circuits,have rejected the argument that there can be no intent to defraud a bank when the principal victim or target is a third party merchant and not a bank we agree that the bank does not have to be the central target of the alleged scheme for there to be bank fraud liability rather,in such cases where the drawer has simply overdrawn the account,the government must present other facts evincing an intent to victimize the financial institution to sustain a bank fraud charge under.
the scheme here was,again,not a simple insufficient check funds scheme.morganfield and his obtained certificates in the names of nonexistent business entities precisely because they knew that the banks would not open checking accounts without the certificates.they also used false personal identifications in opening the checking accounts so as to not be personally connected to the checking accounts.moreover,once they had the checks,they signed the checks in the names of nonexistent persons,often using a signature stamp to make the checks look more legitimate they knew that the checking accounts had insufficient funds to cover the checks,and they did not deposit funds in the account to cover the difference they bought and stole identifications and made the checks payable to the persons listed on those identifications.from this course of conduct the jury could rationally infer the requisite intent to defraud 
finally,morganfield argues that the government failed to prove that any bank was at risk of civil liability or financial loss.morganfield argues that,not only was there no evidence of risk of loss or civil liability,but that the government witness on risk of loss,brenda king,indicated that the banks are not at a risk of financial loss,or civil liability,when checks with insufficient funds are presented to the bank by the businesses which cashed them.
bank fraud under requires that the government demonstrate that the defendants placed the financial institution at risk of civil liability or financial loss it is not necessary,however,for the government to prove that banks actually suffered civil liability or financial loss in order to obtain bank fraud convictions.additionally,the government need not prove a substantial likelihood of risk of loss to support the convictions.
morganfield argument relies upon the assumption that a bank will simply not honor a check where the checking account has insufficient funds,and therefore faces no risk of loss.however,testimony at trial contradicts this line of argument.the following exchange occurred during morganfield of brenda king 
q you talked about civil liability in a case,all right if a person opens an account,puts money in the account and writes a check on the account,the bank has to honor the check,is that true if there money in the account 
a if the funds are available,yes,sir.
q all right.if there is no money in the account,then it the option of the bank to either cover the check,depending on the customer,right charge him a fee for honoring that check,right and they assume that the customer will put money back into the account,is that true,to cover that check 
q all right.or they do what called an nsf,fund,and the check is returned.the bank is not out any money,is that true 
a other than possible fees,yes.
q well,possible fees well,the bank is really not out any money that was drawn against the bank on the check,correct 
a that correct.
king testimony thus describes two separate scenarios when the bank receives a check drawn on an account with insufficient funds.the bank may pay the check despite the insufficient funds on the assumption that the customer will later make a deposit to cover the difference.or,the bank may refuse to pay the check,in which case it faces no loss aside from nsf fees.
king testimony undercuts the assumption morganfield makes that a bank will simply not pay a check when the account has insufficient funds.a rational jury could infer that an inherent consequence of the check cashing scheme was that the bad checks would be presented to the bank by the merchants who accepted the checks.and,according to king testimony,the bank might honor the check even when an account had insufficient funds that possibility creates a sufficient risk of loss to the financial institution 
morganfield asserts that statements made by the prosecutor during rebuttal argument amounted to prosecutorial misconduct and require that his convictions be reversed.we disagree.
this court applies a analysis when reviewing claims of prosecutorial misconduct the court must first decide whether the prosecutor made an improper remark the court evaluates the remark in light of the context in which it is made if an improper remark was in fact made,the court must determine whether the remark prejudiced the defendant substantive rights.in making that determin
