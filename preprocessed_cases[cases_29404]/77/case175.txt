defendant paul lalonde lalonde appeals the conviction and sentence imposed by the district court following his plea of guilty to wire fraud,and income tax evasion.lalonde challenges his conviction on the grounds of alleged violations of federal rules of criminal procedure and.lalonde appeals his sentence on the basis of the district court alleged misapplication of the united states sentencing guidelines the guidelines and for unreasonableness.for the reasons that follow,we affirm both the conviction and sentence imposed by the district court.
background 
from to,lalonde engaged in a scheme to fraudulently obtain over million from various individuals and corporations.lalonde and his associates,richard liggett liggett and thomas mcghee mcghee,obtained money from victims by falsely representing that they worked as either attorneys or financial advisors who would invest the victims money.rather than investing the money,however,lalonde and his associates converted the funds to their own personal use.lalonde failed to report this money as taxable income and thus willfully avoided paying federal income tax during these years as well.
the only details of the scheme that are relevant for this appeal concern lalonde dealings with magellin entertainment magellin and with wright gaming.in and,lalonde,with the help of mcghee,a registered securities broker with continental capital securities continental capital in toledo,ohio,induced magellin,a california based entity,to send to lalonde for the purpose of enhancing magellin ability to secure financing for its motion picture business.lalonde told magellin that he would deposit this money in an escrow account and would provide magellin with certificates of deposit to use as default collateral on any loans that magellin might seek.the certificates of deposit were to be protected by default insurance and were to be placed with mcghee in an account set up for magellin at continental capital.lalonde never obtained any such certificates,but instead spent a substantial part of the on personal expenses and repayment of earlier victims of the scheme.
in,lalonde and liggett similarly induced wright gaming to send them for the purpose of assisting wright gaming to obtain million in financing for a barge casino on the mississippi river.lalonde and liggett instructed wright gaming to wire transfer the funds to an account in the name of cloverleaf at continental capital.the money sent to the account would be used to rent certificates of deposit owned by others and to buy treasury bills which would enhance wright gaming ability to secure financing.cloverleaf would then provide wright gaming with the million loan.after wright gaming wired the money,was transferred to lalonde account and went to liggett.lalonde and liggett did not rent any treasury bills nor did they obtain financing for wright gaming.instead,they used the money for their own personal expenses.
based upon his involvement in this scheme,lalonde was indicted on december,in the southern district of ohio for one count of conspiracy,in violation of,nineteen counts of wire fraud,in violation of and,nineteen counts of money laundering,in violation of and,and three counts of income tax evasion,in violation of and.
on january,lalonde was arraigned on the indictment before a federal magistrate judge.prior to the arraignment,defense counsel was provided with a copy of the indictment.at the hearing,the attorney for the government offered to read the indictment to lalonde if he chose not to waive such a reading.however,because defense counsel proceeded to address other matters with the court,the indictment was never read to lalonde and no waiver of reading was made.lalonde did not object to the magistrate judge failure to read the indictment.
on december,pursuant to a written plea agreement with an attached statement of facts,lalonde entered a plea of guilty to count wire fraud and count income tax evasion of the indictment.at the hearing,the district judge confirmed that lalonde had read and understood the indictment and had discussed all the counts charged in the indictment,and any defenses thereto,with defense counsel.the district judge also questioned lalonde and the government about the plea agreement and lalonde awareness of the consequences of changing his plea.based on this inquiry,the district court determined that there was a factual basis for the plea and that lalonde was aware of the charges against him and was pleading guilty knowingly and voluntarily.
as part of the process of entering the plea,kent rogers,a special agent with the internal revenue service,read into the record a statement of facts relevant to the wire fraud and income tax evasion charges.in particular,special agent rogers stated that a mong the interstate wire communications which furthered the fraud scheme that is set forth in count defendant caused magellin to wire transfer from outside the southern judicial district of ohio to his clermont savings personal checking account in the southern district of ohio.at emphasis added lalonde confirmed that special agent rogers account of the facts was accurate and that the statement of facts attached to the plea agreement was also correct.
the district judge then summarized the elements of wire fraud and informed lalonde that the facts as set forth by special agent rogers indicated that lalonde was guilty of wire fraud.the judge summary of the elements of wire fraud failed to include the word interstate.nevertheless,lalonde confirmed that he had in fact committed the offenses of wire fraud and income tax evasion as alleged in the indictment.lalonde raised only one objection to the factual concerned the calculation of the amount of unpaid taxes.after discussing this issue,the district court accepted lalonde guilty plea and adjudged lalonde guilty of the wire fraud and income tax evasion charges.during this plea hearing,lalonde raised no objections regarding the failure of the magistrate judge to read the indictment or his lack of understanding concerning the elements of the wire fraud charge.
on december,because of concerns regarding lalonde health,the district judge ordered a medical study of lalonde.shortly thereafter,on december,lalonde sent a letter along with a document entitled statement of facts to the district court,which presented a different version of the events giving rise to the charges over the next couple years,the district court granted lalonde several continuances of the sentencing hearing in order to permit further medical examinations of lalonde and to await the supreme court sentencing decisions in blakely washington,d,and united states booker,d.
on june,lalonde filed a pro se motion to withdraw plea,followed by a pro se supplemental motion to withdraw plea on july.in these motions,lalonde stated that he was not in proper physical or mental health at the time of his plea.he further claimed that the only reason that he plead guilty was because of the state of his health and the promises of ausa brinkman that his sentence would not be more than months.at.lalonde did not object that his wire fraud conviction was not based upon an interstate wire transfer.likewise,lalonde did not complain that he had never been read and did not understand the indictment.the district court held a hearing on these motions on july,at which lalonde withdrew his motion to withdraw plea and did not make any further objections regarding his conviction.
on november,the district judge held lalonde sentencing hearing.at the hearing,lalonde motioned to withdraw the statement of facts in the december,letter which he had sent to the district court.lalonde also raised seven objections to the presentence report,all of which were overruled.in particular,the court found that lalonde qualified for a enhancement,pursuant to,because the crime was a scheme to defraud more than one person lalonde qualified for a further enhancement,pursuant to,because he was a organizer,leader,manager,or supervisor of the scheme to defraud magellin lalonde criminal history score was properly increased by three points,pursuant to,for a kentucky felony conviction based upon his guilty plea entered in abstentia and the amount defrauded from wright gaming was properly included in the amount of loss calculation pursuant to the district court concluded that lalonde had an adjusted offense level of with a category v criminal history and,thus,the guidelines sentencing range was to months.
recognizing that the guidelines are merely advisory,the district court then proceeded to consider the other sentencing factors enumerated in a.in particular,the court considered lalonde involvement in a scheme which defrauded several individuals as well as the united states treasury of over million lalonde extensive prior criminal history of fraud and false statements lalonde poor physical health,including his heart condition and the need for lalonde to gain additional vocational skills.the district court concluded that consecutive sentences of months on the wire fraud charge and months on the income tax evasion charge were sufficient but not greater than necessary to comply with the factors set forth in a.in as much as lalonde raised no further objections to such a sentence,the district court imposed the sentence and informed lalonde of his right to appeal.
on november,lalonde filed this timely appeal.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,lalonde raises two procedural challenges to his conviction and a procedural and substantive reasonableness challenge to his sentence.first,lalonde argues that his conviction should be invalidated because the magistrate judge committed plain error in failing to read or summarize the indictment at the arraignment.second,lalonde seeks reversal of his conviction because of the district court alleged failure to comply with federal rule of criminal procedure which requires the court to determine that there is a factual basis for the plea and that it is made knowingly and voluntarily.third,lalonde contends that the district court failed to follow proper sentencing procedures by incorrectly calculating the advisory guidelines range.finally,lalonde challenges the substantive reasonableness of his sentence.we consider each of these arguments in turn.
a.the district court did not commit plain error by failing to read or summarize the indictment at arraignment 
preservation of the issue 
the government argues that lalonde has waived his right to challenge his conviction based upon the magistrate judge failure to read the indictment.we agree.
a defendant waives his right to appeal constitutional violations occurring prior to a plea of guilty once the defendant enters his plea.united states kirksey,cir.when a criminal defendant has solemnly admitted in open court that he is in fact guilty of the offense with which he is charged,he may not thereafter raise independent claims relating to the deprivation of constitutional rights that occurred prior to the entry of guilty plea.he may only attack the voluntary and intelligent character of the guilty plea.id.quoting tollett henderson,d.furthermore,a challenge regarding improper arraignment is waived if the defendant fails to object to the defect prior to appeal.see garland washington.a waiver ought to be conclusively implied where the parties had proceeded as if defendant had been duly arraigned and a formal plea of not guilty had been interposed,and where there was no objection made on account of its absence until,as in this case,the record was brought to this court for review.king united states,cir e ven though the defendant had not been formally arraigned,or had not pleaded to the indictment,his proceeding to trial without raising this objection would imply a waiver,or at least the formal defect would not be prejudicial.
as lalonde has already plead guilty to the wire fraud and tax evasion charges and as he raised no objection to his arraignment at any point prior to this appeal,he has waived his right to challenge the magistrate judge failure to read the indictment at arraignment.however,in order to clarify the law in this area,we find that,even if lalonde had not waived this issue,his challenge is without merit.
standard of review 
we review violations of the federal rules of criminal procedure for plain error if the defendant fails to object before the district court.united states vonn,d a defendant right to review of error he let pass in silence depends upon the plain error rule.united states murdock,cir.see also.a.the defendant bears the burden of proof on plain error review.vonn,at.the defendant must show that there is error,that is plain,and that affects substantial rights.if all three conditions are met,an appellate court may exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error,but only if the error seriously affects the fairness,integrity,or reputation of judicial proceedings.murdock,at quoting johnson united states,d.
rule a of the federal rules of criminal procedure provides 
an arraignment must be conducted in open court and must consist of ensuring that the defendant has a copy of the indictment or information reading the indictment or information to the defendant or stating to the defendant the substance of the charge and then asking the defendant to plead to the indictment or information.
in the instant case,the magistrate judge clearly violated this rule by failing to read or explain the indictment to lalonde at his arraignment.thus,lalonde can satisfy the first two prongs of the plain error test by showing that the lower court committed an error that was plain.however,lalonde can not demonstrate that this error affected his substantial rights.
in garland,the supreme court held that a lack of a formal arraignment does not deprive an accused of any substantial right as long as he has sufficient notice of the accusation and adequate opportunity to defend himself.at.additionally,the courts of appeals which have considered this issue have likewise found that a technical failure to comply with rule does not affect a substantial right as long as the accused has sufficient notice of the charges and an adequate opportunity to prepare a defense.see united states mancias,cir finding that the absence of formal arraignment is of little consequence quoting united states reynolds,cir united states romero,cir finding that defendant was not subject to any prejudice as a result of the district court failure to read the indictment to him at arraignment because defendant had received a copy of the indictment and had an opportunity to read it before making his plea united states coffman,cir finding that defendant was not prejudiced by the failure to be formally arraigned when he had been given a copy of the indictment and when the failure to arraign was inadvertent united states rogers,cir finding that defendant suffered no prejudice when the court failed to read the indictment or provide a copy to defendant at arraignment because he was represented by counsel and did not allege that he was ignorant of the offense charged united states clark,cir finding no merit in defendant challenge for failure to receive a copy of the indictment when defense counsel had been given a copy of the indictment and defendant had informed the court that he had read the indictment and understood the charges against him.
the facts in this case demonstrate that no substantial rights of lalonde were affected by the magistrate judge failure to read the indictment at arraignment.lalonde was represented by counsel at the arraignment.this attorney was provided a copy of the indictment.lalonde also told the district judge at his change of plea hearing that he had read and understood the indictment and discussed it and any possible defenses with his attorney.lalonde has not identified any way in which this technical violation of rule prejudiced his ability to defend himself.accordingly,we find that even if lalonde had preserved this issue for appeal,the district court actions would withstand review on appeal.
b.the district court properly complied with federal rule of criminal procedure when taking lalonde plea 
standard of review 
we review violations of rule for plain error if the defendant did not object before the district court.murdock,at citing vonn,at.the defendant bears the burden of proof on plain error review.vonn,at.the defendant must show that there is error,that is plain,and that affects substantial rights.if all three conditions are met,an appellate court may exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error,but only if the error seriously affects the fairness,integrity,or reputation of judicial proceedings.murdock,at quoting johnson,at.
in applying plain error review,we have held the district court errs when it fails to comply with the clear mandate of a federal rule of criminal procedure,and this error is plain.united states,quoting murdock,at.we have further found that violations of rule b g requirement of ensuring the existence of a factual basis for the plea affect a defendant substantial rights and seriously affect the fairness and integrity of the judicial proceeding.id.at citing united states syal,cir.accordingly,we clarify today that a district court commits plain error when it violates rule b g.
however,for a defendant seeking reversal of his conviction,plain error review requires a heightened showing of prejudice.see united states dominguez benitez,d.a defendant who seeks reversal of his conviction after a guilty plea,on the ground that the district court committed plain error under rule,must show a reasonable probability that,but for the error,he would not have entered the plea.id.in other words,the defendant must convince the reviewing court that the probability of a different result is sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome of the proceeding.id.quoting strickland washington,d.i n assessing the affect of a rule error,a reviewing court must look to the entire record,not to the plea proceedings alone.id.at.citing vonn,at.as lalonde is asking this court to reverse his conviction entered upon a guilty plea,he must meet this heightened standard.
lalonde argues that the district court violated rule in three distinct ways.first,he claims the district court violated b g by failing to adequately inform him of the nature of the charges against him.second,lalonde contends that the district court violated b by failing to ensure that his plea was voluntarily and intelligently given.finally,he argues that the district court failed to determine that a factual basis existed for lalonde plea in violation of b.we find each of these arguments unconvincing.
violation of rule b g 
rule b g requires the district court,before accepting a plea of guilty,to inform the defendant of,and determine that the defendant understands the nature of each charge to which the defendant is pleading.this rule expressly directs the district judge to inquire whether a defendant who pleads guilty understands the nature of the charge against him and whether he is aware of the consequences of his plea.mccarthy united states,d.the district court must be satisfied,after discussion with the defendant in open court,that the defendant understands the elements of the offense,at quoting syal,at.at a minimum,the defendant must understand the critical or essential elements of the offense to which he or she pleads guilty.united states valdez,cir.
the supreme court has suggested that providing the defendant with a copy of the indictment prior to his plea of guilty creates a presumption that the defendant was informed of the nature of the charge against him.bousley united states,d.see also valdez,at.however,we have found that the amount of discussion required to properly inform the defendant of the charges against him varies based upon the complexity of the charges.in a simple case,the district court may need only to read the indictment and allow the defendant to ask questions about the charge.valdez,at quoting syal.at citing united states van buren,cir.see also united states edgecomb,cir holding that,for a case involving conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute,the government reading of the indictment,accompanied by the court reciting of the counts and asking defendants whether they understood the charges and if they had discussed the charges with their attorneys was procedurally sufficient to establish defendants understanding of the charges against them.when the case is more complex,further explanation may be required.valdez,at quoting syal,at.see also van buren,at holding that,for a case involving the charge of using a communication facility to further a conspiracy,the government reading of the indictment and defendant admission of guilt was not sufficient to establish defendant understanding of the charge.however,s ome rehearsal of the elements of the offense is necessary for any defendant and failure to identify these elements is error and can not be said to be harmless,even for an educated,defendant.syal,at finding that the district court did not comply with rule b g because it failed to rehearse the content of the indictment or explain the separate elements of the wire fraud offense to defendant.
lalonde argues that the district court violated rule b g by failing to ensure that he understood the elements of wire fraud.in particular,lalonde argues that at no time was he made aware of the interstate use of wires element of the offense.this argument,however,is unsupported by the facts.
under bousley,the district court was entitled to presume that lalonde had been informed of the nature of the charges against him because he had been provided with a copy of the indictment prior to his plea hearing.nevertheless,prior to taking lalonde plea,the district court confirmed that he had read and understood the indictment and had discussed all the counts with his attorney.special agent rogers then read a summarized statement of facts into the record.this statement of facts specified that a mong the interstate wire communications which furthered the fraud scheme was the wire transfer from magellin to lalonde.at emphasis added.lalonde agreed that this testimony was accurate.
after reviewing the facts,the district court also summarized the elements of wire fraud.lalonde correctly observes that,in its summary of the wire fraud offense,the district court failed to use the qualifying adjective interstate when listing the use of the wires element.however,this omission alone does not demonstrate that the district court failed to ensure that lalonde was aware of the charges against him.on the contrary,lalonde indicated to the court that he understood these charges by agreeing that he had committed the offense of wire fraud.
we view the district court inquiry into whether lalonde had read and understood the indictment as well as its discussion of the underlying facts of the case and the elements of the charges as sufficient to ensure that lalonde was aware of the nature of the charges against him.accordingly,we find that the district court did not violate rule b g and,thus,did not commit plain error.
violation of rule b 
rule b provides that b efore accepting a plea of guilty the court must address the defendant personally in open court and determine that the plea is voluntary and did not result from force,threats,or promises other than promises in a plea agreement.the purpose of this rule is to assist the district count in determining whether a defendant guilty plea is truly voluntary and to produce a complete record of the factors relevant to this determination.united states gardner,cir citing mccarthy,at.in order for a plea to be truly voluntary the defendant must posses an understanding of the law in relation to the facts.mccarthy,at.in questioning the defendant about the voluntary nature of his plea,the questions posed do not have to require a lengthy response.gardner,at.a defendant answers can be sufficient to ensure the district court that his plea is voluntary.id.
lalonde argues that the district court did not properly ensure that his plea was voluntary.he contends that,because he was ill and did not understand what was happening at the plea hearing,his plea could not have been voluntary.again,his argument lacks merit.
the record reflects that the district court engaged in a thorough inquiry to determine whether lalonde plea was being made voluntarily.in particular,the district court asked lalonde whether he was on any drugs or medications that would impact his ability to comprehend the proceedings.the district judge also questioned lalonde about his awareness of the possible sentence and the rights he would be giving up by pleading guilty.the court further inquired about the plea agreement and whether lalonde had been threatened,forced,or bribed with promises in order to plead guilty.finally,the judge ensured that lalonde understood and agreed with the factual basis for the indictment.nothing in the record indicates that lalonde medical condition prevented him from understanding the court questions or providing accurate answers regarding the voluntary nature of his plea.on the contrary,the district judge explicitly noted 
the court has observed the appearance and responsiveness of lalonde in giving his answers to the questions asked and based on such observations and the answers given,the court is satisfied that lalonde is in full possession of his faculties.he not suffering from any apparent physical or mental illness that would impair his understanding of the proceedings and his participation in the plea negotiations undertaken on his behalf.he is not under the influence of narcotics or alcohol.he understands the proceedings in which he engaged.he understands the nature and meaning of the charges and the consequences of his pleas of guilty.
we find that the district court thorough inquiry into lalonde ability to give a voluntary plea and its conclusion that lalonde plea was voluntary clearly demonstrate that it did not violate rule b and,thus,did not commit plain error.
violation of rule b 
rule b requires that b efore entering judgment on a guilty plea,the court must determine that there is a factual basis for the plea.the purpose of this rule is to protect a defendant who is in the position of pleading voluntarily with an understanding of the nature of the charge but without realizing that his conduct does not actually fall within the charge.mccarthy,at.quoting,notes of advisory committee on criminal rules.in applying this rule,we have provided the following guidance 
the ideal means to establish the factual basis for a guilty plea is for the district court to ask the defendant to state,in the defendant own words,what the defendant did that he believes constitutes the crime to which he is pleading guilty.so long as the district court ensures that the defendant statement includes mental state if satisfy every element of the offense,there should be no question concerning the sufficiency of the factual basis for the guilty plea.this ideal method is by no means the only method,however.we recognize that the district court may determine the existence of the rule b factual basis from a number of sources including a statement on the record from the government prosecutors,as well as a statement from the defendant.and of course it is possible that witnesses may be called to state the factual basis with the defendant providing confirmation.our inquiry turns,then,to whether the record of the plea hearing in this case establishes a factual basis for all the elements of the charge.
at quoting united states tunning,cir internal citations omitted.we have further noted that where the crime is easily understood a reading of the indictment,or even a summary of the charges in the indictment and an admission by the defendant,is sufficient to establish a factual basis under rule.id.at quoting edgecomb,at.a stipulation of facts signed by the defendant is also a method for establishing a factual basis for the offense.id.at united states baez,cir.
lalonde argues that the district court erroneously found that there was a factual basis for the wire fraud charge.the wire fraud statute,requires proof of a scheme or artifice to defraud use of interstate wire communications in furtherance of the scheme and intent to deprive a victim of money or property.united states gale,cir quoting united states daniel,cir.lalonde contends that the allegations made in the indictment and the facts established at the plea hearing do not demonstrate an interstate use of the mails in furtherance of his scheme to defraud.as with his other two rule challenges,lalonde argument is not supported by the record.
at the plea hearing,special agent rogers read a statement of facts relevant to the wire fraud offense.his account specifically mentioned that a mong the interstate wire communications which furthered the fraud scheme was magellin wire transfer from outside the southern district of ohio to defendant clermont savings personal checking account in the southern district of ohio.at emphasis added.the statement of facts attached to the plea agreement also indicated that this was an interstate transfer from a business.lalonde confirmed the accuracy of both special agent rogers description of the facts and the statement of facts attached to the plea agreement.based upon this record,the district court properly concluded that there was a factual basis to support the wire fraud charge.accordingly,we find that the district court did not violate rule b and did not commit plain error.
c.the district court followed proper sentencing procedure by correctly calculating the advisory guidelines range as one of the sentencing factors 
standard of review 
the sentencing guidelines are no longer mandatory,united states booker,d,and the range of choice dictated by the facts of the case is significantly broadened.gall united states,d.however,the sentencing act,a,nonetheless requires judges to take account of the guidelines together with other sentencing goals when fashioning a defendant sentence.booker,at.emphasis added.as the supreme court just recently clarified in gall,the guidelines should be the starting point and the initial benchmark in determining a sentence and a district court should begin all sentencing proceedings by correctly calculating the applicable guidelines range.at emphasis added accord united states gale,cir,the district court must still consider the guidelines in fashioning a defendant sentence,and must construe them correctly in doing so.
on appeal,we must ensure that the district court properly calculated the advisory guidelines range as part of its overall consideration of the a factors see gall,at directing appellate courts to ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error,such as failing to calculate or improperly calculating the guidelines range.in evaluating the district court calculation of the advisory guidelines range,we review the district court factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusion de novo.united states mcgee,cir united states moncivais,cir.a factual finding is clearly erroneous when the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.mcgee,at quoting tran gonzales,cir.
however,we have not settled the question of what standard governs review of a sentencing enhancement under.moncivais,at.in buford united states,the supreme court held that review under,regarding consolidation of a defendant prior offenses,should be conducted deferentially rather than de novo,d.since that decision,we have reserve d judgment as to whether the district court application of should be reviewed deferentially or de novo.united states henley,cir.this case does not present us with an opportunity to resolve this question.
lalonde argues that the district court erred in applying the guidelines in four distinct ways.first,he contends that the district judge improperly applied a two level enhancement,pursuant to,based on the district court erroneous finding that there were multiple victims of lalonde scheme.second,lalonde claims that the court wrongly applied a two level enhancement,pursuant to,for his role as manager of the scheme.third,lalonde argues that the district court erred in considering a kentucky felony conviction,based upon a guilty plea entered in abstentia,when determining his criminal history category.finally,lalonde maintains that the district court improperly included the amount defrauded from wright gaming in its calculation of lalonde base offense level.we find none of these arguments persuasive and uphold the district court application of the guidelines on each point.
enhancement pursuant to b b 
under the guidelines,the base offense level for wire fraud is.a.this offense level is increased based upon the amount of loss caused by the fraud.b.section b provides that 
if the offense involved a more than minimal planning,or b a scheme to defraud more than one victim,increase by levels.
the sentencing commission commentary to explains 
scheme to defraud more than one victim,as used in subsection b b,refers to a design or plan to obtain something of value from more than one person.in this context,victim refers to the person or entity from which the funds are to come directly.thus a wire fraud in which a single telephone call was made to three distinct individuals to get each of them to invest in a pyramid scheme would involve a scheme to defraud more than one victim,but passing a fraudulently endorsed check would not,even though the maker,payee payor all might be considered victims for other purposes such as restitution.
lalonde argues that the district court improperly applied this enhancement because his activities constituted several distinct schemes victimizing one person at a time rather than one scheme with multiple victims.lalonde made the same argument to the district court which rejected it,concluding that w hile the loss of each victim of lalonde offense was occasioned by a separate action by lalonda,the scheme to obtain money from various victims through fraud was,as the guidelines describe it,a scheme to defraud more than one victim.at.
the district court factual finding in this regard was not clearly erroneous.lalonde fraudulent activities deprived twelve victims of over million.the indictment charged these activities as a single scheme involving multiple victims.likewise,the statement of facts attached to the plea agreement,which lalonde admitted was accurate,described lalonde fraudulent dealings with various individuals as part of a single scheme.furthermore,both the statement of facts and special agent rogers testimony at the plea hearing indicate that lalonde had used money obtained from one victim to pay a previous victim so as to keep the scheme going.these facts support the district court determination that lalonde activities constituted a single scheme.while lalonde did not use the same ruse to ensnare each victim,he did employ the same general technique of presenting himself as a person qualified to give financial advice in order to induce his victims to part with their money.lalonde prey,while individually snagged,were all caught in the same web of fraud.accordingly,we find that the district court did not err in applying the enhancement pursuant to b b.
moreover,even if the district court conclusion regarding the scheme to defraud multiple victims were clearly erroneous,it would be harmless error.in addressing lalonde objection to the b b enhancement,the district court stated 
i would also note that lalonde is eligible for a increase pursuant to section.b a for an offense involving more than minimal planning,in the alternative to the challenged increase under section b b.
so,accordingly,the offense level would not have been changed,even were the court to have found merit in lalonde objection.
at.lalonde did not object to this statement by the district court.thus,even if lalonde had been correct regarding in characterization of his activities as several schemes with single victims,he would still have been subject to a enhancement under b.
enhancement pursuant to c 
section c provides for a enhancement i f the defendant was an organizer,leader,manager,or supervisor in any criminal activity.we have explained that a defendant must have exerted control over at least one individual within a criminal organization for the enhancement of to be warranted.united states vandeberg,cir quoting united states,cir.in determining whether a defendant qualifies as a leader,organizer,manager,or supervisor,a district court should consider a number of factors including,but not limited to,the exercise of decision making authority,the nature of participation in the commission of the offense,the recruitment of accomplices,the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime,the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense,the nature and scope of the illegal activity,and the degree of control and authority exercised over others,cmt.see also moncivais,at.merely playing an essential role in the offense is not equivalent to exercising managerial control over other participants the assets of a criminal enterprise.vandeberg,at citing united states albers,cir.
lalonde argues that the facts established at the plea hearing were insufficient to show that he was an organizer,leader,manager,or supervisor of the scheme.the district court rejected a similar argument.instead,the district court applied the factors set forth in and found that lalonde exercised authority as regards the manner in which the scheme would be conducted directed some of the activities of thomas mcghee in conducting the offense and claimed a larger share of the proceeds of the scheme than his.at.in reaching these conclusions,the court considered the fact that lalonde had directed mcghee to set up individual brokerage accounts for various victims of the fraud.the court also noted that lalonde had personally obtained all the sent by magellin and did not share this amount with his.based on these facts,the court found that lalonde was a leader or manager and that the enhancement was appropriate.
we find that the district court legal conclusion in this regard should be upheld under either a de novo or deferential standard of review.the district court properly applied the factors for determining management of a criminal organization.in particular,the district court focused on the fact that lalonde had exercised authority and control over others and had received a larger share of the profits from the scheme.the combination of these factors is sufficient to show that lalonde was a manager,leader,or organizer of the scheme.see,moncivais,at upholding the district court conclusion that defendant was an organizer or leader based on facts which demonstrated that defendant had exercised a significant degree of control over others,was involved to a significant degree in the planning of the operation,and had a large stake in its profitability.
the factual record further supports the district court conclusions.the statement of facts,which lalonde admitted was accurate,indicates that lalonde was the person who induced most of the victims to send their money either directly to him or to mcghee at continental capital.at.the statement of facts also indicates that lalonde,himself,used of magellin to repay edwina knott and spent the rest.id.at.lalonde alone kept the money from several of the other victims,including sheri weber,edwina knott,bank one,and monique bergeron.finally,lalonde kept most of the money received from the wright group.the fact that lalonde directed mcghee and liggett to act and then kept the majority of the fruits of their crime for himself is sufficient evidence to show that he was a manager or leader of the scheme.accordingly,we find that the district court properly applied the enhancement.
increase of criminal history score pursuant to a 
in determining a defendant criminal history category,a directs the district court to a dd three points for each prior sentence of imprisonment exceeding one year and one month.section a defines a prior sentence as any sentence previously imposed upon adjudication of guilt,whether by guilty plea,trial,or plea of nolo contendere,for conduct not part of the instant offense.the official commentary to indicates that a sentence for an invalid conviction is not counted.cmt.the commentary to further specifies 
sentences resulting from convictions that a have been reversed or vacated because of errors of law or because of evidence exonerating the defendant,or b have been ruled constitutionally invalid in a prior case are not to be counted.with respect to the current sentencing proceeding,this guideline and commentary do not confer upon the defendant any right to attack collaterally a prior conviction or sentence beyond any such rights otherwise recognized in law,expressly provides that a defendant may collaterally attack certain prior convictions.
cmt emphasis added.thus,the guidelines only explicitly prevent the use of prior convictions which have already been held invalid and leave open the question of whether a defendant may challenge the validity of other prior convictions at sentencing.
in united states mcglocklin,sitting en banc,we held that,under limited circumstances,a sentencing judge has discretion to entertain a defendant challenge to the inclusion of prior state convictions in his criminal history score based on the grounds of alleged federal constitutional violations,cir.however,we clarified that,in seeking the exclusion of such a conviction for federal sentencing purposes,a defendant may only challenge the validity of his conviction under federal,not state,law.id.at.
shortly after we decided mcglocklin,the supreme court found that for purposes of the penalty enhancements for prior convictions that are imposed by the armed career criminal act acca of,e,a defendant in a federal sentencing proceeding has no right to collaterally attack the validity of his previous state convictions,with the sole exception of convictions obtained in violation of the right to counsel.custis united states,d.finding custis to have superseded mcglocklin,we have subsequently held that a defendant in a sentencing proceeding may not collaterally challenge the use of prior convictions or parole revocations for purposes of criminal history calculation unless the challenge is based upon an alleged violation of the right to counsel.see united states carter,cir united states bonds,cir.
in the instant case,the district court increased lalonde criminal history score based upon a kentucky conviction for theft by failure to make required disposition.the conviction was based upon lalonde failure to make payments on or return a leased vehicle and was imposed following a guilty plea entered in boone county on september,through lalonde attorney james ogden.lalonde was not present at that plea hearing.lalonde argues that,because this conviction is invalid under state law,it should not have been used for a criminal history calculation.the district court rejected a similar argument for exclusion of the conviction at the sentencing hearing.the district court concluded that lalonde had not identified any basis under the sentencing guidelines or federal law for the exclusion of the conviction and the calculation of his criminal history category on this point.at.
the district court legal conclusion on this point was correct.kentucky law seems to provide that a felony conviction based upon a guilty plea entered in abstentia is invalid.see.the defendant shall be present at the arraignment,at every critical stage of the trial including the empaneling of the jury and the return of the verdict,and at the imposition of sentence in prosecutions for misdemeanors or violations the court may permit arraignment,plea,trial and imposition of sentence in the defendant absence tipton commonwealth,rcr is discretionary,and we consider it an abuse of discretion to accept a plea of guilty in absentia for any offense,such as driving under the influence,for which an enhanced penalty may be imposed for subsequent convictions.nevertheless,no kentucky court had declared lalonde conviction invalid prior to his sentencing in the instant case.thus,because lalonde challenge to his conviction was not based upon an alleged violation of the right to counsel,the district court was bound by bonds and carter not to allow lalonde to collaterally challenge the validity of the conviction at sentencing.moreover,even if mcglocklin were still valid precedent,lalonde challenge to his conviction could not have been sustained because his challenge was based on state law,not the federal constitution.accordingly,we find that,even if lalonde is correct in asserting the invalidity of his prior state law conviction,the district court properly included this conviction in its calculation of lalonde criminal history category.
fraud loss calculation pursuant to a 
section b m directs a sentencing court to increase the base level of the wire fraud offense by if the loss caused by the fraud exceeded but was less than.section a further specifies that such an increase of the base level shall be determined on the basis of all harm that resulted from the acts and omissions of the defendant and,in the case of jointly undertaken criminal activity,of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity.the commentary to this section provides an example of how to apply this rule to calculate the amount of loss in a fraud case 
defendants f and g,working together,design and execute a scheme to sell fraudulent stocks by telephone.defendant f fraudulently obtains.defendant g fraudulently obtains.each is convicted of mail fraud.defendants f and g each are accountable for the entire amount.each defendant is accountable for the amount he personally obtained under subsection a a.each defendant is accountable for the amount obtained by his accomplice under subsection a b because the conduct of each was in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity and was reasonably foreseeable in connection with that criminal activity.
cmt.we have also clarified that,in determining an increase in the base offense level,p roof of relevant conduct must be supported by some minimal indicium of reliability beyond mere allegation.united states nesbitt,cir quoting united states zimmer,cir.
lalonde argues that the district court erred by including the loss caused to wright gaming in its calculation of his offense level.lalonde contends that he did not participate in the fraud against wright gaming which,he claims,was orchestrated solely by liggett.the district court rejected this same argument at the sentencing hearing,finding that lalonde shared the proceeds of the fraud and was present at a meeting when liggett made false representations in order to defraud wright.at.
the district court factual conclusion regarding lalonde participation in the fraud against wright gaming is not clearly erroneous.the statement of facts,which lalonde agreed was accurate at the plea hearing,indicates that defendant and liggett induced wright gaming to send sic to the cloverleaf account at continental capital,based on their promise to enhance wright gaming creditworthiness in obtaining a loan for a barge casino on the mississippi river.at emphasis added.the statement of facts also states that defendant and liggett both received part of the.id.emphasis added.special agent rogers account of the facts,which lalonde also agreed was accurate,similarly indicates that defendant and liggett induced wright gaming to send them and that defendant and liggett both received part of the.at emphasis added.these undisputed facts clearly show that lalonde was involved in the scheme to defraud wright gaming.thus,the district court properly included the loss caused to wright gaming as part of its calculation of lalonde offense level.
d.the sentence imposed by the district court is reasonable.
standard of review 
we review a district court sentencing determination,under a deferential standard,for reasonableness.gall,at see also rita united states,d booker,at,which,as the supreme court has recently confirmed in gall,contains both procedural and substantive components.at accord united states thomas,cir united states jones,cir.
our first task in evaluating the reasonableness of the district court sentence is to ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error,such as failing to calculate or improperly calculating the guidelines range,treating the guidelines as mandatory,failing to consider the a factors,selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts,or failing to adequately explain the chosen an explanation for any deviation from the guidelines range.gall,at emphasis added.a district court commits such error if the district judge fails to consider the applicable guidelines range or neglec
