background 
in september,harris formed tradewinds international,limited partnership tradewinds,a hedge fund that engaged in trading various currency,bond and equity products.tradewinds was structured as a limited partnership harris was the general partner,and the patrons of the fund were limited partners.harris also formed two other hedge fund entities,all of which are collectively known as tradewinds harris was the only manager of those entities.
harris sent tradewinds investors quarterly statements via mail or.the wire fraud charge to which harris pleaded guilty arose out of communications in which he made material misstatements and omissions concerning the profitability of tradewinds,the use profitability of funds received from investors and the status of each investor investment.he was charged in a information with defrauding investors through the use of interstate wires in violation of and entered a plea of guilty to the information on june.
in the presentence investigation report psr,the probation officer calculated a total offense level of,for which the advisory guidelines range is months.harris then submitted his objections to the psr in which he challenged the inclusion of the financial institution enhancement,see b b i he contended that tradewinds was not a financial institution as that term is employed in the advisory guidelines.he also objected that he should not have received the sophisticated means enhancement,see b c 
harris and his wife forfeited most of their real and personal property in order to compensate the victims of his misrepresentations.harris also submitted letters to the district court,written by himself,family members and friends,that described his role as a devoted husband and father.furthermore,harris fully cooperated with government officials at all times during his proceedings.
relevant to this appeal,the district court analyzed,at harris sentencing,whether harris should receive the financial institutions enhancement under b b i.this section of the advisory sentencing guidelines provides for a upward adjustment to a defendant offense level when the crime substantially jeopardized the safety and soundness of a financial institution.b b i.
at the sentencing hearing,harris contended that tradewinds was not a financial institution.in reply,the government relied upon our opinion in united states collins,cir,which held that an investment company was a financial institution for purposes of the enhancement.id.at.the government submitted that,because tradewinds invested people money,it should be considered an investment company and therefore a financial institution.
harris attorney countered that collins was not controlling because the institution at issue in collins was a sham corporation.the district court rejected that argument,noting that the petitioners in collins had made,unsuccessfully,the same argument.in collins,we held that whether a corporation was a sham had no bearing on whether it could be considered a financial institution.the government proceeded to argue that,because tradewinds was a hedge fund,it was distinguishable from the investment company at issue in collins.neither the sentencing guidelines nor the relevant application note references specifically hedge funds the statutory definition,at also does not refer specifically to hedge funds.because the statutory definition refers to investment companies,and not hedge funds,harris urges that hedge funds can not be considered financial institutions under the statute.
the district court inquired about the investments tradewinds allegedly had made,and the prosecutor stated that tradewinds was supposedly investing in bonds and securities harris added that the company traded commodities,going long and short,and also other types of investments.at.
the district court determined that collins largely forecloses harris argument that tradewinds is not a financial institution.the district court noted that it was theoretically disputable whether tradewinds could be considered an investment company.however,it noted that,in footnote of collins,this court had referenced a definition of investment company that defined the term as a company substantially engaged in the business of investing in securities of other companies.collins,at citing united states savin,cir.the district court then stated that,because it viewed tradewinds as essentially an organization substantially engaged in the business of investing in securities of other companies,tradewinds should be characterized as a financial institution for purposes of the sentencing enhancement.harris spoke at the sentencing about her husband remorse.harris attorney also spoke on his behalf,and harris himself expressed his contrition to the district court.
the court then discussed the nature and circumstances of the offense,referring to submissions from victims of the fraud.the harm to the victims,stated the court,is really beyond quantification.at.in discussing harris family history and characteristics of the crime,the court determined that harris family circumstances weighed in favor of a shorter sentence the court also noted that harris had made efforts to locate the assets.in discussing the countervailing consideration of the seriousness of the offense and the concomitant need to promote respect for the law and to provide just punishment,the court emphasized that the criminal acts were repeated and had occurred over a long period of time.furthermore,because the crime was one that required a significant amount of forethought on harris part,the court determined that a significant sentence also would contribute to the goal of deterrence.considering the issue of remorse,the court observed that,at the time he announced his wrongdoing to the partners in the organization,harris did not appear remorseful,although he certainly was remorseful at sentencing.the district court further observed that harris did not need training,care or correctional treatment.the district court also recognized the importance of restitution in a case involving financial wrongdoing.
the district court then addressed the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities among people with similar records.harris urged that individuals charged in financial fraud cases such as enron and worldcom had received lesser sentences.the district court determined that these cases should have little effect on its decision because it knew little about the particular facts of those cases.finally,the district court looked to the advisory sentencing guidelines calculation,which put the range at months,and determined that a sentence within that range was sufficient but not greater than necessary.the court then imposed a sentence in the middle of the range,months,to be followed by three years of supervised release.the court also imposed a restitution obligation of.
