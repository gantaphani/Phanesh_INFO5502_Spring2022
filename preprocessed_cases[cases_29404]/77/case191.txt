jean hosking pleaded guilty to one count of embezzlement and was sentenced to months in prison and ordered to pay restitution.hosking appeals,arguing that her victim costs to investigate her fraud should not have been included in the restitution award.she also challenges the district court failure to provide a complete accounting of the loss caused by her fraud,and the order to make a payment of from her retirement account.
we affirm the principle of including a private victim investigative costs in the restitution award but vacate and remand for the district court to make findings regarding the amount of those costs.without such findings it is impossible to review the award propriety.we also affirm the aspect of the order requiring hosking to make a restitutionary payment from her retirement account.
hosking worked for the cross plains bank in cross plains,wisconsin,for almost twenty years.when her fraud was discovered in,she was an assistant vice president,responsible for among other things loans granted under the wisconsin petroleum environmental cleanup fund award pecfa program.the bank provides intermediary financing for the pecfa program,which pays for environmental cleanup costs incurred by owners of property contaminated by petroleum storage tanks.after a cleanup site is deemed eligible for a pecfa grant,the property owner takes out a line of credit with the bank,and then submits invoices for cleanup costs to the bank.the bank pays the invoices by allowing advances on the line of credit,and then submits claims for reimbursement to pecfa.
in,hosking began embezzling money from the bank pecfa loan program.her scheme involved taking unauthorized cash advances funded by pecfa loan accounts and covering her tracks by reimbursing those loan accounts with money taken from other pecfa loan accounts,thereby lapping the loan accounts.hosking lapping scheme went on for twelve years,and she embezzled funds from pecfa accounts.ultimately,bank officials started asking questions about discrepancies in pecfa loan files,and hosking confessed.she thought she had taken about.the bank internal investigation revealed that she had actually embezzled more than.
at sentencing,the bank requested restitution of.the probation office recommended a reduced restitution award of,which included the in embezzled funds,for the bank staff costs and for miscellaneous paper and copying expenses.hosking objected,arguing that there was insufficient documentation to support the bank claim for costs.in response,the government submitted minutes from the bank meetings relating to the investigation a declaration of losses from the bank a description of the pecfa loan process and hosking lapping scheme and a description of each expense the bank incurred in the investigation,with attached invoices and a listing of staff members and the hours they spent on the project.
the district court ordered restitution of.this figure included the hosking embezzled from the bank,plus for the bank investigation costs.to reach this new amount for investigation costs,the court added in legal fees in accounting consultant fees in miscellaneous paper and copying expenses and for staff costs,or half the amount recommended by the probation office to reimburse the bank for the time its employees spent on the investigation.the district court failed to explain why it cut the staff costs in half,stating only that the reduced amount was clearly legitimate.the district court also ordered hosking to make an immediate payment of from her retirement account.
the district court authority to order restitution is reviewed de novo,united states wells,cir,while the amount of restitution is reviewed for an abuse of discretion,united states sensmeier,cir citing united states newman,cir.hosking argues that the district court abused its discretion by including the bank investigation costs in the restitution award because the only actual loss caused by her embezzlement was the that she took.she labels the additional amount the bank spent on the investigation and professional fees as consequential damages not caused by her fraud and therefore not properly included in the award.we disagree in principle but question the amounts claimed.
the mandatory victims restitution act mvra requires a defendant convicted of certain crimes,including any offense committed by fraud or deceit,to make restitution to the victims of the offense in an amount equal to the value of the property damaged or lost.a,b,c a ii the mvra also expressly contemplates inclusion of the cost of lost income and necessary child care,transportation,and other expenses incurred during participation in the investigation or prosecution of the offense or attendance at proceedings related to the offense.b emphasis added.the bank investigation was clearly an important part of the investigation of the offense in this case.it led to the determination of the actual amount embezzled,and therefore the costs of that investigation may be included in the restitution award under b.see united states adcock,cir applying b to include the cost of an external audit in a restitution award because it qualified as other expenses incurred during participation in the investigation or prosecution of the offense united states amato,cir including attorney fees and accounting costs in a restitution award because these expenses are so obviously associated with investigation and prosecution,particularly in the case of fraud offenses.
in response to hosking argument that allowing the bank to recover these costs improperly reimburses the bank for consequential damages,we have repeatedly explained that it does no such thing.in fact,
t his measure of relief is less generous than common law damages,since it does not extend to consequences beyond the diminution of the value of the property stolen or damaged.this is because criminal restitution refers only to the restoration of something that the defendant had taken from the plaintiff,including a profit.
adcock,at quoting united states havens,cir,further quoting united states scott,cir other citations omitted.see also scott,at allowing restitution under b for a victim external audit costs because such costs represented a diminution in value of the victim property.
the time and effort spent by the bank employees and outside professionals in unraveling the embezzlement scheme was a direct and foreseeable result of the defendant conduct that contributed to the diminution of the value of the bank property.see b scott,at.see also united states donaby,cir.the bank activities were also an important part of the investigation of the offense.b adcock,at.the sentencing judge was selective.she included only those costs related to uncovering hosking fraud.this was not an abuse of discretion.
hosking argues that even if it was proper to include this category of costs in the restitution award,the sentencing judge nevertheless erred by failing to provide a complete accounting of those costs.instead,she cut the amount recommended by the probation office for investigation costs in half,and announced without elaboration that the reduced amount was clearly legitimate.we agree with hosking that more is needed,both from the government and the district court.
