appellant david tamman raises five issues in his appeal from the district court judgment of conviction and sentence.we begin by addressing an issue of first impression,that is,whether the district court erred at sentencing by applying both the broker dealer enhancement under united states sentencing guideline manual b a version at b a and the special skill enhancement under.we hold that the sentencing guidelines commentary prohibiting simultaneous application of the broker dealer and special skill enhancements does not apply when the broker dealer enhancement pertains specifically to a principal offense and the special skill enhancement pertains to a offense.
we then address tamman additional bases for appeal his arguments that his waiver of his right to a jury trial was not knowing,voluntary,and intelligent the district court erred in excluding two proffered experts the district court erred in admitting the statement of an alleged coconspirator and the district court erred in calculating loss and victim amounts,as required under the sentencing guidelines.we affirm the district court conviction and sentence.
factual and procedural history 
in,tamman,an attorney licensed in california,began performing work for newpoint financial services,a company owned by john farahi.to raise money through newpoint,farahi made private offerings of debentures.newpoint did not register the debentures with the sec,and while it took steps to make it appear that it was complying with federal securities law pertaining to unregistered securities including hiring tamman to prepare private placement memoranda ppms for the debentures it in fact regularly failed to disclose material information to investors,in violation of the securities laws.
in,tamman prepared a ppm that failed to disclose all material risks and facts pertaining to the investment.in,when the national association of securities dealers,now known as the financial industry regulatory authority finra,began an examination of newpoint that required disclosure of the ppm,tamman made substantial changes to the ppm and provided the new,backdated version to finra without disclosing that any changes had been made.
from to,farahi raised over million from investors through debentures.although he represented to the investors that these debentures were investments,farahi used the funds for various undisclosed purposes,including payment of his own personal expenses,principal repayments to previous investors,and futures options trading.in,his loss of approximately million from option trading significantly hampered his ability to repay newpoint investors and creditors.nevertheless,he continued to assure investors that their funds were safe and began to raise additional money to pay back prior investors,sustain his personal expenses,and engage in options trading.
in,the sec visited newpoint offices while investigating a tip that farahi was running a ponzi scheme.after meeting with farahi,tamman created more backdated versions of ppms with added disclosures.throughout the sec investigation,tamman continued to edit backdated ppms and promissory notes.
in,tamman was indicted and charged with one count of conspiracy to obstruct justice,one count of accessory after the fact to mail fraud and securities law violations,five counts of altering documents to influence a federal investigation,and three counts of aiding and abetting farahi false testimony at an sec deposition.on october,tamman waived his right to a jury trial and opted for a bench trial.during in limine hearings on october,and october,the district court excluded tamman experts,mason dinehart and stanley lamport.the district court offered tamman the chance to revise dinehart report and requested that the substance of lamport report be included in a trial brief.his case proceeded to trial on october.
in november,the district court found tamman guilty,and in september,sentenced him to months of imprisonment,well below the calculated sentencing guidelines sentencing range of to months.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,tamman argues that his conviction was the result of an unconstitutional jury waiver and expert testimony exclusion,as well as inadmissible hearsay.he also argues that three errors at sentencing simultaneous application of the broker dealer and special skill enhancements,and calculation of loss and number of victims necessitate remand.we disagree 
alleged sentencing errors 
the district court sentenced tamman as an accessory after the fact to farahi crimes of mail fraud and unregulated offer and sale of securities,pursuant to.that sentencing guideline provides that the applicable base offense level for a is the total offense level of the principal crime,including any applicable special offense characteristics that were known or reasonably should have been known by the,less six levels.cmt.once the district court determines the base offense level,the district court must also apply any specific offense characteristics applicable to the conduct.
in tamman case,the base offense level was therefore the total offense level for farahi mail fraud and securities crimes,which is prescribed by,less six levels.farahi mail fraud and securities crimes included the following special offense characteristics a level enhancement for loss under b l a enhancement under b b because the crime involved or more victims and a enhancement for farahi role as an investment adviser during the commission of a securities law violation under b a.the district court found that the total offense level for farahi mail and securities crimes,including applicable special offense characteristics,was.pursuant to a,the district court reduced the total offense level by to ascertain tamman base offense level for his accessory after the fact crime.however,because caps the maximum base offense level at,the district court determined that tamman base offense level was.
upon calculating the total offense level for farahi crime and subtracting the requisite levels,the district court then added special offense characteristics specific to tamman a enhancement for tamman use of his lawyering skills to commit the crime under and a enhancement for tamman role in impeding the sec investigation under.after applying the special skill and obstruction of justice enhancements,the district court calculated tamman total offense level as.
tamman challenges the dual application of the broker dealer and special skill enhancements,as well as the district court factual findings as to the total loss amount and total number of victims.we review the district court interpretation of the sentencing guidelines de novo and its findings of fact at sentencing for clear error.united states gadson,cir.
application of broker dealer and special skills enhancements 
tamman contends that the dual application of the broker dealer enhancement and the special skills enhancement was improper and barred by the sentencing guidelines.in support,tamman cites the sentencing guideline application note to b a,which states,i f subsection b applies,do not apply.u.cmt.c version at cmt.c.
as this court has long acknowledged,the sentencing guidelines recognize the problems inherent in double counting and,in an effort to avoid increasing a defendant sentence for a harm that has already been fully taken into account,expressly prohibit the dual application of sentencing guidelines that account for the same harm.united states smith,cir citing united states rosas,cir united states holt,cir.however,when each invocation of the behavior serves a unique purpose under the guidelines,we conclude that the commission authorized and intended the cumulative application of both provisions.id.quoting holt,at.
in,the sentencing commission amended the broker dealer enhancement to cover registered brokers and dealers,associated persons of a broker or dealer,investment advisers,and associated persons of an investment adviser.app.c,vol.ii,at amend.the rationale accompanying the amendment explains 
the commission concluded that a four level enhancement appropriately reflects the culpability of offenders who occupy such positions and who are subject to heightened fiduciary duties
