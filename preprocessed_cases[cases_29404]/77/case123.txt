appellant thomas prousalis pled guilty to three counts arising from his fraudulent activity in connection with a client initial public offering.he now seeks habeas relief,contending that,in light of the supreme court intervening decision in janus capital group,first derivative traders,the conduct for which he was convicted is no longer criminal.for the following reasons,we reject prousalis claims and affirm the dismissal of his petition.
thomas prousalis was a securities lawyer who marketed his services to small firms seeking to raise capital.at issue here is his representation,busybox,an internet company that he guided through the process of conducting an initial public offering ipo.despite busybox modest size and limited cash flow,prousalis persuaded company management to agree to an initial offering of over million.prousalis retainer agreement provided that he would be compensated the greater of or percent of the gross proceeds notably,his fee was contingent upon the successful closing of the ipo.to effectuate the transaction,busybox also hired barron chase securities,an investment banking firm,which agreed to provide a firm commitment underwriting.this agreement obligated barron chase to purchase all of the available busybox shares and then resell them to the public.
prousalis prepared the ipo registration materials,which were subsequently signed by busybox officers and filed with the securities and exchange commission sec.the materials stated that busybox intended to raise million in gross proceeds through the offering,with net receipts of million.the forms also reported prousalis legal fee,but failed to acknowledge the contingent nature of his compensation.when busybox ceo attempted to correct the registration statement to accurately reflect prousalis retainer agreement,prousalis insisted that the existing description was compliant and that the sec had confirmed its sufficiency.prousalis later admitted in his plea allocution that he knew at the time that busybox would not be listed on the nasdaq exchange if his compensation arrangement were accurately disclosed.
prousalis soon became aware that barron chase was unwilling to complete a firm commitment underwriting of the ipo.barron chase failure to uphold its end of the bargain generated a shortfall of million in the ipo as originally conceived.to solve this problem,prousalis orchestrated a scheme in which ipo proceeds were recycled in order to purchase shares that were then used both to compensate him in a sum unrelated to his retainer agreement and to pay salaries and bonuses to busybox officers.prousalis failed to disclose these maneuvers to the sec.only after the initial offering was made did he reveal to busybox officers the existence of the shortfall and his proposed remedy.the judge presiding over prousalis earlier collateral proceeding noted that prousalis specifically admitted that at the time he did each of these acts he knew he was doing something wrong,knew he was acting in violation of the law,and was acting with the intent to deceive and defraud investors in busybox securities.prousalis united states,civ.dlc,cr,slip op.at.
as a result of these activities,prousalis was indicted in the southern district of new york on three counts.count one charged conspiracy to commit securities fraud,wire fraud,and mail fraud in violation of b,b.count two charged securities fraud in violation of b,b.finally,count three charged failure to disclose interest of counsel in the registration materials prousalis prepared in connection with the ipo in violation of.as relevant for purposes of this appeal,prousalis convictions hinged in large part on his violation of sec rule,which implements section b of the securities exchange act of.the rule provides 
it shall be unlawful for any person,directly or indirectly,by the use of any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce,or of the mails or of any facility of any national securities exchange t o make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made,in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,not misleading in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.
b.subjects certain violators of rule to criminal penalties.a any person who willfully violates any provision of this chapter or any rule or regulation thereunder the violation of which is made unlawful shall upon conviction be fined not more than,or imprisoned not more than years,or both.
trial commenced but was aborted when prousalis agreed to plead guilty to each count pursuant to a plea agreement.the district court subsequently sentenced prousalis to months of imprisonment,followed by three years of supervised release.he was also ordered to pay million in restitution.prousalis appealed to the second circuit but lost on the basis of the appeal waiver contained in his plea agreement.in,he filed a petition for collateral review under,alleging ineffective assistance of counsel and fifth and sixth amendment violations.the district court denied his petition and the second circuit affirmed the dismissal.
pursuant to the savings clause of,prousalis later filed a habeas petition in the eastern district of virginia the site of his supervised release under,naming his probation officer as respondent.as explained below,prousalis is only eligible for relief under if the conduct for which he was originally convicted is no longer deemed criminal.the district court denied his motion,citing two alternative rationales.first,it concluded that the decision upon which prousalis relies,janus,has no application in the criminal context.second,it determined that prousalis pled guilty to charges such as aiding and abetting that fall outside the substantive scope of the janus decision,which only addresses primary liability under the securities laws.the court thus concluded that prousalis petition constituted an unauthorized,successive motion and dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.this appeal followed.
prousalis may file a habeas petition under only if the collateral relief typically available under is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.e.this standard is satisfied when 
a t the time of conviction,settled law of this circuit or the supreme court established the legality of the conviction subsequent to the prisoner direct appeal and first motion,the substantive law changed such that the conduct of which the prisoner was convicted is deemed not to be criminal and the prisoner can not satisfy the gatekeeping provisions of because the new rule is not one of constitutional law.
in re jones,cir.the parties here agree that conditions and are satisfied.
prousalis bases his argument under prong on the supreme court decision in janus,which was handed down subsequent to his direct appeal and motion.in that case,the court defined what it means to make an untrue statement in the context of a private action alleging a rule violation.according to the court,the maker of a statement is the person or entity with ultimate authority over the statement,including its content and whether and how to communicate it.janus.at.it added that w ithout control,a person or entity can merely suggest what to say,not make a statement in its own right.one who prepares or publishes a statement on behalf of another is not its maker.id.the court analogized its rule to the relationship between a speaker and speechwriter even when a speechwriter drafts a speech,the content is entirely within the control of the person who delivers it.and it is the speaker who takes credit or blame for what is ultimately said.id.
prousalis contends that,under janus,he does not qualify as the maker of any false statements contained in busybox registration materials.instead,busybox itself the entity with the ultimate legal authority over the sec filings is the maker for purposes of.if this interpretation of janus is correct,then prousalis arguably stands condemned at least in part of conduct which is no longer deemed criminal.on the other hand,prousalis convictions unquestionably remain valid if his reading of janus is mistaken.he does not contest th
