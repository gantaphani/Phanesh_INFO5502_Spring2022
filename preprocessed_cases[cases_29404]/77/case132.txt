on appeal,arthur weiss weiss challenges his month sentence,following his plea of guilty to one count of wire fraud,one count of money laundering,id,one count of making a false statement on a loan application to a financial institution,the accounts of which are insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic,id,and one count of corrupt interference with the internal revenue laws of the united states,a.we affirm.
the following facts either underlie the counts to which weiss pled guilty or constitute relevant conduct for sentencing purposes.
from sometime in until mid,arthur weiss weiss owned and operated several professional employer organizations in north carolina.a professional employer organization peo provides human resource functions,including payroll processing,for companies through employee leasing agreements.under north carolina law,peos are required to be licensed and regulated by the north carolina department of insurance.north carolina professional employer organization act.to.
during this time frame,weiss falsely held himself out as a certified public accountant by using the initials cpa on his letterhead,on his business cards,and in his email address.the record also contains evidence that weiss provided a brochure to a potential client,whom he later acquired as an actual client,outlining the services offered by his peo named employee alternatives,llc ea,including payroll processing,tax services,and securing workers compensation insurance.the ea brochure stated that w e deposit your payroll taxes,file payroll tax returns and assume full responsibility for the accuracy and timeliness of those processes.internal quotation marks omitted.other ea services included preparation and filing of internal revenue service irs form employer quarterly federal income tax return and making deposits for federal unemployment insurance.in the ea brochure,weiss listed himself as a cta,which can stand for either certified tax accountant or chartered tax advisor,and listed himself as an ata,which stands for accredited tax advisor.id.
through his various peo entities,at least companies hired weiss.weiss collected funds from client companies to pay the wages of the companies respective leased employees along with a fee for the payroll services.weiss then deposited such funds into bank accounts he controlled.weiss then instructed payroll companies to actually calculate the applicable state and federal income tax withholdings.the payroll companies either paid the employees their net income directly or advised weiss of the net amounts due thereafter weiss would disburse the net paycheck funds to the employees.on many occasions,weiss failed to pay the state and federal withholdings deposited with his peo entities to the irs and relevant state revenue agencies,converting such funds to his own use.
weiss also collected funds from his client companies to secure workers compensation insurance for their leased employees,but failed to secure the level of coverage for which he collected premiums.he converted the excess premium payments to his own use.
weiss stipulated for sentencing purposes that the losses attributable to him totaled in unpaid federal employment taxes,in unpaid state employment taxes,and in unpaid workers compensation insurance premiums.
another weiss scam involved a bank insured by the fdic.over time,weiss established a close banking relationship with branch bank and trust bb t.from until,weiss submitted false federal income tax returns to bb t reflecting higher income figures for himself than he had actually reported to the irs.in reliance upon these misrepresentations,between and,bb t approved four loans to weiss,totaling,for the purchase of a lot and construction of a home in marion,north carolina.the home securing such loans subsequently sold in bankruptcy proceedings for.
weiss failed to report any of his illegally obtained income to the irs.he stipulated that the illegal income he should have declared on his federal income tax returns resulted in him underpaying personal income taxes in the amount of.
weiss used a portion of the proceeds from his employment tax scheme to purchase expensive jewelry.between may,and may,weiss and his wife traveled to romania.during the trip,weiss falsely reported to his insurance carrier that four pieces of jewelry with a total purchase price of were lost or stolen.he subsequently received a check,via the united states postal service,from his insurance carrier,for the appraised value of such jewelry.law enforcement authorities subsequently located the same four items of jewelry in weiss home.
the presentence report psr calculated weiss total offense level under the united states sentencing guidelines the guidelines or ussg at and his criminal history category at iii,resulting in an advisory sentencing range of to months imprisonment.of relevance on appeal,the total offense level of included a level enhancement for abuse of a position of trust,pursuant to ussg,to which weiss objected.the district court overruled his objection.
also of relevance on appeal,the total offense level of set forth in the psr included levels for a loss of more than,but less than.see ussg b k.weiss objected to application of this loss range,contending that he is only accountable for in losses,thus placing him in the loss range of more than,but less than.this loss range results in an level increase in his offense level as opposed to.see ussg b j.the district court overruled this objection also.the district court found the total amount of loss attributable to weiss offense conduct and relevant conduct to be.
ultimately,the district court determined weiss advisory sentencing range under the guidelines to be to months imprisonment,and sentenced him to months imprisonment.
on appeal,weiss challenges the procedural reasonableness of his sentence on the basis that the district court erred by increasing his offense level under the guidelines by levels pursuant ussg for abuse of a position of trust by increasing his offense level under the guidelines by levels pursuant to ussg.b k,instead of by only levels pursuant to ussg b j and by failing sua sponte to appoint various experts to assist in his defense at sentencing.we address each of these assignments of error in turn.
ussg provides for a level enhancement in the defendant offense level if the defendant abused a position of public or private trust in a manner that significantly facilitated the commission or concealment of the offense ussg.the applicable commentary identifies a position of trust as a role characterized by professional or managerial discretion,substantial discretionary judgment that is ordinarily given considerable deference.ussg,comment.the enhancement also applies to imposters,so long as the provides sufficient indicia to the victim that the defendant legitimately holds a position of private or public trust.united states brack,cir internal quotation marks omitted.this is so because i n making the misrepresentation,the defendant assumes a position of trust,relative to the victim,that provides the defendant with the same opportunity to commit a crime that the defendant would have had if the position were legitimately held.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
three factors guide the sentencing court in determining whether a person held a position of public or private trust for purposes of applying the ussg enhancement whether the defendant had special duties or access to information not available to other employees the extent of the defendant discretion and whether the defendant acts indicate that he is more culpable than similarly situated actors.id.the commentary to ussg also provides specific examples of when the defendant abuse of a position of trust justifies application of the enhancement an embezzlement of a client funds by an attorney serving as a guardian,a bank executive fraudulent loan scheme,or the criminal sexual abuse of a patient by a physician under the guise of an examination.ussg,comment.in contrast,the same commentary provides that the adjustment does not apply in the case of an embezzlement or theft by an ordinary bank teller or hotel clerk because such positions are not characterized by the abovedescribed factors.id.
here,in concluding weiss should receive a ussg enhancement for abuse of a position of trust,the district court found the following facts weiss held himself out to be a cpa cpas have substantial discretionary judgment in making determinations as to how to properly engage in the various computations and decisions necessary to properly account for and pay the various payroll taxes at issue in the present case and most persons would regard cpas to be regulated by the state weiss holding himself out as a cpa significantly facilitated his fraud scheme by g iving him certain credential with people in business who would be willing to give him such type of business and have him provide the services that one would imagine that a cpa would faithfully and properly provide and weiss holding himself out as a cpa significantly facilitated the commission and concealment of his fraud scheme by allowing him to manage payroll functions,including the payment of state and federal tax withholdings to the proper government agencies,without any oversight.
we review the factual findings underlying the district court ussg enhancement for clear error.united states dawkins,cir.to the extent the district court undertook a legal interpretation of ussg,our review is de novo.united states gormley,cir.
on appeal,weiss concedes the government presented evidence at sentencing that he used the cpa designation in many of his business documents and on his business cards,and thus,it may be reasonable to infer that he held himself out as a cpa to at least some of the victims.weiss opening br.at.however,weiss contends that a ussg enhancement is inapplicable in his case because there was no evidence adduced in any form that his false representation of himself as a cpa induced any of these victims to do business with him or caused them to repose a higher level of trust or confidence in him whatsoever.id.in weiss view,he merely provided payroll and insurance agent services to his victim corporations and did not act as their cpas.
in support of his position,weiss primarily relies upon our decision in united states caplinger,cir.the defendant in caplinger misrepresented himself as an accomplished physician in his efforts to attract investors in his fraudulent schemes involving production of a fake wonder drug used to treat.id.at.in determining the defendant offense level under the guidelines,the district court assessed a level enhancement pursuant to ussg for abuse of a position of trust.id.at.the defendant challenged the enhancement on appeal.
on appeal,we framed the issue as whether caplinger,by posing as an accomplished physician in order to influence potential investors,abused a position of trust with respect to the victims of his fraud scheme within the meaning of ussg.id.at.in answering this question in the negative,we reasoned that while the false information about the defendant credentials and experience assisted in convincing investors and in making them more confident about their investment,any trust the investors placed in the defendant was not based on a special relationship he had with them as a physician,but on their misplaced belief in the misrepresentations about his credentials and the fake wonder drug potential for success.id.at.as a result,we vacated the defendant sentence and remanded for resentencing without the ussg enhancement.id.at.
weiss contends that the argument for applying the enhancement in caplinger is stronger than in his case because the sentencing court in caplinger found that the defendant misrepresentations induced the victims to invest in his fraudulent scheme,while in weiss case,the record contains no evidence that falsely holding himself out as a cpa induced any victim to participate in any of his schemes in any way.
the government distinguishes caplinger on the basis that,in caplinger,the defendant participated in an transaction with each of his victims as opposed to entering into a fiduciary or personal trust relationship with his victims as weiss did.
the primary case upon which the government relies in support of its position is brack.in brack,the defendant tiffanie brack brack posed as a bail bondsman at a north carolina jail in order to secure identifying information,cash,and the title to two properties from an elderly gentleman attempting to post bond for his granddaughter.at.brack pled guilty to one count of wire fraud and one count of aggravated identity theft.in sentencing brack,the district court applied a ussg enhancement for abuse of a position of trust based upon brack purported position as a bail bondsman.id.at.
brack unsuccessfully challenged the enhancement on appeal.on appeal,we first concluded that a bail bondsman in north carolina holds a position of public trust leading to the assumption of certain fiduciary duties to their clients.id.at.second,we concluded that brack purported position as a bail bondsman significantly contributed to the commission or concealment of her offenses because the position provide d a seemingly valid basis for her to make initial contact with the victim grandfather at the jail,and it also allowed brack to secure the victim grandfather identifying information without revealing her criminal intent.id.at.
the government argues that the relevant facts in the present case are on all fours with brack in that weiss represented himself throughout the course of his unlawful activity as being a cpa,thus providing his victims sufficient indicia that he was trustworthy and qualified to handle their payroll processing,and weiss misrepresentations about being a cpa created trust relationships with his clients which allowed him to manage the gross payroll of several large companies virtually unchecked.
we uphold the district court level enhancement in weiss offense level pursuant to ussg for abuse of a position of trust.t he central purpose of is to penalize defendants who take advantage of a position that provides them with the freedom to commit a wrong.id.at internal quotation marks and alteration marks omitted.here,there is more than sufficient evidence in the record from which a reasonable person could infer that weiss had a trust relationship with at least one of his which provided him with the freedom to commit a wrong.while all payroll processing companies are not headed up by a cpa,when a cpa does head up a payroll processing company,with the attendant required calculations for tax withholding and payments over to the irs and applicable state agency,the client company reasonably believes that it has hired a licensed professional in the field to ensure the proper processing of its payroll liabilities and responsibilities.weiss only had to take advantage of his trust relationship with one client on one occasion in order for the enhancement to apply.this fact is easily inferred from the record evidence.
caplinger is materially distinguishable on the basis that the defendant in caplinger did not have a trust relationship with any of his investor victims.the present case is analogous to brack in the sense that we can infer from the evidence in the present case that weiss was able to perpetrate his fraud,at least in part,because of a trust relationship with at least one of his victim companies.
in sum,the district court did not err in increasing weiss offense level by levels pursuant to ussg for abuse of a position of trust.
we now turn to weiss challenge to the district court loss calculation under the guidelines.in calculating weiss offense level under the guidelines,the district court found the amount of pecuniary harm foreseeable to weiss with respect to his offense conduct and all relevant conduct to be.this amount added levels to weiss base offense level of for a loss greater than,but less than.ussg.b k.the district court reached this figure by finding as follows weiss failed to pay the irs.in employment taxes that he collected from his client companies payrolls weiss failed to pay.in state taxes for his client companies weiss failed to pay in workers compensation premiums for his client companies weiss fraudulently obtained an
