in,alaska claims that the district court erred when it refused to certify alaska proposed class,because in reaching its decisions the court conducted the federal rule of civil procedure certification hearing under a standard,rather than under a standard,and applied an incorrect standard of loss causation to alaska exchange act claims,resulting in an erroneous predominance determination under rule b.in,alaska asks us to reverse the district court grant of flowserve motion for summary judgment on the merits of alaska actions,contending that the court was precluded from acting on the merits of alaska claims during the pendency of its appeal in,erroneously concluded that the merits of alaska exchange act claim were resolved by the court own resolution of loss causation for purposes,and ignored the presumption of loss causation for securities act claims.flowserve counters that even if the district court thus erred,its judgment should be affirmed because the provision of the private securities litigation reform act the pslra,c a b,applies to the projections at issue,and the securities act statute of limitation,bars alaska and claims.we reverse in part,vacate in part,and remand for further proceedings in the district court.
facts and proceedings 
flowserve corporation manufactures pumps,seals,and valves,along with providing flow management services.in january,the company made scott greer its ceo.any honeymoon for greer was brief on february,flowserve reported net earnings of million for fiscal year fy,a decline from its earnings,after which its stock closed at a low.
to help address its financial difficulties,flowserve undertook acquisitions in and that were designed to create synergies and to yield other benefits in a consolidating industry.flowserve acquired ingersoll dresser pump company idp in august for million and the flow control division of invensys plc ifc in may for million.to finance these acquisitions,flowserve entered into a billion credit agreement and twice offered public stock,once in november and again in april 
the parties versions of flowserve conduct diverge from there.alaska claims that greer,renee hornbaker,the cfo during the class period,and flowserve through its officers schemed to misrepresent the company financial condition by making inextricably related false statements concerning earnings forecasts,historical financial performance,past and future integration costs and savings related to the acquisitions of idp and ifc,and compliance.flowserve disputes this characterization.
as an example of this alleged scheme,alaska points to a press release issued on the date that it selected to begin the putative class period,february.flowserve release reported earnings of million for,in which its true earnings were million lower than reported,a fact not known publicly until flowserve restated its earnings in.the same press release announced reduced earnings and a projection lower than analysts expectations.according to alaska,the projection included fraudulent misstatements designed to increase expectations about integration synergies from the idp acquisition yet,flowserve stock price declined in response to the inflated earnings estimate.
in addition to a variety of flowserve other public statements that alaska claims were fraudulent,it highlights an april,announcement of positive earnings that overstated earnings and understated costs,in response to which flowserve stock climbed.the earnings statement,released on july,was inflated as well,but also reduced earnings guidance,causing the stock to slip although it rebounded by the next day.according to alaska,flowserve again engaged in fraud when it knowingly released overly optimistic earnings guidance on october,the same day that it released inaccurate results flowserve stock rose in response to these releases.
after repeating the same guidance on february,same day that it had released misstated results,including a understatement of downwardly revised its guidance in july and september after the july downward revision of the guidance,flowserve stock declined,and declined another after the september disclosure.both releases blamed the reduced earnings on industry and market factors and did not disclose facts that alaska contends were the real reasons for the decline,namely flowserve failure to comply with debt covenants,misstated historical financial performance,and problems in extracting synergies from flowserve acquisitions.alaska introduced expert testimony to show that statistically significant proportions of those declines in share price were attributable to factors,not to factors.
on february,flowserve announced that it would downwardly restate earnings for by million.no statistically significant decline in share price occurred after this disclosure.the actual amount of the eventual restatement totaled almost million,and flowserve admitted that it had not been in compliance with its debt covenants.
alaska filed suit in federal district court against flowserve,greer,and hornbaker on august.an amended complaint filed on may,named as additional defendants banc of america and credit suisse first boston,two of flowserve underwriters for the stock offerings made during the class period,and pricewaterhousecoopers,flowserve auditor during the class period.alaska filed its final amended complaint on february,suing flowserve,greer,and hornbaker under of the exchange act and suing greer and hornbaker under of the exchange act and of the securities act as controlling persons and suing all defendants under of the securities act for making stock offerings under a defective registration statement.
all defendants moved to dismiss alaska complaint under federal rules of civil procedure b and b.the district court denied these motions and,in a detailed opinion,denied the defendants request to file an interlocutory appeal.ryan flowserve,d.alaska then moved to certify a class on may.it defined the class as a ll persons who purchased the equity securities of flowserve corporation between february,and september,subject to the customary exclusions.the district court conducted a hearing after which it denied certification in an opinion filed on november.ryan flowserve.in that same opinion,the court granted the defendants pending motions,thereby resolving the case on the merits as well on december,we granted alaska timely motion in for permission to appeal the denial of class certification under rule f.on january,the district court entered final judgment on the merits,dismissing all of alaska claims,from which judgment alaska timely appealed in.we consolidated the two appeals here.

class certification.
alaska exchange act claim requires it to show,in connection with the purchase or sale of a security,that the defendants made a misstatement or omission,of a material fact,with scienter,on which alaska relied,and that proximately caused alaska loss.greenberg crossroads,cir.alaska class certification appeal concerns the application of rule b predominance requirement to the reliance element of alaska exchange act claims 
class certification requires that questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members.rule b c.as to the reliance element of alaska claims,i f the circumstances surrounding each class member alleged reliance on the purported misrepresentations differ,then reliance is an issue that will have to be proven by each plaintiff,and the proposed class fails the predominance requirement.unger amedisys,cir.alaska can establish a class wide rebuttable presumption of reliance using the fraud on the market theory of collective reliance.id.at.under this theory,it is assumed that all public information concerning a company is known to the market and reflected in the market price of the company stock.greenberg,at.thus,when someone purchases a company stock,a court can presume that he relied on the supposition that the market price was validly set and that no unsuspected manipulation ha d artificially inflated the price.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
to establish the rebuttable presumption,the supreme court has explained,a plaintiff must prove that the defendant made public material misrepresentations,the defendant shares were traded in an efficient market,and the plaintiffs traded shares between the time the misrepresentations were made and the time the truth was revealed.id.at discussing basic levinson,d.we have tighten ed the se requirements.oscar private equity invs.allegiance telecom,cir.most notably,we require a plaintiff additionally to prove that the defendant materially affected the market price of the security.nathenson zonagen,cir quoting abell potomac ins,cir.as we have explained,this essentially requires a plaintiff to demonstrate loss causation.oscar,at.to establish loss causation,a plaintiff must prove that the negative truthful information causing the decrease in price was related to an allegedly false,positive statement made earlier and that it is more probable than not that it was this negative statement,and not other unrelated negative statements,that caused a significant amount of the decline.greenberg,at.
the district court concluded that alaska failed to prove loss causation and that alaska thus was not entitled to the rebuttable presumption of class wide reliance.consequently,it held,alaska did not satisfy rule b predominance requirement.it is this holding that alaska challenges on appeal.we conclude that the district court failed to apply the proper legal standard,and we remand the case so that it may do so.
alaska was required to prove loss causation by a preponderance of the evidence.
before addressing the merits of alaska class certification appeal,we address its argument that the district court applied an erroneous standard of proof.the district court required alaska to prove loss causation by a preponderance of the evidence.alaska contends that the court should instead have inquired whether a reasonable trier of fact could have found loss causation by a preponderance of the substantially less stringent standard.
our precedents foreclose that position.in oscar private equity investments allegiance telecom,we held that loss causation as an issue of predominance must be established at the class certification stage by a preponderance of all admissible evidence,at see also teamsters local freight division pension fund bombardier,cir t he preponderance of the evidence standard applies to evidence proffered to establish rule requirements.in re hydrogen peroxide antitrust litigation,cir factual determinations necessary to make rule findings must be made by a preponderance of the evidence.and the plain text of rule requires the court to find the facts favoring class certification,unger,at,not to inquire whether a jury reasonably could do so.
alaska contends that reading our cases so broadly would create conflict with rules and and would have the potential for intruding on plaintiffs seventh amendment right to a jury trial.appellants opening brief.its argument proceeds as follows when assessing a defendant rule motion for summary judgment,a district court is required to inquire whether a reasonable jury could find loss causation by a preponderance of the evidence.but a plaintiff can not present that evidence to the jury if the district court denies class certification under rule for lack of predominance.thus,if the district court may assess predominance at the class certification stage under a higher standard of proof than that required under rule,the plaintiff may be denied the opportunity to present sufficient evidence to the jury.
this argument fails because it conflates the issue of loss causation for purposes of establishing predominance under rule with the issue of loss causation on the merits.in determining the propriety of a class action,the question is not whether the plaintiff or plaintiffs have stated a cause of action or will prevail on the merits,but rather whether the requirements of rule are met.eisen carlisle jacquelin,d quoting miller mackey international,wisdom,see also appellants opening brief an evaluation of the probable outcome on the merits is not properly part of the certification decision quoting fed.civ.c advisory committee notes.the rule analysis must focus on the requirements of the rule,and if findings made in connection with those requirements overlap findings that will have to be made on the merits,such overlap is only coincidental.bell ascendant solutions,cir.the denial of class certification does not prevent a plaintiff from proceeding individually.and the court determination for class certification purposes may be revised or wholly rejected by the ultimate factfinder.unger,at see also oscar,at l oss causation,as an element of a claim,can be reexamined at summary judgment.in short,alaska bore the burden of establishing loss causation by a preponderance of the evidence in order to obtain certification of its proposed class.this burden was independent of alaska obligation to establish reliance on the merits,and the rule requirement does nothing to compromise alaska opportunity to meet that distinct obligation.
the district court applied an improper standard for assessing loss causation.
loss causation requires proof of a causal connection between a misstatement and a subsequent decline in a stock price.in dura,broudo,the supreme court explained that,though necessary,evidence that a stock was purchased at a fraudulently inflated price is insufficient to prove causation,d.a plaintiff must also establish that after the purchase and before the loss there was a disclosure of negative truthful information that was related to the allegedly false,positive statement made earlier.oscar,at see lormand us unwired,cir explaining that our related to test is in harmony with dura relevant to standard.the loss must be caused because this truth ma de its way into the marketplace,not as a result of changed economic circumstances,changed investor expectations,new or facts,conditions,or other factors independent of the fraud.dura,at.
the central dispute between the parties concerns the definition of relevant corrective information for purposes of assessing loss causation.flowserve argues,and the district court largely agreed,that a plaintiff must show a disclosure of information that fully corrected prior misstatements.joint brief of appellees flowserve corporation,scott greer,and renee hornbaker see also ryan flowserve,memorandum order.in other words,under this theory a fraud causes a loss only if the loss follows a corrective statement that specifically reveals the fraud.the only statements that meet this definition were made in,when flowserve restated its earnings and announced that it had not been in compliance with its debt covenants.because no statistically significant decline in flowserve share price followed those disclosures,they did not cause alaska any loss.thus,under flowserve view of relevant disclosures,alaska has failed to establish loss causation.
alaska contends that loss causation may result when the true financial condition of a company becomes of whether the disclosure of the company true financial condition corrects past misstatements.so long as the difference between the market erroneous perception of the financial condition of the company and the company true financial condition is a consequence of the fraud,alaska argues,a loss that results from a revelation of the company true financial condition is caused by the fraud.under this view,any disclosure of flowserve weakening financial condition would relate to its earlier misstatements.
neither party is correct the true standard lies in the middle.flowserve position effectively does away with the theory of reliance.if a disclosure were required to establish loss causation,a defendant could defeat liability by refusing to admit the falsity of its prior misstatements.in re worlds of wonder sec,cir.and if a complete corrective disclosure were required,defendants could immunize themselves with a protracted series of partial disclosures.freeland iridium world commc ns.thus,t o be corrective,a disclosure need not precisely mirror an earlier misrepresentation.in re williams sec.subclass,cir.
alaska position similarly is untenable,because undisclosed information can not drive down the market price of a stock.only information known to the market can cause a loss.for this reason,only information known to the market is relevant under the theory of class wide reliance.as we have explained,to establish loss causation this disclosed information must reflect part of the relevant truth the truth obscured by the fraudulent statements.
our cases illustrate the application of this standard.for example,in greenberg crossroads systems,cir,the plaintiffs argued that they relied to their detriment on several alleged misstatements.among them were statements reporting the defendant financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year and detailed analysts earnings estimates for the fiscal second quarter,and statements pertaining to the defendant third quarter earnings.id.at.these statements caused a substantial loss,plaintiffs argued,when the stock price fell in part because of a subsequent press release predicting a significant revenue shortfall for the defendant third fiscal quarter.we explained that the press release was related to the latter category of statements,but not the former.as to the former,there was no relationship between the allegedly false statements and the subsequent release.id.at.the release did not report any concern that the defendant first and second quarter earnings were incorrect.id.to the contrary,it ma de no reference at all to the first and second fiscal quarters.id.thus,the first category of statements could not support a presumption of loss causation.the second category of purported misstatements pertained to third quarter earnings.because the release clearly concerned a significant revenue shortfall for the third fiscal quarter,the plaintiffs had shown the requisite link between the release and th ose earlier statements.id.at.
lormand us unwired,provides additional guidance.the defendant in lormand us unwired,uttered two general classes of misstatements.first,it touted becoming a type ii affiliate of sprint,when in fact it had been forced into that arrangement by type ii affiliation posed significant financial risks that were not disclosed.id.at.second,us unwired misled the public about the expectations it had for success after sprint forced the company to enter the subprime cellular service market.id.at.we discussed a series of disclosures through which some truth leaked out.generally,the disclosures made increasingly clear that there were substantial problems in the subprime market and that expected subscriber growth in that market was unlikely to materialize.id.at.upon detailed examination of these disclosures,we concluded that none related to us unwired conversion to type ii affiliation,and that us unwired thus failed to establish loss causation with respect to the misstatements pertaining to that conversion.id.at.on the other hand,the disclosures did relate to us unwired misstatements about the subprime market.id.at.for this reason,the plaintiffs could demonstrate that their losses were caused by those misstatements when the relevant truth leaked out.id.at.
here,the district court appears to have demanded more of alaska than is required by greenberg or lormand.for example,the district court held that the reductions in july per share and september per share of the earnings guidance did not reveal the relevant truth concerning the inaccuracy of the october earnings projection per share.it must have reasoned that the july and september statements need not have simply reduced flowserve guidance,but had directly to reveal that the october guidance was fraudulent.that is not required it was enough that the market learned that the october guidance was wrong and that other negative information unrelated to the reduced guidance did not cause the decline in flowserve share price.see in re williams sec.subclass,at loss causation is easiest to show when a corrective disclosure reveals the fraud to the public and the price subsequently,of course,that the plaintiff could isolate the effects from any other intervening causes that could have contributed to the decline.alaska offered expert testimony on the latter point,and the district court did not find that alaska had failed to segregate loss caused by the relevant truth leaking out from loss caused by unrelated factors.instead,the district court found that the july and september guidance did not relate to or,in dura terms,was not relevant to the october guidance or any other alleged misstatements.this conclusion was erroneous.
flowserve complains that our approach turns the exchange act into a scheme of investor insurance.dura,broudo,at.internal quotation marks omitted.it ignores the exchange act scienter requirement.flowserve was free to be wrong in its october earnings guidance and even for such error to cause investors loss when it was revealed in july and september long as flowserve did not commit fraud.only if flowserve october guidance or another alleged misstatement was fraudulent would any loss it caused alaska be actionable.the exchange act is not investor insurance,but neither is the possibility of recovery for fraud tantamount to insurance.
the market may never have learned the relevant truth of flowserve allegedly fraudulent statements concerning its past financials,acquisition synergies,and compliance from the july and september guidance.clearly,the market understood that there was some problem with flowserve business or its business environment when the company reduced earnings guidance and the market reacted by driving down flowserve share price.but loss caused solely by a general impression in the market that something is wrong is insufficient to establish causation.see in re williams sec.subclass,at the inability to point to a single corrective disclosure does not relieve the plaintiff of showing how the truth was revealed he can not say,well,the market must have known.were this not so,we could have concluded that the subprime market information in lormand related to the misstatements about type ii affiliation because that affiliation was the reason us unwired was enmeshed in the subprime cellular market in the first place.similarly,we could have concluded in greenberg that the disclosure of reduced earnings related to misstatements about first and earnings because the earlier shortfalls were surely some cause of the shortfall.if alaska can not prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the market learned more than that flowserve earnings guidance was lower and so its business seemed less valuable,it can not establish that its loss was caused by flowserve misstatements pertaining to past financials,acquisition synergies,or compliance.
finally,the district court concluded without analysis that of flowserve misstatements were confirmatory and therefore not actionable.we have held that i f the market price was not actually affected by the statement,reliance on the market price does not of itself become reliance on the statement.nathenson,at.we have also said that information a
