tallman,circuit judge 
we address an issue of first impression involving the securities and exchange commission ability to disgorge funds from relief defendants.victor messina and international market ventures imv,contest their liability as relief defendants in the sec enforcement action against phil ming xu and various entities for federal securities law violations arising out of a fraudulent investment scheme.the sec claims that messina and imv received million of the tens of millions of dollars xu unlawfully raised through investor deposits worldwide,but messina and imv assert that they received those funds as a loan.
the question presented is whether putative relief defendants may divest a district court of jurisdiction to proceed against them using summary procedures simply by asserting a claim of entitlement to the disputed funds in their possession.messina and imv argue that a facially colorable claim is sufficient to destroy relief defendant jurisdiction,and that to seek disgorgement from them,due process requires the sec either to join them as party defendants or bring a separate action against them.messina and imv also argue that the sec failed to show that the funds the district court ordered disgorged are proceeds of monies unlawfully collected from united states investors.
we conclude the district court properly exercised its jurisdiction to determine the legal and factual legitimacy of messina and imv claim to the million.the court acted correctly under our precedent approving the invocation of relief defendant procedures in sec enforcement actions and did not clearly err in finding,following a evidentiary hearing,that messina and imv had no legitimate claim to the funds.the evidence demonstrates that far more than million was raised by xu and his various entities in the united states,and the court correctly concluded that the funds sought were proceeds of illegal activity and subject to disgorgement.finally,the district court did not abuse its discretion in later ordering disgorgement from messina and imv as relief defendants.we have jurisdiction and affirm.
phil ming xu,together with his corporations including world capital market,and collectively,wcm,ran a marketing business ostensibly selling investors membership units providing access to cloud computing services.xu and wcm promised investors returns of up to percent over a period.wcm did not provide any actual products or services and had no significant legitimate business operations.instead,xu and wcm used money from new investors to pay existing investors and to buy real property and golf courses for xu and associated third parties.forensic accountants established that investor funds deposited into various xu and bank accounts between january and march totaled.xu was the mastermind who controlled the ponzi scheme he later stipulated to liability for securities law violations,and judgment in favor of the sec was ultimately entered against xu in the amount of.
relief defendant vincent messina began working with xu in june,providing legal advice regarding tax,corporate,and immigration matters.during this time,messina was also general counsel to relief defendant imv in washington,imv president,gary messina,is vincent messina nephew 
by the fall of,messina was well aware that xu and wcm were under investigation by the sec for securities law violations.xu instructed wcm chief operating officer to keep messina apprised of the commission investigation so that messina could help xu protect his assets.on december,wcm disbursed to messina,who deposited it into a lawyers trust account at wells fargo bank.although no contract reflects the purpose of this transfer,according to messina the funds represented fees for his services related to the formation of a political action committee pac requested by xu messina signed a consulting contract with imv on january,retaining gary messina and imv to assist with work related to the formation of the pac.the fees for imv services were listed as two hundred thousand dollars consisting of two payments one hundred thousand dollars upon the execution of this agreement and one hundred thousand dollars on june.no money was transferred to imv on the date of the execution of the agreement.
by february,xu outside securities law counsel,scott warren,was in settlement discussions with the sec on behalf of xu and wcm.messina,learning that warren had recommended settling with the sec for million,texted xu on february,advising him to drop scott because the proposed settlement sum was ridiculous.messina also wrote 
by the way the sec does not have the power to bring a criminal charge.that is the decision of the us attorney which is entirely separate from the sec.perhaps the new counsel can delay the negotiations so that your assets seem less.i have tried to look at your transactions from the standpoint of rearranging them,but have not been able to get the required information.
xu responded ok.
three weeks after this text exchange,xu transferred million from the bank account of topacific another xu entity funded by wcm investor deposits into messina bank of america trust account.xu was topacific sole director and the signatory on its bank account.xu asked messina to hold the funds for future business endeavors.messina responded that he would not simply hold the funds,and instead prepared and executed a document messina characterizes as a loan agreement the day after the transfer which,in its entirety,reads 
this agreement agreement is entered into on february,between vincent messina and ming xu.
for value received,vincent messina promises to pay to ming xu without recourse the sum of five million dollars with interest computed at five percent per annum,interest and principal due on january,at his place of business.
that transfer from xu to messina was recorded as an uncategorized expense in topacific books and a payee was not specified.messina testified before the district court that the loan was in furtherance of previously discussed proposals to set up a fund for future investments in africa,the no recourse language in the agreement meant that he could do whatever he wanted with the money in terms of investment ventures,and he had no personal legal obligation to repay xu,although he had a moral obligation to do so.
nine days after xu transferred the million to messina,xu sent a text message to him requesting the return of the money to help fund a settlement with the sec.messina refused,stating the money has already been wired out and is i n accordance with the note i signed.in actuality,as of march,when xu requested the recall of funds messina still held almost all of the million in a series of personal and client trust accounts and had transferred only to imv and to mohammed el fatih saeed,who was in charge of imv correspondent office in the united arab emirates.despite xu request,messina went on to use seven different bank accounts to distribute approximately million of the funds to various business partners and associates.relevant here are messina additional transfers of to imv on march,on march,and on march.
according to gary messina testimony,of the close to million imv received from messina during this time represented fees for imv services under the january pac consulting agreement and the remainder related to a potential business venture that would be undertaken as part of an agreement with cnc consulting.on april,acting on instructions from messina,gary messina wired of the funds to a bank account in canada maintained by andrew savor.gary messina testified that savor was the agent for cnc consulting in canada.
meanwhile,the sec initiated enforcement proceedings against xu and wcm in los angeles district court.on march,the commission filed its complaint against xu and wcm,and the court appointed a statutory receiver and issued a temporary restraining order freezing all of xu and wcm assets and accounts including topacific accounts.after discovering xu february transfer of million to messina,the receiver contacted messina on march and provided him with a copy of the temporary restraining order.subsequent negotiations between messina attorney at thompson hine llp,the receiver,and the sec resulted in messina transfer of the approximately million remaining from the funds he had received from xu to thompson hine client trust account to hold in escrow pending further order of the court.gary messina also wired of xu funds to thompson hine trust account.
the sec amended its complaint against xu and wcm on may,adding messina and imv as relief defendants.on may,the district court ordered messina and imv assets frozen and authorized expedited discovery.messina and imv filed a motion to dismiss on june,arguing they were not proper relief defendants because they had a legitimate claim to the million they received from xu.the district court denied the motion to dismiss on july,but ordered a rule b evidentiary hearing to resolve disputed issues of fact related to the legitimacy of messina and imv claims to the funds.on july,xu separately consented to the entry of judgment against him and disgorgement and a civil penalty in an amount to be determined by the court upon motion by the 
following expedited discovery,the district court held its rule b evidentiary hearing on september and,during which it heard testimony from six witnesses,including vincent and gary messina.one hundred exhibits offered by the sec and exhibits offered by the relief defendants were admitted into evidence.the district court made an adverse credibility finding against vincent messina,noting that his testimony seemed contrived and evasive and that his long,rambling,answers to simple,straightforward questions were designed to avoid directly answering questions that would be harmful to his position.ultimately,the court concluded after listening to the witness that it was left with the distinct impression that vincent messina was prepared to say whatever he deemed necessary in an attempt to hold on to the million.the court ruled that messina had no legitimate claim to the million because the loan agreement with xu was a sham and that imv likewise had no legitimate claim to of the it received from messina.the court also concluded,however,that the sec had failed to carry its burden to demonstrate messina and imv were not entitled,respectively,to and for their work related to xu requested pac.
on january,the sec filed a motion for an order of disgorgement against messina and imv.after full briefing,the district court granted the motion without further hearing on february,and ordered messina to disgorge million,with imv jointly liable for of that amount.final judgment against messina and imv was entered on february,and they timely appealed.we have jurisdiction under.
messina and imv primary contention on appeal is that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to determine the legitimacy of their claim to the million messina received from xu.they also argue the district court erred in its factual findings,improperly ordered disgorgement,and denied them due process.
we review a district court exercise of subject matter jurisdiction over relief defendants de novo.see sec colello,cir.we review the district court underlying factual findings on jurisdictional issues,however,for clear error.see united states ex rel.hartpence kinetic concepts,cir.en banc where the district court relied on findings of fact to draw its conclusions about jurisdiction,we review those factual findings for clear error.see also commodity futures trading comm kimberlynn creek ranch,cir.reviewing for clear error factual findings entered after a hearing to determine the legitimacy of a relief defendant claim to the disputed funds.
generally,a district court decision to award disgorgement is reviewed for abuse of discretion.colello,at.the court order of disgorgement in this case,however,resulted in part from its conclusion that the undisputed forensic evidence tracing the investor money demonstrated as a matter of law that the funds xu transferred to messina were ill gotten.we review that conclusion de novo because it involves the application of law to facts not disputed at the hearing id.
the sec is authorized by both the securities act of and the securities exchange act of to bring civil enforcement actions seeking equitable relief in the form of injunctions against those committing violations of the acts.see b,d.in such actions,federal courts may grant any equitable relief that may be appropriate or necessary for the benefit of investors,d,including disgorgement of the gains obtained from securities law violations.see,sec platforms wireless int l,cir.courts may also exercise their broad equitable powers to order disgorgement from third parties who have received proceeds of others violations to which the third parties have no legitimate claim.in such circumstances,these third parties are referred to as relief defendants or nominal defendants.colello,at.
in the context of an sec enforcement action,a relief defendant is a person who holds the subject matter of the litigation in a subordinate or possessory capacity as to which there is no dispute.id.quoting sec cherif,cir.accordingly,a relief defendant is not a real party in interest,and can be joined to aid the recovery of relief without the assertion of subject matter jurisdiction because he or she has no ownership interest in the property which is the subject of litigation,cherif,at.as we have previously recognized,the paradigmatic example of a nominal defendant is a bank or trustee that has only a custodial claim to the property,however the term is broad enough to encompass persons who are in possession of funds to which they have no rightful claim,such as money that has been fraudulently transferred by the defendant in the underlying securities enforcement action.sec ross,cir.quoting colello,at.
to assert jurisdiction over and ultimately obtain disgorgement from messina and imv as relief defendants,the sec was required to demonstrate that messina and imv received funds and do not have a legitimate claim to those funds.colello,at.we agree with the district court that the sec made both of the required showings in this case and we hold that asserting jurisdiction over messina and imv as relief defendants was proper.
messina and imv contend that once they advanced a facially colorable claim to the disputed funds as loan proceeds,the district court was immediately divested of jurisdiction to adjudicate the legitimacy of their claim and proceed any further against them as relief defendants.they insist they would have to be named as defendants either in the sec underlying civil enforcement action against xu and the entities or in a lawsuit,with all of the rights attending a civil action.we disagree.
messina and imv filed a rule b motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,challenging the factual predicate for the court jurisdiction namely,the legitimacy of their claim to the million received from xu.in adjudicating a motion to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b,if the existence of jurisdiction turns on disputed factual issues,the district court may resolve those factual disputes itself.leite crane,cir.we see no reason to treat a factual dispute any differently in the context of a relief defendant proceeding.we therefore conclude that the district court properly conducted a rule b evidentiary hearing to evaluate the legitimacy of messina and imv claims to the funds at issue.
in messina contrary view,the putative loan agreement gave him presumptive title to the money and the receiver therefore could not proceed against him as a relief defendant rather,the receiver could disgorge the million only by demonstrating that messina himself had violated the securities laws.see ross,at.but this position begs the question because it necessarily assumes the loan was not a sham the very issue the district court resolved in the rule b hearing in deciding whether to allow the proceedings against messina and imv as relief defendants to continue.see colello,at t he lack of a legitimate claim to the funds is the defining element of a nominal defendant.relief defendants can not defeat jurisdiction simply by asserting an ownership interest in the disputed funds rather,as the fourth circuit has explained,they must assert an interest both recognized in law and valid in fact.kimberlynn creek ranch,at rejecting relief defendant ownership claim as not factually valid.we join the fourth circuit in so holding.otherwise,any third party with a custodial claim to the proceeds of securities violations committed by others would be able to defeat relief defendant jurisdiction simply by stating a claim of ownership,however specious.id.
our holding in ross does not compel a different conclusion.in that case,it was undisputed that the purported relief defendant,a salesman for the company accused of violating securities laws,received funds in the form of commissions on his sales of unregistered securities that is,he received compensation in return for services rendered.at.we recognized that the salesman had presumptive title to the funds just as any other employee or vendor,and it was on that basis that we reversed the district court exercise of jurisdiction over him as a relief defendant.id.here,by contrast,the facts demonstrating presumptive title are disputed indeed,whether the million messina received represented the proceeds of a valid loan or was instead an attempt to make xu assets seem less was hotly contested.messina and imv reliance on commodity futures trading commission wecorp,supp.haw,is similarly misplaced.in wecorp,the district court found an attorney had a legitimate claim to funds received following the circulation of an email offering legal services because the undisputed evidence demonstrated the attorney had actually performed work in exchange for the payment.see id.at.no such undisputed evidence is present here.
nor are we persuaded by the cases messina and imv cite to support their argument that the purported existence of a loan agreement,without more,is sufficient to establish presumptive title and destroy relief defendant jurisdiction.those cases are inapposite because,just as in ross and wecorp,each rests on an undisputed underlying factual premise of legitimacy missing in this case.in sec founding partners capital management,for example,it was undisputed that the purported relief defendant received the loan proceeds pursuant to written loan agreements establishing a valid relationship executed eight years prior to the sec enforcement action.supp.similarly,in janvey adams,it was undisputed that the purported relief defendants received the funds pursuant to written certificate of deposit agreements well before the underlying sec enforcement action,cir.
here,the relevant facts were disputed the district court received extensive documentary evidence and heard considerable testimony regarding messina dealings with xu,wcm,and imv,including evidence about the creation of the disputed loan agreement,and ultimately determined that messina ownership claim was not factually valid,it was not a legitimate loan upon which to base a cognizable claim.to conclude that the district court lacks jurisdiction to engage in such factfinding after the mere invocation of a claim of entitlement to the funds would effectively eliminate the relief defendant procedure in sec enforcement actions in any case involving a disputed claim to funds alleged to be the proceeds of securities fraud.we decline to take such a step,and hold that the district court appropriately adjudicated the legal and factual validity of messina and imv claim to the million to determine whether it had jurisdiction over them as relief defendants.
having concluded that it was proper for the district court to adjudicate the legitimacy of messina and imv claim,we next hold that there was no clear error in the district court finding that the million transfer from xu to messina as a loan was a sham.over the course of a evidentiary hearing,the court assessed more than exhibits and heard testimony from six witnesses,including vincent messina and gary messina,whose credibility the court was in the unique position to evaluate.see valenzuela michel,cir.noting that where findings of fact turn on credibility determinations,the findings receive heightened deference in light of the fact finder unique opportunity to observe the demeanor of the witnesses internal quotation marks omitted.we will not disturb the district court factual findings absent a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.mcclure thompson,cir.our review of the record yields no such conviction.
in concluding the loan agreement was a ruse designed to keep million of xu money out of the reach of the sec,the district court relied not just on its rejection of messina incredible testimony,but also on impeaching evidence such as messina text message to xu advising him to delay the sec negotiations so that they could make his assets seem less xu transfer of the million less than three weeks later,before any discussion of a potential loan,along with a contemporaneous request for messina to hold the money the cursory agreement prepared by messina after the transfer,which lacked the normal provisions of a valid loan agreement topacific record of the transfer as an uncategorized expense without a listed payee the agreement promise to repay xu rather than topacific messina testimony that he had no personal legal obligation to repay the million and xu request to messina to return the million just nine days after the transfer.the court did not clearly err in evaluating this evidence and,accordingly,we affirm its finding that the loan transaction was a sham.
in its february,disgorgement order,the district court concluded that the million transferred from xu to messina and the messina subsequently transferred to imv were ill gotten as a matter of law.we affirm because the unrebutted forensic analysis traced the source of the transferred funds.there was no error in the court ultimate conclusion that the monies were the proceeds of unlawful activity or that imv should be held jointly liable for the of those funds it received.
the sec provided unrebutted declarations from the receiver and the sec accountant responsible for the commission forensic accounting investigation showing that the only significant source of funds in xu and wcm bank accounts,including the topac
