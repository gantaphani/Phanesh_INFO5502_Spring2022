this case involves a scheme to sell defective airplane engines.robert parker and two were accused of improperly overhauling small aircraft engines and falsely representing to customers that the engines met federal aviation administration requirements.after a jury trial,parker was convicted on five counts for his role in the scheme one count for conspiracy,three counts for aiding and abetting or making or using false writings in connection with aircraft parts,and one count for mail fraud.the district court sentenced parker to months in prison and ordered him to pay in restitution.
parker appeals his conviction with five objections attacking the sufficiency of the evidence,several evidentiary rulings,and the amount of restitution.after carefully reviewing the record and legal authorities,we affirm parker conviction and sentence.
background 
parker was a fan of aircraft and by the mid he started to deal with good aviation,an airplane mechanic shop which overhauls engines in washington,oklahoma.at good aviation two technicians,larry good and michael redpath,held airframe and powerplant a p certificates from the federal aviation administration,allowing them to work on domestic aircraft.larry good son,allen,also worked in the shop.allen good did not have a p certification,but he did work on overhauling airplane engines,ostensibly under the supervision of either his father or his cousin,michael redpath.as early as parker engaged good aviation to overhaul engines which he would sell to third parties,typically by advertising the engines in a trade journal,trade a plane.
the superceding indictment alleges a conspiracy between parker and relevant parties at good aviation for the years through.during that time good aviation overhauled approximately engines for parker.these engines were mostly lycoming io engines,which are typically installed in small,aircraft.
allen good did the bulk of the engine work for parker.each overhauled engine had a logbook describing the overhaul.because allen good did not have a p certification,either larry good or michael redpath would sign off on his work in the engine logbooks the seal of good approval for rebuilt engines.parker frequently visited good aviation to deliver parts for the engine overhauls,and to observe and direct work on the engines.
as part of the overhaul process,parker was solely responsible for engraving data plates for the engines.data plates affixed to engines must include information about the precise type and model of engine,especially if an engine is type certified.good aviation supplied the data plates and parker used a local trophy shop to engrave them.
at trial,the government presented evidence regarding ten engines purchased during the conspiracy the government also introduced evidence of a few engine sales preceding the conspiracy.several mechanics were called and testified in detail about the dysfunctional state of the engines.victims testified that parker told them the engines had been properly overhauled.but evidence at trial showed engines with cracks or rusted parts,missing or wrong parts,and other serious problems.two engines caused failures and placed the pilots at substantial risk.none of the engines were airworthy and many were never installed in aircraft.parker frequently sold the engines with an accompanying propeller.in every instance,the propellers were likewise found to be deficient because of cracks or other problems,rendering the propellers useless.
parker and his testified in their own defense.parker claimed that he relied on logbooks,had no knowledge the repairs were fraudulent,and blamed all the problems with the engines on good aviation.the jury returned a conviction for parker on all counts.
ii.discussion 
parker challenges his conviction and sentence on five grounds the district court wrongly admitted evidence of prior bad acts under federal rule of evidence b insufficient evidence improper hypothetical questions during of parker character witnesses the sentence imposed was procedurally and substantively unreasonable and the restitution amount failed to provide an offset for the engines.we address each argument in turn.
rule b evidence of sales predating the conspiracy 
parker first argues the district court erred in admitting evidence of prior bad acts under federal rule of evidence b when the government introduced evidence of engine sales not listed as overt acts in the indictment.we review the district court admission of evidence under rule b for abuse of discretion.united states shumway,cir.without objection at trial we review the admission only for plain error.united states hill,cir.
federal rule of evidence b provides 
evidence of other crimes,wrongs,or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.it may,however,be admissible for other purposes,such as proof of motive,opportunity,intent,preparation,plan,knowledge,identity,or absence of mistake or accident 
in weighing the admissibility of rule b evidence,we consider four factors whether the evidence is offered for a proper purpose,whether the evidence is relevant,whether the probative value of the evidence is substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect,and whether a limiting instruction is given if the defendant so requests.see huddleston united states,d united states zamora,cir.the standard for satisfying rule b admissibility is permissive i f the other act evidence is relevant and tends to prove a material fact other than the defendant criminal disposition,it is offered for a proper purpose under rule b and may be excluded only under rule.united states tan,cir.
parker challenges two sets of engine sales admitted under rule b one set of sales during the charged conspiracy time,but not included in the charged overt acts,and a second set of sales that occurred before the conspiracy.
sales during conspiracy 
parker seeks to have three engine sales,which were not listed in the overt acts section of the indictment,excluded under rule b.the indictment charged parker with conspiracy to make or use false statements in aircraft engine logbooks during the calendar years through.the charged conspiracy covered the sale of unsafe airplane engines with accompanying false documentation,listing six overt acts,among others,vol.at indictment,all in violation of a.parker challenges three engines sold during the conspiracy to kardell and brown,and the flemings,but not listed in the overt acts section.the government argues the transactions are intrinsic to the charged crimes and thus not subject to the rule b limitation.we agree.
rule b limits evidence of other crimes,wrongs,or acts not the crime in question.similarly,i t is well settled that rule b does not apply to other act evidence that is intrinsic to the crime charged.united states,cir see also united states arney,cir discussing rule b as not applying to intrinsic evidence.generally speaking,i ntrinsic evidence is directly connected to the factual circumstances of the crime and provides contextual or background information to the jury.extrinsic evidence,on the other hand,is extraneous and is not intimately connected or blended with the factual circumstances of the charged offense.thomas dibiagio,intrinsic and extrinsic evidence in federal criminal trials is the admission of collateral other crimes evidence disconnected to the fundamental right to a fair trial,syracuse.because rule b only limits evidence of other crimes those extrinsic to the charged crime evidence of acts or events that are part of the crime itself,or evidence essential to the context of the crime,does not fall under the other crimes limitations of rule b.
the three transactions within the charged conspiracy are intrinsic to the crime and substantiate the criminal conspiracy.they directly support the conspiracy charged,namely that parker made or used false statements in connection with airplane parts and logbooks associated with the sales to kardell,brown,and the flemings.these three sales provided direct proof of parker involvement with the crimes charged.the sales were not merely contextual,they supported elements of the charged crimes.rule b only applies to evidence of other crimes the transactions were part of the crimes charged,not some other crime.
accordingly,the district court did not err in admitting the transactions 
sales outside the conspiracy 
the government also introduced two engine sales outside the charged conspiracy,one to pryce jones in and one to peters in.pryce jones contacted parker in about an advertisement for an airplane engine in trade a plane,and she and her husband arranged to purchase the engine.parker claimed he had overhauled this engine for his own plane,but after deciding to upgrade the horsepower,he could sell the recently overhauled engine.when pryce jones inspected the engine in person,the exterior looked great and everything appeared to be very good,iv at.the certified engine came with a logbook indicating it was overhauled in accordance with the manufacturers instructions.the pryce joneses purchased the engine for.however,they later discovered multiple problems,including a cracked crankcase,substantial oil leaks,five cracked cylinders,and worn out connecting rods and bushings.not surprisingly,the engine was not safe for flight.
the engine purchased by peters involved similar circumstances.parker advertised the engine in trade a plane.parker explained the engine was recently overhauled and just lying around his shop.however,after purchase,an independent mechanic examined the engine and discovered major problems,such as incorrect bolts inside the engine.
upon reviewing this evidence,we conclude the district court did not commit plain error in admitting the evidence of parker engine sales before the charged conspiracy.both transactions satisfy the huddleston test.first,the government offered pryce jones testimony for a proper purpose under rule b to address parker intent and knowledge both of which parker disputed at trial.according to parker,he was merely an innocent seller of overhauled engines,and all the blame rests on the mechanical work performed by others.but the pryce jones engine sale shows that even when parker sold an engine overhauled by someone other than good aviation,the result was the same a deficient engine that appeared new on the outside,including a clean logbook,but was not airworthy.also,parker requested,and the court gave,a rule b cautionary instruction for pryce jones testimony.
second,the government offered the peters transaction for a proper purpose,and to show parker knowledge of the nature and quality of good aviation repair work.this testimony demonstrated parker knowledge of the goods inadequate repair work and his desire to profit from the sale of shoddy engines.in fact,when challenged with a complaint letter sent to trade a plane,parker responded with a highly pertinent letter,blaming good aviation for poor engine repairs.
in sum,parker fails to demonstrate how either engine sale outside the conspiracy lacked relevance or would have been unduly prejudicial.united states cuch,cir it is well settled that the rule is one of inclusion which admits evidence of other crimes relevant to an issue in a trial,unless the evidence is introduced for an impermissible purpose or undue prejudice is shown.
while we conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the evidence,any possible error would plainly be harmless.a harmless error is one that does not have a substantial influence on the outcome of the trial nor does it leave one in grave doubt as to whether it had such effect.united states resendiz patino,cir.parker does not persuade us the admitted evidence had a substantial influence,or was so influential that we should doubt the jury verdict.
the district court committed no error,but even if it did,the error would have been harmless.
sufficiency of the evidence 
parker next challenges the sufficiency of the evidence for his conviction on each of five counts.we review sufficiency of the evidence de novo.united states voss,cir.in so doing,we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government asking whether any rational trier of fact could have found the defendant guilty of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.united states wood,cir quoting jackson virginia,d.when conducting this review,we do not weigh conflicting evidence or consider witness credibility,as that duty is delegated exclusively to the jury.united states hien van tieu,cir.we also do not review the evidence in bits and pieces,but we evaluate the sufficiency of the evidence by consider ing the collective inferences to be drawn from the evidence as a whole.united states hooks,cir.we will only overturn a guilty verdict on sufficiency grounds if no reasonable juror could have reached such a verdict on the evidence presented.united states shepard,cir.
count conspiracy under a 
parker first argues the government failed to provide sufficient evidence that he engaged in a conspiracy to commit fraud involving aircraft parts.to obtain a conviction for conspiracy under a the government is required to prove an agreement with another person to violate the law knowledge of the essential objectives of the conspiracy knowing and voluntary involvement and interdependence among the alleged.see united states.edwards,cir discussing elements for conspiracy under.participation in a conspiracy can be proven by either explicit or implicit agreement by the defendant.see united states rahseparian,cir.
parker argues t here was insufficient evidence to prove that an agreement existed among the alleged.aplt.br.at.in support of this contention,parker selects favorable bits and pieces of testimony from his and his testimony to deny the existence of a conspiracy 
not every piece of evidence need support the jury verdict.when we look at the record as a whole,we find enough evidence to support parker conviction.the evidence shows parker worked independently of his as a central figure in the scheme,with full knowledge and intent to defraud the purchasers of the defective engines.the trial contained testimony of customers,who purchased engines from parker,and several mechanics,who later worked on the engines,for a total of government witnesses indicating the poor quality of the engines.
in each case,the engines sold by parker included a new logbook that falsely represented the overhaul work done to the engine.a few logbooks even stated that the engine was in a condition for safe operation,vol.iii,at.in reality the engines were so inadequate that not a single engine was safe for flight.three engines actually failed during flight,causing substantial risk to the pilots.the government first witness,kardell,testified about the dramatic failure of the engine on the very first that forced an emergency landing.
as one representative example of the defective engine quality,stricker,who is also an a p mechanic,described the numerous deficiencies he found in the engine he purchased from parker.he testified that the rocker box,valve springs and all four cylinders were covered with rust,vital engine bolts were,the crankcase was contaminated with media,the oil pump was defective,other parts were incorrect,one part was missing,cylinders were not honed correctly,the pistons were used,the crankshaft was worn below the maximum allowable specifications and cracked,valves and valve keepers were worn,and the bearings were used.see,vol.iii at.deficiencies of similar magnitude were found in trial testimony about each of the engines.as another clear example,some engines were overhauled with internal parts stamped not airworthy.id.at.
parker played a central role in marketing and advertising these defective engines.parker placed the advertisements in trade a plane,a publication targeted at small airplane enthusiasts,and he gave a similar deceptive to the purchasers.
the engines were overhauled in a way that supports a plan to sell grossly deficient engines as if they were in proper working order.the engines had the external appearance of being properly overhauled.only when the engine was torn down did the defective nature of the work become apparent.the jury could conclude that parker,as the salesman of these engines,had full knowledge of their defective state and acted with an intent to defraud the customers.testimony at trial demonstrated an overwhelming pattern of grossly deficient engines,all sold with pretense of being newly overhauled and in airworthy condition.
to counter this,parker defense claimed he was unaware of the deficiencies and was just a mere seller of the engines,who had no intention to profit from selling the dangerously defective engines.parker also claimed to have stopped selling the deficient engines once he became aware that good aviation was producing less than satisfactory overhauls.substantial evidence at trial contradicted both lines of defense.
first of all,the evidence supported a finding that parker was more than a mere salesman and played an active role in a conspiracy.three witnesses testified parker was present at good aviation on multiple occasions and instructed or supervised allen good in the overhaul of engines.one witness testified parker was at good aviation more than a dozen times,provided numerous engine parts to the mechanics,was very knowledgeable about the particular types of airplane engines he sold,and observed the engine overhaul process at every stage.one witness testified parker brought defective parts to allen good for use in an engine overhaul.multiple witnesses supported the claim that parker was essentially allen good only customer during the of the conspiracy.the overall weight of the evidence was not consistent with parker claim to be an unknowing salesman.
the evidence also supports the jury conclusion that parker did not stop selling the engines once he learned about allen good inadequate work.a letter parker sent to the faa on july,shows his active role in the scheme.the letter expressly recognized the inadequate nature of the engine overhauling work performed by good aviation.yet parker continued to sell engines after admitting in the letter that he knew the repairs were inadequate,directly contradicting his testimony that he had stopped selling defective engines.
in addition,throughout the conspiracy parker personally requested logbooks from allen good,and those logbooks contained material false statements relating to the deficiently overhauled engines.this evidence also demonstrates parker knowledge and involvement in the conspiracy.in each case the logbook entries falsely stated repair work was done to the overhauled engines.the logbooks contained numerous,materially false statements.parker alone was responsible for having data plates engraved at a trophy shop and then installed on the engines before sale.
finally,the jury heard testimony from several customers who contacted parker about their deficient engines and parker refusal to correct any of the problems.this evidence points to parker deep involvement in the plan to sell deficient engines,and his desire to profit from the sale by ignoring or refusing to correct the defects after the engines were sold.
in sum based on the entire record,a jury could reasonably conclude that parker was involved in a conspiracy to commit fraud in connection with airplane parts in violation of a.
counts,and false statements involving aircraft parts 
parker argues the government failed to provide sufficient evidence that he aided or abetted,or made or used false statements involving aircraft parts.he was charged under a c,which prohibits making or using a false writing concerning any aircraft part,and with aiding and abetting violations of the same statute under.the three counts involved three specific engines sold by parker during the conspiracy count for the wedman engine count for the shoop engine and count for the royall engine.see,vol.at psr.
to obtain a conviction for violating a c,the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that parker made or used a false writing he knew the false writing contained a false statement or entry at the time he made or used it the false writing was material he made or used the false writing with the intent to defraud and the false writing concerned aircraft parts in or affecting interstate commerce.see a tenth cir.pattern.crim.jury ins.instruction for a.according to the statute,a false writing can include any entry,certification,document,record,data plate,label,or electronic communication.a.
the relevant evidence supporting parker conviction on these three counts has been discussed in detail above regarding the conspiracy count.the same evidence supports the jury conclusion that parker knowingly,with an intent to defraud,either made or used false writing in connection with airplane parts namely the logbooks parker provided to purchasers attesting to the workmanship of the overhauled engines.
in short,a reasonable jury could conclude parker violated a c.
count mail fraud 
finally,parker argues the government failed to provide sufficient evidence that he committed mail fraud.
to obtain a conviction for mail fraud under,the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that parker engaged in a scheme or artifice to defraud customers or obtain money by means of false and fraudulent pretenses,representations or promises parker intended to defraud customers,and parker used the united states mails or a commercial interstate carrier to facilitate that scheme.see united states rahseparian,cir.
the evidence supports parker conviction for committing mail fraud.at parker request,royall sent a check to parker for a down payment through the united states mail.parker contention that the mailing was not necessary to carry out the scheme misses the mark.the use of the mail need not be an essential element of the scheme,rather the use of the mail may be incident to an essential part of the scheme or a step in the plot.schmuck united states,d internal citations omitted.the evidence of royall mailing a check to parker a step in the plot to defraud his customers supports parker conviction for committing mail fraud.
character witness 
parker next challenges the district court decision to allow the government to ask certain hypothetical questions to three character witnesses.
we review the district court decision to allow questions of character witnesses for abuse of discretion.see world wide ass of specialty programs pure,cir.we review how character evidence depend s on numerous and subtle considerations difficult to detect or appraise from a cold record,and therefore rarely and only on clear showing of prejudicial abuse of discretion will we disturb rulings of trial courts on this subject.michelson united states.see also sec peters,cir finding exclusion of question to character witnesses to be an abuse of discretion.
under rule,a defendant is entitled in limited circumstances to call witnesses to attest to the defendant good character and the prosecution may conduct limited.our cases allow the prosecution in a criminal case to ask questions of the have you heard variety when a character witness testifies about personal opinion of the defendant character,as opposed to offering testimony limited to the defendant general reputation in the community.united states polsinelli,cir.the prosecution may ask a personal opinion witness whether he or she has heard the defendant had been sued for fraud and whether that information would have affected your opinion of good character.see peters,at cir see generally mccormick on evidence,ed.
parker called four witnesses to vouch for his character as a matter of personal opinion,and now challenges the prosecution of three of the witnesses.we analyze each witness separately.
first,buddy testified to parker community reputation and gave a personal opinion,stating,i think very highly of parker,because he been a true friend to me,and i have seen nothing that would degrade from his position,and he has been honorable and upright and truthful in every dealing i ever had with him,vol.v.on the government asked buddy if it would change your opinion of parker if you found out he had been selling aircraft engines through trade a plane that were unairworthy,vol.at.the government also asked if it became apparent to parker through complaints from those purchasers that the engines were bad,would it change your opinion of him if you learned that he did not then go ahead and contact the other purchasers of the engines to warn them that they might have a defective engine id.neither question assumed parker guilt.
parker objected to the government of buddy.after extensive argument,the district court concluded that buddy expressed a personal opinion of parker character,which did not prohibit the government about hypothetical instances of prior conduct.the rules of evidence did not prohibit the as long as the questions did not assume parker was convicted of the crimes alleged in this case,vol.vi at.
second,way testified favorably about parker reputation.without objection,the government asked limited questions about way knowledge of parker reputation outside the local community.none of the questions suggest prior bad acts,and we see no reason to find the improper or prejudicial.
third,hudson testified about parker character saying,i do have an opinion.i admire him greatly,and h e a great craftsman,at.without objection,the government hudson about his knowledge of good,as well as asking details about the people hudson knew concerning parker reputation.none of these questions dealt with prior bad acts or assumed parker guilt.
in sum,the district court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the limited questioning by the government on of parker character witnesses.moreover,given the extensive evidence of guilt,even if the was error,it would be harmless.
parker sentence 
parker challenges both the procedural and substantive reasonableness of his sentence.procedurally,parker challenges the upward adjustment for a leadership role and the district court explanation of the a factors.substantively,he challenges the length of the sentence.
we review sentences for reasonableness by giving deference to the district court under the familiar standard.gall united states,d see united states smart,cir noting that it is now well settled that we review a district court sentencing decisions solely for abuse of discretion.we address the procedural and substantive reasonableness in turn.
procedural reasonableness 
parker makes two arguments of procedural error.first,he challenges the district court calculation of the sentencing guidelines range and,second,he contends the district court inadequately explained its decision not to depart downward.see gall.at noting as examples of significant procedural error a district court failing to calculate or improperly calculating the guidelines range and failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence see also united states romero,cir treating defendant allegation that the district court failed to explain its reasons for rejecting a sentence as a claim of procedural unreasonableness.
application of c 
the district court applied united states sentencing guidelines ussg c,finding that parker played a leadership role.we review the district court legal interpretation of the guidelines de novo and its factual findings for clear error.see united states dalton,cir.the district court heard evidence indicating parker was the leader and organizer of the conspiracy,and thus subject to the upward adjustment for his leadership role.
the guidelines call for the leadership enhancement i f the defendant was an organizer,leader,manager,or supervisor.ussg c.the guidelines commentary to suggests factors the sentencing court should consider when evaluating whether a defendant is an organizer or leader.these factors include 
the exercise of decision making authority,the nature of participation in the commission of the offense,the recruitment of accomplices,the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime,the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense,the nature and scope of the illegal activity,and the degree of control and authority exercised over others.
ussg cmt.see also united states suitor,cir applying the commentary factors to find leadership or organizer adjustment.to qualify for the adjustment,the defendant need only have been the organizer,leader,manager,or supervisor of one or more other participants or have exercised management responsibility over the property,assets,or activities of a criminal organization.id.cmt.more than one person involved in a conspiracy can qualify for the enhancement.ussg cmt.
the district court had the benefit of a jury trial,and a number of facts support the court finding.first,parker does not dispute that he alone placed advertisements in trade a plane to sell the engines in the conspiracy.further,parker alone explained to each victim why the engines were available for resale as well as representing,falsely,the basic quality of the engines.parker alone engraved the data plates for the engines,which were a necessary and important element of the scheme.finally,parker frequently visited good aviation to check on the status of the engines and to direct the engine overhaul work.
taken together,these facts are more than sufficient to qualify parker as a leader or organizer for the upward adjustment.
failure to explain a factors at sentencing 
parker makes a procedural challenge by claiming the district court failed to consider,or explain its consideration of,the a sentencing factors.see smart,at quoting gall.at.where,as here,a district court imposes a sentence within the range suggested by the guidelines,c requires the court to provide only a general statement of the reasons for its imposition of the particular sentence.c.we do not require the district court to recite any magic words to show us that it fulfilled its responsibility to consider the a factors.united states sanchez juarez,cir internal quotations and citations omitted.
the district court judge entertained parker sentencing arguments at length and indicated on the record the a factors explaining the reliance on the sentencing range suggested by the guidelines 
i conclude that the section factors carefully considered and taken together do lead to a result entirely in harmony with the application of the guidelines alone and that there is nothing in the section factors which leads me to a conclusion that a sentence below the bottom of the guidelines range is warranted.
vol.ix at.in the absence of any request for a downward departure,when a sentence is within the guidelines range,nothing more is required.
substantive reasonableness 
parker also challenges the substantive reasonableness of his sentence.we review the district court sentence for reasonableness in light of the a sentencing factors.see united states hamilton,cir in evaluating the substantive reasonableness of a sentence,we ask whether the length of the sentence is reasonable considering the statutory factors delineated in a.sentences imposed within a properly calculated guidelines range are accorded a presumption of substantive reasonableness.united states hernandez,cir see gall.at if the sentence is within the guidelines range,the appellate court may,but is not required to,apply a presumption of reasonableness.rita united states,d.the presumption of reasonableness is a deferential standard that either the defendant or the government may rebut by demonstrating that the sentence is unreasonable when viewed against the other factors delineated in a.united states kristl,cir.
parker makes a perfunctory challenge that his sentence is not reasonable,considering the factors set out in a.aplt.br.at.we conclude parker fails to overcome the presumption of reasonableness.the record supports the district court sentencing determination as substantively reasonable in light of the charged crimes and the evidence presented at trial.
restitution 
finally,parker challenges the district court restitution order.we review the legality of a restitution order de novo,the district court factual findings for clear error,and the amount of restitution for abuse of discretion.see united states serawop,cir.
the district court ordered parker to pay in restitution pursuant to the mandatory victims restitution act,mvra.under the mvra,the sentencing court must order a defendant convicted of a felony through fraud or deceit to pay restitution to the victims of the defendant illegal conduct.see a,c a ii.the district court resolves disputes over the proper amount of restitu
