background 
factual.the zimple street property 
in,barbara dowl dowl and her nathaniel dowl,purchased a home and property located at zimple street in new orleans,louisiana the zimple property or property.the dowls failed to keep up with their property taxes,and the zimple property was adjudicated to the city of new orleans in 
in,the city of new orleans sold the zimple property to robinson ventures,llc,a small company owned by michelle and braden robinson the dowls sought to annul this sale,and the robinsons sought to evict the dowls from the property.the state trial court granted the eviction,and the dowls filed a writ for review by the louisiana supreme court.this writ and the dowls petition to annul the sale of the zimple property were pending when hurricane katrina struck in august,severely damaging the home on the property.in january,the louisiana supreme court declined to hear the dowls writ for review and subsequently denied their motion for reconsideration in march.then,in january,the state trial court granted the city exception of no cause of action,effectively terminating the dowls challenges to the sale of the zimple property.
dowl loan applications 
i.the small business administration loan 
in october,dowl applied to the united states small business administration the sba for a disaster assistance loan to rebuild a home on the zimple property.as part of her application,dowl claimed to own the zimple property,and in support of this claim,she provided the act of sale documents.the sba,on the basis of dowl application and her supporting documents,approved a loan to be disbursed in installments.
following the initial disbursement,the sba requested additional information in order to verify that nathaniel no longer had an interest in the property.in response,dowl filed a false quitclaim deed,stating that the city of new orleans had sold the zimple property to her for the payment of back taxes.additionally,she supplied a conveyance certificate,which indicated that she had not sold the property since,and a document from the city tax assessor office showing that all taxes on the property were current.the government showed at trial that the city knew nothing of the quitclaim deed the conveyance certificate did not indicate any other transactions because it was pulled from the transaction system using a different name for the property and the property taxes had been paid by the robinsons,not dowl.in total,the sba disbursed to dowl.dowl did not use these funds to rebuild a home at the zimple property,though she made regular monthly payments on the loan.
ii.the louisiana road home program grant 
in november,dowl also applied for a grant from the louisiana road home program road home dowl submitted an application claiming that she was the owner of the zimple property and that the home on the property was her primary residence when hurricane katrina struck.in support of these claims,dowl provided the act of sale and the false quitclaim deed she had presented to the sba.dowl also listed the sba loan on her road home application.on the basis of dowl application and supporting documents,road home approved dowl for a grant to rebuild her home at the zimple property.however,following a determination that dowl had previously received sba funds for rebuilding her house,the road home program wired to the sba,reducing the amount outstanding on dowl sba loan.dowl acknowledged the transmission of funds to the sba and received an road home grant check to rebuild a home at the zimple property she did not use these funds for that purpose.
indictment,trial,and sentencing 
in june,a federal grand jury returned an indictment charging dowl with one count of wire fraud,in violation of and one count of theft of government funds,in violation of and in early,the grand jury returned superseding indictments,which further charged dowl with two counts of making false statements to the government in violation of and another count of theft of government funds.
before trial,dowl moved to dismiss the wire fraud count,arguing,inter alia,that the wire transmission alleged by the transfer of funds from road home to the insufficient to sustain the charge.the district court denied this motion,finding that the wire transmission charged was sufficient because the completion of dowl scheme depended in part on the wire transfer,and thus the transfer was incident to an essential part of the scheme.
during trial,the government presented evidence showing that dowl falsely claimed to own the zimple property made false applications to other entities for assistance following hurricane katrina filed false deeds and real estate documents concerning the zimple property and used the court system to file frivolous litigation challenging the ownership of the zimple property,including a suit that alleged corruption against the robinsons.the government also detailed the specifics of dowl fraudulent applications to the sba and road home and showed that dowl had used assistance funds for expenditures.
following the close of the government case,dowl moved under federal rule of criminal procedure for acquittal on the theft of the government funds from the sba charge.she argued that the government had not shown any intent to deprive the government of funds because she intended to pay back the loan and that thus the government had not shown theft in violation of.the district court denied this motion,finding that there was enough evidence to submit the case to the jury.dowl then presented witness testimony purporting to show that she had rights in the zimple property.dowl failed to renew her rule motion at the close of all evidence.
the case was submitted to the jury,which found dowl guilty on all charged counts and also determined that should be forfeited to the government as restitution.following the verdict,a united states sentencing guidelines guidelines range of months imprisonment was calculated.during sentencing,dowl argued that the guidelines intended loss calculation of did not properly credit her for the repayment of her sba loan by road home.the district court overruled this objection,concluding that the loan applications established the intended loss and that no credit should be given for the government detection of the overlapping funds.
the government moved for an upward departure from the guidelines range because it did not accurately reflect the impact on the robinsons as victims.the district court agreed,finding that dowl frauds and use of the court and property filing systems had imposed hardships on the robinsons.the court upwardly departed by months and sentenced dowl to months imprisonment.dowl timely appealed.
ii.discussion 
conviction 
on appeal,dowl raises two challenges to her conviction whether the wire of funds from road home to the sba was sufficient to bring dowl fraudulent scheme within the scope of the wire fraud statute and whether there was sufficient mens rea evidence produced by the government to sustain dowl conviction on the theft of sba funds.we address each in turn.
wire transfer 
to prove wire fraud under,the government must prove a scheme to defraud and the use of,or causing the use of,wire communications in furtherance of the scheme.united states stalnaker,cir quoting united states ingles,cir.here,the government charged that the relevant wire was the transmission of from road home in louisiana to the sba account in new york,following the discovery of the overlapping funds.dowl contends that this wire was not for the purpose of executing the alleged scheme to defraud and thus can not support her wire fraud conviction.we disagree.
we review a conviction de novo and ask whether a reasonable jury could conclude that the relevant evidence,direct or circumstantial,established all of the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt when viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict.id.quoting united states loe,cir.the use of wire communications need not be an essential element of a scheme to defraud but may instead be incident to an essential part of the scheme,or a step in the plot.schmuck united states,d citations,alterations,and quotation marks omitted discussing the mail fraud statute requirements accord united states mills,cir per curiam interstate wire communications a re used to further the fraudulent scheme,and federal jurisdiction attaches,if the use of the wires by the banks i s incident to an essential part of the scheme.to show that a wire is incident to an essential part of the scheme,the government must demonstrate that completion of the alleged scheme depended in some way on the information that passed through the wire.ingles,at quotation marks and alterations omitted discussing the mail fraud statute.
the alleged wire supports the wire fraud count,and the evidence presented at trial supports dowl wire fraud conviction.dowl knew that she might have to use some of her road home money to pay down her sba loan.she agreed to this condition through signing her applications,explicitly agreeing to any necessary transfer.mills,at defendant was not indifferent as to when the scheme was discovered because the continuation of the scheme depended upon the successful deception of all parties.because road home discovered that the sba loan funds overlapped with its grant,the transfer from road home to the sba was necessary to obtain the balance of the road home funds.dowl accepted this transfer,acknowledging that would be remitted to the sba to pay down her loan,and received the balance of the road home funds.this transfer of funds was accomplished via an interstate wire transfer.
dowl scheme was not complete until she approved the transfer of funds and road home distributed the funds to dowl and sba.see united states arledge,cir a scheme to defraud is complete when the persons intended to receive the money had received it.alterations and quotation marks omitted quoting united states maze,d mills,at s uccess of the fraudulent venture depended upon continued harmonious relations among various entities.as such,the wire transfer from road home to the sba was,at the least,an incidental part of dowl scheme to defraud.see arledge,at finding that documents that had to be sent prior to release of funds were sent pursuant to the scheme to defraud mills,at finding that the wire communications to sustain a fraudulent scheme were at the heart of the scheme to defraud.the wire transfer was sufficient to support dowl wire fraud conviction.
mens rea evidence 
dowl next challenges her conviction for theft of sba funds,arguing that she lacked the requisite mens rea for conviction.dowl moved for a judgment of acquittal at the beginning of trial,but she failed to renew this motion at the close of evidence.therefore,we review for a manifest miscarriage of justice and will reverse only if the record is devoid of evidence pointing to guilt or contains evidence on a key element of the offense that is so tenuous that a conviction would be shocking.united states burton,cir alteration and quotation marks omitted.
dowl specifically argues that the government alleged a form of theft,larceny by trick,that required an intent to permanently deprive the government of its funds.dowl contends that the government did not prove that she intended to permanently deprive the government because she intended to repay the loans,and thus the government failed to prove theft of its property under.we are unpersuaded.
in morissette united states,the supreme court outlined the breadth of,noting that it was enacted to collect from scattered sources crimes so kindred as to belong in one category.the court further recognized that t he history of demonstrates that it was to apply to acts which constituted larceny or embezzlement at common law and also acts which shade into those crimes but which,most strictly considered,might not be found to fit their fixed definitions.id.at.emphasis added.
following on this broad construction,we have determined that the requisite intent under is the intent to deprive the owner of the use or benefit of the property.united states dien duc huynh,cir see also united states jones,cir per curiam the jury instructions defined the term steal as the wrongful taking of money or property belonging to another with the intent to deprive the owner of its use or benefit either temporarily or permanently.the intent required in is the intent to appropriate the government property to a use inconsistent with the owner rights and benefits.quotation marks and alterations omitted.
and in united states aguilar,we favorably quoted a district court inclusion of temporary takings within the ambit of stealing under the district court defined the term steal as the wrongful taking of money or property belonging to another with intent to deprive the owner of its use or benefit either temporarily or permanently,cir.further,in united states sparkman,an unpublished opinion which,though,is nonetheless persuasive,we rejected the defendant argument that the evidence failed to show that he intended to deprive the government of the funds permanently because the government was not required to prove a permanent deprivation a temporary taking also violates the statute,cir per curiam citing the fifth circuit pattern jury instructions criminal cases the pattern jury instructions.our sister circuits are in accord with this construction of required intent.see united states rehak,cir in morissette,the supreme court recognized that section intended to fill the gaps or crevices on the law on offenses.the statute reaches all instances where one may obtain wrongful advantages from another property and prohibits both permanent and temporary takings.citations and quotation marks omitted united states howard,cir there are three elements to the crime of conversion under section that the money or property belonged to the government that the defendant fraudulently appropriated the money or property to his own use or the use of others and that the defendant did so knowingly and willfully with the intent either temporarily or permanently to deprive the owner of the use of the money or property.emphasis added quoting united states mcree,cir mcree,at allowing for intent to deprive either temporarily or permanently citing united states lanier,cir lanier,at defendants intention to repay the million,even actual repayment,is not a defense to a charge of embezzlement under section,so long as the money was the property of the united states when it was taken.
we think the district court use of the pattern jury instructions here was correct it was not error to define steal,for the purposes of,to mean the wrongful taking of money or property belonging to another with intent to deprive the owner here,the government of its use or benefit either temporarily or permanently.pattern jury instructions.further,we conclude that the government submitted ample evidence at trial to support the jury determination that dowl intended such a deprivation and did steal government property.dowl submitted fraudulent applications to obtain the government funds and proceeded to use the funds inconsistently with their intended use this scheme deprived the government of the funds economic value for aiding homeowners rebuilding efforts after hurricane katrina.united states barnes,cir finding sufficient taking of government funds where government loan funds were obtained as a result of misrepresentations by several borrowers who were not qualified for these loans and who utilized the funds for purposes other than those for which they were intended.we find no less a manifest miscarriage of justice in dowl conviction for violating.
regarding her sentence,dowl challenges only the district court intended loss calculation.dowl argues that if we uphold her conviction on the wire fraud,in her words,that road home return of the funds was
