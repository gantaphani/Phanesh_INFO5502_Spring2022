appellants bradley frost and wakon iron redcorn,were the president and the chief financial officer of heritage national insurance company hnic,an oklahoma health insurer.using their positions,they managed between them to bleed the company of some million.on january,they were indicted in federal district court on charges of embezzlement from a health care benefit program,wire fraud,and money laundering.a jury found them guilty,and each was sentenced to concurrent terms of months imprisonment on every count.in this direct appeal,we affirm in part,reverse the wire fraud convictions,and remand for resentencing.
background 
hnic sold life,accident,and group health insurance.first licensed to sell insurance in oklahoma in by the late hnic fortunes had fallen and it was forced into receivership by the oklahoma insurance department oid.frost and another investor acquired the company,and they,along with redcorn,rehabilitated it out of receivership and into the black.as of,hnic was owned by a holding company of which frost owned half a different investor,steven silverstein,along with his wife,owned the other half and redcorn had an option to acquire part of their interests.frost served as hnic president,and redcorn as the and cfo silverstein was hnic chairman and the ceo of the holding company.by,hnic revenues had climbed to over twelve million dollars a year.in that year hnic also purchased the business book of a failing texas insurer,giving it interstate reach.
from early,however,frost and redcorn started removing money bit by bit from hnic.they began by investing hnic moneys in other companies they controlled.they would also write checks to themselves on hnic accounts and designate the payments on the books as loans or consulting fees.although they would pay back most of the alleged loans and investments,the evidence showed that they retained over for themselves.then in august of that year frost opened a new bank account in hnic name at bank of america.the account sat,unused,until march,when redcorn instructed kendra blevins,an employee in hnic financial department,to start diverting incoming premium payments away from the company ordinary accounts and into the separate account.he told her that he and frost were planning to save up a war chest of one million dollars to sue their partner silverstein,whom they suspected of stealing from the company.well over a million dollars was funneled into the account over a period of only weeks.then,in mid and,redcorn and frost withdrew apiece in checks payable to themselves,recording the payments on hnic books as investments.they deposited the funds briefly in their private bank accounts,then shifted them to personal investment accounts with a broker in florida.they never sued silverstein and never returned the money to hnic.
around this time,federal authorities and state regulators were starting to take an interest in hnic finances.the fbi interviewed redcorn in january as part of an investigation of silverstein,who was,apparently,independently engaged in a bank fraud scheme involving check kiting with hnic moneys the focus turned to redcorn and frost,however,after the oklahoma insurance department began its investigation.at the beginning of may,the oid sent a financial examiner,hallie burnett,to hnic to conduct a review of its records.in late summer,the oid ordered hnic to be placed under supervision,and appointed burnett as conservator with authority to prevent the removal of any more money from the company.on november,a court ordered hnic into receivership.all its assets were auctioned off,and the insurance guaranty associations of oklahoma and texas had to shoulder thousands of outstanding obligations to persons hnic had insured million dollars worth.
on january,frost and redcorn were indicted on one count of health care fraud in violation of for taking money from a health insurance company,four counts of wire fraud in violation of for transferring the money using interstate wires,and a total of counts of money laundering in violation of a for a variety of financial transactions using the stolen money.at their trial in december,the defendants claimed that the investments they had made for themselves with company money were authorized by the minutes of a board meeting of hnic predecessor,and that the funds they had taken in april were a legitimate buyout or severance because they were planning to leave the company.they also attacked the oid special investigator hallie burnett as incompetent,possibly corrupt,and the dupe or cat paw of steve silverstein.
but the jury returned a verdict of guilty on all counts on december.redcorn and frost now appeal,and raise four chief areas of argument that the indictment was legally insufficient,that the evidence adduced at trial was insufficient to establish their guilt,that they were entitled to a new trial because of evidence they received afterward,and that their sentences violated the constitution.we reject all these arguments except as to the sufficiency of the evidence to establish the elements of wire fraud.
ii.sufficiency of the indictment 
an indictment is sufficient if it sets forth the elements of the offense charged,puts the defendant on fair notice of the charges against which he must defend,and enables the defendant to assert a double jeopardy defense.united states chisum,cir quoting united states dashney,cir.i t is generally sufficient that an indictment set forth an offense in the words of the statute itself,as long as those words themselves fully,directly,and expressly,without any uncertainty or ambiguity,set forth all the elements necessary to constitute the offence intended to be punished.united states hathaway,cir quoting hamling united states,d.therefore,where the indictment quotes the language of a statute and includes the date,place,and nature of illegal activity,it need not go further and allege in detail the factual proof that will be relied upon to support the charges.united states dunn,cir quoting united states crippen,cir.we review the sufficiency of an indictment de novo,united states todd,cir,but a challenge to the indictment is not a vehicle for testing the government evidence.rather,a n indictment should be tested solely on the basis of the allegations made on its face,and such allegations are to be taken as true.id.quoting united states hall,cir.
count health care fraud 
count of the indictment charged appellants with violation of,which outlaws embezzlement of any of the moneys or other assets of a health care benefit program.health care benefit program is defined in another section 
t he term health care benefit program means any public or private plan or contract,affecting commerce,under which any medical benefit,item,or service is provided to any individual,and includes any individual or entity who is providing a medical benefit,item,or service for which payment may be made under the plan or contract.
b.appellants contend that a health insurance company can not be a health care benefit program as so defined,and thus that because the indictment alleged that hnic was both a health insurance company and a health care benefit program it did not properly state a violation of.they assert also that federal prosecution of crimes under is precluded by the act,b,which leaves insurance regulation generally in the hands of the states.
inconsistency of allegations 
count of the indictment alleges,in its entirety 
from on or about april,and continuing through june,in the northern district of oklahoma and elsewhere,redcorn and frost,defendants herein,aiding and abetting each other,did knowingly and willfully embezzle,steal or otherwise convert to the use of a person other than the rightful owner and did intentionally misapply,approximately of the monies,funds,premiums,credits,and other assets of hnic,a health care benefit program as defined in title,united states code,section sic.
all in violation of title,united states code,sections a and.
vol.i,doc,at emphasis added.this sets forth the charged offense in the words of the statute itself,and contains the date,place,and nature of the charged illegal activity.it is thus entirely sufficient to give the defendants fair notice and enable them to determine whether to raise a double jeopardy defense.that is all that our precedents require.
the defendants point out,however,that the introduction to the indictment describes hnic as an insurance company doing business in oklahoma.id.at.they contend that it is not possible for a private insurance company to be a health care benefit program as that term is defined in the act,because a company is not a plan or contract.we are not necessarily persuaded.a private insurance company,which makes payments to providers for the cost of medical services,appears to be the private equivalent of medicare or medicaid.these are unquestionably health care programs under b.see united states morgan,cir united states mcgovern,cir collecting cases.but there are no precedents squarely on point,and this seems to be an open question.we need not answer it here.whether hnic actually was an insurance company is a matter of the evidence,not the indictment,and if it was not,then the issue is moot.
appellants attempt to characterize the problem as one of internal inconsistency within the indictment gets them no farther.to succeed on such an argument they would have to demonstrate not only that insurance companies are not necessarily health care benefit programs,but that it is impossible for an insurance company also to be a health care benefit program.in light of the existence of hybrid arrangements like health maintenance organizations,which are both insurers and health care providers,we do not think this is impossible.we are not saying that hnic was a health maintenance organization,only that there is no logical inconsistency within the indictment.
moreover,even if there were an inconsistency between the indictment prefatory averment that hnic was an insurance company and the averment in count that it was a health care benefit program,this would not render count insufficient.each count in an indictment is regarded as if it was a separate indictment.united states powell,d quoting dunn united states.there is no need to look beyond the borders of a particular count to determine what offense is charged indeed,it is generally improper to do so except where a count incorporates other allegations expressly,as permitted by federal rule of criminal procedure c.see united states caldwell,cir united states stoner,cir.an indictment need not contain introductory or prefatory matter at all,see.c,so if it does such matter is perforce superfluous unless expressly incorporated into one of the counts.a part of the indictment unnecessary to and independent of the allegations of the offense to be proved may normally be treated as a useless averment that may be ignored.united states nickl,cir quoting united states miller,d see also,ford united states.a useless averment is innocuous and may be ignored.
we have here a situation not unlike that presented in united states hajecate,cir,in which the defendants claimed that the allegations of the indictment were inconsistent with the government allegations in a bill of particulars provided,at defendants request,to explain the indictment.even if the bill was inconsistent with the indictment,the fifth circuit explained,the proper remedy is not dismissal of the indictment but clarification of the bill.the indictment,unless properly amended or superseded,constitutes the full statement of the charges against the defendants.id.at accord united states arge,cir the indictment must stand on its allegations and whatever the bill of particulars contained in the way of variance from this allegation does not effect sic the sufficiency of the indictment.the same reasoning applies to each count in an indictment,for each is to be treated as separate.prefatory factual allegations inconsistent with one count of a count indictment,we hold,can warrant dismissal of that count no more easily than factual allegations in a bill of particulars inconsistent with the very count the bill purports to explain.
the case might be different in the unusual situation where an indictment introductory matter made the instrument as a whole so confusing or misleading that a reasonable defendant would not be on fair notice of the charges against which he must defend.chisum,at internal quotation marks omitted hajecate,at we will not countenance government tactics that confuse defendants by creating inconsistencies between the indictment and the bill.but here,the defendants were on notice that they needed to defend against the charge of embezzling from a health care benefit program,and it was not necessary for the government to prove the extraneous allegations in the introduction or for defendants to defend against them.if it is true,as defendants contend,that the allegations about hnic contained in the introduction and in count are mutually exclusive,the proper course would have been to wait until it was proved that hnic was an insurance company and then argue the insufficiency of the evidence to support count.
appellants also challenge the health care fraud charge as precluded by the act,which provides that state law shall generally govern insurance matters 
no act of congress shall be construed to invalidate,impair,or supersede any law enacted by any state for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance,or which imposes a fee or tax upon such business,unless such act specifically relates to the business of insurance 
b.appellants say that section impairs oklahoma administrative efforts to protect insurance policy holders because their prosecution undermine d a lawsuit by the state to recover the money they had embezzled from hnic.aplts br.in their reply brief,they explain the nature of the interference frost and redcorn were completely unable to defend,or work toward settlement of their case with the oid while they were preparing for trial and defense of the federal criminal prosecution.reply br.indeed,the case was stayed by mutual agreement during the pendency of this prosecution,and subsequently settled.
we agree with the government,and with amicus the director of the oklahoma insurance department,that this type of interference does not trigger preclusion.section does not invalidate,impair,or supersede any state regulation of insurance state insurance regulations remain fully in force.appellants being tied up in a federal forum in one kind of proceeding made them unavailable to appear in state court for an be made against any federal criminal prosecution.they might as easily have been busy defending charges of importing a mongoose,a,or using the character smokey bear for profit without authorization,id,or shanghaiing a sailor,id.all would distract them from defending or working toward settlement of their case with the oid.yet enforcement of those laws in such a circumstance is surely not precluded by the act.
the supreme court clarified in humana forsyth,d,that does not entirely cede the field of insurance regulation to the states,saving only instances in which congress expressly orders otherwise.id.at.rather,w hen federal law does not directly conflict with state regulation,and when application of the federal law would not frustrate any declared state policy or interfere with a state administrative regime,the act does not preclude its application.id.at.emphasis added.so,in humana,the court upheld against a challenge a private rico action against an insurer to recover treble damages for corrupt insurance practices,even though state law provided a parallel remedy.the court observed that rico private right of action and treble damages provision appears to complement nevada statutory and claims for relief,and held that b ecause rico advances the state interest in combating insurance fraud,and does not frustrate any articulated nevada policy,the suit was not barred by.id.at.here,even more clearly,does not directly conflict in any way with oklahoma insurance law rather,as the insurance department urges,it complements state regulation and furthers the state policy against financial crimes that jeopardize the stability of insurers.
munich american reinsurance company crawford,cir,which predated humana,is of no assistance to appellants.that case concerned application of the federal arbitration act to force certain insurance actions into fora other than the state receivership court,which state law made the exclusive forum.see id.at.this is not at all on point the statutes conflicted directly and enforcement of the federal law would have thwarted express state policy.that is not the case with section.indeed,because in the face of a federal criminal prosecution a state retains parallel jurisdiction to prosecute offenses under its own laws,we are skeptical that a federal criminal statute would ever be preempted by unless it were to forbid something affirmatively required by state insurance law.
counts wire fraud 
counts through charged redcorn and frost with wire fraud.a defendant is guilty of wire fraud if,for the purpose of executing a scheme or artifice to defraud or to obtain money by false pretenses,he transmits or causes to be transmitted by means of wire,radio,or television communication in interstate or foreign commerce,any writings,signs,signals,pictures,or sounds.the allegations here were that appellants diverted incoming hnic premiums to an oklahoma hnic bank account,moved the funds to their personal accounts at the same bank,and are the four charged the moneys to their personal investment accounts with a broker in florida.
it simply can not be suggested,redcorn and frost propose first on appeal,that transfers of funds by the officers of an insurance company are wire fraud.aplts br.this argument is frivolous.the gravamen of the charge is not that funds are transferred,it is that this is done by wire communication in interstate commerce.communication by wire for whatever function,by officers,wire fraud if done for the purpose of executing a fraudulent scheme.
appellants further contend that the indictment was insufficient because it did not allege false statements or deception of any kind,and these are a necessary component of any scheme to defraud.id.at.not so.for purposes of the mail and wire fraud statutes,t he concept of fraud includes the act of embezzlement,which is the fraudulent appropriation to one own use of the money or goods entrusted to one care by another.carpenter united states,d quoting grin shine.false statements are not necessary for perpetrating an embezzlement scheme,so they need not be alleged in an indictment for wire in some unusual case this were necessary to put the defendant on fair notice of the charges against which he must defend,and enable the defendant to assert a double jeopardy defense.chisum,at internal quotation marks omitted.
iii.sufficiency of the evidence 
at the close of the government evidence,and again after the verdicts were handed down,redcorn and frost moved for a judgment of acquittal on the insufficiency of the evidence to support the charges.on appeal,they renew their arguments as to counts through of the indictment our review is de novo,united states mendez,cir,and in considering whether the record supported conviction we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,and reverse only if no rational jury could have found the evidence sufficient to convict beyond a reasonable doubt.united states nacchio,cir.
counts wire fraud 
appellants contend that they should have been acquitted of the wire fraud charges because there was no evidence that the four charged transfers,from their private bank accounts in oklahoma to their investment accounts,were for the purpose of executing a scheme or artifice to defraud.once the funds were in their personal accounts,they argue,the scheme if any was already complete 
the transmission charged in count,for example,took place when redcorn wired of money to his investment account with janney montgomery scott jms in florida,from funds previously embezzled from hnic and deposited in his bank of america boa account.likewise,the transmission charged in count was a wire transfer from frost personal boa account to his jms account on april.frost had previously embezzled these funds from hnic by drawing three checks from hnic boa account,signed by himself,for a total of,and depositing them into his personal boa account.the transfers charged in counts and were similar the money was routed from redcorn boa account first to his account at arvest bank,and thence to jms.in each instance,the appellants personal boa,jms,and arvest accounts were opened in their true names with their own social security numbers.
to meet purpose requirement,a wire transmission must be part of the execution of the scheme as conceived by the perpetrator at the time.schmuck united states,d.the defendant need not have made the transmission personally,merely caused it to be made.it need not be at the heart of a scheme,nor necessary or even helpful for its success it need not itself be false or deceptive.rather,as we have said,a transmission is considered to be for the purpose of furthering a scheme to defraud so long as the transmission is incident to the accomplishment of an essential part of a scheme.united states mann,cir quoting united states puckett,cir accord pereira united states.nonetheless,at some point the fraudulent scheme must be complete,and the perpetrators subsequent enjoyment of its groceries,going to the movies,redecorating the not an essential part of the scheme.united states taylor,cir united states altman,cir.the defendants claim that once they had deposited the embezzled funds in their personal bank accounts in oklahoma,the scheme was complete the subsequent transfers to florida,they say,were simply a means of using their gains 
reluctantly,we are forced to agree.once the defendants deposited the funds into their personal bank accounts,they had accomplished their crime and the funds were available for their personal use.that they chose to transfer part of their stolen money to their broker in florida for the purpose of investments is purely incidental to the fraud they could just as easily have decided to blow it on a luxury trip to the ozarks.without a closer connection to the mechanism of their fraud,what they did with the stolen money afterward can not itself relate to an essential part of the scheme.mann,at.quoting puckett,at.
a chorus of supreme court opinions applying the parallel language of the mail fraud statute limns the boundaries of a scheme to defraud and explains when liability for communications is apt.kann united states,was a prosecution of several defendants for cashing checks they had received in a fraudulent scheme the defendants were charged with mail fraud after the paying banks mailed the checks to the drawee banks for recoupment.id.at.although the defendants had caused the use of the mails,the court held that the interbank mailings were not in furtherance of their fraudulent scheme 
the scheme had reached fruition.the persons intended to receive the money had received it irrevocably.it was immaterial to them,or to any consummation of the scheme,how the bank which paid or credited the check would collect from the drawee bank.it can not be said that the mailings in question were for the purpose of executing the scheme,as the statute requires.
id.at.later,in parr united states,d,the court quoted this passage in holding that mail fraud liability would not lie for fraudulent use of a school district credit card to purchase gasoline merely because the vendor mailed invoices to the school district and the district mailed the payment.id.at.similarly,in united states maze,d,it held that a defendant who had used a stolen credit card at a motel could not be convicted of mail fraud simply because the motel had invoiced the issuing bank by mail 
t he mailings were directed to the end of adjusting accounts between the motel proprietor,the bank,and the card rightful holder,all of whom had to a greater or lesser degree been the victims of respondent scheme.respondent scheme reached fruition when he checked out of the motel,and there is no indication that the success of his scheme depended in any way on which of his victims ultimately bore the loss.
in schmuck united states,d,the court at last upheld a mail fraud conviction.the defendant,a distributor,illegally rolled back the odometers on some automobiles before selling them to unknowing dealers at fraudulently inflated prices.the dealers,on later reselling the automobiles to consumers,had to mail forms to the state to transfer title and complete the sale.id.at.the defendant was convicted of mail fraud for causing twelve such mailings and sought reversal,citing kann,parr,and maze to support his claim that his scheme had reached fruition when the dealers had paid him and the later mailings were not in furtherance of it.id.at.but the court distinguished its prior cases,noting that the mailings in schmuck facilitated the defendant ongoing scheme because a failure of th e passage of title would have jeopardized schmuck relationship of trust and goodwill with the retail dealers upon whose unwitting cooperation his scheme depended.id.at.
the government argues that the final,charged transfers to appellants jms accounts facilitated the scheme to provide appellants with hundreds of thousands of dollars the wire transfers of money into their jms accounts merely completed the scheme to defraud hnic and its policyholders govt br.at a motion hearing before the district court,the government had put forward one theory of the role the charged transfers played in the scheme they got the money out of oklahoma and helped conceal the embezzlement from the auditors.the auditors were aware of the bank of america account of hnic and they would much easier be able to find and locate the monies if they had got it out of the state,vol.v,at.on appeal,the government offers up a somewhat different theory having the money in the florida accounts was the goal of appellants scheme,and depositing the embezzled checks briefly in their boa required the subsequent,charged transfers to complete the plot would have speeded the immediate availability of the full face value of the checks to appellants.govt br.
we agree with the government that a transfer is part of a scheme to defraud if it is necessary to put the stolen money in a form useable to the perpetrator.in united states odiodio,cir,for instance,the defendant stole and altered a check from one corporation to another and deposited it in a bank account he opened in a false name.id.at.he then wired the money to a third party account,and coerced the third party to wire it overseas to the defendant real transfer that enabled him to use the funds.see id.at.united states rude,cir,provides a similar example.the defendants in that case used an investment swindle to induce a hawaii nonprofit called unity house to wire million to a swiss bank account,opened in its name,over which the defendants had power of attorney.id.at.then they wired the funds to their own account in the united states,and later wired of the principal back to the victim,falsely representing it as return on the investment.id.they were charged and convicted of wire fraud,not for the initial transfer to switzerland,but for the subsequent transfers,and sought reversal on appeal,claiming that the wire fraud was completed once the money was out of the victim coffers and under the defendants control in switzerland.id.at.the ninth circuit affirmed.the transfer from switzerland to the united states,it held,effected a step in the scheme because it plac ed the funds outside of unity house account,outside of the scope of unity house authorization,and within defendants own control.id.at.it was a final step toward the goal of having the money in a useable form.
rude illustrates a second,important principle as well transfers,or other wire communications,may constitute wire fraud if they are carried out to conceal an otherwise completed fraud.thus,although the funds in rude were under the defendants control and beyond the victim grasp once they had been transferred out of the swiss account,the later transfer of a portion of the funds back to unity house,to create the impression that unity house was earning an immediate,substantial return on its investment,was not only relevant to the fraudulent conspiracy,but extended the overall scheme by lulling unity house into a false complacency about the fraud.id.at.
the similar notion of the lulling letter as relating to an essential part of a scheme to defraud is well accepted.even after the schemer has extracted what he wants from his victims,a communication will be mail fraud or wire fraud if it is intended to lull the victims into a false sense of security,postpone their ultimate complaint to the authorities,and therefore make the apprehension of the defendants less likely.maze,at.accord united states trammell,cir.it has long been understood that a voidance of detection and prevention of recovery of money lost by the victims are within,and often a material part of,the illegal scheme.further profit from the scheme to defraud,as such,may be over,and yet the scheme itself be not ended.united states riedel,cir 
however,not every wire transfer of money violates.as the supreme court has repeatedly emphasized in the parallel context of,t he federal mail fraud statute does not purport to reach all frauds,but only those limited instances in which the use of the mails is a part of the execution of the fraud,leaving all other cases to be dealt with by appropriate state law.schmuck,at.quoting kann united states.it is therefore not correct to claim without qualification,as the government did in its closing argument to the jury,that use of the wires is illegal if at all in relation to a scheme to defraud,vol.xiv,at.setting aside cases where the wires are employed so that the fruits of the fraud are useable to the defendant,and cases of lulling or concealment,as a general proposition,use of the wires after a scheme reaches fruition will not constitute grounds for a conviction.taylor,at accord altman,at.
we can find in the record of this case no evidence that,as the scheme was conceived by the perpetrator s at the time,schmuck,at,the charged wire transfers from appellants personal boa accounts to their personal jms accounts were necessary to gain control over the funds or to conceal the nature of appellants fraud on hnic.certainly they do not fit the classic mold of the lulling communication,carried out to delay complaint or to enable an ongoing scam to continue,as hnic had no reason to learn of the transfers at all.the government asserted below that these transfers helped conceal the embezzlement from the auditors,vol.v,at,but that claim was not supported then by reference to the transcripts,and is not supported now by our own review of the auditors testimony.there is no evidence that the transfers charged in this case helped conceal appellants fraud or were meant to do so.if anything,the four charged transfers to separate investment accounts in florida made it more,not less,obvious that appellants were taking these funds for themselves the transfers undercut appellants defense that they were holding these funds as a war chest to sue steve silverstein on hnic behalf 
nor do we find any evidence to support the government current theory that the transfers to florida somehow speeded the immediate availability of the funds.govt br.the funds were available from the moment they were deposited in appellants boa accounts,and could be spent,transferred,or otherwise drawn on at their pleasure.we see nothing to bear out the contention that moving the stolen funds to jms would have been slower without the intermediate stopovers.on the contrary,in counts,and the boa stopovers lasted four days or a sign that speed was of the essence.
it might well be that appellants use of their bank of america accounts speeded the availability of the embezzled funds.but they were not prosecuted for transferring the funds to those accounts they were prosecuted for subsequent transfers to their broker in florida.we think the scheme to defraud ended at the earlier step,before the interstate wires were used.it was at that point that t he persons intended to receive the money had received it irrevocably and the scheme had reached fruition.kann,at.although appellants may have wished to draw an investment return on the proceeds of their fraud,investing stolen money is no more a part of a scheme
