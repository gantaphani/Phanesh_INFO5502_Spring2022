on june,lary lee speakman pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud,in violation of.speakman was sentenced to months in prison and ordered to pay in restitution.on appeal,speakman challenges only the restitution orders entered by the district court,which we have jurisdiction to review under.for the following reasons,we reverse.
background 
the following facts were stipulated to in the plea agreement.speakman became a financial consultant with merrill lynch pierce fenner smith,merrill lynch in its denver office in about.in september,speakman and his wife,carolyn speakman,opened a joint account at merrill lynch that speakman managed as a merrill lynch financial consultant.in october,speakman opened an account at merrill lynch in her name only,but managed by her husband.she deposited approximately worth of stock into the account.in,speakman made two additional deposits of stock she inherited into the same account,totaling over million.speakman signed a limited power of attorney in relation to the account,granting her husband the authority to buy and sell securities in the account,but denying him use of those funds or the ability to transfer funds out of the account.
despite lacking the authority to do so,speakman transferred money and securities from speakman account without her authorization numerous times from through.on several occasions between and,speakman transferred securities from speakman account to the joint account and then sold those securities for.on additional occasions between and,he transferred from speakman account to the joint account by forging her signature on merrill lynch forms.on an additional occasions from to,speakman wrote,or caused merrill lynch to write,checks totaling on speakman account payable to himself.speakman forged his wife signature either on the checks themselves or on the merrill lynch forms authorizing the checks.
speakman transferred most of the money that went through the joint account to other accounts.in particular,speakman wire transferred,in a series of transfers,to an account for cdm enterprises,an account he held at evergreen national bank in evergreen,colorado.speakman controlled and possessed signatory authority over the account,which appears to have been funded largely,if not entirely,by these illegal transfers.speakman used much of this money in the cdm account for the benefit of roxanne rouser.rouser was a former martial arts student of speakman who had since opened her own instruction business.speakman and rouser also had a romantic relationship during this time,although speakman claims it was brief and over by the.speakman wrote checks from the cdm account directly to rouser,totaling.he also wrote checks from the cdm account,totaling,to the united states treasury and colorado department of revenue to satisfy rouser tax obligations,as well as those of her business.
speakman also bought rouser a number of gifts with his wife money.for instance,he wrote a cdm check for to buy her a motorcycle on june.on march,he wrote another cdm check for to pay for a vacation for rouser and one of her friends.speakman also bought rouser larger gifts with his wife money,including a house and a diamond ring.for the house,speakman caused merrill lynch to transfer out of speakman account to the joint account by forging her signature on an authorization form in october.speakman then had merrill lynch transfer the money to the cdm account,which he accomplished by again forging speakman name.speakman most of the money from the cdm account to an account for satori group,a company founded by him and rouser.rouser used this money to purchase the house,and received an additional from the cdm account to cover various insurance and tax payments for the house.speakman claims that he and rouser intended to flip the house for a profit,but that appears to have never happened,and the house became rouser residence.later,in august,rouser made a deposit on a diamond ring,and speakman paid the remaining owed on the ring by writing a check drawn on speakman account.speakman forged his wife signature on the check and wrote her driver license number on it.
speakman also used money from the cdm account for reasons unrelated to rouser.for instance,he used from that account to reimburse some of his merrill lynch clients he also used approximately from the account to make personal investments in several companies.in,speakman wrote two checks from the cdm account as donations to the golden sun foundation.
speakman eventually learned of her husband fraud and recorded a telephone conversation with him on august.in that conversation,she accused him of forging her signature on the merrill lynch authorization forms,to which he replied,i ca imagine i did all of that.maybe i did.speakman eventually admitted to forging her signature on the form transferring from her account,as well as forging her signature on the check used to buy rouser a diamond ring.
on october,a federal grand jury indicted speakman on nine counts of wire fraud in violation of,two counts of engaging in monetary transactions involving criminally derived property in violation of a,and one count of uttering and possessing a forged security in violation of a.speakman reached a plea agreement with the government,and,on june,pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud.on september,the united states district court for the district of colorado entered judgment against speakman and sentenced him to months in prison,three years of supervised release,and a special assessment of.
in addition,the court ordered speakman to pay in restitution to merrill lynch,and to the crime victims fund the fund.according to the presentence investigation report psr,the restitution owed to merrill lynch was the result of a national association of securities dealers nasd arbitration proceeding initiated by speakman against both merrill lynch and speakman.in that proceeding,speakman was held liable for.as a result of the arbitration,merrill lynch paid speakman.as detailed below,the award does not explicitly state the basis of merrill lynch liability.the district court apparently did not have a copy of the arbitration award at the time of sentencing,and was made aware of merrill lynch liability only through the psr.on this basis,the district court concluded that merrill lynch was a victim of speakman fraud,and,therefore,speakman was obligated to pay merrill lynch in restitution.
the sum that speakman was ordered to pay to the fund is the amount of restitution the court calculated that speakman was owed,after subtracting the amount merrill lynch had paid her and subtracting a portion of the amount she had recovered from speakman in a civil suit in state court j b any amount paid to a victim under an order of restitution shall be reduced by any amount later recovered as compensatory damages for the same loss by the victim in any state civil proceeding.in a letter to the probation officer who prepared the presentence investigation report,speakman expressly declined further restitution from speakman 
i would not want to receive any restitution obtained at the expense of any other victim.furthermore,i believe that a judgment in my favor against speakman could set up a situation where he might pursue me with empty promises that he was going to make payments.i do not want to again be subjected to speakman emotional abuse.
the district court nevertheless felt compelled under the mandatory victim restitution act mvra,to order speakman to pay restitution for this loss.because speakman disavowed her interest in the restitution,the court ordered speakman to pay the amount that would be owed to speakman to the crime victims fund.speakman challenges both of these restitution awards,arguing that merrill lynch was not a victim of his fraud,and that the court lacked authority to award restitution to the crime victims fund.
ii.discussion 
restitution order to merrill lynch 
speakman first objects to the district court order that he pay merrill lynch in restitution arising from the arbitration panel award.we review the factual findings of the district court for clear error and its application of the mvra de novo.united states gallant,cir.
definition of victim 
the mvra provides that,for certain crimes,the court shall order that the defendant make restitution to the victim of the offense.a.speakman concedes that the mvra applies to the count of wire fraud to which he pleaded guilty,see id.c a ii applying mvra to an offense against property committed by fraud or deceit,but contends that merrill lynch is not a victim within the meaning of the act.for purposes of the mvra,a victim is 
a person directly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of an offense for which restitution may be ordered including,in the case of an offense that involves as an element a scheme,conspiracy,or pattern of criminal activity,any person directly harmed by the defendant criminal conduct in the course of the scheme,conspiracy,or pattern.
id.a emphasis added.this definition of victim thus sets forth two separate ways an individual can be a victim under the mvra first,if the person is directly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of an offense covered by the mvra second,if the defendant crime includes an element that the defendant engaged in a scheme,conspiracy or pattern of criminal activity,then the person will be a victim if he is directly harmed by the defendant criminal conduct in the course of the scheme,conspiracy,or pattern of criminal activity.see also gallant,at a victim under the mvra is someone who is directly harmed by the defendant criminal conduct in the course of the scheme.quoting a.the first of these definitions is in some ways broader because it requires only that the individual be harmed as a result of the defendant offense,and not in the course of the offense.the first clause also includ es the second,which applies only to those crimes that involve,as an element,a scheme,conspiracy,or pattern of criminal activity,and even then applies only when the individual is harmed in the course of the scheme,conspiracy,or pattern.it thus follows that an individual could be deemed a victim by meeting the first criteria only,and not the second.
following our decision in united states gallant,the district court in this case concluded that merrill lynch was a victim under the second criterion.in gallant,we held that wire fraud,speakman crime of conviction,includes as an element a scheme to defraud.gallant,at a guilty verdict for wire fraud necessarily establishes the existence of a scheme to defraud under the mvra.accordingly,we concluded that when the defendant commits wire fraud,an individual will be deemed a victim so long as he was directly harmed in the course of the scheme.id.at see also united states gordon,cir recognizing that mvra applies not only to those harmed by the offense of conviction,but also to those directly harmed by the defendant criminal conduct in the course of a scheme,conspiracy,or pattern of criminal activity.
on this basis,the district court concluded that merrill lynch was directly harmed by the defendant criminal conduct in the course of the scheme,and was therefore a victim under the mvra entitled to restitution.vol.at.the district court applied the wrong standard,however.the standard employed by the district court applies only when the alleged victim is directly harmed by the defendant criminal conduct in the course of the scheme.a emphasis added.in gallant,for example,the defendants committed acts of wire fraud in order to sell a credit card portfolio by misrepresenting its delinquency risk.gallant,at.the individual that they hired to market their portfolio was directly harmed in the course of their scheme because his participation was essential to their scheme,and if the defendants had not committed wire fraud,the victim likely would not have incurred the expenses to market the account.id.
here,by contrast,the harm that the government claims merrill lynch endured occurred when merrill lynch was found liable to speakman,well after the conclusion of speakman scheme.unlike the scheme in gallant,which required the victim participation to be successful,speakman scheme did not contemplate that speakman would file an nasd arbitration.in fact,if speakman had never brought the nasd took place after speakman fraudulent scheme had run its lynch would not have been harmed by speakman conduct at all.therefore,merrill lynch harm can not be said to have arisen in the course of the scheme.
requirement of direct and proximate harm 
as noted above,merrill lynch may still be a victim of speakman fraud if it meets the first criterion of a that is,merrill lynch may be a victim under the mvra if it was directly and proximately harmed as a result of speakman fraud.id.emphasis added.although this was not the basis of the district court determination that merrill lynch was a victim,the parties have briefed the issue to this court and we can consider whether to affirm the district court determination on this alternate ground.see united states sandia,cir w e are free to affirm a district court decision on any grounds for which there is a record sufficient to permit conclusions of law,even grounds not relied upon by the district court.quotation omitted.
we first note that phrase directly and proximately uses the conjunctive and,which indicates that direct harm and proximate harm have separate meanings.qwest commc ns int l,cir noting that use of the word and in setting out duties clearly indicates that the commission can not satisfy the statutory mandate by simply doing one or the other.other circuits that have considered the phrase directly and proximately harmed in the mvra and other federal restitution statutes have required more than but for causation.the second circuit,for example,has held that the requirement that the victim be directly and proximately harmed encompasses the traditional but for and proximate cause analyses.in re rendon galvis,cir this interpretation makes a good deal of sense,as it essentially requires a showing of causation to show that a victim was directly harmed,and a showing of proximate causation to show that a victim was proximately harmed.see also in re antrobus,cir tymkovich,concurring a pplying traditional rules of and proximate causation in the cvra context,and noting that direct harm encompasses a causation notion that is different from proximate harm.similarly,the first circuit has held that a approach is appropriate when defining the causation standard required to show that someone is a victim under the mvra.t he government must show not only that a particular loss would not have occurred but for the conduct underlying the offense of conviction,but also that the causal connection between the conduct and the loss is not too attenuated either factually or temporally.united states cutter,cir see also united states robertson,cir quoting cutter,at.
we agree with these courts that to show that one is a victim under the mvra,the government must show both that the defendant conduct is the cause of the individual harm and that the defendant proximately caused the harm.in speakman case,the parties do not dispute that speakman was a cause of merrill lynch loss,as merrill lynch never would have had to pay speakman any money under the arbitration award if not for speakman fraud.the district court stopped here in its analysis,concluding that merrill lynch was directly harmed by the defendant criminal conduct in the course of the scheme and was therefore a victim within the meaning of the mvra.vol.at.as noted above,however,because merrill lynch was not harmed in the course of speakman fraud,the district court also needed to consider whether merrill lynch was proximately harmed by speakman fraud.the court could thus only order restitution if speakman fraud against his wife proximately caused the loss to merrill lynch.
proximate cause standard 
while we have not articulated a precise standard of proximate cause in the mvra context,we have recognized that the main inquiry for causation in restitution cases is whether there was an intervening cause and,if so,whether this intervening cause was directly related to the offense conduct.united states wilfong,cir quoting united states de la fuente,cir see also united states gamma tech,cir defendant conduct need not be the sole cause of the loss,but any subsequent action that contributes to the loss,such as an intervening cause,must be directly related to the defendant conduct.other courts have also focused on the need for the harm suffered by the alleged victim to be not too attenuated from the defendant wrongful act.see robertson,at t he government must show not only that a particular loss would not have occurred but for the conduct underlying the offense of conviction,but also that the causal connection between the conduct and the loss is not too attenuated either factually or temporally.quoting cutter,at.we thus hold that,for the purposes of determining if an individual is a victim under the mvra,an individual will be proximately harmed as a result of the defendant crime if either there are no intervening causes,or,if there are any such causes,if those causes are directly related to the defendant offense.
there are potentially two intervening causes between speakman wire fraud and the loss merrill lynch suffered.first,speakman initiation of arbitration against merrill lynch is an intervening cause of merrill lynch harm,because merrill lynch presumably would not have had to pay if speakman had not brought the arbitration.we have little difficulty in concluding that the arbitration was directly related to the offense conduct,because speakman initiated the arbitration directly in response to speakman fraud in an attempt to recover the money he stole from her.this is a direct relationship that is not too attenuated from speakman fraud so that it would be unjust to hold him responsible.
the second intervening cause between speakman fraud and merrill lynch harm is whatever caused the arbitrator to rule that merrill lynch was liable to speakman in the nasd arbitration.however,the record does not reflect the basis for merrill lynch liability in the arbitration,so we can not be sure if merrill lynch liability was based on respondeat superior principles,negligence in supervising speakman,or some other basis entirely and because,as explained below,whether merrill lynch was proximately harmed by speakman fraud depends on the basis of merrill lynch liability to speakman in the nasd arbitration,the government has not met its burden of establishing that merrill lynch was a victim of speakman fraud because the district court did not require a showing of proximate cause in its determination of whether merrill lynch was a victim,the government never attempted to establish that element.mindful of the mvra interest in providing compensation to victims of crime,we conclude that a remand is appropriate to allow the government to present evidence of the proximate cause of merrill lynch loss to the district court in the first instance.
in order to provide the district court with guidance as to what constitutes proximate cause in this instance,we next consider whether proximate cause would be established if the government is able to establish that merrill lynch liability in the arbitration arose from either respondeat superior or negligence.
respondeat superior 
if merrill lynch liability was premised on a respondeat superior theory,then there really is no second intervening cause,as employers are generally held liable on that theory not because of any act or omission on their part,but rather because the employee was acting within the scope of his duty.see generally restatement third agency.if the government could establish that merrill lynch was liable to speakman under a respondeat superior theory,we would thus have little trouble concluding that merrill lynch was directly and proximately harmed by speakman fraud.
negligent supervision 
although a closer question,we also think that merrill lynch harm would still be directly related to speakman fraud even if merril lynch was held liable in the arbitration because of its own negligence in supervising speakman.speakman must have anticipated that merrill lynch would not diligently supervise his actions,or else he would not have been able to commit the fraud in the first place.in addition,the negligent supervision only gave rise to merrill lynch liability because of the fraud that speakman was committing.thus,unlike a volitional act,negligent supervision would not be a cause by itself.it thus can not be an intervening cause.this satisfies us that merrill lynch harm would be directly related to speakman fraud if merrill lynch liability arose from its own negligence in supervising speakman.
c.other bases for merrill lynch liability 
unfortunately,based on the record before us,we can not even determine whether either respondeat superior or negligent supervision provided the basis for merrill lynch liability to speakman.it is possible that the nasd arbitration found merrill lynch liable for other reasons,possibly for an intentional harm that merrill lynch itself committed.the only reference to merrill lynch liability contained in the record is a statement by the probation officer in the psr,based on a statement from merrill lynch itself,that merrill lynch and the defendant were found jointly and severally liable for losses to speakman in the amount of.psr at.with no further information concerning merrill lynch liability in the arbitration,it remains possible that merrill lynch was liable to speakman because of its own volitional acts.in such a case,merrill lynch would not have been proximately harmed by speakman because it was its own actions that gave rise to its liability,and thus merrill lynch harm would not be directly related to speakman fraud.just as a third party intentional tort will generally be held as a superseding cause of a harm,thereby relieving another party of liability for negligence,we are satisfied that any intentional act that merrill lynch may have taken would be a superseding cause of its liability that would break the causal chain between speakman actions and merrill lynch loss sustained in the arbitration.see ici explosives,usa,cir when the intervening act is intentionally tortious or criminal,it is more likely to be considered independent.quotation omitted see also restatement second of torts the act of a third person in committing an intentional tort or crime is a superseding cause of harm to another resulting therefrom.indeed,it would be odd to consider merrill lynch a victim of speakman fraud if the reason it suffered harm was because of its own intentional conduct 
we therefore vacate this portion of defendant sentence and remand for the district court to perform further as to whether speakman proximately caused merrill lynch harm.
restitution order to crime victims fund 
speakman also argues that the district court erred in ordering him to pay in restitution to the crime victims fund.that sum was owed to speakman as a result of the fraud,but speakman specifically disclaimed her interest in receiving the money.the district court believed that it was nevertheless required to order restitution,because the mvra imposes a mandatory requirement on district courts to order restitution.specifically,the statute says that 
notwithstanding any other provision of law,when sentencing a defendant convicted of an offense described in subsection c,the court shall order,in addition to,or in the case of a misdemeanor,in addition to or in lieu of,any other penalty authorized by law,that the defendant make restitution to the victim of the offense or,if the victim is deceased,to the victim estate.
a emphasis added.the mvra must be construed in conjunction with,however,which outlines the procedures for enforcing a restitution order.see id d stating that a restitution order under the mvra shall be issued and enforced in accordance with section.section states no victim shall be required to participate in any phase of a restitution order.id.g.the statute also provides that a victim may at any time assign the victim interest in restitution payments to the crime victims fund in the treasury without in any way impairing the obligation of the defendant to make such payments.id.g.
the district court interpreted these three statutory provisions a,g,and g as imposing a mandatory obligation on the court to order restitution.even though speakman did not assign her interest in restitution to the fund,the court was concerned that by not ordering any restitution,it would allow the victim to trump the mandatory nature of the statute,when we have a receptacle in the victim restitution fund for the disposition of restitution amounts.tr.at,vol.the district court concluded that it had a statutory duty to order restitution,and that the victim decision to forego restitution can not abrogate that duty.id.at.accordingly,because the court believed it was bound to order restitution under the mvra and because g establishes a receptacle to which victims can assign their restitution interests,the court ordered the restitution due to speakman be paid instead into the crime victims fund.
we disagree with the district court.as the starting point of our analysis,we note that f ederal courts possess no inherent authority to order restitution,and may only do so as explicitly empowered by statute.united states nichols,cir quoting united states hensley,cir.while we agree that the mvra imposes a mandatory obligation on courts to order restitution in certain cases,restitution is only mandatory if it is ordered either to the victim of the offense or,if the victim is deceased,to the victim estate.a.here,the victim speakman is alive,so the mvra,read in isolation,would appear to require the district court to order restitution to speakman.the mvra must be read in conjunction with g,however,which permits a victim to decline restitution.see id.d directing courts to issue restitution orders in accordance with section.these two statutes can thus be read together in a sensible way.because restitution is only mandatory when ordered to the victim or the victim estate,see id.a,and because victims are not required to participate in any phase of a restitution order,see id.g,courts are not required to order restitution if the victim declines the restitution without assigning her interest to the fund.
the district court emphasis on g is also misplaced.by its own terms,that provision only permits restitution to be made to the fund if the victim assign s the victim interest in restitution payments to the crime victims fund.id.g.the statute could have been written so as to authorize the court to order restitution payments to the fund even when the victim failed to assign her interest,or to require the victim to either accept restitution or assign her interest to the fund.however,as written,the statute only authorizes restitution to the victim a,the victim estate,if the victim is deceased a,persons other than the victim if agreed to by the parties in a plea agreement a,or the crime victims fund,if the victim assigns her interest to the fund g here,the predicates for,and are not met,and the victim has renounced her interest in restitution.there is thus no statutory basis to support the district court award of restitution to the fund.
the legislative history of and reinforce this conclusion in two ways.first,although was originally enacted prior to,the provisions of at issue,g and were enacted as an amendment to in the same bill in which congress enacted.see antiterrorism effective death penalty act of,stat.this underscores the importance of reading in conjunction with,and strongly suggests that while congress intended to order mandatory restitution to victims a,it also expressly gave victims the right to decline that restitution g.second,the senate considered and rejected a broader version of g g no victim shall be required to participate in any phase of a restitution order.if a victim declines to receive restitution made mandatory by this title,the court shall order that the victim share of any restitution owed be deposited in the crime victims fund in the treasury,at,cong at,emphasis added.section g in this proposed bill,just as in the version finally adopted,also gave victims the option of assigning their interest to the fund.id.thus,the proposed legislation would have explicitly authorized the restitution order entered by the district court here however,the enacted statute lacks any such explicit authorization.while evidence of what congress considered but did not enact may not be conclusive proof of the proper construction of the statute,this legislative history further underscores what we believe is the proper reading that congress only authorized courts to order a restitution payment to the fund when the victim herself assigns her interest to the fund.
our conclusion also finds support in the seventh circuit holding in united states pawlinski,cir.in pawlinski,an alderman committed mail fraud by using money contributed to his campaign fund for purposes unrelated to the campaign.id.at.the court ordered the defendant to pay restitution and to deposit the sum owed in the district court.id.the court then notified the contributors that they could be reimbursed for their donation,but many contributors did not collect what they were owed.id.the defendant suggested that this unclaimed amount be returned to the campaign fund,which could then be dissolved in accordance with state law.id.at.the government was indifferent between that outcome and paying the unclaimed sum to the crime victims fund,and the district court ordered the money to be paid into the fund.id.the seventh circuit reversed,holding that a n order of restitution under the mvra must go to victims of the defendant crimes,and the crime victims fund is neither a victim of pawlinski nor a representative of his victims.id.at.the court recognized that there were only two exceptions contained in the mvra that permit restitution to nonvictims if the order is imposed pursuant to a plea agreement which provides for restitution to nonvictims,or if the victims assign their right to restitution to the crime victims fund.id.at citing a,g.the court in pawlinski reversed the restitution order because f ederal courts can not order restitution in a criminal case without a statutory basis,and no such basis existed.id.at.we,too,lack a statutory basis here,and so the district court could not order speakman to pay restitution to the fund.
in contrast to our holding today and the seventh circuit decision in pawlinski,the second circuit has affirmed a court sua sponte award of restitution to the fund.focusing on the mandatory language of the mvra,that court held that a district court,orders of restitution on defendants convicted of crimes identified in the mvra even if their victims decline restitution.united states johnson,cir.that court rejected the defendant argument that precludes ordering restitution to the fund when the victim does not assign her interest because the permissive language of g a victim may assign the victim interest in restitution payments to the crime victims fund does not foreclose the ability of the court from assigning the victim interest as well.johnson,at although g authorizes victims to make such an assignment,it does not preclude the court from doing so.
we respectfully disagree with the second circuit,for two reasons.first,the court failed to appreciate the import of g,which permits victims to decline restitution.g no victim shall be required to participate in any phase of a restitution order.the johnson court asserted that this provision can not reasonably be interpreted as carving out an exception to the mandatory nature of,and that a victim refusing restitution has no effect on the mandate of the court to order restitution.at.as explained above,however,we believe that g,adopted at the same time as,has the precise effect of carving out an exception to the mandatory nature of.because the mvra only authorizes restitution payments to victims except in certain specifically delineated circumstances,and because g allows victims to decline restitution,the mvra is expressly made subject to the victim accepting restitution.in other words,construing and g together means that restitution payments under the mvra are mandated only when the victim accepts them.see a stating only that the court shall order that the defendant make restitution to the victim.the second circuit holding thus disregards the principle that f ederal
