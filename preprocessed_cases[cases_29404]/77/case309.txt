ii.background 
factual background 
lanl mission is to develop science and technology to help ensure the united states national security.a substantial amount of the work undertaken at lanl is classified.the united states owns lanl grounds,facilities,property,and equipment the united states department of energy is responsible for oversight of lanl.all purchases of equipment and expenditures for operations are paid for by the united states.
arreola began working at lanl in she continued working there until her criminal activities were discovered in.at the time she committed her crimes,arreola was working as a buyer within lanl supply chain management division,procurement organization procurement department.to meet its ongoing needs,lanl purchased property,equipment,supplies,materials,and services from various approved vendors.to obtain needed goods or services from an outside vendor or supplier,an authorized lanl employee would complete a purchase request describing the items needed and submit it to the procurement department.in her position as a buyer,arreola was responsible for processing a segment of those purchase requests.
arreola was not a manager or a administrator within the procurement department.she did,however,have signature authority,within which she had great discretion.that signature authority meant she was authorized to make purchases for goods and services costing up to in a single transaction without supervisory approval.within her signature authority,she was expected to exercise her professional judgment as to a variety of issues,including choosing a vendor and negotiating and resolving the legal terms and conditions of a purchase order.the decisions she made within her signature authority were entitled to deference within the lanl system and were sufficient to commit lanl to a contractual obligation.
acting within her authority,arreola had a continuing responsibility to conduct a full range of procurement activities until any particular purchase order was closed out.for example,she was responsible for making decisions such as whether lanl was going to solicit quotes verbally for the procurement activity or,instead,whether it would put together a written request for a quotation or proposal and send it out to the supplier community.she also decided whether the procurement would be handled on a single source or competitive basis.it was within arreola discretion to choose the final vendor based upon other market research that resulted in only one supplier being identified as meeting lanl requirements or a competitive bidding process in which a supplier was chosen based on the selection criteria in the request for quotation.in sum,arreola was responsible for reviewing proposals for price reasonableness,negotiating the final terms of the purchase order with suppliers,executing the actual transaction,and closing out the purchase order subcontract when the goods or services were received by lanl.
arreola crimes stemmed from her approval for payment of three fake purchase orders,which resulted in lanl issuing checks to a fictitious vendor.all three fraudulent purchase orders were issued for amounts that fell within arreola signatory authority.she subsequently arranged for lanl personnel to release the checks to her personally.she then deposited the checks into a bank account to which she had access.thus,as set out more fully below,arreola committed her crimes in a way that exploited weaknesses in lanl procurement system and utilized the discretion inherent in her position as a buyer within the procurement department.
one of the first steps arreola took to embezzle funds was to enter false data into lanl computerized vendor desk system to make it appear as if an organization known as the santo domingo de cundiyo heirs association sdha was a legitimate lanl vendor she then contacted personnel at the vendor desk requesting that sdha be made an active and authorized vendor in lanl procurement system database these actions were necessary steps in arreola criminal scheme,as goods or services could not be procured from any particular vendor until that vendor was first made an active vendor within the procurement system.
after having sdha falsely established as a legitimate vendor,arreola began creating fictitious purchase orders based upon other legitimate purchase orders for which she was responsible.she did so by changing the vendor name on an established purchase order to that of sdha.that is,she would use the same description of goods and services from a legitimate purchase order in her fraudulent purchase orders so the goods and services being requested would appear legitimate.for example,on may,arreola processed a legitimate purchase order to acquire high voltage diodes from a company called vmi.that same day,she prepared a fictitious purchase order for the same items and price,but named sdha as the vendor.likewise,on may,arreola processed a legitimate purchase order for milliliters of bulk reaction from genprime.on june,she prepared a fraudulent purchase,again listing sdha as the vendor,based on the genuine genprime purchase order 
after awarding sdha each of the above fictitious purchase orders,arreola anticipated that no goods or services were ever going to be received by lanl.in accord with standard government practice,lanl generally would not pay a vendor for any goods and services until those goods or services were actually received.instead,once goods were received,a receipt report would be generated to alert appropriate personnel so a check could be mailed to the vendor.with regard to the fictitious purchase orders she created,however,arreola exercised her discretionary authority to approve a waiver of the normal receipt report prior to payment of sdha.arreola also utilized her discretionary authority to alter the standard payment method utilized by lanl.normally,almost all lanl payments to vendors were mailed.arreola overrode that general practice,however,and arranged for the checks to be picked up personally by herself for delivery to sdha.she then deposited the checks into sdha account at del norte credit union,an account for which she had signature authority,and then withdrew the funds for her personal use.
procedural background 
there was no real dispute at sentencing as to how arreola committed her crimes.rather,the dispute involved the applicability of the enhancement set out in.for her part,arreola asserted she was not a manager and did not exercise sufficient professional or managerial discretion in her job duties to implicate.she essentially denied she had ever administer ed any funds on behalf of lanl,instead insisting her position merely involved processing paperwork and in doing so and having worked for lanl for so many years,she was able to discover a means to fraudulently obtain funds.the government responded that arreola had been entrusted with ample professional discretion which she had then abused in ways that made her crimes significantly more difficult to dete
