factual and procedural background 
criminal proceedings 
louisiana governor edwin edwards,his son stephen edwards,and his executive assistant andrew martin collectively,appellants,along with several of their associates,were indicted on federal counts by superseding indictments on august,for their roles in a number of illegal activities designed to profit from awarding riverboat gambling licenses while edwin edwards was governor.the superseding indictments alleged that appellants had conspired in five separate schemes to extort money from individuals who had applied to the louisiana riverboat gaming commission for a limited number of licenses to operate riverboat casinos along louisiana gulf coast and lake charles.in exchange for cash bribes,appellants promised to use governor edwards influence with the riverboat gaming commission to help applicants obtain preliminary approval for the riverboat gambling licenses they sought for those applicants who refused to pay,appellants threatened to make obtaining a license impossible.appellants then attempted to launder the extorted money to cover up their criminal activities.at their arraignments on august,appellants entered pleas of not guilty.
on may,after a trial in the united states district court for the middle district of louisiana,the jury returned its verdict.appellants were convicted of,inter alia,violating the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico,rico conspiracy,extortion,conspiracy to commit extortion,wire and mail fraud,conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud,and conspiracy to commit money laundering.

proceedings 
section proceedings 
on february,appellants timely filed in the united states district court for the middle district of louisiana motions to vacate their sentences under,alleging six separate grounds for relief and requesting an evidentiary hearing.two of these grounds,which are now before this court on appeal,alleged that during appellants trial the government withheld impeachment evidence relating to two of its key witnesses,robert guidry and john brotherton,in violation of appellants due process rights under brady,d.
a robert guidry plea agreement 
in their motions,appellants asserted that the government violated their due process rights under brady when it concealed information regarding the plea agreement of louisiana businessman robert guidry,a government witness who had testified against appellants pursuant to a grant of immunity.appellants further maintained that guidry gave false testimony concerning the scope of his plea agreement and that the government failed to correct it in violation of napue illinois,d.
appellants asserted that at their trial,the government relied heavily on guidry testimony to convict appellants on counts related to the treasure chest scheme.guidry,the owner of the treasure chest riverboat casino,testified that in he had agreed to pay appellants per month in exchange for a license hearing before the riverboat gaming commission.guidry received a license and,after governor edwards left office in,began making the monthly cash payments of.guidry testified that between february and april he paid a total of million to appellants.
guidry gave this testimony in exchange for immunity from further prosecution pursuant to a written plea agreement with the federal government.per the agreement,at his october,arraignment,guidry pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit extortion related to the treasure chest scheme in the united states district court for the middle district of louisiana.the agreement also required that he forfeit million and pay in restitution and in fines,capping his total financial liability to the federal government at million in addition,guidry received state immunity in an october,letter to eddie jordan,the united states attorney for the eastern district of louisiana,signed by east baton rouge parish district attorney doug moreau.in this letter,moreau promised that he would defer to federal prosecution in the matter and grant guidry immunity for crimes he may have committed concerning the louisiana riverboat gaming industry and specifically the treasure chest riverboat casino.def.exh.tab.guidry plea agreement specified that the statements set forth above represent the entire agreement with the government,any prior oral discussions or written letters do not affect this agreement.def.exh.tab at.the government produced guidry written plea agreement and the moreau letter to appellants prior to the beginning of appellants criminal trial.
on october,the louisiana attorney general,on behalf of the state of louisiana,filed a civil suit in state court against guidry.the state sought damages arising from guidry illegal dealings with appellants,including all of the profits resulting from guidry breach of fiduciary duty and the value of his gaming license.shortly before the beginning of appellants criminal trial,the district court stayed the state action against guidry pending the outcome of appellants trial.during appellants trial,guidry testified that,although his financial liability to the federal government was capped at million,his overall financial exposure was possibly much greater because he had two or three lawsuits that sic pending against all this money.at.after appellants trial and convictions,guidry was sentenced in federal court consistent with his plea agreement on january,
soon thereafter,the state of louisiana proceeded with its civil suit against guidry.in support of his motion for a preliminary injunction,guidry defense attorneys argued that the immunity provisions set forth in the moreau letter should be construed under louisiana law to include immunity from state civil suit for money damages as well as from state criminal prosecution.at a june,hearing on the motion,guidry attorneys attempted to elicit testimony from the federal and state prosecutors involved in the plea agreement to support this civil immunity theory.the state court judge denied the preliminary injunction on the ground that,given the testimony from the hearing,there was simply no meeting of the minds regarding an agreement to extend civil immunity to guidry.def.exh.tab at.
despite the state court finding,appellants,citing newly discovered evidence of a brady violation,built on guidry civil immunity theory a year later during their proceedings.they argued that guidry plea agreement went beyond the contents of the written agreement and the moreau letter because guidry had also entered into an unwritten,undisclosed deal with federal prosecutors and the state of louisiana immunizing guidry from financial liability to the state arising from crimes he may have committed in connection with the treasure chest casino.appellants further suggested that a federal judge approved this separate agreement at guidry arraignment in a secret,chambers conference with guidry,his lawyers,and the prosecutors.
b john brotherton book deal 
in their motions,governor and stephen edwards the edwardses also contended that the government violated their due process rights under brady when it failed to disclose that,during the trial,cooperating witness john brotherton had been writing a book about his role in the edwards case.the edwardses asserted that brotherton,a vice president for the players casino company who testified pursuant to a grant of immunity,was a crucial witness in the government players scheme case because he and richard shetler,an edwards family friend and paid consultant for players,were the only two witnesses to testify to extortion connected with the players casino.
the edwardses argued that the government failure to disclose that brotherton was writing a book deprived them of impeachment evidence concerning brotherton purported financial stake in the outcome of the trial.moreover,the edwardses contended that the contents of the book revealed further exculpatory evidence that the government had failed to disclose in violation of brady,including the existence of tape recordings obtained from a wiretap of an undercover informant.
c the district court ruling 
the district court denied appellants motions and their request for an evidentiary hearing on november.the court found that there was no evidence that the government had concealed the extent of guidry financial immunity in violation of appellants due process rights because guidry testified extensively on about the terms of his plea agreement,including the limitations on his federal forfeiture,his understanding of his immunity deal with the state of louisiana,and his plea agreement relationship to the pending collateral civil suits appellants were able to impeach guidry effectively on the financial liability limitation contained in his written plea agreement,and even if the government had disclosed its purported belief that the state lawsuit against guidry was barred because of his financial immunity deal,such information would have been at best,cumulative,and at worst,not material and appellants argument that the plea agreement contained an undisclosed and unwritten clause which barred the state from seeking monetary damages from guidry is speculative and unsupported by the evidence.ruling on petitioner motion to vacate,set aside,or correct sentence,at,hereinafter dist.ruling.because the court found no evidence of an undisclosed financial immunity deal,it also rejected appellants contention that guidry gave false testimony at trial that the government failed to correct.
likewise,the district court rejected appellants assertion that the government failure to disclose john brotherton book deal violated appellants due process rights under brady.because brady requires that materiality be determined in light of all evidence at trial,the court examined the totality of the evidence supporting the convictions for the players scheme.id.at.the court found that ample evidence besides brotherton testimony supported the convictions,and i t is rank speculation to conclude that,compared with this incriminating evidence,any marginally more impeaching evidence concerning brotherton could have created in the jurors minds reasonable doubt as to the appellants guilt.id.at.
appellants filed notices of appeal of the district court ruling and motions for a certificate of appealability coa on november.
appellants motions to amend their motions 
appellants did not challenge the constitutionality of their sentences in the motions that they filed on february.on june,the united states supreme court handed down blakely washington,d,striking down a state sentencing guideline scheme that allowed sentence enhancements based on facts found by a judge and not a jury.anticipating that the supreme court might extend blakely to the federal sentencing guidelines,appellants filed motions for leave to amend their motions on july,outside of the,limitation period.in a ruling dated september,the district court denied appellants motions based solely on united states pineiro,cir,vacated,d,which held that blakely did not invalidate the federal sentencing guidelines.appellants filed notices of appeal and motions for a coa on november.shortly thereafter,on january,the supreme court handed down booker,d,which applied blakely to hold the mandatory application of the federal sentencing guidelines unconstitutional.
certificate of appealability 
on december,the district court granted each appellant a coa pursuant to c b,finding that appellants had demonstrated a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right on the following issues 
whether the appellants due process rights were violated by the government failure to disclose a promise to cooperating witness robert guidry that he would not be liable in money damages to the state of louisiana.
whether the appellants due process rights were violated by the government failure to correct robert guidry trial testimony that he faced financial exposure from the lawsuits pending against him and from the denial of an evidentiary hearing on this issue.
whether the appellants due process rights were violated by the government failure to disclose exculpatory,impeachment material relating to cooperating witness john brotherton and from the denial of an evidentiary hearing on this issue.
whether the appellants should be permitted to raise a constitutional claim pursuant to blakely washington.
appellants now request that this court reverse the district court judgment and vacate their convictions,or,in the alternative,remand for an evidentiary hearing.

the alleged brady violations 
under brady,the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment,irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.at.the supreme court subsequently extended this principle to impeachment evidence,holding that w hen the reliability of a given witness may well be determinative of guilt or innocence,nondisclosure of evidence affecting credibility falls within this general rule.giglio united states,d quoting napue,at.see also united states bagley,d rejecting any distinction between exculpatory and impeachment evidence for brady purposes.to establish a brady violation,appellants must prove that the prosecution suppressed evidence the evidence was favorable to the defendant because it was either exculpatory or impeaching and the evidence was material.united states sipe,cir see also strickler greene,d kyles whitley,d.
a robert guidry plea agreement 
appellants allege that the government violated brady with regard to cooperating witness robert guidry because in addition to a grant of immunity from state prosecution,guidry plea deal included a secret,unwritten promise of immunity from any
