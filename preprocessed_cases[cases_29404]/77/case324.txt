schuler purchased mailing lists for use in mass mailings to individuals identified as having bad credit.she also bought advertising space in national,weekly periodicals such as the national enquirer,star,and the weekly world news.her advertisements,by mail and publication,guaranteed that persons responding would receive unsecured mastercard or visa credit cards.customers were instructed to send schuler via one of her companies a sum of mail.mailing addresses and forwarding services were used to collect the responses generated by her solicitations,which were then forwarded to her home in wisconsin.some of the advertisements contained the following guarantee i understand that if i not approved by the card issuing bank,i will receive a full refund.

but i also had time to mull things over and think a little more clearly.i had some pretty bad feelings about the misleading mailings,knowing full well that people had expectations that were being met.i feel much better about the cs credit services letter,and once that cleared up and a disclaimer has been added to the vegas coupon i will truly be good to go.this was a necessary step,i guess,to clean up my act.luckily,the show will go on

after a jury trial,schuler was convicted of counts of mail fraud under.individuals testified at her trial that they had received neither unsecured credit cards nor refunds.schuler was also convicted of eleven counts of money laundering under a a i.she was sentenced to sixty months imprisonment followed by two years supervised release.schuler appeals her conviction and sentence.she claims that the district court erred in sustaining her mail fraud conviction,as a matter of law,failing to strike surplusage from her indictment,admitting character and summary evidence,declining to give her proposed jury instructions,and that cumulative error in her trial deprived her of due process.
in determining whether the evidence presented at trial is sufficient to support a jury verdict,we review the record de novo and ask only whether,taking the direct and circumstantial,together with the reasonable inferences to be drawn the light most favorable to the government,a reasonable jury could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.united states voss,cir quotation omitted.
