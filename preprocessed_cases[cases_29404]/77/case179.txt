the defendants,peter vasilakos and debbie lent,appeal their convictions for mail fraud,money laundering,and conspiracy to commit mail fraud.the district court sentenced vasilakos to months imprisonment and lent to months.on appeal,the defendants offer a host of arguments for overturning their convictions that prior civil proceedings in which the defendants prevailed should have precluded their criminal prosecution that the district court,in violation of the sixth amendment,permitted the government to use redacted excerpts of codefendants civil trial testimony that the district court abused its discretion with respect to various evidentiary rulings that precluded the defendants from presenting a good faith defense that the district court bail restrictions impermissibly infringed on the defendants ability to contact witnesses and present a defense that the district court erred by allowing a united states postal inspector to testify about the ownership and use of the post office boxes utilized in the defendants scheme that the district court failed to issue a proper instruction limiting the testimony of the government summary witness and that the sentences imposed by the district court are unreasonable.after careful consideration of each of these arguments of error,we conclude,for reasons we shall discuss,that vasilakos and lent convictions and sentences should be affirmed.
a federal grand jury in the southern district of ohio indicted peter vasilakos and debbie lent on eight counts of mail fraud,in violation of and,one count of conspiring to commit mail fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit tax fraud,both in violation of,and one count of conspiring to launder money,in violation of h.the government claims that from to,vasilakos and lent defrauded the combined insurance company of america cica,several cica employees,and the federal government of a substantial,but indeterminate,amount of money.the government indicted four other baker,terence magrey,rocky edwards,and jodi part of the conspiracy.all of the indictees except baker were tried before the same jury.this appeal concerns only vasilakos and lent,who were convicted on all counts and sentenced to prison.
the convictions arise from a scheme concocted by vasilakos and lent to steal money from their employer,cica.the defendants worked as district managers for cica and supervised numerous field agents who conducted sales of disability indemnity insurance policies.cica compensated sales agents solely by commission for sales that the district managers called in weekly to the regional office.district managers earned approximately four percent commission on total sales for all agents under their supervision and were eligible for additional compensation when a customer renewed an existing policy.district managers were also eligible for bonuses based on total sales and the rate of policy renewals.finally,district managers could earn additional bonuses based on man weeks,or weeks in which sales agents earned more than in commissions.
the government contends that vasilakos and lent fraudulently led cica to believe that many former agents who in fact had left the company,were still employed and selling policies for cica.that misrepresentation generated man week bonuses and additional compensation for the district managers.vasilakos instructed some of his working agents to sign blank sales reports,on which baker,at vasilakos direction,filled in data reporting fictional insurance policy sales to fictional purchasers.these fictional sales also generated commission checks and other compensation payable to the.in order to get possession of these checks,lent contacted cica,ostensibly on behalf of the agents,to change the agents mailing addresses to post office boxes controlled by vasilakos,lent,and baker.the conspirators then forged the agents signatures on the diverted checks.the fictional sales and resulting commission payments caused cica to erroneously report to the internal revenue service,commission payments to the.
the defendants concealed their scheme by depositing cica checks and large amounts of cash into multiple bank accounts.the government argued that vasilakos also maintained bank accounts in other persons names in order to show a small balance in his own account and to prevent the irs from collecting on a tax lien filed against him.
vasilakos and lent first argue that the district court erred by refusing to give preclusive effect to earlier civil court proceedings in which the defendants prevailed in a civil suit brought against the defendants by cica to recover fraudulently obtained sums.we review the district court application of the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel de novo.knox county educ.ass knox county bd.of,cir.
in montana united states,the supreme court stated that under the res judicata doctrine,a final judgment on the merits bars further claims by parties or their privies based on the same cause of action,d.res judicata precludes future claims when there is a final decision on the merits by a court of competent jurisdiction a subsequent action between the same parties or their privies an issue in the subsequent action which was litigated or should have been litigated in the prior action and an identity of the causes of action.saylor united states,cir quoting becherer merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir en banc.
collateral estoppel precludes relitigation of issues between parties or their privies previously determined by a court of competent jurisdiction.montana,at.
judgments are preclusive only as to parties and their privies.id.privity is limited to a successor in interest to the party,one who controlled the earlier action,or one whose interests were adequately represented.sanders confectionery,heller,cir.
because the united states was not a party to the civil litigation between the defendants and cica and is not in privity with the insurance company,neither res judicata nor collateral estoppel is available to vasilakos or lent.the government is not a successor in interest to cica and its interest in prosecuting the defendants for federal crimes was not adequately represented by cica in the civil case.manifestly,the government had no control over cica litigation strategy.becherer,at.
next,vasilakos and lent argue that the district court erred by admitting in evidence,over the defendants objection,deposition statements made by their codefendants in the prior civil proceedings between cica and the defendants.when the deposition statements were introduced in this case,the court instructed jurors to consider each deposition statement as evidence only against the specific defendant who made the statement.the government redacted names of other defendants before proffering the statements.vasilakos and lent contend,however,that the statements constituted inadmissible hearsay and that their admission violated their rights under the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment.
the supreme court has instructed us to review all evidentiary rulings,even those under the federal rules of evidence,for abuse of discretion.joiner,d.reversal is appropriate only if the abuse was not harmless error.error is harmless if we are satisfied that the outcome of a trial was not affected by evidentiary error.united states johnson,cir.quoting mccombs meijer,cir,cert.denied,d.confrontation clause claims are questions of law that are reviewed de novo.johnson,at.
the defendants argue that the district court abused its discretion by refusing to exclude the codefendants deposition statements as inadmissible hearsay.this contention is without merit.federal rule of evidence d a establishes that a statement is not hearsay if it is offered against a party and is the party own statement.the deposition excerpts are not hearsay because each statement was offered and received only against the party who made it.
the defendants also claim that the deposition statements of their codefendants,even though admitted only against the at the joint trial,violated the defendants confrontation clause rights.the sixth amendment guarantees that i n all criminal prosecutions,the accused shall enjoy the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him.const.amend.vi emphasis added.the principal evil the confrontation right seeks to eliminate is the use of ex parte examinations as evidence against the accused.crawford washington,d.
ordinarily when,at a joint trial,a codefendant prior statement,testimonial or otherwise,is introduced only against the,and not against the complaining codefendant,the latter has suffered no violation of his sixth amendment confrontation clause rights.richardson marsh,d.however,the supreme court has recognized an exception to this general rule for a codefendant statement that facially incriminates the defendant.bruton united states,d.the bruton court held that a jury instruction limiting the jury use of the statement to the did not preclude the risk that a jury,despite the limiting instruction,would consider the codefendant statement,which also implicated the defendant,as evidence of the defendant guilt.id.
two supreme court decisions define the contours of bruton.in richardson,the court determined that the government did not violate the sixth amendment by introducing a redacted confession by a codefendant that removed all references to the defendant.at.the redacted confession did not indicate that any person other than the was involved in the crime it became incriminating only when linked with evidence introduced later at trial.id.at.in gray maryland,d,the court held that a defendant sixth amendment rights were violated by the introduction of a confession in which the defendant name had been removed and replaced with a blank space.when the government read the confession at trial,the government witness stated the word deleted whenever a blank space appeared in place of the defendant gray name.id.at.although the gray court reaffirmed richardson holding that bruton does not preclude statements that incriminate only inferentially,the court determined that redactions which replace a defendant name with an obvious blank or the word deleted call jurors attention specifically to the removed name.gray,at.
since gray,the sixth circuit has not announced precisely what type of redactions are acceptable under bruton.several other circuits have held that the government may avoid a bruton violation by replacing a defendant name with a neutral term.for example,the fourth,eighth,and tenth circuits permit prosecutors to read a codefendant confession after replacing a defendant name with another person or another individual.see united states logan,cir united states,cir united states akinkoye,cir.
we think the rule followed by the fourth,eighth,and tenth circuits that permits the introduction of a,statement,in a joint trial,where the defendant name is redacted and a neutral term is substituted,avoids any sixth amendment or bruton violation.in this case,before reading any of the deposition statements at trial,the government replaced each reference to vasilakos and lent with a neutral word,such as the person or another person.an example from the record is illustrative 
do you have any idea why the person did cash their sic own checks 
q.who made deposits into that account 
another person has.
another person has 
emphasis added.
because the government was prosecuting multiple defendants for participation in an alleged conspiracy to defraud cica,the deposition statements did not ineluctably implicate vasilakos or lent.the effect of the redaction methodology used in this case is distinguishable from the circumstances in gray,in which the supreme court noted that the inferences at issue referred directly to someone,often obviously the defendant,and which involve inferences that a jury ordinarily could make immediately,even were the confession the very first item introduced at trial.at.here,the government,who alleged a multifaceted conspiracy in which several individuals engaged in activities,substituted names in the deposition statements with the neutral noun person or phrase another person.reading the redacted depositions into evidence at the defendants trial did not offend the confrontation clause.
vasilakos and lent next argue that the district court erred by refusing to permit the defendants to introduce evidence relating to cica internal operating policies and the actions of various cica officials,in order to establish a good faith defense.the defendants claim that the district court denied them an opportunity to present their theory of defense by refusing to allow them to present evidence that other cica managers operated similar schemes refusing to give the jury an instruction that the defendants acted in good faith refusing,initially,to permit evidence of cica internal operating policies and excluding certain statements by cica employees and the defendants as inadmissible hearsay.the defendants argue that,but for these errors,they could have convinced the jury that they were acting in good faith,pursuant to the written and unwritten cica policies and procedures.
as we have said,the supreme court has instructed us to review trial court violations of the federal rules of evidence for abuse of discretion,at.in a strained but respectful effort to explain the logic of abuse of discretion as a standard of review of all evidentiary rulings,how it is that a trial court can have discretion whether to apply a federal federal rules of to its terms we have explained that i n reviewing a trial court evidentiary determinations,this court reviews de novo the court conclusions of law and reviews for clear error the court factual determinations that underpin its legal conclusions.united states ganier,cir citation omitted.while this recent statement of our standard of review of evidentiary rulings makes no mention of abuse of discretion,that apparent contradiction is reconciled by our even earlier precedentially binding pronouncement that it is an abuse of discretion to make errors of law.id.subsequent internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
federal rule of evidence states that e vidence which is not relevant is not admissible.
vasilakos and lent argue that the proffered evidence that cica internal operating policies inferentially condoned their practices is relevant because of its tendency to show that they lacked the requisite mens rea to commit fraud.to be guilty of mail or wire fraud,a defendant must act with specific intent to defraud.united states daniel,cir.however,fraud on a corporation is not mitigated simply because corporate officers with broad agency powers authorized and participated in the scheme.united states gullett,cir.the gullett court noted that,despite participation by corporate officers,the defendants defrauded the corporation as an entity and its owners,the shareholders.id.because the gullett defendants knew the corporation would rely upon false invoices to make payments,the basic elements of and detrimental reliance were present.id.
aside from the manifest illogic of the argument that because others did it too,and besides,the employer policies condoned what we did,so we therefore had no specific intent to defraud,we think it is obvious that the defendants proffered evidence of similar fraud by other managers was not relevant not material,actually because the evidence had no tendency to show that it was less probable that the defendants acted with intent to defraud,than if the evidence had been admitted.see.simply stated,evidence of fraudulent acts by other employees including policy making executives,would have no tendency to show that the defendants acts were innocent.we think the trial court correctly applied.
the defendants proffered evidence that they acted in accordance with company policies was at first rejected by the trial court,but on later consideration,it was admitted.the defendants now argue that the initial order rejecting the evidence precluded effective of several government witnesses.we disagree.the defendants could have recalled these witnesses and examined them about the company internal operating policies during presentation of their case in chief.they made no request to do so and,therefore,we are not persuaded that they suffered any prejudice from the delay in presenting company policy evidence.
