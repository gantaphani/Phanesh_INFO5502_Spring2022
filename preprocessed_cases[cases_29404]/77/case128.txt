a jury convicted william roosevelt cloud of various offenses stemming from an extensive mortgage fraud conspiracy.on appeal,cloud challenges the district court evidentiary rulings,loss calculation,and order directing him to reimburse his attorneys fees.we affirm the district court judgment on the first two issues,but vacate the court reimbursement order.cloud also argues that his money laundering convictions must be reversed under united states santos,d,and thus,that the district court erred in rejecting his motion for judgment of acquittal on this ground.applying santos,as interpreted by united states halstead,cir,to the facts underlying cloud substantive money laundering convictions,we agree and therefore reverse those convictions.
following his indictment in the western district of north carolina,cloud was convicted of one count of mortgage fraud conspiracy,in violation of three counts of mail fraud,in violation of thirteen counts of bank fraud,in violation of one count of money laundering conspiracy,in violation of h and six counts of money laundering,in violation of a.the convictions stemmed from cloud leadership of a conspiracy from until the scheme involved multiple coconspirators,at least fourteen of whom including two mortgage brokers,two attorneys,an appraiser,a bank insider,and cloud wife pleaded guilty to various offenses.
the government alleged that cloud recruited,church members,and members of the filipino american community with good credit to purchase various properties.he offered the buyers an opportunity to become real estate investors with no money down,earning cash upon buying a home.to lull the buyers,cloud offered to make ownership of the properties easy,assisting with rent or mortgage payments,taking care of repairs to the properties,and ensuring that rental income would cover the mortgage payments.cloud claimed that he would eventually sell the properties,splitting the profit with the buyers.
unbeknownst to the buyers,cloud bought the properties shortly before the buyers,and then flipped the property to the buyer,making money off each transaction.cloud arranged for the buyers to purchase multiple properties within a short time frame,to prevent the earlier sales from appearing on their credit reports.once a buyer purchased his or her last home,cloud ceased contact with the buyer.although cloud received some rental income from tenants,the money was not used to pay the mortgages.ultimately,many of the homes went into foreclosure.
to perpetrate the scheme,cloud falsified the loan applications.although the buyers supplied accurate information,the loan applications misrepresented the buyers income,falsely indicated that the buyers were purchasing the property as a residence,and made it appear as though the buyers had sufficient funds to cover the down payment.because the buyers trusted cloud,they often signed the documents without reviewing them.in some instances,cloud forged the buyers signatures on the applications.further,because cloud offered the buyers an opportunity to invest in real estate with no money down,he provided cashier checks to closing attorneys,which falsely indicated that the buyers were providing the down payment.the attorneys,in turn,falsely represented on the hud settlement statements that the buyers were providing the down payment.cloud then signed the hud forms containing the false information.cloud also paid thousands of dollars in kickbacks to buyers,at least one mortgage broker,and the recruiters responsible for finding the buyers.these payments were not disclosed on the hud forms.
the government called numerous witnesses at trial to support its theory of the fraud.for example,joseph goines testified that cloud paid him a commission between and per head to obtain buyers with good credit.as a pitch to the buyers,cloud instructed goines to tell them that cloud would pay for the use of their credit.robert moore,a buyer,testified in part that he was not aware that the property he bought for was purchased by cloud for less than one month prior.moore also testified that cloud typically paid him between and at closing,and that all ten properties he purchased ultimately went into foreclosure.kim dauria,a loan officer,testified that cloud brought buyers to her,that she was involved in the mortgage fraud conspiracy,and that cloud paid her.another government witness,daniel greene,testified that as a mortgage broker,he conducted fraudulent real estate transactions with cloud,that cloud was responsible for the down payments,and that his transactions with cloud involved false lease agreements.
at trial,cloud insisted that he was a neophyte real estate investor who had to rely on professionals criminals,as it turned out to structure his transactions,but that he believed his buyers would make money by renting out their properties and benefitting from rising housing prices.appellant br.
following the close of the government case and again before the case was submitted to the jury,cloud moved for a judgment of acquittal under federal rule of criminal procedure.the district court denied both motions.although the jury acquitted cloud on one money laundering count,it convicted him on all others.
cloud later moved for a judgment of acquittal on his money laundering convictions based on united states santos,d,in which the supreme court affirmed the vacatur of the defendants money laundering convictions after concluding that the offenses merged with the defendants convictions for operating an illegal gambling business.the district court denied cloud motion,concluding that united states howard,app x cir unpublished,limited santos to offenses.
prior to sentencing,the probation officer prepared a presentence report psr,calculating cloud total offense level as and his criminal history category as i,resulting in an advisory guidelines range of months to life imprisonment.the offense level calculation was based on cloud estimated intended loss to lenders of million as well as approximately million in collateral loss to the surrounding communities.at sentencing,the court adopted the intended loss figure,but limited cloud collateral loss to million,reducing the total loss amount to just over million.this reduction decreased cloud offense level to,and his guidelines range to months.the court sentenced cloud to months imprisonment.cloud timely appealed.
on appeal,cloud first challenges the admission of testimony and hearsay statements at trial.second,he argues that the district court wrongly rejected his rule motions as to his money laundering convictions,arguing that the convictions can not stand under santos and our subsequent decision in united states halstead,cir,and that there was insufficient evidence to support these convictions.third,cloud contends that the district court loss calculation was clearly erroneous.finally,he asserts that the district court erred in ordering him to reimburse the united states for the services of his attorneys.we address these arguments in turn.
cloud challenges the district court admission of testimony from buyers and hearsay statements from tenants.we review evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion and will only overturn an evidentiary ruling that is arbitrary and irrational.united states cole,cir quoting united states blake,cir.under federal rule of criminal procedure a,evidentiary rulings are subject to harmless error review.i n order to find a district court error harmless,we need only be able to say with fair assurance,after pondering all that happened without stripping the erroneous action from the whole,that the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error.united states johnson,cir quoting united states brooks,cir.
cloud first argues that testimony from five buyers was irrelevant and highly prejudicial.the buyers testified that as a result of their dealings with cloud,they suffered liens on their property,were unable to borrow money,were sued,suffered bad credit,or faced foreclosure.cloud assigns particular prejudice to the testimony of rodney thompson,who testified that all six properties he purchased as part of cloud scheme went into foreclosure and that he was forced to file for bankruptcy.in response to government questioning about his first purchase,thompson responded that he bought a home next to his parents with the idea when they got older,he could take care of them.thereafter,thompson began to cry.
we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the testimony.first,testimony regarding the impact of the offenses on the victims met the low bar of relevancy,given cloud defense that the buyers were guilty of bank fraud.in his opening statement to the jury,cloud identified the buyers associated with the bank fraud charges and argued that t hese people are not victims t hey are the ones that committed the bank fraud.id.in united states copple,cir,the third circuit concluded that testimony was relevant to show intent to defraud in a mail fraud prosecution where the defendant claimed that he had simply made a bad business decision,explaining that p roof that someone was victimized by the fraud is treated as some evidence of the schemer intent.so too here.we further find that the probative value of the victims testimony was not substantially outweighed by a danger of unfair prejudice.
even assuming that the court erred in admitting this testimony,we find any error to be harmless.cloud was convicted following a lengthy trial that included testimony from multiple witnesses regarding various elements of cloud conspiracy.given the overwhelming evidence against cloud,we are satisfied with fair assurance that the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error,johnson,at quoting brooks,at.
cloud next argues that the district court erred in admitting hearsay testimony from buyers detailing conversations between cloud and several tenants.in one instance,reginald foster,a buyer,testified that a tenant told foster that cloud described foster an african american as a racist caucasian who did not want to deal with his african american tenants.in another,rodney thompson testified that a tenant told him that cloud kept tenants in the fog about who owned the properties and that cloud indicated that he was the landlord.
cloud asserts that the admission of this testimony can not be dismissed as harmless because it buttressed the government theory that cloud was dishonest with tenants to disguise his scheme and portrayed cloud as an immoral person who would falsely accuse an african american of racism.appellant br.cloud concerns as to foster testimony,however,were specifically addressed by the district court in its instructions following foster testimony,the court instructed the jury that the statement obviously was not being admitted for what we call the truth of the matter asserted,and that it should not inject race into the trial,but should be used,if the jury so chose,to weigh whether cloud would have made this statement to help in a cover up because he did want the tenants to talk to foster.cloud challenged the last part of the instruction and in response,the court further instructed the jury that its instruction was in no way an expression of the court view of the guilt or innocence of cloud.id.
in any event,we conclude that any error in admitting the tenants hearsay statements was harmless.looking to the weight of the evidence against cloud,and the comparative insignificance of the tenants statements,we again find with fair assurance that the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error,johnson,at quoting brooks,at.
cloud also contends that the district court erred in denying his rule motions.cloud argues that the government failed to prove counts of the indictment,which charged cloud with money laundering under a and money laundering conspiracy under h by failing to show that the transactions involved the profits of unlawful activity as required by santos,and offering insufficient evidence.we review the denial of a rule motion for judgment of acquittal de novo,sustaining a guilty verdict that,when viewed in the light most favorable to the government,is supported by substantial evidence.united states alerre,cir.
we find that cloud money laundering convictions on counts suffer from a merger problem,as they charge the payment of the essential expenses of the fraud.halstead,at quoting santos,at stevens,concurring.because we reverse these convictions under santos and halstead,we do not address cloud additional argument that counts are not supported by sufficient evidence.see united states moreland,cir reversing defendant convictions under a a i based on santos,and declining to address defendant additional sufficiency of the evidence challenge.as to cloud money laundering conspiracy conviction on count,however,we affirm,finding no merger problem and sufficient evidence.
cloud was convicted of promotional money laundering under a and of money laundering conspiracy under h.to prove promotional money laundering,the government was required to show that cloud conducted or attempted to conduct a financial transaction involving the proceeds of a specified unlawful activity knowing that the property involved proceeds of an unlawful activity and intending to promote the carrying on of the specified unlawful activity.see united states singh,cir.
in santos,the supreme court considered whether the term proceeds which was not then defined in the federal money laundering statute means receipts or profits.at plurality opinion.santos was convicted of operating an illegal gambling business and of laundering the proceeds of that business.santos runners collected bets from gamblers,retaining a percentage as a commission and delivering the rest to santos collectors.the collectors delivered the money to santos,who used it to pay the salaries of the collectors and to pay the winners.the district court vacated santos money laundering convictions under a a i and h,finding that the proceeds admittedly used by santos to pay winners and couriers could only have been gross proceeds,rather than net proceeds.united states santos,d,aff,cir.
the supreme court affirmed in a decision.although yielding a fractured opinion,the judgment of the court was driven by a concern regarding a merger problem.santos,at plurality opinion.as justice scalia,writing for the plurality,explained,if proceeds meant gross receipts,nearly every violation of the statute would also be a violation of the statute,because paying a winning bettor is a transaction involving receipts that the defendant intends to promote the carrying on of the lottery.id.since few lotteries,if any,will not pay their winners,the statute criminalizing illegal lotteries,would merge with the statute.id.at.looking beyond illegal gambling,justice scalia added the following 
for a host of predicate crimes,merger would depend on the manner and timing of payment for the expenses associated with the commission of the crime.few crimes are entirely free of cost,and costs are not always paid in advance.anyone who pays for the costs of a crime with its proceeds for example,the felon who uses the stolen money to pay for the rented getaway car would violate the statute.and any crime with multiple participants would become money laundering when the initial recipient of the wealth gives his confederates their shares.generally speaking,any specified unlawful activity,an episode of which includes transactions which are not elements of the offense and in which a participant passes receipts on to someone else,would merge with money laundering.
id.at footnote omitted.
justice stevens,writing separately and concurring in the judgment only,agreed,finding that a llowing the government to treat the mere payment of the expense of operating an illegal gambling business as a separate offense is in practical effect tantamount to double jeopardy.id.at stevens,concurring emphasis added.
in halstead,we considered the impact of santos in the context of a healthcare fraud scheme.before turning to the record evidence,we observed generally that w hen a fragmented court decides a case and no single rationale explaining the result enjoys the assent of five justices,the holding of the court may be viewed as that position taken by those members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds.halstead,at quoting marks united states,d.looking to santos,we concluded the following 
in its narrowest sense the five justices could be found to have held that the money laundering term proceeds means net profits when the proceeds are from an illegal gambling operation.they also agreed that the driving force for their holding was the merger problem resulting from the circumstances in that case a prosecution of defendants for transactions that supported convictions for both illegal gambling and money laundering.finally,they agreed that the merger problem had to be solved by defining the term proceeds in the money laundering statute to mean net profits,because if proceeds were defined to mean gross receipts,any crime involving costs would automatically become money laundering when the money received from the crime was used to pay expenses.
in evaluating how to apply this narrowest holding of santos,we determined that because justice stevens concurrence was limited to the facts of the case,it did not control cases where a merger problem arises in the context of money laundering and an illegal activity other than illegal gambling.id.at emphasis added.contemplating such other offenses,we explained that when the illegal activity includes money transactions to pay for the costs of the illegal activity,a merger problem can occur if the government uses those transactions also to prosecute the defendant for money laundering.id.and,we added that santos made clear that when a merger problem arises,a judicial solution must be found to eliminate its unfairness.id.when,however,the financial transactions of the predicate offense are different from the transactions prosecuted as money laundering,the merger problem does not even arise.id.at.turning to the facts in halstead,we found no merger problem.
halstead was convicted of healthcare fraud under and money laundering conspiracy under h.trained as a chiropractor,halstead led a scheme that fraudulently billed insurance companies for services for patients.as part of the scheme,halstead orchestrated the cash flow thus obtained from the insurance companies and healthcare providers.id.at.priority one a clinic opened at halstead direction billed for the services and received the insurance payments.upon receiving those payments,priority one transferred the monies to west virginia healthcare management,another company formed by a coconspirator.finally,west virginia healthcare management transferred the monies to checking accounts for halstead and a coconspirator.
finding no merger problem,we determined that halstead healthcare fraud was complete the moment that the healthcare provider paid money to priority one.id.at.the money paid was the proceeds of the healthcare fraud.id.when halstead later directed that the proceeds be transferred from priority one to west virginia medical corporation and then to himself,t hese transfers constituted the transactions of money laundering.id.we noted that these transactions were separate from the transactions constituting healthcare fraud,adding that while t he healthcare fraud charges were defined by the obtaining of money from the fraudulent billing of healthcare providers,the money laundering charge was defined by transferring the proceeds thereafter.id.at.accordingly,we concluded that the merger problem never arises in the circumstances of this case.id.at.
because cloud was not convicted of operating an illegal gambling business,we must determine whether a merger problem arises on the facts of this case.halstead,at noting that justice stevens opinion would require addressing that situation on a approach and leav ing further development of a solution to a future case that presents the problem.
the indictment charges cloud in count with conspiracy to commit money laundering and in counts with six substantive money laundering transactions.counts and stem from commissions cloud paid to joseph goines for recruiting buyers william lytle and reggie thompson.goines testified that he was paid between and for each investor he brought to cloud.count relates to a kickback cloud paid to lytle,which lytle testified was paid only after he signed the relevant documents.count charges cloud with repaying kenneth strong for money strong loaned to cloud for a previous closing.and counts and relate to payments cloud made to burt bartniski,another buyer.for example,count was based in part on that bartniski received approximately one week after bartniski purchased a property.bartniski also testified that cloud paid the first mortgage payment for a property he purchased,forming the basis of count.as bartniski testified,cloud informed him that he would help cover the mortgage.
we have stated that a n individual can not be convicted of money laundering for paying the essential expenses of operating the underlying crime.halstead,at quoting santos,at stevens,concurring.in this case,cloud money laundering convictions are based on payments to recruiters,buyers,and other coconspirators for the role each person played in the mortgage fraud scheme.cloud mortgage fraud depended on the help of others,and their help,in turn,depended on payments from cloud.such payments are no different than the felon who uses the stolen money to pay for the rented getaway car or the initial recipient of the wealth in any crime with multiple participants who gives his confederates their shares.santos,at plurality opinion.because cloud money laundering convictions on counts were based on paying the essential expenses of his underlying fraud,we find a merger problem.
in resisting this conclusion,the government seizes on our language in halstead that the underlying fraud was complete before the money laundering transactions occurred,and argues that cloud money laundering transactions were not for services rendered,but were designed to perpetuate the scheme.we are not persuaded.
first,the government emphasizes that in finding no merger in halstead,we noted that halstead commission of healthcare fraud was complete before he committed money laundering.appellee supp.br.quoting halstead,at.the government argument,however,does not reflect a complete reading of halstead and fails to account for important factual differences in the two cases.
initially,we note that halstead was a standard money laundering case,where the defendant transferred the fraudulent proceeds through various companies and into his own coffers cloud,conversely,was not charged with transferring the proceeds into his personal account,but with paying persons involved in the underlying fraud for services necessary to the operation of the fraud.this factual difference is important,as halstead makes clear that a merger problem can occur in these circumstances.see at a merger problem can occur when the illegal activity includes money transactions to pay for the costs of the illegal activity and the government uses those transactions also to prosecute the defendant for money laundering.in transferring the proceeds from the fraud into his own account,the defendant in halstead was not paying the essential expenses of the underlying fraud.
moreover,the distinction we made in halstead between fraudulently procuring funds from a healthcare provider and then funneling those funds from one corporate entity to another was in response to the defendant argument that both crimes were the product of a single conspiracy,implying that a conspiracy can involve only the commission of one crime.id.at.as we explained in halstead and reaffirm now,it is without doubt that a single conspiracy can encompass an agreement to commit multiple discrete offenses.in rejecting halstead argument to the contrary,we emphasized that the healthcare fraud was complete once the fraudulent funds were paid by the healthcare provider before the transactions underlying halstead money laundering convictions occurred.here,in reversing cloud money laundering convictions,we do not suggest that the crimes merge because they were part of one conspiracy.rather,we conclude that the specific money laundering transactions were the payment of the essential expenses of cloud underlying fraud,thus presenting a merger problem.
nonetheless,the government argues that cloud fraud obtaining money by the submission of false information to the victim precisely parallels the underlying fraud in halstead.appellee supp.br.this argument,however,focuses exclusively on the underlying fraud offense,ignoring the critical other half of our merger analysis the money laundering transactions.in halstead,the money laundering transactions were not based on the payment of the essential expenses of his fraud.it was for that reason that we noted there that the money laundering transactions were distinct from and subsequent to the transactions involved in the healthcare fraud itself.halstead,at emphasis added.in other words,halstead healthcare fraud did not require the cooperation,procured via payment,of coconspirators to succeed.cloud mortgage fraud conspiracy,on the other hand,could not have succeeded otherwise.
simply put,cloud lured his coconspirators with promises of payment.without these payments,there would have been no recruiters,no buyers,no coconspirators.and without the recruiters to provide the buyers,or the buyers to provide the good credit,or the coconspirators more generally,there would have been no mortgage fraud.applying santos as interpreted in halstead,we conclude that cloud substantive money laundering transactions were simply the essential expenses of his underlying fraud,thus presenting a merger problem.
we also reject the government second argument that cloud money laundering transactions were intended to perpetuate the scheme,not to pay for services rendered.on this point,the government urges that the transactions underlying cloud money laundering convictions were designed to lure buyers into engaging in additional fraudulent transactions and to perpetuate the scheme.appellee supp.br.the evidence,however,shows that cloud paid these recruiters,buyers,and coconspirators for services performed.and,as justice scalia noted in santos,costs are not always paid in advance.at plurality opinion.that these same individuals were often repeat players in the conspiracy does not negate the fact that the specific transactions alleged in counts of the indictment were for the past and essential expenses of cloud mortgage fraud conspiracy.
in rejecting the government arguments,we recognize the difficult problems cases like this one present.see santos,at alito,dissenting describing the difficulty of distinguishing between payments to participants who expect to receive a certain amount for their services whether or not the operation is profitable,and payments to those who expect to receive a certain percentage of the gross revenue perhaps even in addition to a salary.nonetheless,the similarity of the payments charged in counts to those the defendant in santos made to the runners,collectors,and winners in the illegal gambling operation compels us to find a merger problem.
we reach a different conclusion as to count,which alleges conspiracy to commit money laundering.unlike cloud substantive money laundering charges,the conspiracy charge was not tied to any specific payment to a recruiter,buyer,or coconspirator.moreover,there was evidence that cloud used the profits from his previous flips to finance additional purchases.specifically,attorney john lee testified that cloud left monies he acquired from previous closings in lee trust account,and later us ed those monies to buy the property underlying count.in utilizing monies from previous properties to finance future purchases,cloud was not paying the essential expenses of the underlying crime.thus,count does not present a merger problem 
nor do we believe that count fails for insufficient evidence.in reviewing the denial of a rule motion for judgment of acquittal,we must affirm a guilty verdict that,when viewed in the light most favorable to the government,is supported by substantial evidence.alerre,at quoting united states burgos,cir en banc.substantial evidence is defined as evidence that a reasonable finder of fact could accept as adequate and sufficient to support a conclusion of a defendant guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.id.quoting burgos,at.based on lee testimony,we are satisfied that the government met its burden of proof on count.
in reversing cloud substantive money laundering convictions,we again emphasize that conspiracies such as cloud can support multiple discrete convictions.see halstead,at.and,we do not suggest that the government may not successfully prosecute promotional money laundering in connection with similar conspiracies where the transactions are designed to promote the carrying on of specified unlawful activity,a a i.on the facts of this case,however,we are confronted with a merger problem that halstead directs us to correct.
in halstead,we concluded that santos made clear that when a merger problem arises,a judicial solution must be found to eliminate its unfairness.at.and we added that the solution dictated by santos for a merger problem in the context of an illegal gambling business is to define the proceeds as its net profits.id.in the context of another predicate crime,however,we left further development of a solution to a future case that presents the problem.id.that case is now before us,and we see no better course to correct the merger problem here than that adopted in santos,defining proceeds as profits.so defined,we reverse cloud substantive money laundering convictions on counts because they do not comport with the definition of proceeds announced in santos 
cloud also challenges the district court loss calculation.we review for clear error the district court factual determination of the amount of loss attributable to cloud,united states miller,cir,mindful that the court need only make a reasonable estimate of the loss,sentencing guidelines manual cmt.c.
the district court concluded that cloud was responsible for an intended loss equal to the entire loan amount on the properties,minus a proxy for the value of the house.the proxy was set by the price cloud paid for the properties prior to the flip.after subtracting the proxy from the value of the loan,the court arrived at an intended loss figure of approximately million.as to the collateral loss,the district court relied on expert testimony regarding the impact that foreclosed properties have on surrounding communities.the court,however,reduced the expert collateral figure originally encompassing properties within to meters of the foreclosed property based on the court conclusion that an impact over a half mile away was not reasonably foreseeable to cloud.reducing the collateral loss radius to to meters,the court found that cloud was responsible for over million in collateral loss.
on appeal,cloud argues that neither the intended nor collateral loss figures were tied to evidence of cloud intent.specifically,cloud asserts that the court overlooked evidence that cloud intended that the lenders would be repaid at least in part and that cloud did not intend any losses to the community.appellant br.
as to intended loss,cloud asserts that even the most reading of the evidence does not establish that cloud intended the lenders to lose the entire spread between his purchase and sale prices.id.in support,cloud argues that he could have intended this amount of loss only if he intended that the buyers would not make a single mortgage payment.according to cloud,evidence of his property management shows otherwise.
although the district court noted that cloud did do some property management,it clarified that this management was very minor and a lot of it was to make the property look more appropriate for closing.and,it concluded that the small amount of property management cloud did does not offset the fact that virtually the vast majority of the properties went into foreclosure.id.we find no clear error in the district court assessment of cloud property management as it influenced the intended loss calculation.
as to collateral loss,cloud faults the district court for overlooking that many of the properties were in foreclosure when cloud purchased them,and argues that the government failed to present evidence demonstrating why cloud should have foreseen tha
