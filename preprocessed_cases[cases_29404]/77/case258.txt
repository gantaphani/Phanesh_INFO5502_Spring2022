this appeal presents a question of first impression in this circuit,namely,whether federal courts may order restitution as a condition of supervised release for offenses set forth in title of the united states code the internal revenue code.having been subjected to such an order,appellant alma batson argues that the authority of the federal courts to order restitution is limited to restitution authorized or required by the victim and witness protection act vwpa and the mandatory victims restitution act mvra,neither of which includes restitution for violations of title.we reject batson contention and hold that the district court was authorized to order restitution for a violation of title as a condition of supervised release by b,which grants courts broad discretion to order restitution as a condition of probation,and d,which makes that grant applicable to supervised release.
we agree with batson,however,and the government concedes,that restitution so ordered must be limited to the offense of conviction when,as here,that offense does not involve an element of a scheme,conspiracy,or pattern of criminal activity.a.for this reason,we vacate the order of restitution and remand to the district court for the limited purpose of determining the proper amount of restitution due for the offense of conviction and for entry of an order accordingly.
background 
for three years batson operated a tax return preparation business that falsified tax returns in order to precipitate undeserved tax refunds.she was indicted on one count of conspiracy to commit tax fraud in violation of,six counts of willfully aiding and assisting in the preparation of fraudulent tax returns in violation of,and two counts of making a false statement to a government agent in violation of a.batson subsequently pled guilty to one count of aiding and assisting in the preparation of a single fraudulent tax return,the loss caused by that conduct apparently being somewhere between and.batson stipulated in her plea colloquy that the taxpayers for whom she had prepared returns collectively received at least in refunds to which they were not entitled 
the district court sentenced batson to months of imprisonment followed by months of supervised release as well as a fine of and a special assessment of.the court reserved decision on the issue of restitution,indicating that it would amend the order of judgment and commitment to include an order of restitution if necessary.meanwhile,the government reduced its request for restitution from to,an amount representing only those overpayments not amenable to collection from the payees by the internal revenue service.
about three months later,the district court issued an amended order of judgment and commitment identical to its predecessor in all respects except for the addition of a condition of supervised release requiring batson to pay restitution in the amount of batson timely appealed.we have jurisdiction pursuant to and.

discussion 
batson argues that the district court lacked the authority to order restitution as a condition of supervised release for an offense under title and,furthermore,that the court abused its discretion by ordering restitution in an amount greater than the loss caused by the conduct underlying the offense of conviction we consider each argument in turn.
the district court did not err in ordering restitution as a condition of supervised release 
the power to order restitution is not inherent in the federal courts it is conferred only by statute.see united states,cir.the vwpa and mvra are two such statutes.the vwpa,on the one hand,grants courts the discretion to order restitution for certain offenses set forth in titles,and of the united states code.the mvra,on the other hand,requires courts to order restitution to any person who suffered a physical injury or pecuniary loss as a direct or proximate result of the commission of a crime of violence,an offense against property under a or title,or an offense under,relating to the act of tampering with consumer products.id.
these two statutes,however,are not the only statutory sources of authority for orders of restitution by federal courts.the crucial statutes here are b the probation statute,which authorizes courts to order restitution as a condition of probation,and d,which extends that authority to supervised release.
a.the probation statute grants federal courts the authority to order restitution as a condition of probation for any criminal offense 
the starting point for our discussion is,as always,the plain language of the statute.see,at.regarding restitution,the probation statute authorizes courts to 
provide,as a further condition of a sentence of probation that the defendant make restitution to a victim of the offense under section but not subject to the limitation of section a or c a.
the quoted language and cited statutory sections make it perfectly clear that restitution imposed as a condition of probation is not subject to the limitations of the vwpa and mvra.the quoted passage requires a court ordering restitution as a condition of probation to adhere to section,which in turn requires adherence to the provisions of the vwpa and mvra,but without the limitation s of section a or c a.id.b.those limitations confine restitution under the vwpa and the mvra to particular offenses the express exemption from these limitations forecloses batson contention that the district court restitution authority is confined to the offenses covered by the vwpa and the mvra.the district court is therefore authorized by b to order restitution as a condition of probation to the victim of any criminal offense,including those in title,for which probation is properly imposed.
a consistent line of decisions supports this interpretation of.in united states nachtigal,per curiam,the supreme court recognized the authority of federal courts to attach a host of discretionary conditions to a probationary term pursuant to b,id.at,and,more specifically,to order restitution as a condition of probation for offenses set forth in the code of federal regulations,id.at under b,a court may require,among other things,that the defendant pay restitution as a condition of probation.in addition,several of our sister circuits have recognized,directly or tangentially,the authority of courts to order restitution as a condition of probation for offenses under title.see,united states may,cir united states nolen,cir united states lewis,cir united states bok,cir.although we have not directly held the same until today,we have recognized the authority of courts to order restitution as a condition of probation for offenses under title and,in the same opinion,affirmed an order imposing restitution as a condition of probation for an offense under title.united states gamma tech,cir.we have no doubt,therefore,of the authority of federal courts to order restitution as a condition of probation for offenses not set forth in the vwpa or the mvra.
b.the supervised release statute grants federal courts the authority to order restitution as a condition of supervised release for any criminal offense 
despite its expansive terms,the probation statute does not,on its own,grant courts the authority to order restitution as a condition of supervised release.that authority comes from d the supervised release statute,which extends the reach of the probation statute to supervised release.the version of the statute in effect at the time of batson indictment,which is essentially identical to the one currently in effect,provides in pertinent part that 
a court may order,as a further condition of supervised release any condition set forth as a discretionary condition of probation in section b through b and b through b,and any other condition it considers to be appropriate.
