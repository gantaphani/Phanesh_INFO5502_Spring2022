this criminal antitrust case stems from an international conspiracy between taiwanese and korean electronics manufacturers to fix prices for what is now ubiquitous technology,liquid crystal display panels known as tftlcds.after five years of secret meetings in taiwan,sales worldwide including in the united states,and millions of dollars in profits to the participating companies,the conspiracy ended when the fbi raided the offices of au optronics corporation of america auoa in houston,texas.
the defendants,au optronics auo,a taiwanese company,and auoa,auo retailer and wholly owned subsidiary collectively,the corporate defendants,and two executives from auo,hsuan bin chen,its president and chief operating officer,and hui hsiung,its executive vice president,were convicted of conspiracy to fix prices in violation of the sherman act after an jury trial their appeal raises complicated issues of first impression regarding the reach of the sherman act in a globalized economy.more specifically,they contend that the rule of reason applies to this conspiracy because of its foreign character.this proposition,pegged to foreign involvement,does not override the long standing rule that a horizontal conspiracy is subject to per se analysis under the antitrust laws.the defendants also urge that because the bulk of the panels were sold to third parties worldwide rather than for direct import into the united states,the nexus to united states commerce was insufficient under the sherman act as amended by the foreign trade antitrust improvements act of,ftaia.the defendants efforts to place their conduct beyond the reach of united states law and to escape culpability under the rubric of extraterritoriality are unavailing.to begin,the defendants waived their challenge that morrison national australia bank,displaced the supreme court landmark case regarding antitrust and extraterritoriality,hartford fire insurance california.in light of the substantial volume of goods sold to customers in the united states,the verdict may be sustained as import commerce falling within the sherman act thus,the nexus to united states commerce is a given and is not at issue.we need not reach the alternate theory under the ftaia relating to the domestic effects of the transactions.we affirm the convictions of all defendants and the sentence of auo,the only defendant to challenge the sentence.
factual and procedural background 
i.the conspiracy 
from october to january,representatives from six leading tft lcd manufacturers met in taiwan to set the target price and stabilize the price of tft lcds,which were sold in the united states principally to dell,hewlett packard hp,compaq,apple,and motorola for use in consumer electronics.this series of meetings,in which chen,hsiung,and other auo employees participated,came to be known as the crystal meetings.
following each crystal meeting,the participating companies produced crystal meeting reports.these reports provided pricing targets for tft lcd sales,which,in turn,were used by retail branches of the companies as price benchmarks for selling panels to wholesale customers.more specifically,auoa used the crystal meeting reports that auo provided to negotiate prices for the sale of tftlcds to united states customers including hp,compaq,viewsonic,dell,and apple.auoa employees and executives routinely traveled to the united states offices of dell,apple,and hp in texas and california to discuss pricing for tft lcds based on the targets coming out of the crystal meetings.chen and hsiung played the most critical role s in settling price disputes with executives at dell.
crystal meeting participants stood to make enormous profits from tft lcd sales to united states technology retailers.during the conspiracy period,the united states comprised approximately of the global market for personal computers incorporating tft lcds,and sales of panels by crystal meeting participants to the united states generated over million in revenue.sales to key united states companies,dell,compaq,and hp,were particularly important because they were bellwether they accepted a price increase,the entire market could also accept the price increase.
ii.proceedings in the district court 
the defendants were indicted in the northern district of california and charged with one count of conspiracy to fix prices for tft lcds in violation of the sherman act,et seq.the indictment also contained a sentencing allegation pursuant to the alternative fine statute,d,alleging that auo and auoa,along with their coconspirators,derived gross gains of at least.
the defendants twice moved to dismiss the indictment.the district court denied the first motion and rejected the arguments that i the rule of reason should apply pursuant to metro industries sammi,cir,and ii the government was required to plead and prove that the defendants acted with knowledge that their conduct would have anticompetitive effects on united states commerce.the district court held that the rule of reason did not apply because horizontal historically has been considered a per se violation of the sherman act,metro industries notwithstanding.
the district court also denied the second motion to dismiss the indictment and rejected the argument that the indictment was deficient for failing to allege an intended and substantial effect on united states commerce as required by the ftaia.according to the district court,b y its express terms,the ftaia is inapplicable to the import activity conducted by defendants.the district court also concluded that the ftaia did not bar prosecution of this conspiracy involving both foreign and domestic conduct.
at trial,the government presented evidence regarding the defendants extensive involvement in the crystal meetings and their sales of tft lcds to customers in the united states,including evidence that the defendants specifically targeted united states technology companies,principally,apple,compaq,and hp.government experts testified regarding the financial impact of those sales,specifically that the defendants derived hundreds of millions of dollars in profits from sales of tft lcds in the united states.
in closing arguments,defense counsel argued,among other things,that the government had not met its burden of proving venue by a preponderance of the evidence.on rebuttal,the government responded and directly addressed venue for the first time,explaining that venue was appropriate in the northern district of california because t he conspirators negotiation of panels with hp in cupertino were acts in furtherance of this conspiracy.defense counsel objected on the ground that the government representation misstated the evidence.the district court overruled the objection,relying on the government representation that this fact was in evidence.
during the jury instruction conference,as well as in pretrial proceedings,the reach of the sherman act to conduct occurring outside of the united states was a contentious subject.in describing the application of the sherman act,the district judge settled on the following charge 
the sherman act applies to conspiracies that occur entirely outside the united states if they have a substantial and intended effect in the united states.thus,to convict the defendants you must find beyond a reasonable doubt one or both of the following 
a that at least one member of the conspiracy took at least one action in furtherance of the conspiracy within the united states,or 
b that the conspiracy had a substantial and intended effect in the united states.
the jury found the defendants guilty of conspiracy to fix prices in violation of the sherman act.the jury also found that the combined gross gains derived from the conspiracy by all the participants in the conspiracy were million or more.
the defendants moved for a judgment of acquittal under federal rule of criminal procedure,and,in the alternative,for a new trial under federal rule of criminal procedure.they argued that i the government had failed to establish venue in the northern district of california,ii the rule of reason should have applied pursuant to metro industries,iii the defendants did not have notice of the unlawfulness of their conduct,iv the government had failed to prove an exception to the ftaia,and v the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to establish the million or more loss amount.auoa also claimed that the government did not prove that any agent of auoa knowingly and intentionally participated in the agreement.the district court denied the motions.
the district court sentenced hsiung and chen principally to a term of months imprisonment and a fine each.the district court sentenced the corporate defendants principally to a term of probation with conditions.the district court also imposed a million fine on auo.all of the defendants appeal their convictions,and auo appeals its sentence.
venue challenge 
as a preliminary matter,the defendants appeal on the basis of improper venue four issues are subsumed in the venue challenge i our standard of review,ii the proper standard for proof at trial,iii whether the government representation in closing arguments constituted prosecutorial misconduct,and iv whether the government proved venue.
although the defendants suggest otherwise,we review de novo whether venue was proper.united states liang,cir.the defendants argue that the standard of review should be whether a rational jury could not fail to conclude that the evidence establishes venue,because the district court in substance decided the issue of venue as a matter of law when it overruled the objection to the government representation in rebuttal that negotiations of tft lcds occurred in the northern district of california.see united states lukashov,cir.that a mouthful.nonetheless,the district court evidentiary ruling did not decide venue as a matter of law.see id.at,finding venue decided as a matter of law when the jury did not find venue proper,and the district court ruled that venue was proper on a rule motion.the proper standard of review remains de novo.
it is well established that a preponderance of the evidence is the proper standard of proof for venue.see,id.at.the defendants position that the standard is beyond a reasonable doubt has no support in the law.the district court appropriately instructed the jury on the standard of proof for venue.
next,we consider the government timing in addressing venue.the issue of venue was affirmatively highlighted for the first time in the defendants closing argument,and the government then responded in its rebuttal argument.the defendants argue that it was prosecutorial misconduct and reversible error for the prosecutor to represent in rebuttal that t he conspirator negotiation of panels with hp in cupertino were acts in furtherance of this conspiracy.neither the timing of this statement nor its substance constitutes misconduct.the defendants accuse the government of sandbagging by relying on theories of venue in rebuttal.however,the defense invited a response by raising the venue issue in the first place.a prosecutor may respond in rebuttal to an attack made in the defendant closing argument.see lawn united states.the substance of the government response was not new evidence or allegations instead,it was permissible argument based on the indictment allegations and the evidence produced at trial.the indictment alleged that the charged conspiracy was carried out,in part,in the northern district of california.trial testimony established that auo employees negotiated prices for tft lcds with hp in cupertino,california.see united states reyes,cir it is certainly within the bounds of fair advocacy for a prosecutor,like any lawyer,to ask the jury to draw inferences from the evidence that the prosecutor believes in good faith might be true.quoting united states blueford,cir.the jury also was instructed that closing arguments were not evidence.accordingly,the prosecutor did not commit misconduct by making these statements during closing argument,and the district court properly overruled the defendant objection.
finally,the evidence referenced by the government was sufficient to establish venue by a preponderance of the evidence.it is by now well settled that venue on a conspiracy charge is proper where any overt act committed in furtherance of the conspiracy occurred.united states gonzalez,cir.in addition to the hp negotiations,the government introduced evidence that auoa representatives negotiated sales of tft lcds with apple in the northern district of california and that auoa maintained offices in the northern district of california from which it conducted price negotiations by and phone.this evidence is sufficient to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy occurred in the northern district of california.thus,venue was proper.
ii.jury instruction challenge and extraterritoriality of the sherman act 
the supreme court seminal case on antitrust and foreign conduct is hartford fire,in which the court held that the sherman act applies to foreign conduct that was meant to produce and did in fact produce some substantial effect in the united states.at.the district court instructed the jury to this effect to convict the defendants you must find beyond a reasonable doubt one or both of the following a that at least one member of the conspiracy took at least one action in furtherance of the conspiracy within the united states,or b that the conspiracy had a substantial and intended effect in the united states.
before trial,the defendants moved to dismiss the indictment on the basis that it did not allege adequately the hartford fire substantial and intended effects test.at the jury instructions conference,the defendants urged the district court to give the hartford fire instruction,while also claiming that part a of the instruction was erroneous because it permitted the jury to convict on the basis of one domestic act.although the defendants contested part a,they all concurred that part b is a correct statement of the hartford fire requirements for establishing extraterritorial jurisdiction over foreign anticompetitive conduct,and should be given.
in an about face,in motions,the defendants rejected the principle of hartford fire and argued for the first time that the sherman act can not be used to prosecute foreign conduct because there is no affirmative indication that the sherman act applies extraterritorially.they cited to the supreme court decision in morrison,which addressed the extraterritorial reach of the federal securities laws.
at the time of the jury instructions conference,in february,morrison had been on the books for more than eighteen months.commentary about the case was extensive.see,nathan koppel ashby jones,securities ruling limits claims of fraud,wall,at hogan lovells,us supreme court rejects extraterritorial reach of securities exchange act antifraud provisions,june.the opinion was hardly breaking news.in light of the defendants request that the court give the hartford fire jury instruction and their untimely objection to the instruction in motions,we hold that the defendants waived the argument that morrison overruled hartford fire and that an extraterritoriality defense bars their convictions.
because the defendants were the ones who proposed the instruction in the first place,they can not now claim that giving the instruction was error.the defendants considered the effects of the instruction and intentionally relinquished the right to argue that the sherman act does not apply extraterritorially.see united states baldwin,cir where the defendant himself proposes the jury instruction he later challenges on appeal,we deny review under the invited error doctrine.to be sure,the defendants point out that they raised the extraterritoriality argument in motions.however,the complete reversal of their position after the verdict and in motions was so untimely as to amount to a waiver,with respect to the morrison objection to the jury instruction.see united states stapleton,cir internal quotation marks omitted.this case falls squarely within the invited error doctrine,which covers known rights that have been intentionally relinquished or abandoned.united states perez,cir en banc quoting united states olano,internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.this is not a case of forfeiture,where defense counsel simply failed to make a timely assertion of a claimed right.id.at.waiver occurred here because,despite having knowledge of the law,the defendants proposed or accepted what they now claim to be a flawed instruction.see id.that this election was knowing is underscored by the defendants challenge to part a of the instruction versus their support for part b,the hartford fire formulation.
as to part a of the instruction,the defendants objected on the basis that it would render hartford fire entirely nugatory,as,having proven the most minimal act in furtherance of a charged agreement,the government would never have to prove an intended and substantial effect on commerce.in support of this argument,the defendants rely on the following statement in hartford fire i t is well established by now that the sherman act applies to foreign conduct that was meant to produce and did in fact produce some substantial effect in the united states,at,and united states aluminum of america,cir.as to part b,the defendants agreed that the instruction was accurate.
we have held that the ftaia requirement that the defendants conduct had a direct,substantial,and reasonably foreseeable effect on domestic commerce displaced the intentionality requirement of hartford fire where the ftaia applies.see united states lsl biotechnologies,cir.to the extent that the prosecution was not subject to the ftaia,the jury instructions as a whole belie the assertion that the jury could have convicted on the basis of one,unintentional domestic act.see united states frega,cir in reviewing jury instructions,the relevant inquiry is whether the instructions as a whole are misleading or inadequate to guide the jury deliberation.immediately following the hartford fire instruction,the district court instructed the jury that it must find the following beyond a reasonable doubt 
t hat the members of the conspiracy engaged in one or both of the following activities 
a fixing the price of tft lcd panels targeted by the participants to be sold in the united states or for delivery to the united states or 
b fixing the price of tft lcd panels that were incorporated into finished products such as notebook computers,desktop computer monitors,and televisions,and that this conduct had a direct,substantial,and reasonably foreseeable effect on trade or commerce in those finished products sold in the united states or for delivery to the united states.in determining whether the conspiracy had such an effect,you may consider the total amount of trade or commerce in those finished products sold in the united states or for delivery to the united states however,the government proof need not quantify or value that effect.
the effect of foreign conduct in the united states was a central point of controversy throughout the trial.nonetheless,the conduct always was linked,as in the above instruction,to targeting for sale or delivery in the united states.part a of the instruction required the jury to find that the defendants fixed the prices of tft lcds targeted for sale or delivery in the united states.this targeting language subsumed intentionality.see oxford english dictionary ed defining targeted as d esignated or chosen as a target.there is no way that the defendants could have unintentionally designated or chosen the united states market as a target of the conspiracy.viewing the instructions as a whole,nothing misled the jury as to its task.the hartford fire jury instruction was neither a surprise nor was it improper.part a of the instruction passes legal muster,and the defendants solicited part 
iii.per se liability for horizontal price fixing 
having determined that the prosecution was not barred by an extraterritoriality defense,we address the appropriate standard for judging liability in this scheme.for over a century,courts have treated horizontal as a per se violation of the sherman act.see,united states socony vacuum oil,f or over forty years this court has consistently and without deviation adhered to the principle that agreements are unlawful per se under the sherman act and that no showing of competitive abuses or evils which those agreements were designed to eliminate or alleviate may be interposed as a defense.twice in recent years,the supreme court reiterated this principle.the directive in leegin creative leather,psks,is unequivocal a horizontal cartel among competing manufacturers or competing retailers that decreases output or reduces competition in order to increase price is,and ought to be,per se unlawful.and just last year,the chief justice emphasized that it is per se unlawful to fix prices under antitrust law.actavis,roberts,dissenting on other grounds.
consistent with supreme court precedent,the district court treated this case as governed by the per se rule.the defendants claim that the district court erred by not adopting the rule of reason as the benchmark and that the indictment,jury instructions,and proof were deficient under rule of reason analysis.we hold that the scheme as alleged and proven is subject to per se analysis under the sherman act.
according to the defendants,this is not a per se case because under metro industries,application of the per se rule is not appropriate where the conduct in question occurred in another country,at.this approach invites us to read our circuit precedent in metro industries as out of sync with the well established tradition of analyzing under the per se rule and recent supreme court precedent emphasizing that ought to be analyzed under the per se rule.we decline the invitation.although the language from metro industries may have created some ambiguity based on the unusual facts of that case,we do not read the case as controlling.in any event,the supreme court subsequent confirmation that courts should continue to treat horizontal as a per se violation of the sherman act laid to rest any uncertainty.see united states golden valley ass n,cir.
invoking the language in metro industries to suggest that cases involving foreign conduct always should be analyzed under the rule of reason is clearly irreconcilable with supreme court precedent.see id.internal quotations marks omitted.to begin,metro industries was not a pricefixing case rather,it involved a horizontal market division for stainless steamers by a group of korean companies.at.the korean holloware association the association established a design committee consisting of korean manufacturers,traders,patent attorneys,and government officials.id.at.the association prohibited trading companies from holding a patent to a design,unless it was held jointly with a manufacturing company.id.when metro industries,a manufacturer,experienced a disruption in stainless steamer supply from its trading counterpart,sammi corporation,the association blocked its attempts to partner with another trading company.id.at.based on that interference,metro industries brought suit against sammi and its american subsidiaries alleging,among other claims,violations of and of the sherman act.id.at see.the district court granted summary judgment in the defendants favor and denied metro industries for summary judgment on the claim that the korean design registration system under which sammi had the exclusive rights to manufacture a particular steamer design constituted a market division that was illegal per se under of the sherman act.metro,at.
we affirmed and held that because the market division at issue was not a classic horizontal market division agreement,the rule of reason applied.id.at emphasis added.we then went on to write that even if the registration system constituted a market division that would ordinarily be treated as a per se violation of the sherman act,the rule of reason applied because the allegedly unlawful conduct occurred in a foreign country.id.at.this broad statement,which was wholly superfluous,and unnecessary to the holding,has not been repeated in subsequent cases and appears to be limited to the unique facts of the association efforts centered solely in korea.not surprisingly,this statement also has been the subject of scholarly criticism.see,phillip areeda herbert hovenkamp,antitrust law ed.perhaps the court conclusion that restraints abroad always require rule of reason analysis would have been more qualified had the restraint before it belonged more clearly in the per se category without offsetting considerations of comity.stephen calkins,the antitrust year in review antitrust olympics,fall antitrust,surely a classic international cartel that substantially affects commerce ought to qualify for per se treatment.metro industries was a procedurally unusual case,in which the record from one unsuccessful proceeding was offered to support a second in which there was no evidence of actual injury to competition in the united states.courts in future cases should limit metro industries language to its facts.quoting metro,at.
unlike metro industries,this case centers on a classic horizontal scheme subject to the per se rule.see leegin creative,at.also unlike metro industries,in which there was no evidence of actual injury to competition in the united states,at,the voluminous evidence here documents substantial effects on the united states.the conduct here did not occur in a solely foreign bubble.although the agreement to fix prices occurred in taiwan,the sale of tft lcds occurred in large part in the united states.
in reiterating the applicability of the per se rule for horizontal,a result that supreme court precedent compels,we also join the reasoning of other circuits.see,united states nippon paper indus,cir upholding an indictment alleging a per se violation of the sherman act against a japanese fax paper manufacturer that entered into a conspiracy overseas for fax paper that was sold to companies in the united states at fixed prices.the district court was bound to apply the per se rule and appropriately rejected the rule of reason defense 
iv.the foreign trade antitrust improvements act 
the international implications of this case are not limited to the challenges to the jury instructions or the per se rule.the defendants also argue that the indictment and proof did not satisfy the requirements of the ftaia.the ftaia provides that the sherman act shall not apply to conduct involving trade or commerce other than import trade or import commerce with foreign nations unless such conduct has a direct,substantial,and reasonably foreseeable effect a on trade or commerce which is not trade or commerce with foreign nations.
although the statute is a web of words,it boils down to two principles.first,the sherman act applies to import trade or import commerce with foreign nations.id.put differently,the ftaia does not alter the sherman act coverage of import trade import trade is excluded from the ftaia altogether.second,under the ftaia,the sherman act does not apply to nonimport trade or commerce with foreign nations,unless the domestic effects exception is met.id.for the sherman act to apply to nonimport trade or commerce with foreign nations,the conduct at issue must have a direct,substantial,and reasonably foreseeable effect a on trade or commerce which is not trade or commerce with foreign nations id.
congress enacted the ftaia in in respon se to concerns regarding the scope of the broad jurisdictional language in the sherman act.in re dynamic random access memory dram antitrust,cir.as the supreme court explained,t he ftaia seeks to make clear to american exporters and to firms doing business abroad that the sherman act does not prevent them from entering into business arrangements say,arrangements,however anticompetitive,as long as those arrangements adversely affect only foreign markets.hoffmann la roche empagran,citing,at,cong.admin.news.empagran teaches that the ftaia removes from the reach of the sherman act export activities and other commercial activities taking place abroad,unless those activities adversely affect domestic commerce,imports to the united states,or exporting activities of one engaged in such activities within the united states.at.we now consider the multiple legal issues the ftaia challenge raises.
jurisdiction versus merits 
whether the ftaia affects the jurisdiction of the district court or if,on the other hand,it relates to the scope of coverage of the antitrust laws,is our first inquiry.minn chem,agrium,cir en banc.we start here because a court has a duty to assure itself of its own jurisdiction,regardless of whether jurisdiction is contested by the parties,peterson islamic republic of iran,cir,and the supreme court has emphasized the need to draw a careful line between true jurisdictional limitations and other types of rules,minn chem,at citing morrison,and henderson ex rel.henderson shinseki.we hold that the ftaia is not a jurisdiction limitation on the power of the federal courts but a component of the merits of a sherman act claim involving nonimport trade or commerce with foreign nations.
we have not definitively addressed this issue in the past.in lsl biotechnologies,at,we rejected the argument that foreign conduct having only a substantial effect on united states commerce satisfied the ftaia and held that the ftaia created a jurisdictional test requiring a direct,substantial,and reasonably foreseeable effect on domestic commerce.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.despite our use of the term jurisdictional,we did not analyze whether the ftaia provided a jurisdictional limitation on the power of the federal courts nor did we discuss our use of the term jurisdictional.seven years later,in in re dynamic random access memory dram antitrust litigation,we observed that i t is unclear,however,whether the ftaia is more appropriately viewed as withdrawing jurisdiction from the federal courts or as simply establishing a limited cause of action and decline d to resolve the question.at.
as a consequence of clarification by the supreme court,much has changed since lsl biotechnologies.the court has made a point of distinguishing between a true jurisdictional limitation and a merits determination,noting that this court have sometimes mischaracterized rules or elements of a cause of action as jurisdictional limitations,particularly when that characterization was not central to the case,and thus did not require close analysis.reed elsevier,muchnick.the court emphasized that its recent cases evince a marked desire to curtail jurisdictional rulings,which too easily can miss the critical difference s between true jurisdictional conditions and nonjurisdictional limitations on causes of action.id.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
as the court framed the issue in morrison,to ask what conduct b of the securities exchange act reaches is to ask what conduct b prohibits,which is a merits question.jurisdiction,by contrast,refers to a tribunal power to hear a case.at internal quotation marks omitted.the ftaia,like b of the securities exchange act,plainly remov es conduct from the sherman act reach.empagran,at.to the extent lsl biotechnologies signaled the contrary,intervening supreme court precedent clarifies that the issue of what conduct the ftaia prohibits is a merits question,not a jurisdictional one.see morrison,at.in concluding that the ftaia is not a jurisdictional limitation on the court power,we bring our precedent into line with the court admonition to bring some discipline to the use of the term jurisdictional.see henderson.at we have urged that a rule should not be referred to as jurisdictional unless it governs a court adjudicatory capacity,that is,its or personal jurisdiction.
other circuits that have considered the question are in accord relying on morrison,the seventh circuit held that the ftaia sets forth an element of an antitrust claim,not a jurisdictional limit on the power of the federal courts.minn chem,at.the second and third circuits reached the same conclusion.see lotes,hon hai precision indus,wl,at cir.june,w e have little difficulty concluding that the requirements of the ftaia go to the merits of an antitrust claim rather than to subject matter jurisdiction.animal sci,china minmetals corp,cir t he ftaia constitutes a substantive merits limitation rather than a jurisdictional limitation.the ftaia does not limit the power of the federal courts rather,it provides substantive elements under the sherman act in cases involving nonimport trade with foreign nations.
b.the ftaia challenges 
the following jury instruction sums up the heart of the sherman act violation 
t he government must prove each of the following elements beyond a reasonable doubt 
first,that the conspiracy existed at or about the time stated in the indictment 
second,that the defendants is,voluntarily and members of the conspiracy charged in the indictment,knowing of its goal and intending to help accomplish it and 
third,that the members of the conspiracy engaged in one or both of the following activities 
a fixing the price of tft lcd panels targeted by the participants to be sold in the united states or for delivery to the united states or 
b fixing the price of tft lcd panels that were incorporated into finished products such as notebook computers,desktop computer monitors,and televisions,and that this conduct had a direct,substantial,and reasonably foreseeable effect on trade or commerce in those finished products sold in the united states or for delivery to the united states.in determining whether the conspiracy had such an effect,you may consider the total amount of trade or commerce in those finished products sold in the united states or for delivery to the united states however,the government proof need not quantify or value that effect.
the defendants argue that i the indictment was insufficient because it did not name or cite the ftaia,ii the indictment and evidence are insufficient as to both import trade and domestic effects,and iii the domestic effects exception,which was not alleged in the indictment,is an element of a sherman act offense that implicates the ftaia and thus this instruction constructively amended the indictment.
the ftaia in the indictment 
the defendants argue that the indictment was flawed for failing to mention the ftaia by name or statutory citation.however,as explained in detail with regard to import trade and domestic effects,the indictment contained the factual allegations necessary to establish that the ftaia either did not apply or that its requirements were satisfied.
in any event,there was absolutely no prejudice from the indictment failure to cite the ftaia.unless the defendant s w ere misled and thereby prejudiced,neither an error in a citation nor a citation omission is a ground to dismiss the indictment or information or to reverse a conviction.c see united states vroman,cir correct citation to the relevant statute,though always desirable,is not fatal if omitted.the parties raised the ftaia requirements throughout the proceedings,and the district court record is full of briefing and argument on the ftaia.
import trade and the ftaia 
the appropriate characterization of the import trade provision of the ftaia is essential to our analysis.the statute provides that the sherman act shall not apply to conduct involving trade or commerce other than import trade or import commerce,and then goes on to provide limitations nonimport commerce.we agree with the defendants that this section should not be labeled an ftaia exception.rather,more accurately,import trade,as referenced in the parenthetical statement,does not fall within the ftaia at all.it falls within the sherman act without further clarification or pleading.consequently,we disagree with the defendants view that the indictment was insufficient because it did not allege import trade under the ftaia.
the indictment charged a violation of of the sherman act and alleged that the defendants entered into and engaged in a combination and conspiracy to suppress and eliminate competition by fixing the prices of transistor liquid crystal display panels tft lcd in the united states and elsewhere.see united states morrison,cir it is generally sufficient that an indictment set forth the offense in the words of the statute itself,as long as those words of themselves fully,directly,and expressly,without any uncertainty or ambiguity,set forth all the elements necessary to constitute the offence intended to be punished.internal quotation marks omitted.apart from tracking the language of the sherman act in the indictment,the government did,in fact,plead and prove that the defendants engaged in import trade.
in empagran,the supreme court explained the somewhat convoluted scope of the ftaia 
the ftaia initially lays down a general rule placing all nonimport activity involving foreign commerce outside the sherman act reach.it then brings such conduct back within the sherman act reach provided that the conduct both sufficiently affects american commerce,it has a direct,substantial,and reasonably foreseeable effect on american domestic,import,or certain export commerce,and has an effect of a kind that antitrust law considers harmful,the effect must giv e rise to a sherman act claim.
at internal quotation marks omitted.under its plain terms,the ftaia does not affect import trade.see dee k,at because this case involves importation of goods,congress expressly exempted from ftaia coverage as involving import trade or import commerce with foreign nations the ftaia standard obviously does not directly govern this case.internal quotations marks and citation omitted.
the legislative history supports this statutory interpretation.house reports are clear that the ftaia does not implicate import trade.a transaction between two foreign firms,even if,should not,merely by virtue of the american ownership,come within the reach of our antitrust laws.such foreign transactions should,for the purposes of this legislation,be treated in the same manner as export transactions that is,there should be no american antitrust jurisdiction absent a direct,substantial and reasonably foreseeable effect on domestic commerce or a domestic competitor it is thus clear that wholly foreign transactions as well as export transactions are covered by the amendment,but that import transactions are not,at.
although our circuit has not defined import trade for purposes of the ftaia,not much imagination is required to say that this phrase means precisely what it says.as the seventh circuit held in a case involving foreign cartel members,transactions that are directly between the plaintiff purchasers and the defendant cartel members are the import commerce of the united states minn chem,at.similarly,the sixth circuit labeled goods manufactured abroad and sold in the united states import commerce.carrier outokumpu oyj,cir.so too are transactions between the foreign defendant producers of tft lcds and purchasers located in the united states see id.
the defendants conduct,as alleged and proven,constitutes import trade,and falls outside the scope of the ftaia.the allegations in the indictment,which we review de novo,united states,cir,must ensure that the defendants were prosecuted only on the basis of the facts presented to the grand jury,see united states du bo,cir internal quotation marks omitted.thus,a n indictment must be specific in its charges and necessary allegations can not be left to inference a n indictment should be read in its entirety,construed according to common sense,and interpreted to include facts which are necessarily implied,at citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
the indictment is replete with allegations that support the government position that the defendants engaged in import trade.the indictment alleged that,within the conspiracy period,auo and auoa engaged in the business of producing and selling tft lcds to customers in the united states.during the conspiracy period,auo employees had discussions in person or by phone with representatives of coconspirator tft lcd manufacturers during which they reached agreements on pricing of tft lcd sold to certain customers,including customers located in the united states.the indictment went on to allege that auo attempted to attain the price goals set with coconspirators by,during the conspiracy period,regularly instruct ing employees of auoa located in the united states to contact employees of other tft lcd manufacturers in the united states to discuss pricing to major united states tft lcd customers,and that i n response to these instructions,employees of auoa located in the united states had regular contact through meetings and phone calls with employees of other tft lcd manufacturers in the united states to discuss and confirm pricing,and at times agree on pricing,to certain tft lcd customers in the united states.
these allegations directly describe that the defendants and their coconspirators engaged in import commerce with the united states indeed,the conspiracy intent,as alleged,was to suppress and eliminate competition by fixing the prices for panels that auo and auoa sold to manufacturers in the united states and elsewhere for incorporation into retail technology sold to consumers in the united states and elsewhere.
going into trial,there was no surprise regarding the import trade allegations likewise,the evidence at trial was ample on this aspect of the conspiracy.we review the defendants sufficiency of the evidence challenge under the well established standard of jackson virginia,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,we determine whether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.id.at.
trial testimony established that auo imported over one million panels per month into the united states.the crystal meeting participants earned over million from the importation of tft lcds into the united states.although it was undisputed at trial that auo and auoa did not manufacture any consumer products for importation into the united states,the evidence revealed that auo and auoa executives and employees negotiated with united states companies in the united states to sell tft lcd panels at the prices set at the crystal meetings.importation of this critical component of various electronic devices is surely import trade or import commerce.to suggest,as the defendants do,that auo was not an importer misses the point.the panels were sold into the united states,falling squarely within the scope of the sherman act.
the defendants also claim that the transactions did not target the united states.targeting is not a legal element for import trade under the sherman act,though it was included in the jury instructions at the defendants request.in any event,the negotiations in the united states and the significant direct sales to the united states certainly qualify as targeting.the challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence fails.
in sum,the ftaia does not apply to the defendants import trade conduct.the government sufficiently pleaded and proved that the conspirators engaged in import commerce with the united states and that the conspiracy violated of the sherman act.
domestic effects under the ftaia 
unlike import trade,which is exempted from the ftaia altogether,if the government proceeds on a domestic effects theory,which it did here,the government must plead and prove the requirements for the domestic effects exception to the ftaia,namely that the defendants conduct had a direct,substantial,and reasonably foreseeable effect on united states commerce.see.we hold that the indictment sufficiently alleged such conduct.we do not need to reach,however,the defendants sufficiency of the evidence challenge on domestic effects because sufficient evidence supported the alternate ground of conviction,the import trade theory.
as with import commerce,it is important to place the domestic effects exception within the statutory framework of the ftaia.we reject the government position that the ftaia is an affirmative defense to a sherman act offense.the government interpretation is at odds with the plain language of the statute,which establishes that when a case involves nonimport trade with foreign nations,the sherman act does not apply unless the ftaia domestic effects exception applies.see united states davenport,cir contrasting elements and affirmative defenses.
the government reliance on mckelvey united states,u,and united states gravenmeir,cir,which both held that the government did not have to disprove an exception to a criminal statute to obtain a conviction,is misplaced.in those cases,the statutes at issue laid out prohibited conduct and then provided an escape hatch exception.see mckelvey,at statute prohibiting the obstruction of access to public lands p rovided,this section shall not be held to affect the right or title of persons,who have gone upon,improved or occupied said lands under the land laws of the united states,claiming title thereto,in good faith citing act of february,stat,gravenmeir,at statute prohibiting the transfer or possession of a machine gun except with respect to b any lawful transfer or lawful possession of a machinegun that was lawfully possessed before the date this subsection takes effect alteration in original citing o.in contrast,as a default,the ftaia provides that when the alleged conduct involves nonimport trade with foreign nations,the sherman act does not apply.see empagran,at.to allege a nonimport trade claim under the sherman act,the claim must encompass the domestic effects elements.
the indictment alleged that auo was engaged in the business of producing and selling tft lcds to customers in the united states and elsewhere that,at crystal meetings,in telephone conversations,and in messages with other coconspirators,auo employees reached agreements on prices for tft lcds sold in the united states and that employees of auo regularly instructed employees of auoa located in the united states to contact employees of other tft lcd manufacturers in the united states to discuss pricing to major united states tft lcd customers.the indictment also alleged that the tft lcds were used in computers and other monitors that were sold in and substantially affected interstate commerce.specifically,the indictment charged that the substantial terms of the conspiracy were an agreement to fix the prices of tft lcds for use in notebook computers,desktop monitors,and televisions in the united states and elsewhere.
the magic words domestic effects were not necessary to make clear that the overseas sale of panels for incorporation into products destined for sale in the united states was a key focus of the indictment.from the outset,the indictment targeted both import trade of panels and the effects of foreign sales on domestic commerce.the scope of the charges was not a mystery.
the defendants argue that the ftaia jury instruction worked a constructive amendment of the indictment because it permitted the jury to convict based on either an import trade or domestic effects theory when prior to trial the government had only sought to rely on an import trade theory.we have found constructive amendment of an indictment where there is a complex of facts presented at trial distinctly different from those set forth in the charging instrument,or the crime charged in the indictment was substantially altered at trial,so that it was impossible to know whether the grand jury would have indicted for the crime actually proved.united states adamson,cir alterations in original internal quotation marks omitted,modified on other grounds by united states larson,cir.
here,there was no constructive amendment because the facts in the indictment necessarily supported the domestic effects claim,namely by allegations that auo and auoa sold panels in the united states and abroad for use in finished consumer goods sold in or delivered to the united states.the allegations gave fair notice that the claimed conduct had a direct,substantial,and reasonably foreseeable effect on united states commerce.see a.based on the allegations,the domestic effects instruction did not result in a constructive amendment of the indictment.
finally,we address the sufficiency of the evidence under the domestic effects exception,which was directed at foreign sales of panels that would be incorporated overseas into finished consumer products that would ultimately be sold in the united sates.the defendants question whether the government proved the domestic effects exception at trial.specifically,the defendants claim that evidence did not support a direct effect on domestic commerce,nor was the
