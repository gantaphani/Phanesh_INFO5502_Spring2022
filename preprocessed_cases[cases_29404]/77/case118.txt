opinion of the court 
albert tupone appeals his felony conviction for making false representations in connection with the receipt of federal workers compensation benefits,a violation of.although tupone and the government agree that this case should be remanded for resentencing under the supreme court decision in united states booker,d,a conclusion with which we agree,we must decide two remaining issues.the first is whether the district court erred in instructing the jury on the threshold dollar amount for a felony conviction under,and in holding that the jury verdict constituted felony,rather than misdemeanor convictions.the second is whether the district court erred in finding that the total amount of benefits tupone received as a result of false applications for workers compensation benefits constituted the loss amount under of the united states sentencing guidelines the guidelines.because we conclude that the district court interpretation of was sound,we will affirm tupone conviction.because we also conclude,however,that the loss amount fixed by the court was incorrect under the guidelines,we will vacate the sentence,and we will remand the case for resentencing in light of booker and based on a properly calculated loss amount.
on june,albert tupone was an employee of the united states postal service.on that day,tupone suffered disabling injuries to his back and eardrum when his mail truck was involved in an accident.as a result of his injuries,tupone was found to be totally disabled and began to receive disability payments from the united states office of workers compensation program owcp.
each year that tupone received disability payments,the department of labor monitored his status by,inter alia,sending him a questionnaire to.in particular,tupone was required to answer truthfully the following questions did you work for any employer during the period covered by the form and were you or involved in any business enterprise during the period covered by the form during the years through,tupone received form,and each year he answered the above employment questions no.as a result of his answers,tupone received benefits in the amount of for,in,in,for a total of.
in late,however,tupone began to buy,repair,and resell used cars.over the three years in question,tupone bought and sold approximately cars for some disputed amount of profit tupone neither reported the income to the department of labor nor advised the department of his activity when filling out the forms for through.the department of labor discovered the omissions,and a criminal investigation ensued.
on march,a grand jury returned an indictment against tupone charging him with three counts of violating the indictment alleged that tupone had violated the statute by certifying on three forms that he had no and no earned income from any employment for the previous fifteen month period.count one was based on the form filed on july,which covered the previous months count two was based on the form filed on may,which covered the previous months and count three was based on the form filed on may,which covered the previous months.paragraph of the indictment indicated that form was used to determine whether the claimant qualified for continued benefits and to determine whether an adjustment for continued benefits was warranted.paragraph of the indictment alleged that tupone knowingly and willfully concealed material facts,and made false representations,in connection with the receipt of compensation and other benefits and payments exceeding,under subchapters i and iii of chapter of title of the united states code,the federal workers compensation law.
at trial,the owcp employee assigned to tupone case testified as to the total amount of benefits tupone had received during the period covered by the indictment.a second owcp employee,agent gallagher,testified that had tupone been truthful on his forms,the department of labor would have reduced his benefits according to profits made,required additional medical examinations,and initiated the process designed to determine if tupone was still disabled and whether his benefits should be further reduced or terminated.
at the close of evidence,the court instructed the jury on the elements of the offense 
counts,and of the indictment charge defendant with violating federal law requiring recipients of federal disability benefits to report any employment or and any income earned through that employment.
united states code section provides in part that whoever knowingly and willfully falsifies,conceals or covers up a material fact or makes a false,fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation or makes or uses a false statement or report,knowing the same to contain any false,fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry in connection with the application for or receipt of compensation or other benefit or payment in excess of,under subchapter or of chapter of title,shall be guilty of an offense against the united states.that the statute.
the defendant can be found guilty of the offense of making false statements in order to receive federal disability benefits only if all of the following facts are proved beyond a reasonable doubt.these are what we refer to as the essential elements of the crime charged.
first,that defendant knowingly and willfully made a false statement or report to the department of labor,office of workers compensation program as charged in counts,and of the indictment.
second,that the false statement or report was made in connection with an application for or receipt of federal workers sic compensation benefits in excess of.
and,third,that the false statement or report related to a material fact.
the jury found tupone guilty of each count of making false statements.
at the sentencing hearing,tupone argued that defined both a felony and a misdemeanor,and that the felony required proof that tupone had received more than in falsely obtained benefits,an element of the crime which the jury had not been instructed to find.the court rejected the argument that falsely obtained meant something different than receiving a benefit in connection with a false statement.the district court entered felony convictions based on the jury verdict.
on the issue of the loss calculation under the guidelines,agent gallagher of the owcp testified regarding his calculation of the immediate reduction in tupone benefits that would have resulted had he reported his earnings on his forms in in and in,for a total reduction of.gallagher also indicated,as he had at trial,that reported income or employment by tupone would have triggered a process regarding tupone status that could have led to a further reduction or even elimination of his benefits and may have resulted in tupone return to some form of work.
based in large part on agent gallagher testimony,the district court found that the loss for guidelines purposes associated with tupone offenses was not merely the in foregone benefit reductions,but the entire amount of benefits that tupone had received during the indictment period.using that finding,the court determined that tupone total offense level was rather than,and,applying the mandatory guidelines regime,sentenced tupone to five months incarceration and three years supervised release,including five months of home detention.tupone appealed.
the district court exercised subject matter jurisdiction over this criminal case under.we exercise appellate jurisdiction over the district court final order pursuant to.
because tupone challenge to the jury instructions turns on a matter of statutory interpretation,our review is plenary as to that issue.united states cooper,cir.we review the district court application of the guidelines to facts for abuse of discretion.buford united states,d.factual findings will be reversed only if clearly erroneous.united states moorer,cir united states napier,cir.
whether the district court adequately instructed the jury turns on a specific question of statutory interpretation.the parties agree that w here the language of the statute is clear the text of the statute is the end of the matter.steele blackman,cir.the key issue in this case is the meaning of the phrase benefits falsely obtained.both parties look to the plain text of the statute,and both believe that the text cuts their way.we conclude that the government reading of the statute best comports with the text and structure of.
tupone argues before us,as he did at sentencing,that the phrase falsely obtained requires that an additional element be proved in order for a violation to constitute a felony.he asserts that the use of falsely obtained means that,for a jury verdict to constitute a felony conviction under,a jury must find a difference between what a given defendant was entitled to receive had he been truthful and what he actually received owing to his false statement.because the indictment and jury instructions did not include the phrase falsely obtained,tupone argues that he was charged with,and the jury convicted him of,a misdemeanor 
the district court rejected that argument and stated 
a nother way to read the statute is that it makes it a crime to falsely apply for or receive compensation or other benefits.and if the benefits falsely obtained,which is all of the benefits does not exceed,we have a misdemeanor and not a felony.
i think the statute criminalizes making of sic a false statement in connection with the application for or receipt of compensation,and it makes it a misdemeanor only if the amount of benefits at think they could have said at issue,but they said falsely obtained,in the statute,does not exceed.that a misdemeanor.
according to tupone,the district court reading of renders the phrase falsely obtained meaningless.in other words,he submits that the district court ignored the distinction congress drew between the misdemeanor offense of filing a false application which is complete at the time of filing and requires no loss,and the felony which only occurs when and if the applicant is paid more than he is entitled to receive.
the government argues that the structure and design of show that the statute clearly sets forth the prohibited conduct up front,and makes the violation of the statute a felony.in other words,benefits falsely obtained refers back to the criminal conduct proscribed by the statute,obtaining any benefits as a result of false statements.under this reading,benefits falsely obtained is not rendered meaningless it is synonymous with and refers to benefits received in connection with a false statement.
although our cases offer no precedent dealing directly with the meaning of,two other circuits have weighed in on the proper reading of the statute.the tenth circuit,in united states henry,cir,concluded that the plain terms of pertain,at least for loss calculation purposes,to the benefits obtained in connection with a false application,not the amount of benefits obtained minus the amount that would have been obtained if no false statement had been made.id.in united states hurn,cir,the eleventh circuit court of appeals indicated that requires a jury to find a causal link between a defendant false statement and his receipt of in benefits id.the court in hurn also stated,however,that a reasonable juror would be likely to conclude that a benefit is obtained falsely if it is obtained as a result of a fraudulent or misleading statement or omission.id.in other words,the eleventh circuit concluded that benefits falsely obtained is synonymous with benefits received as a result of a false application.no court has addressed and interpreted the statute in the manner urged by tupone.
in matters of statutory interpretation,the plain meaning of statutory language is often illuminated by considering not only the particular statutory language at issue,but also the structure of the section in which the key language is found,the design of the statute as a whole and its object united states schneider,cir.the supreme court has stated consistently that the text of a statute must be considered in the larger context or structure of the statute in which it is found.see,city of rancho palos verdes abrams,d context,not just literal text,will often lead a court to congress intent in respect to a particular statute alexander sandoval,d interpretive inquiry begins with the text and structure of the statute.
many of our own cases reflect this methodology as well.see,zheng gonzales,cir expressly looking to the text and structure of a statute to discern congressional intent booth churner,cir we do not quarrel with petitioner claim that the most natural reading of the relevant phrase,when viewed in isolation,would suggest one result.however,statutory language must always be read in its proper context w hen the relevant section is read in its entirety,it suggests the opposite result internal citations omitted.it would therefore be a mistake to squint myopically at the phrase falsely obtained and interpret it in isolation,rather than in the context of the text and structure of as a whole.ex rel.sch.dist.of the city of newark,cir.
we conclude that,when read in its entirety,phrase benefits falsely obtained refers back is synonymous benefits received in connection with the making of a false representation.the overall design and object of is to criminalize the making of false statements in the application for and receipt of government benefits.schneider,at.the language of the primary import of the section as a concerned with communicating that any knowing or willful false statement made in connection with the application of or receipt of benefits will be considered a felony.the misdemeanor exception for benefits less than rated no separate section,no subsection,nor even a separate paragraph.nowhere does offer a separate definition for benefits falsely obtained.the statute is devoid of any language that would require the calculation,amount of benefits received minus amount rightly owed in the absence of the false statement that tupone argues is required by its plain text for felony conviction.all of the above militates in favor of the district court reading of the statute.
in contrast,tupone reading turns the import of on its head even as he claims to be taking its overall structure into consideration.tupone argues that deference is required to the distinction congress drew between the misdemeanor offense of filing a false application which is complete at the time of filing and requires no loss,and the felony which only occurs when and if the applicant is paid more than he is entitled to receive.such a reading suggests that the main thrust of the entire statute is to create a misdemeanor,with the latter clause carving out a narrow category of felony liability.an examination of the federal criminal code reveals such a structure to be highly atypical among criminal those dealing with fraud,theft,or false provide for both felony and misdemeanor offenses.in fact,numerous sections of the criminal code mirror the precise linguistic pattern found in.see.the above code sections and those like them all include the same structural elements a lengthy primary clause describing certain illegal conduct and providing for felony punishment thereof a semicolon and,finally,a second with the word but which refers back to the illegal conduct described in the main clause and provides for misdemeanor punishment in cases where the dollar value associated with the aforementioned illegal conduct does not exceed.see,id.in other words,the above statutes are felony criminal statutes that include a narrow misdemeanor exception in the event that the illegal conduct results in de minimus gain.
we reject the argument that,unlike all other identically structured provisions in the federal criminal code,alone primarily establishes a misdemeanor and creates a narrow felony exception that turns on an undefined,phrase,and that requires a calculation nowhere mentioned or implied in the text.the much more natural and obvious reading of is that the main effect of the text is to create the felony of making false statements related to government benefits,and to carve out a narrow misdemeanor exception for those defendants whose false statements relate to applications for or receipt of de minimus benefits and dollar amounts 
applying this interpretation of the statute,we conclude that both the indictment and jury instructions set out the necessary elements for felony liability under.paragraph of the indictment alleged that tupone knowingly and willfully concealed material facts,and made false representations,in connection with the receipt of compensation and other benefits and payments exceeding the jury instruction stated,inter alia,that the jury must find that tupone knowingly and willfully made a false statement or report to the department of labor in connection with an application for or receipt of federal workers sic compensation benefits in excess of.although neither the indictment nor the instruction contained the phrase falsely obtained,both tracked other language from that expresses all the elements necessary for a felony violation of the statute.
the phrase benefits falsely obtained does not create an additional element to felony liability under.the district court therefore properly treated the jury verdict against tupone as three felony convictions.the conviction will be affirmed 
we must next decide whether the district court erred in finding that the loss resulting from tupone false statements equaled the entire amount of benefits tupone received from to,rather than fixing the loss at the amount that tupone benefits would have been reduced immediately had tupone filed truthful forms.we conclude that the court erred in its application of the guidelines to this case.
tupone argues that the correct measure of loss under the guidelines as applied to is the difference between what tupone actually received,and what he would have received,if his forms had been accurate.the government implicitly argues that the loss under is necessarily equal to the entire amount of benefits received as a result of tupone false statements.we are persuaded that,in general,the guidelines support a difference method of loss calculation.
the commentary to states that,as a general rule,loss under is the greater of actual or intended loss.app.note a.that same commentary,however,indicates clearly that cases involving government benefits call for the use of a more particularized standard in evaluating loss 
f special subdivision a,which states the above general rule,the following special rules shall be used to assist in determining loss in the cases indicated 
ii government a case involving government benefits,grants,loans,entitlement program payments,loss shall be considered to be not less than the value of the benefits obtained by unintended recipients or diverted to unintended uses,as the case may be.for example,if the defendant was the intended recipient of food stamps having a value of but fraudulently received food stamps having a value of,loss is.
app.note f ii.this subdivision explains that loss in government benefits cases is,at a minimum,equal to the amount of benefits obtained that were not intended by the government to be obtained by a given recipient.in those cases in which a defendant was intended by the government to receive some amount of benefits,the loss is the delta between the amount of benefits intended by the government to be received by that defendant and any greater amount of benefits actually received 
our cases indirectly support the idea of a difference method of calculating loss under the guidelines in government benefits cases.no precedent binding on this court has dealt directly with the standard for loss under that said,there are decisions of our court which,though they involve specific offenses and guidelines provisions distinguishable from the case at bar,support the general concept of a difference standard of loss.see united states kopp,cir loss amount in case involving false statements on loan applications is the amount of money the victim lost as of,the amount of the loan not the full amount of the original loan united states evans,cir in case involving fraudulent submission of insurance claims,loss amount does not include legitimate insurance claims submitted on behalf of legitimate victims.
furthermore,as an analytical matter,we note the necessary distinction between the task of evaluating the text of proper and that of measuring the loss amount under the guidelines resulting from a violation of that text.the former task involves assessing the breadth and level of by the language of.as discussed above,congress,in passing,ascribed felony liability to the making of false statements in connection with the application for or receipt of benefits in excess of.for the qualitative purpose of measuring criminal liability,then,all the benefits which a defendant applies for or receives must necessarily be counted.
loss calculations under the guidelines,however,generally involve a different analytical goal.rather than measuring the more qualitative categories of criminal culpability and liability as such,the court attempts to reach an appropriate sentence by quantifying the amount of harm wrought against the the a particular criminal act.applying that principle to and other government benefits cases,the guidelines commentary defines the aforementioned harm as the value of benefits obtained by an individual in the absence of a government intention that he obtain them.accordingly,we hold that the proper loss calculation under the guidelines for a violation of is the difference between the amount of benefits actually obtained by a given defendant and the amount the government intended him to receive during the relevant period.
applying the above standard,we conclude that the district court erred in finding that the difference in this case was the entire amount of benefits tupone received from through.
in this case,the key guidance on government loss is found in owcp agent gallagher testimony at the sentencing hearing.based on our review of that testimony,the rest of the sentencing record,and the district court remarks regarding the evidence,we conclude that the only loss that can be definitively shown on this record is the amount by which tupone benefits would have been immediately reduced had he reported his car sale profits.
gallagher testimony contained two essential components for loss calculation purposes.the first component involved the immediately ascertainable and retroactive loss that owcp suffered because tupone failed to report his income.gallagher testified that tupone activities during the relevant years did not constitute sufficient information to establish a pattern,and that owcp would therefore base any adjustments for these periods of times sic strictly on the figures that tupone earned.gallagher also stated that any overall change in tupone disability status resulting from his reported income would affect his prospective benefits and would not be applied retroactively.
the second key component of gallagher testimony relates to further possible loss based on a of tupone eligibility for benefits.gallagher indicated that had tupone reported his income on his form in,the owcp would have considered that income to be prima facie evidence of partial disability rather than total disability and would have initiated a of tupone that could have led to further reductions in his benefits.gallagher questioned by the his earnings only assessment of benefits reduction was a retroactive estimate based on the information provided by the defense as to tupone car sale profits.gallagher said he was hindered in his estimate because,in a trial context,it was given so late after the fact,
w hereas,in actual practice,as soon as we notified of these type sic of earnings,we going to start the ball rolling with the medical examination we going to determine disability we going to go back to the employing agency and request a job offer to get the beneficiary back to their original employer.
tupone attorney responded by asking whether,on the mere basis of tupone sale of six cars in owcp would start to do a work up gallagher responded,oh yes attorney an earning capacity gallagher yes,absolutely.
additionally,agent gallagher testified that despite the required regular medical reports given by all beneficiaries,a report of earnings or employment by a beneficiary would call into question whatever medical inf
