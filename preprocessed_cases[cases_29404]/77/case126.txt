after the government charged robert graham with criminal offenses,he opted for a bench trial.the district court found him not guilty of all offenses except that charged in count from his employer,an organization receiving in excess of annually in federal funds.see.graham appealed his sole conviction,and we reversed,holding that the government had offered insufficient evidence to prove,beyond a reasonable doubt,that graham knowingly stole any money as alleged in count.see united states graham,app x,cir per curiam.graham then moved for a certificate of innocence,a necessary prerequisite to recovery of damages from the government for unjust conviction and imprisonment.see.concluding that graham had not met the statutory prerequisites for a certificate of innocence,the district court refused to grant him one.graham appeals.because the district court did not abuse its substantial discretion in denying the certificate,we affirm.
graham served as executive director of two related nonprofit council on aging,coa and all care home and community services,all care for more than twenty years.the corporations,which shared a board of directors,provided services to the elderly and infirm and received well over annually in federal funds.
for many years,graham had no written employment contract with either corporation.however,in december,he prepared and submitted employment contracts,which the board president signed.the contracts raised graham annual salary from to.
in march,coa agreed to assume responsibility for all care administrative expenses,including graham salary and benefits,and entered into an amended employment contract with graham so providing.this amended contract contains the following provision 
beginning on the date of employment sometime around may until the termination of employment,graham shall be entitled to accrue two days hours per month paid sick leave time.sick leave may be accumulated from year to year.sick leave benefits may be converted into cash compensation if used for illnesses or upon the termination of this contract.
thus,the contract authorized graham to convert his benefits into cash compensation under only two circumstances illness or termination of th e contract.
nevertheless,in january,without meeting these conditions,graham sought board permission to convert some of his sick leave to cash.graham offered the board the following brief justification for the request i am requesting permission to buy out some of my sick leave.it shows in the books as an accrual.i can already bu y out my vacation.the board granted his request,and on that same day,graham converted hours to.two more times in the spring of,again without meeting the contractual conditions,graham requested and received board permission to convert some of his sick leave to cash.in all,during,graham converted sick leave to over in cash.
graham never again asked the board to approve his conversion of sick leave to cash.but in both january and february,again without meeting either of the contractual conditions,he converted sick leave to cash.in total,during,graham converted sick leave to over in cash.
in response to ongoing state investigations of coa,the board called an emergency meeting in march,at which it revised the terms of graham employment contract and ordered graham to return the money he received for sick leave in.that same month,graham heeded his attorney advice and repaid all the money he had received for sick leave in both and.
in july,a federal grand jury in the southern district of west virginia returned a second superseding indictment against graham.both counts and charged him with embezzling money from coa by unauthorized conversion of sick leave to cash.see count charged him with embezzling in calendar year count charged him with embezzling in.
graham pled not guilty to all counts and waived his right to a jury trial.during his bench trial,the government offered substantial evidence that at all relevant times,the coa board members were elderly their average age exceeded,hard of hearing,financially unsophisticated,and strongly influenced by graham.the government argued that this evidence required the district court to find that graham could,and did,take advantage of the board at every turn and so find him guilty of all counts in the indictment.
the district court refused to so find.rather,after the trial,at which graham did not testify,the court acquitted graham of all crimes but that charged in count from his employer of through conversions to cash in.thus,the court found graham not guilty of mail fraud,wire fraud,tax violations,embezzlement related to the purchase of a plasma television and the maintenance of a sep ira plan,or embezzlement with respect to the conversion charged in count.united states graham,wl.
the court explained its differing finding as to counts and as follows 
evidence establishes that,in,defendant went to the boards of coa and and requested board approval prior to cashing in sick leave.the board sanction of defendant behavior,regardless of the ability of its members to fully comprehend the intricacies of the organizations finances,leads this court to conclude that defendant did not violate a a as to count thirteen.even though the court doubts that the board members comprehended in detail all of the matters before them,they did consent.their assent,regardless of their level of competence,creates a reasonable doubt as to count thirteen.
on the other hand,the evidence at trial did establish that defendant was guilty of count fourteen.it shows clearly that he did not return to the board and seek the same approval for his last buy out of sick leave even though he knew he was supposed to do 
t he conclusion is inescapable that graham cashed in the sick leave in january and february without the approval of his board,knowing he needed board approval,thereby effectively stealing the money or converting it to his own use.
from the evidence taken at trial it is clear that defendant,an employee,took this money from coa without having any board approval whatsoever.these transactions each constituted major changes of the sort that required board approval.the fact that graham sought board approval for the of sick leave is compelling evidence that he knew such approval was required.graham cavalierly disregarded the board and treated large amounts of coa money as if it were his own,diverting it to his personal use and to the detriment of those whom coa and were created and funded to serve.
as to the other to the plasma television,sep ira plan,and federal court concluded that although graham conduct was doubtlessly improper and unethical,id.at,and inconsistent with graham duties as executive director,id.at,the government had failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that graham harbored the requisite intent to commit the crimes charged.id.at,see.the court similarly acquitted graham of various fraud charges,see,finding that the government had not proven that graham devised a scheme to defraud his employer.graham,wl,at.
the district court concluded that 
t he events leading to this indictment are improper and outrageous and can not be condoned by the court.graham failed miserably to fulfill his duties as a public servant,engaging in conduct that squandered public resources and adopting a that reflected discredit upon coa and,their directors and employees.bad conduct in and of itself,however,does not equal criminal conduct.to convict a defendant of a crime,the government must establish beyond a reasonable doubt by competent evidence each and every element of each and every crime charged.except for count fourteen,the government has failed to do so.
id.at.the court imposed on graham a sentence of two years in prison and a fine,and ordered him to forfeit any portion of the funds charged as stolen in count that he had not already returned.
graham appealed,and we reversed his sole conviction on sufficiency grounds.graham,app x at.we concluded that,because in,t he board repeatedly authorized graham to buy out his accrued sick leave and did not place any restrictions on the timing of these cash outs,his failure to obtain board approval in for the cash payments of sick leave was clearly insufficient for purposes of establishing graham intent to steal funds.id.at.although graham written contract permitted him to receive cash payment for sick leave only upon illness or termination,we held that the board decisions in january,march,and may of to permit cash payment of sick leave in circumstances not permitted in the employment contract resulted in a de facto amendment that overrode these restrictions.id.
we pointed to several other facts suggesting graham did not intentionally steal from coa,including the board decision to maintain graham as executive director in march after the federal and state investigations of coa had begun,graham decision to continue to obtain cash for sick leave after the federal investigation began in early,and his filling out the proper paperwork and obtaining approval from the board treasurer for all of the conversions to cash.id.at.although we recognized that certain other example,that graham conversions of sick leave ran afoul of coa written personnel policies may demonstrate that graham is not eligible for the priesthood,we found them irrelevant so far as the district court determination of guilt is concerned.id.at.
we issued our mandate on march,and on that same day the district court entered an order adjudging graham not guilty.at that time,graham had spent thirteen months in prison.
on july,graham filed an action in the united states court of federal claims seeking damages from the government for unjust conviction and imprisonment.see.two months later,graham moved in this court for a certificate of innocence,a necessary prerequisite to the federal claims action.id.we dismissed the motion without prejudice,noting that the reversal of appellant conviction was not based on technical or procedural grounds,but law and fact therefore,a certificate of innocence is appropriate in accordance with.however,we concluded that the district court is the most appropriate court to issue the certificate.
graham then moved for a certificate of innocence in the district court,which the court denied.after examining the relevant statutory language,the court concluded that does not mandate the payment of public funds to everyone acquitted after being imprisoned.rather,the statute orders compensation to the truly innocent who have been prosecuted through no fault of their own.united states graham,d.the court noted that the few precedents interpreting and its predecessors agreed that the statute provides a remedy to be applied only in exceptional cases.id.
the district court determined that it was unable to reach the conclusions mandated by as a necessary condition to the award of a certificate of innocence.id.at.specifically,the court found itself not persuaded that graham is in fact innocent,nor able to conclude that he did not by misconduct or neglect bring about his own prosecution.id.
the court first catalogued the trial evidence,which it believed demonstrated that graham was not actually innocent graham selected and controlled the board which w as composed entirely of the elderly,took home an annual salary of,which was excessive by comparison to the pay of others in similar positions,used employees on company time to perform personal services for himself and his family,bought a television through coa to get a better price and avoid sales taxes,manipulated a sep ira to benefit his family,and assumed a lavish lifestyle including regular visits to a gentlemen club.id.at.this evidence led the court to conclude that graham operated coa and all care for years as his own personal domain and for the financial benefit of himself and his family.id.
the court then explained why it found that graham misconduct or neglect cause d or br ought about his own prosecution.a.first,the court found that the enumerated evidence of graham wrongdoing certainly shows that,in a general sense,graham brought about his own prosecution.graham,d at.specifically,the court found that graham was at the very least negligent in not seeking board approval before converting his sick leave to cash in,as he had in.id.the court explained that graham either simply neglected to do so or he purposely failed to do so for some specific reason such as the belief his request would not be approved.in either event his own conduct brought about his prosecution id.
the district court expressly recognized that on appeal,we had carefully reviewed the evidence against graham on the count of conviction and concluded that it was insufficient to establish his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.id.the court did not challenge this holding.rather,the court explained that while the evidence at trial had been found insufficient to prove graham guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,this evidence left the court unconvinced that graham is in fact innocent,or that graham did not by misconduct or neglect bring about his own prosecution.id.
graham timely noted this appeal.
this case presents our first opportunity to address.nor has the supreme court ever construed,or even cited,the statute.but the clear statutory language,its legislative history,and the cases that have previously considered the statute provide us substantial guidance.
section,the u njust conviction and imprisonment act,provides 
a any person suing under section of this title which waives sovereign immunity for suits seeking money damages from the government,to be filed in the court of federal claims must allege and prove that 
his conviction has been reversed or set aside on the ground that he is not guilty of the offense of which he was convicted,as appears from the record of the court setting aside or reversing such conviction,and 
he did not commit any of the acts charged or his acts,deeds,or omissions in connection with such charge constituted no offense against the united states,or any state,territory or the district of columbia,and he did not by misconduct or neglect cause or bring about his own prosecution.
b proof of requisite facts shall be by a certificate of the court or pardon wherein such facts are alleged to appear,and other evidence thereof shall not be received.
thus,the plain language of requires that one seeking a certificate of innocence who has not been pardoned prove three predicates.he must prove that the record of the court setting aside or reversing his conviction demonstrates that it did so on the ground that he is not guilty of the offense of which he was convicted,a he did not commit any of the acts charged or those acts constituted no crime against the united states,or any state,territory or the district of columbia,a and he did not by misconduct or neglect cause or bring about his own prosecution,id.
after setting forth these three requirements,specifically characterizes them as requisite facts.b.then,the statute expressly sets forth the only way again absent pardon that a person can demonstrate these requisite facts in the court of federal a certificate from the court in which such facts are alleged to appear.id.this intricate statutory scheme renders several conclusions inescapable.
first,congress clearly did not provide in the unjust conviction and imprisonment act an avenue for monetary compensation to all whose criminal convictions are reversed after incarceration.see betts united states,cir united states keegan.rather,the phrasing of the act and its legislative history proclaim the care with which its framers guarded against opening wide the door through which the treasury may be assailed by persons erroneously convicted.united states brunner,cir see also,at,quoted in keegan.at noting that congress enacted this statute to provide only certain innocent persons the ability to present a claim for financial indemnity upon showing their innocence.as the eighth circuit has recently recognized,compensates only the truly innocent.united states racing,cir citing betts,at 
second,and just as clear as its intent to permit only the truly innocent to receive a certificate,congress expressly directed that one seeking the certificate bear the burden of not only alleg ing but also prov ing entitlement to the certificate.a see also betts,at rigsbee united states,keegan.at burgess united states.moreover,because it constitutes a waiver of sovereign immunity,t he unjust conviction statute has always been strictly construed.burgess.at osborn united states,cir keegan.at a statute creating a claim against the government should be strictly construed,and may not by implication be extended to cases not plainly within its terms.internal quotation marks omitted.thus,imposes a rigorous burden on those who seek a certificate of innocence.
third,as every court to consider the question has held,t he decision to deny a certificate of innocence is committed to the sound discretion of the district court.racing,at betts,at rigsbee,at eastridge united states,d,keegan.at.accordingly,we review a district court denial of a certificate of innocence for abuse of discretion,racing,at,and must affirm that decision unless the court abused its discretion,or unless the findings underlying its decision were clearly erroneous.betts,at.when a district judge has exercised his substantial discretion to deny a certificate of innocence,we can not require him to stultify himself by certifying an opinion contrary to his real matter what our own view might,perhaps,in a case in which the refusal to certify innocence was completely capricious and without rational basis.rigsbee,at see also humphrey united states,fed.cl,noting the district court broad discretion in deciding whether or not to issue a certificate of innocence,aff,app x fed.cir.
graham does not challenge any of the above principles.indeed,he expressly concedes that the district court had discretion to determine his entitlement to a certificate of innocence,and that we must affirm absent abuse of this discretion or unless the findings underlying it were clearly erroneous.petr.br.given our deferential review,however,even if we assume that the district court abused its discretion in finding graham ineligible for a certificate of innocence under a and the first clause of a graham has not demonstrated that the court abused its discretion in concluding that he failed to meet his burden under the second clause of a,that he did not by misconduct or neglect cause or bring about his own prosecution.we must therefore affirm the district court denial of graham motion for a certificate of innocence.
consistent with,the factfinder designated by district all the evidence relevant to graham conduct and state of mind,and found that graham was at the very least negligent in failing to seek board approval before obtaining cash for sick leave in,and that this neglect brought about his prosecution.graham,d at.ample record evidence supports that finding.indeed,in his first appeal in our court,graham expressly conceded that he needed board approval to cash out sick leave,petr.reply br.in,at,available at wl,and we noted that graham conversions of sick leave were inconsistent with both coa written policies and the employment contract graham prepared and executed.graham,app x at.the district court recited numerous other facts in its account of graham sordid tale of abuse of a position of public trust,graham,d at,and did not abuse its discretion in concluding that they constituted neglect that provided cause for graham prosecution.
in fact,when graham informed his lawyer in of his cash payments,his lawyer advised him that he could not legally cash in his sick leave,and recommended that he return the funds.in,at.although the attorney conclusion proved inaccurate as a matter of law,see graham,app x at,it obviously constituted prudent and reasonable advice in light of the facts at hand.in contrast,graham marked lack of his repeated failure to seek board approval for substantial conversions that violated the terms of an employment contract he had the district court finding that graham neglect brought about his own prosecution.these omissions,combined with substantial evidence of graham imprudent stewardship of coa,constitute a reasonable basis for government officers to prosecute,leading them to conclude as indeed the trier of fact did that graham committed a federal offense by stealing from his employer.
graham relies heavily on the seventh circuit opinion in betts,the only court of appeals decision to find an abuse of discretion in a district court denial of a certificate of innocence.compare racing,at affirming denial of certificate of innocence,osborn,at same,and rigsbee,at same,with betts,at reversing denial of certificate see also brunner,at reversing grant of certificate the court in betts held that a petitioner fails to satisfy the second clause of a only when he has acted or failed to act in such a way as to mislead the authorities into thinking he had committed an offense.id.at.although the betts court acknowledged that n either the statute nor the legislative history elucidates what kind of misconduct or neglect will bar relief,and that the case law is sparse,id.at,the court concluded that congress intended to preclude a certificate w here there has been an attempt to flee,a false confession,the removal of evidence,or an attempt to induce a witness or an expert to give false testimony or opinion,or an analogous attempt to suppress such testimony or opinion,id.at quoting keegan.at.
we reject this narrow reading of subsection a because it effectively reads neglect out of the statute.each of the betts court enumerated examples implicates some element of wrongful intent.indeed,the seventh circuit appears to limit denial on neglect grounds to situations in which a defendant has it within his means to avoid prosecution but elects not to do so.id.emphasis added.tellingly,the betts court draws its examples of neglect from the discussion in keegan of willful misconduct,see keegan.at,not of conduct that constitutes neglect or negligence,the prior statutory term,which keegan never addresses.although betts seeks to avoid a reading of that would require courts to assess the virtue of a petitioner behavior even when it does not amount to a criminal offense,at,the statute misconduct or neglect language on its face captures noncriminal conduct and thus requires just such an assessment.
moreover,even if we did accept the betts construction of,we could not conclude that the district court abused its discretion here.the court found that,given that the written contract did not permit the conversions and that graham had obtained board approval to modify the contract in,his failure to do so in at the very least constituted neglect and provided prosecutors a basis for charging that he intentionally stole from his employer.graham repeated failure to seek board approval in,while insufficient to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,could reasonably be said to constitute omission s by the petitioner that misle d the authorities as to his culpability.betts,at.
further,nothing in our opinion reversing graham conviction foreclosed the district court finding that graham neglect caused his prosecution.rather,we expressly cabined our reversal,holding only that a reasonable trier of fact could not find,beyond a reasonable doubt,that graham knowingly stole any money from coa.graham,app x at.in reversing graham criminal conviction,we had no occasion to address the question of his misconduct or neglect,but instead expressly limited our analysis to his claim of insufficient evidence.see id.at.the closest we came to a discussion of misconduct or neglect was to acknowledge the damning nature of some of the evidence against graham,but to distinguish it from proof necessary for conviction.id.at t hese facts are irrelevant so far as the district court determination of guilt is concerned.our conclusion that i n essence,the board gave graham the ability to cash out his accrued sick leave early without any limitation,id.at we reached in narrowly addressing the issue of criminal open the possibility that graham nonetheless acted with neglect in failing to take the prudent,established course of seeking board approval to circumvent express company policy.
what graham refuses to recognize is that the government failure to offer sufficient evidence to prove his guilt does not require the district court,in considering the same evidence,to find him entitled to a certificate of innocence.see,racing,at a reversal of the criminal conviction based on insufficiency of the prosecution evidence does not entitle the defendant to a certificate of innocence.at trial,the government had to prove,as a matter of fact,that graham acted with a guilty state of mind,that he intended to steal from his employer.we have held that the government failed to meet its burden of proof on this issue,and so reversed his conviction.but to obtain a certificate of innocence,graham must address the same issue and prove,as a matter of fact,not only that he acted with no criminal intent but also that no neglect on his part caused his prosecution.
the district court exercised its discretion to conclude that graham,who presented no evidence in support of his application,failed to prove this.we can discern nothing completely capricious and without rational basis,rigsbee,at,in that conclusion.although a reasonable trier of fact might disagree,the district court finding was surely reasonable in light of the record evidence.
in sum,the district court painstaking,analysis of the evidence that had been admitted during graham bench trial resulted in a conclusion consistent with,supported by the facts,and permitted perhaps even suggested by our earlier decision.see graham,app x at.the district court,which acquitted graham on of counts,expressly recognized the difference between b ad conduct and criminal conduct.graham,wl,at.and while we have held graham neglectful conduct irrelevant in determining his criminal guilt,renders this evidence relevant,indeed critical,in determining his eligibility for a certificate of innocence.we find no abuse of discretion.
before concluding,we must briefly respond to the dissent contention that we have misread the second clause of a.our friend in dissent maintains that this clause requires a petitioner to prove only that he did not cause his prosecution by misconduct or neglect that is separate from the charged conduct.dissent at emphasis added.
the plain language of the statute forecloses this theory.section a provides that in addition to proving that h e did not commit any of the acts charged or that those acts are not criminal,a petitioner must prove that he did not by misconduct or neglect cause or bring about his own prosecution.a.the statute does not in any way limit the type of causative misconduct or neglect that will bar relief.to make its argument then,the dissent must and does insert a modifier other,additional,subsequent,or separate before misconduct in the second clause of a.see dissent at.thus,under the dissent view,the statute would require a petitioner to prove only that he did not by other or additional or subsequent or separate misconduct or neglect cause or bring about his own prosecution.congress could have so legislated.but it did not.
rather,the plain language of the statute dictates that any misconduct or neglect that cause s or bring s about a petitioner prosecution renders him ineligible for a certificate of innocence.in the face of the unambiguous words of the statute,we can not construe a to add language that congress omitted.see united states deluxe cleaners laundry,cir noting that it is not permissible to construe a statute on the basis of a mere surmise as to what the legislature intended and to assume that it failed to state something other than what it plainly stated internal quotation marks omitted.this is so particularly when the statute we interpret waives sovereign immunity.see middlebrooks leavitt,cir noting that waivers of sovereign immunity must be construed strictly in favor of the sovereign and not enlarged beyond what the language requires quoting united states nordic.indeed,the supreme court has directed that proper statutory construction begins with the language of the statute,and when,as here,the statutory language provides a clear answer,it ends there as well.hughes aircraft jacobson,u,internal quotation marks omitted.
contrary to the dissent suggestion,our decision to give effect to the plain language of the statute,and our refusal to add to or disregard any of its language,does not conflate the first and second clauses of a or render the first clause incoherent or unnecessary.dissent at.the first clause requires a petitioner to prove that he did not commit the charged criminal acts or that they do not constitute a crime the second clause requires him to prove that his misconduct or neglect did not cause or bring about his prosecution.the first clause addresses criminal conduct the second addresses acts of misconduct or neglect.therefore,the two clauses require a court to ask two distinct questions about the defendant conduct.even the dissent recognizes that a person may commit an act constituting misconduct or neglect without committing a crime.see id.at listing examples.
nothing in a or in simple logic requires the conclusion that a finding that a given act is not a crime mandates a finding that it does not constitute misconduct or neglect.rather,because only acts of misconduct or neglect that cause or bring about a petitioner own prosecution disqualify him from relief,it seems likely that those acts often will have originally been charged as crimes,as they were here.in the dissent view,however,only acts that do not garner criminal charges of their own and yet somehow cause the levying of other charges may prevent a petitioner from receiving compensation from the government under the second clause of a.but an appellate court holding that certain acts are not criminal surely does not eliminate the possibility that those acts nonetheless constitute misconduct or neglect that cause d the prosecution.indeed,in keegan,one of the first and most exhaustive interpretations of what is now,the court concluded that the petitioner did not qualify for a certificate of innocence in part because the very conduct for which he was charged constitute d wil l ful misconduct which contributed to bring about his arrest and conviction.at.
in sum,it is the dissent that offers a novel interpretation of,which if adopted would create a circuit split.see dissent at.although,as explained within,we disagree with the seventh circuit cramped reading of the statute,neither that court nor any other has held that acts charged as crimes but ultimately found not to be criminal can not constitute acts of misconduct or neglect causing the petitioner prosecution.in fact,as noted above,even if we adopted the statutory construction of the betts court,we would have to hold that the district court in this case did not abuse its discretion in denying graham a certificate of innocence.for even the betts court concluded that the disqualifying misconduct or neglect need only constitute an affirmative act or an omission by the petitioner that misleads the authorities as to his culpability.at.graham failure in to seek board approval to modify his contract so as to convert sick leave to cash certainly constitutes such an act or omission.
we of course regret that graham suffered imprisonment for an unsupported conviction.however,congress has determined that this unfortunate fact alone does not establish eligibility for damages against the government.rather,vests the court that heard the evidence at trial with the discretion to ascertain not just whether a defendant is not guilty,but whether he is in fact entitled to a certificate of innocence.because the district court did not abuse that discretion,we must affirm.
both the district court and the majority misconstrue,imposing a standard of their own design in place of what is required by the statute.congress made clear that in order to recover under,a petitioner must prove that the charged acts did not constitute a crime.separately,a petitioner must prove that he did not cause his own prosecution through some other misconduct or neglect.the majority errs by conflating these two elements,requiring a petitioner to show not only that the charged acts were not criminal but also that those acts conform to some amorphous,unwritten code of conduct.today,through its novel interpretation of the statute,the majority creates a circuit split and encourages the government to prosecute acts it deems immoral rather than acts that are criminal under the law.
in order to obtain a certificate of innocence and collect money damages for wrongful imprisonment,a petitioner must satisfy three requirements under.he must prove the record of the court setting aside or reversing such conviction establishes that his conviction has been reversed or set aside on the ground that he is not guilty of the offense of which he was convicted,a either he did not commit any of the acts charged or his acts,deeds,or omissions in connection with such charge constituted no offense against the united states,or any state,territory or the district of columbia,a and he did not by misconduct or neglect cause or bring about his own prosecution,a.
the majority relies on the substantial discretion afforded to the district court in determining whether or not a petitioner has successfully met his burden under the statute.see op.at.however,this case can not rest on the district court discretion because the district court failure to correctly apply the statute is an error of law,which is necessarily an abuse of discretion.see thorn life ins,cir.under the majority reading,a person who has met the standard set forth in a must not only show that they are truly innocent under the first prong of a,but additionally that the same,conduct does not constitute negligence under the second prong of a.inserting this extraneous impediment into the statute is unwarranted and unsupported by the law.i therefore would reverse the district court and remand with instructions to grant the certificate of innocence.
the first two requirements under the statute,a and the first prong of a,evince congress intent to compensate only those who are truly innocent,both of the charges for which they were convicted and any other crime which their conduct could constitute.see betts united states,f d,cir citing burgess united states,consequently,it would be necessary to separate from the group of persons whose convictions have been reversed,those few who are in fact innocent of any offense whatever.citation omitted.
the majority first contends that it is unclear if graham met his burden to prove his actual innocence under a and the first prong of a,asserting that this court merely held that the government failed to prove graham harbored the requisite intent,and therefore reversed his conviction based on insufficiency of the evidence.op.at.however,we made plain in reversing graham conviction that no crime was committed.united states graham,app x,cir.
in overturning his conviction,we held that graham was not required to return to the board for permission to convert his to cash.see id.at quite simply,graham in june and july of and january and february of were not contrary to the authority given to him by the board.the majority makes much of the fact that graham failed to seek the board permission in light of the limitations his employment contract placed on his ability to convert to cash.per the terms of his contract,he was only allowed such a only upon illness or termination.however,we explicitly acknowledged those contractual conditions and held that the board decisions in january,march,and may of resulted in a de facto amendment that overrode these restrictions.id.emphasis added.graham employment contract term was thus altered by the party empowered to do board.our decision reversing graham conviction was therefore not based on some technicality or procedural issue,but rather on finding graham truly innocent of the crime for which he was convicted.t he record of the court reversing graham conviction thus demonstrates that the conviction has been reversed or set aside on the ground that graham is not guilty of the offense of which he was convicted,as is mandated by a.
additionally,in no way does the record below support the inference that graham was guilty of some other,unindicted crime,as is prohibited by a.instead,it is clear that the government pursued every possible charge against graham.graham indictment contained counts,only one of which resulted in a conviction.although the majority points to the district court recitation of graham sordid tale of abuse of a position of public trust,op.at citing united states graham,d,none of that behavior was found to be illegal or even evidence of some further crime of which the government was unable to obtain proof.compare,united states keegan,holding that denial of a certificate of innocence is appropriate in cases where the indictment may fail on the original count,but claimant may yet be guilty of another or minor offense.it is indisputable that graham conduct constituted no offense against the united states,or any state,territory or the district of columbia,as is required under a.
because graham conviction was not overturned on procedural grounds,and nothing in the record indicates that the conduct for which graham was acquitted somehow constitutes a different crime against the united states,graham clearly met his burden under both a and the first clause of a to show that he was truly innocent.
beyond the initial question of whether a petitioner is truly innocent,the final clause of a requires a petitioner to show he did not by misconduct or neglect cause or bring about his own prosecution.a emphasis added.the statute expressly requires a causal connection between the petitioner conduct and his prosecution it does not preclude relief simply because the petitioner engaged in misconduct or neglect period.betts,at emphasis added.it must follow that to give meaning to all words in the statute,one can not cause one own prosecution by engaging in the very conduct which was found to be in the first part of the inquiry.instead,the second prong of the statute must be referring to some additional conduct,be it intentional or unintentional,willful or neglectful,which misleads the authorities into continuing their investigation of,and ultimately prosecuting,a person later cleared of criminal wrongdoing.to say otherwise conflates the acts,deeds,or omissions in connection with the charge referenced in the first clause of a and the misconduct or neglect required in the second clause.
congress made clear that the two inquiries are fundamentally different.a petitioner must show that the underlying conduct for which he was charged was no offense against the united states,or any state,territory,or the district of columbia.a.in other words,the only thing that a petitioner must prove regarding his underlying conduct is that it was not a crime.the second clause of a requires the petitioner show that no other,subsequent conduct during the course of the government investigation induced the government to commence a wrongful prosecution.id.essentially,the misconduct or neglect prong is an estoppel defense that protects the united states treasury against defendants who could have thwarted a prosecution that had already begun,but instead went to prison and then attempted to collect money damages 
any other reading of the statute would be nonsensical.why would congress explicitly specify that a petitioner need only prove that the acts,deeds,or omissions for which he was charged constituted no offense against the united states,only to further require in the next clause proof that those same acts were not an offense against any private entity,public decorum or social mores if congress intended this result,surely it would not have limited a petitioner burden regarding the charged acts to offenses against the state instead it would have remained silent or at minimum broadened the offenses to include more than actual crimes.but it did not do so.instead,the statute clearly demarcates the sphere of charged acts as separate from the misconduct or neglect which cause or bring about the prosecution.thus,a petitioner could cause his own prosecution by giving a false confession,removing evidence,or by failing to disclose clearly exculpatory evidence within his possession,either intentionally or carelessly.though this list is not exhaustive,it certainly encompasses conduct which constitutes misconduct and neglect,which,under a,could cause the petitioner prose
