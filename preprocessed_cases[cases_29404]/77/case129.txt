a jury convicted erik dehlinger of three counts of filing false income tax returns.he received a sentence of months imprisonment and one year of supervised release and was ordered to pay in restitution and a fine of.dehlinger appealed his conviction and sentence,and we affirmed.dehlinger then moved for habeas relief,asserting that his trial counsel had labored under a prejudicial conflict of interest in violation of dehlinger sixth amendment rights.following an extensive evidentiary hearing,in which dehlinger,his trial counsel,and other witnesses testified,the district court,in a thorough and opinion,denied dehlinger habeas relief.the court did,however,grant dehlinger a certificate of appealability pursuant to.for the reasons below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
dehlinger sixth amendment challenge rests on his trial counsel relationships with three individuals tara lagrand,gary kuzel,and collis redd who were involved in the same fraudulent scheme that gave rise to his convictions.dehlinger maintains that these relationships produced conflicts of interest that prevented his trial counsel from calling these individuals as witnesses to provide exculpatory testimony at his trial.
dehlinger convictions arose from his involvement with anderson ark and associates aaa,which marketed programs enabling users to avoid current income tax liability and recapture taxes paid in the previous two years.dehlinger began using the aaa tax programs in.he first became involved with the aaa through george benoit,an employee of an aaa affiliate called guardian management,and richard marks,an aaa planner,i,an aaa employee who prepared client tax returns and other documents that formed the basis of the fraudulent tax schemes.benoit prepared dehlinger,and tax returns using aaa tax schemes.tara lagrand,another aaa planner,prepared dehlinger and amended tax returns.use of the aaa programs resulted in a substantial benefit to dehlinger.in the three years he used the programs,he avoided in tax liability and obtained annual refunds on his income taxes despite earning,as an emergency room doctor,between and per year.
in,the government began its investigation of dehlinger.the government offered dehlinger a plea agreement,in which he would plead guilty to one felony and cooperate with the government.during plea negotiations,robert stientjes and other lawyers represented dehlinger.when dehlinger rejected the plea,the government indicted him in august.then,dehlinger,relying on a recommendation from one of stientjes partners,retained scott engelhard as his trial counsel to work along with stientjes at trial.
dehlinger retained engelhard based largely on engelhard relative success as counsel for aaa planner tara lagrand in her trial in seattle,washington the jury deadlocked over the charges against lagrand in that trial.subsequently,lagrand still represented by engelhard accepted a guilty plea and was sentenced to months imprisonment and one year of supervised release.in lagrand plea agreement,she admitted that she knowingly prepared false loan statements and tax deductions.this directly contradicted her trial testimony,in which she had claimed that she did not know the aaa programs were illegal.lagrand plea agreement contained a waiver of the right to appeal.thus,engelhard representation of lagrand at her trial effectively ended with her sentencing in september.
one year after that representation ceased,and before undertaking his representation of dehlinger,engelhard obtained a conflict waiver from lagrand.in that waiver,lagrand identified engelhard as her former attorney and stated that t o the extent that there might be any apparent conflict of interest,i do hereby waive that conflict of interest so that engelhard can represent dehlinger at trial.accordingly,when retained by dehlinger in the autumn of,engelhard no longer represented lagrand,and lagrand had waived any continuing duties engelhard might have owed her.
with engelhard as his lead counsel,dehlinger proceeded to trial in.on october,after a trial,the jury found dehlinger guilty of tax fraud on his,and tax returns.
a few weeks after dehlinger conviction,engelhard contacted lagrand to inform her that the lawyers for other aaa clients had written him asking for her contact information.those lawyers ultimately subpoenaed lagrand to testify before the district court in seattle,washington in the prosecution of other aaa clients.engelhard was appointed to serve as lagrand counsel in this matter due to his familiarity with the aaa prosecutions.the district court in seattle docketed engelhard as lagrand counsel as of november,one and one half months following the conclusion of dehlinger trial.engelhard filed a motion to quash the subpoena of lagrand on fifth amendment grounds.in march,dehlinger fired engelhard when he learned that engelhard had filed this motion on behalf of lagrand.
after his unsuccessful appeal of his convictions and sentence,engelhard moved for habeas relief pursuant to.the district court held a evidentiary hearing on dehlinger motion.during that hearing,the court considered substantial documentary evidence and heard the testimony of several witnesses,including dehlinger,engelhard,stientjes,and lagrand.
dehlinger testified that his sole defense at trial was his good faith reliance on the assurances of aaa planners that the aaa tax plans were legal.he asserted that he wanted engelhard to call aaa planners lagrand,kuzel,and redd to testify as to these assurances,but that engelhard repeatedly advised him that their testimony would be harmful rather than helpful.dehlinger contended that engelhard decision not to call lagrand,kuzel,or redd as witnesses was driven by a conflict of interest arising from engelhard prior representation of them.
dehlinger also offered evidence that lagrand had written a novel based on engelhard earlier representation of her,in which she depicted scott the character modeled after engelhard as a hero.lagrand herself testified at the hearing that she was in awe of engelhard.in addition,she stated that she believed dehlinger tax returns were legal when she prepared them for dehlinger and that she told him that.but lagrand acknowledged that she had ultimately pled guilty to fraud in connection with her preparation of aaa returns,invoked her fifth amendment privilege and refused to testify at the trial of another aaa defendant,and had not appeared voluntarily at the hearing.although dehlinger argued that engelhard represented lagrand during dehlinger trial,he provided no evidence to support this contention 
engelhard testified that he felt pretty clear before he even started to represent dehlinger that calling aaa planners as witnesses would not be the best way to present dehlinger defense.in their preliminary discussions,engelhard informed dehlinger of this assessment.nevertheless,engelhard explored the option of calling aaa planners.he ultimately concluded that given their status as convicted felons or affiliates of aaa,which a jury had found to be a fraudulent scheme the risks inherent in their testimony outweighed any benefits.
as to redd and kuzel,engelhard testified that dehlinger said he had never interacted with them,and for this reason engelhard concluded that they were not qualified to testify on dehlinger behalf.as to lagrand,engelhard testified that he believed she would make an especially poor witness for dehlinger because she had testified at her trial that she was completely innocent but then later entered a guilty plea and so could be impeached on.engelhard also thought lagrand testimony would not aid dehlinger because,since she lacked experience in corporate and offshore matters,a good prosecutor could make her look like someone that nobody should believe as a planner in complicated matters like this.stientjes agreed with this assessment when engelhard explained his reasoning to stientjes and dehlinger prior to undertaking dehlinger representation.
engelhard also opted not to call as witnesses other aaa planners with whom he had no past relationship.engelhard testified that he had considered including aaa affiliate benoit as a witness.he believed that b
