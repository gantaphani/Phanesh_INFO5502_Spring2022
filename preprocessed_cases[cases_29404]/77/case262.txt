during his meteoric rise from serving as a local ukrainian official to prime minister of ukraine,pavel ivanovich lazarenko formed multiple business relationships and engaged in a tangled series of business transactions that netted him millions of dollars.lazarenko kept his money in foreign bank accounts,transferring funds from one account to another across the globe in an effort,so he was accused,to disguise and conceal the sources and ownership of the proceeds from the ukrainian people.after the money passed through bank accounts in the united states,from swiss,and other accounts,the united states charged him in a indictment with conspiracy,money laundering,wire fraud,and interstate transportation of stolen property.lazarenko was convicted on fourteen counts and now challenges those convictions on appeal.we affirm eight of his convictions,but reverse six others.
background 
during the,lazarenko was a public official in ukraine.for several years he served in regional governmental positions,including as governor of the dnepropetrovsk region of ukraine.he rose to the level of ukrainian first vice prime minister in and in may,lazarenko was appointed prime minister.following a rift in his relationship with president leonid kuchma,he was dismissed from this position in july.he then became a member of the ukrainian parliament and led the opposition hromada party.
while serving as a government official,lazarenko became involved in the affairs of a number of businesses and formed relationships with prominent businessmen.the united states alleged that certain of lazarenko business relationships amounted to extortion and that he defrauded the ukranian people by obtaining interests in companies,allocating privileges to cronies,and then failing to disclose his assets and wealth as required on ukranian financial disclosure forms.the government identified five arrangements that formed the basis for the charges in the indictment.
a.the underlying schemes 
extortion of kiritchenko 
according to testimony at trial,lazarenko was extremely powerful as the governor of the dnepropetrovsk region of ukraine and in his other public roles.he required businesses to pay him fifty percent of their profits in exchange for his influence to make the businesses successful.conversely,lazarenko used his influence to disadvantage the businesses if he was not paid.
in,peter kiritchenko,a businessman,formed a company known as agrosnabsbyt,which was involved in agriculture and metals.in,kiritchenko met with lazarenko because,according to kiritchenko,to do any kind of serious trade one needed lazarenko agreement.lazarenko informed kiritchenko that he worked with everyone,which kiritchenko interpreted as meaning that lazarenko would control fifty percent of the business and take fifty of the profits.kiritchenko initially transferred to lazarenko as a gesture of good faith.in january,kiritchenko transferred a fifty percent interest in agrosnabsbyt to ekaterina karova,a relative of lazarenko,and transferred fifty percent of the profits from the business to accounts controlled by lazarenko.later,lazarenko and kiritchenko partnered to move lazarenko money between accounts and together they purchased the european federal credit bank eurofed.
extortion of dityatkovsky 
according to the indictment,lazarenko established a similar relationship with alexei alexandrovich dityatkovsky.in,lazarenko met dityatkovsky and took a fifty percent interest in his company,dneproneft,along with fifty percent of the profits as well.lazarenko share went to his driver and to an associate.
naukovy state farm 
while lazarenko was governor of dnepropetrovsk,he was also actively involved in the operations of naukovy state farm naukovy,a dairy operation that was directed by mykola agafonov naukovy also had secured the right to export metal products and raw materials.naukovy purchased cattle and farm equipment from a dutch company,van der ploeg von terpstra van der ploeg.van der ploeg kept a foreign currency account at abn amro bank for its business with naukovy the abn amro account.unbeknownst to van der ploeg chief accountant,agafonov was given access to this account for his own use.agafonov used the money in the abn amro account to,among other things,purchase a bmw and pay his credit card bills.
lazarenko was also actively involved in the operations at nikopolsky metal works factory nikopolsky.at his direction,million was transferred from nikopolsky to van der ploeg abn amro account supposedly to purchase wheat on behalf of naukovy to combat a food crisis that was plaguing ukraine at the time the accountant for naukovy and the bookkeeper for van der ploeg both testified that they did not know whether wheat was ever purchased.the records reflect that million was transferred from the abn amro account to agafonov account in hungary at postabank the postabank account.in turn,million was transferred from the postabank account to an account known as lip handel,controlled by lazarenko in switzerland.lazarenko then transferred the money from this swiss account to various banks,including a million transfer to an account controlled by kiritchenko at bank of america in san francisco,california.
united energy systems of ukraine 
eventually,lazarenko became the first prime minister of ukraine and was responsible for the energy section within the government.according to the indictment,an associate of lazarenko,yulia tymoshenko,created a natural gas company,united energy systems of ukraine uesu,which received deliveries of gas from rao gazprom.uesu was held in large part by united energy international,ueil,which was owned by a turkish national.uesu conveyed title to the gas to ueil such that payments from ukrainian customers for gas were diverted to ueil.ueil did not pay rao gazprom for the gas deliveries with the money it received from customers.instead,it transferred approximately million to a cypriot company,somolli,that was controlled,in part,by tymoshenko.ueil and somolli transferred million to accounts controlled by kiritchenko in switzerland,poland,and the united states.kiritchenko then transferred million to accounts controlled by lazarenko in switzerland and antigua.lazarenko made two transfers of million each from one of these accounts to accounts in the united states.
lazarenko and kiritchenko also allegedly controlled a panamanian company,ghp ghp.according to the government,in,lazarenko,by then prime minister,caused the ukrainian cabinet of ministers to contract with ghp for the purchase of six homes.ghp turned to pacific modern homes pmh in california and purchased six homes for.the cabinet of ministers purchased the homes from ghp for.ghp produced false invoices to customs officials to make it appear that it had shipped the homes and paid for them.half of the profit realized by ghp was deposited into an account controlled by lazarenko.
b.the charges 
based on lazarenko business activities,the government brought numerous charges.count charged lazarenko with conspiracy to commit money laundering,in violation of h,for conducting financial transactions that involved the proceeds of extortion,wire fraud,and receipt and transfer of property that was stolen.
counts through charged lazarenko with money laundering,in violation of a.the indictment specifically identified four wire transfers from kiritchenko abs trading account in san francisco to lazarenko account in geneva,switzerland in and early.counts through charged lazarenko with money laundering,in violation of a b.these transactions allegedly occurred in november,august,and september.all the money laundering counts were based on the specific unlawful activities of receipt and transfer of property that was stolen,unlawfully converted,and taken by fraud,in violation of and extortion as specified in c b ii and wire fraud in violation of and.id.
counts through charged lazarenko with wire fraud in violation of and.specifically,lazarenko was charged with honest services fraud against the people of ukraine for obtaining ownership interests in agrosnabsbyt,dneproneft,and ghp,using his authority and influence to grant these companies privileges,and receiving money from these businesses.the indictment identified specific wire transfers in and.
counts through charged lazarenko with transportation of stolen property in violation of.the indictment identified a wire transfer in and several others in and.
dismissal of some charges 
at the close of the government,the district court granted in part lazarenko rule motion for a judgment of acquittal.the scope of the indictment was massive and the trial testimony voluminous.the district court carefully reviewed the evidence in addressing the rule motion.significantly,the district court dismissed the allegations that related to lazarenko relationship with uesu.the district court ruled that the government failed to prove that there was fraud in lazarenko alleged dealings with uesu,that lazarenko failure to inform the ukrainian people that he was receiving money from uesu was a material omission in support of the government property fraud theory,or that there was material harm to support the theory that the uesu dealings constituted honest services fraud.the court also held that the money laundering charges could not rest on the property fraud theory with respect to uesu.
the court further concluded that the evidence did not support charges arising out of the fraud because the government failed to establish the element of material harm.on the government motion,the court dismissed the allegations regarding dityatkovsky.altogether,the court dismissed counts counts through wire fraud,count wire fraud,counts through interstate transportation of stolen property,and count interstate transportation of stolen property.
following the jury verdict of guilty on all of the remaining counts,the district court partially granted lazarenko renewed rule motion and dismissed counts through and counts through.the court concluded that n o reasonable jury could find that the transfers in counts wire fraud and counts interstate transportation of stolen property represented the proceeds of kiritchenko extortion or naukovy fraud.the court further concluded that counts and,for wire fraud and interstate transportation of stolen property,respectively,failed because the government theory that the funds involved in that alleged transfer had been extorted from kiritchenko was not supported by the indictment.finally,the court dismissed counts through,which charged lazarenko with interstate transportation of stolen property,because the court found that there were sufficient clean funds in the accounts at issue to cover the transfers.
lazarenko now challenges his remaining convictions on counts through,through,and.
ii.analysis 
sufficiency of the indictment 
lazarenko argues that the indictment must be dismissed because it failed to allege that his conduct violated ukrainian law.we review the sufficiency of an indictment de novo.united states berger,cir.an indictment is sufficient if it contains the elements of the offense charged and fairly informs a defendant of the charge against which he must defend and enables him to plead an acquittal or conviction in bar of future prosecutions for the same offense.hamling united states,d.a n indictment should be read in its entirety,construed according to common sense,and interpreted to include facts which are necessarily implied.berger,at quoting united states king,cir.unless the defendant was misled and thereby prejudiced,neither an error in a citation nor a citation omission is a ground to dismiss the indictment or information or to reverse a conviction.c.
the indictment tracks the statutory language in charging money laundering,wire fraud and interstate transportation of stolen property.we have previously held that those statutes set forth the essential elements of these offenses.see united states savage,cir money laundering united states ladum,cir money laundering united states bonallo,cir wire fraud united states rosi,cir interstate transportation of stolen property.lazarenko seeks to import an additional element into these offenses,claiming that the ukrainian law at issue is also an essential element because the government must prove a violation of ukrainian law to sustain a conviction.
nothing in our case law supports requiring the government to plead a specific violation of foreign law in an indictment.indeed,lazarenko challenge does not achieve novelty status simply because it involves foreign law.to analyze his claim,we look for guidance to our general precedent on indictments.for example,when bringing charges of money laundering,the government need not allege all the elements of the specified unlawful activity,the underlying offense.see united states lomow,cir united states golb,cir.here,the violation of ukrainian law is the specified unlawful activity.
nor can it be said that the omission of a citation to foreign law in the charges of wire fraud and interstate transportation of stolen property misled or prejudiced lazarenko.see.c.the indictment provided detailed allegations regarding the basis for the charges,including dates,amounts,account numbers,and sources of the money.berger,at.significantly,the jury was instructed that it had to find a violation of ukranian law and was provided with the elements of the relevant ukranian statutes.
relying on richardson united states,d,lazarenko contends that there is a long list of predicate offenses to the money laundering statute and without a finding regarding the specific predicate offense,there is a risk of disagreement among the jurors as to what the defendant did.this argument falters,though,because not only did the supreme court not comment on the sufficiency of an indictment in richardson,here the indictment identified interstate transportation of stolen property,extortion,and wire fraud as the specified unlawful activit ies and provided detailed allegations regarding each of these offenses.there was little room for jurors to disagree on the underlying offenses.the indictment against lazarenko was legally sufficient.
wire fraud through 
lazarenko claims that the government constructively amended the indictment following the court dismissal of the uesu allegations by changing its theory to argue that the wire transfers charged as wire fraud in counts and of the indictment were in furtherance of the naukovy fraud.he also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence on counts through.
we review de novo whether there has been a constructive amendment to an indictment.united states pang,cir.a constructive amendment occurs when the defendant is charged with one crime but,in effect,is tried for another crime.pang,at.
the indictment charged generally that the accounts involved in the transfers alleged as wire fraud in counts to received proceeds from both fraud and extortion.however,under the heading the uesu fraud,the government alleged more specifically that 
between february of and september of,the money from somolli,along with other funds,totaling more than was transferred from kiritchenko accounts into accounts controlled by lazarenko in switzerland and antigua.thereafter,lazarenko transferred portions of these funds from switzerland into bank accounts in the northern district of california,including two transfers of each on august.
count and count both allege a transfer of million into a bank account in the northern district of california on august.the plainest reading of these allegations is that the transfers in counts and are the same two transfers alleged under the heading the uesu fraud.when the district court dismissed the uesu allegations after the close of the government,counts and should have been dismissed as well.
the government asserted in its brief that the million transfers were not necessarily funds derived from the uesu scheme because the indictment alleged that money from somolli,along with other funds,was deposited into lazarenko swiss bank account.we decline to read this phrase as turning the two million transfers into proceeds from the naukovy fraud.the paragraph in which these allegations are found begins,lazarenko received and transferred money that had been stolen,converted and taken by fraud in connection with the distribution of natural gas in ukraine as follows.each allegation following relates directly to the uesu scheme,including allegations about the parties involved and payments between ueil,somolli,and uesu.it simply makes no sense to read this paragraph as concluding with lazarenko transferring money from a completely different scheme.the details of the transfers in this paragraph and in counts and are identical and the only logical conclusion that can be drawn is that those counts are premised on the uesu scheme.
at oral argument,the government claimed that an allegation in a later paragraph,paragraph,supported its argument that the transfers of million in counts and were part of the naukovy fraud.this paragraph,though,does not advance the government position.the portion of the paragraph to which the government points merely alleges that b etween and,lazarenko received at least from naukovy state farm.this allegation neither speaks to whether two transfers of million were made in august,nor does anything there cause us to read the allegations under the uesu fraud any differently.
even with the government shift in theory,the government failed to provide sufficient evidence to support lazarenko wire fraud convictions on counts and,as well as on counts,and.we evaluate a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence by viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution.jackson virginia,d.evidence is sufficient to support a conviction if,viewed in this light,a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.id.
we first address a threshold question,namely whether the government must trace the wire transfer proceeds back to some unlawful activity.lazarenko puts it this way whether a wire transfer not proven to contain proceeds of theft or fraud for the purpose of a transporting stolen property offense can be found,on the same evidence,to contain such illegal proceeds.this argument on the government burden in the context of interstate transportation of stolen property.
to sustain a conviction for interstate transportation of stolen property,the government must prove that the money transported was stolen,converted,taken by fraud,or derived from such property.see united states morgan,cir.the property must be directly traceable to the fraud or theft.id.at.by contrast,in a money laundering charge,the commingling of tainted money with clean money taints the entire account.see united states english,cir.the money transferred from a commingled account does not need to be traceable to fraud,theft,or any wrongdoing at all.it is enough that the money,even if innocently obtained,was commingled in an account with money that was obtained illegally.see id.
wire fraud does not necessarily rest on the characterization of the funds.it is that the wire used in the wire fraud scheme need only have been in furtherance of the scheme.schreiber distrib.furniture,cir see,united states johnson,cir upholding a wire fraud conviction where the wire involved was a telephone call.in a case such as this,where the wire at issue is a wire transfer of funds that are connected to an unlawful activity,the in furtherance inquiry may be met without a strict tracing of the wired funds.we decline to narrow the in furtherance focus by requiring the funds to be traced back to a particular unlawful activity 
we turn,then,to the question whether the wire transfers alleged in counts to were in furtherance of the naukovy fraud.to support a wire fraud charge,the wire must be incident to the execution of the scheme and not part of an transaction that,although foreseeable,was not in furtherance of the defendant fraudulent scheme.united states lo,cir explaining the principle in the context of mail fraud united states manarite,cir finding that mailings and phone calls made after a credit scam was completed were not in furtherance of an ongoing scheme.the importance of the temporal aspect of the wire transfer to the underlying scheme is best illustrated in our case law t he pertinent question is not whether or not the defendant had obtained all the money she expected to get before the wire occurred.rather,the wire can occur after the defendant has obtained her fee,if the wire is part of the execution of the scheme as conceived by the perpetrator at the time.lo,at quoting united states sampson,d schmuck united states,d.
the wire transfers at issue occurred in and,approximately three or four years after the money was wired into the account.counts and are transfers of million from lazarenko account in switzerland to kiritchenko eurofed accounts at pacific bank in california and at commercial bank of san francisco.count is a transfer of million from lazarenko eurofed account in switzerland to a eurofed account at hambrecht quist in california.counts and are transfers of million and million from lazarenko lady lake account in the bahamas to kiritchenko account at commercial bank of san francisco and to an account controlled by lazarenko at westamerica bank in california.
the government theory was that these transfers were meant to hide lazarenko fraudulent activity as he sought political office.kiritchenko testified at trial that lazarenko closed his bank account in switzerland in,after lazarenko was dismissed as prime minister.this account contained close to million.he explained that lazarenko made the transfers that are alleged in counts to of the indictment because he was under investigation in ukraine and did not want his assets frozen.
under the facts of this case,we conclude no rational trier of fact could find that these transfers in and were in furtherance of the naukovy fraud,which centered on allegedly shady agricultural and personal purchases.the fraudulent activity was completed,and the money concealed,in,when the money reached lazarenko control and he deposited it into coded bank accounts where it remained for three years.subsequent transfers were not part of the scheme as it was originally conceived.lo,at.nothing in the evidence supports an inference,let alone a conviction,on the grounds that the transfers were simply a delayed link in the fraudulent chain.
if the government theory were correct,then it would be possible for an ordinary fraud to be converted into wire fraud simply by the perpetrator picking up the telephone three years later and asking a friend if he can store some property in his garage before the police execute a search warrant or later taking the proceeds of fraud and transferring them to another bank.the government theory extends an already broad statute too far.concealing the source and ownership of property in downstream transactions is better understood as money laundering absent evidence that the wire transfer is incident to an essential part of the scheme.lo,at quoting pereira united states.emphasis omitted.
we reverse lazarenko convictions on counts through.
money through 
our reversal of lazarenko convictions on counts to does not,as lazarenko urges,require us to reverse his convictions on counts,and for money laundering.count alleged that in november lazarenko laundered million from a eurofed account at commercial bank in san francisco to another eurofed account.just three months earlier,in august,the commercial bank account had received the million transfer that was charged as wire fraud in count.count alleged that lazarenko laundered million by drawing a check on the account of one of his companies,dugsbery,and using it to purchase a home in marin county,california,in.count charges lazarenko with an unlawful transfer of million from one dugsbery account at westamerica bank to another at bank boston robertson stevens,also in.the money in the dugsbery account can be traced to lazarenko lady lake bank account in the bahamas the transfer of money from lady lake to the dugsbery account was charged as wire fraud in count.
the funds in the san francisco eurofed account and in the dugsbery westamerica account can be traced back to lazarenko large account,where he deposited proceeds from his naukovy fraud and from his extortion of kiritchenko.the government contends that even if lazarenko wire fraud convictions are reversed,the money laundering charges in counts,and still rest on lazarenko laundering of funds extorted from kiritchenko.
the government was somewhat inconsistent in how it portrayed these counts to the jury.during its closing argument,when summing up counts,and,the government at times referred only to the fraud allegations,making no mention of extortion proceeds.nonetheless,argument is not evidence,and the evidence shows that proceeds from extortion ended up in the eurofed accounts and in the dugsbery account.at trial,the government showed that lazarenko laundered proceeds from the extortion.recognizing that we consider these facts in the light most favorable to the government,jackson,at,we affirm the convictions on counts,and.
money through 
we affirm lazarenko money laundering convictions on counts through.the statute clearly lists extortion as a foreign offense that may be a predicate offense for money laundering.c b ii.lazarenko asserts that extortion as it was used in the money laundering statute,at the time of his conduct,is limited to extortion through violence and the extortion he is charged with is more akin to bribery.we review de novo t he district court interpretation of the money laundering statute and the scope of the conduct covered by the statute.united states deeb,cir.
generally speaking,criminalizes the laundering of the proceeds of a specified unlawful activity.during the period alleged in the indictment against lazarenko,specified unlawful activity was defined to include 
a any act or activity constituting an offense listed in section of this title except an act which is indictable under subchapter ii of chapter of title 
b with respect to a financial transaction occurring in whole or in part in the united states,an offense against a foreign nation involving 
i the manufacture,importation,sale,or distribution of a controlled substance as such term is defined for the purposes of the controlled substances act 
ii kidnapping,robbery,or extortion or 
iii fraud,or any scheme or attempt to defraud,by or against a foreign bank as defined in paragraph of section b of the international banking act of.
c.in,congress amended this section to include bribery of a public official,or the misappropriation,theft,or embezzlement of public funds by or for the benefit of a public official as a specified unlawful activity.c b iv.
extortion,as it is criminalized under the hobbs act,can be committed through the threat of violence or under color of official right.see evans united states,d.lazarenko urges that extortion as it is used in does not include nonviolent foreign extortion.he claims that such conduct is equivalent to foreign bribery and public corruption and that these offenses were beyond the reach of federal law until the patriot act of 
it is a familiar maxim that a statutory term is generally presumed to have its common law meaning.evans,at.quoting taylor united states,d.at common law,extortion was a crime that resembled what we know as bribery,and involved an abuse of power by a public official.id.at.federal statutes have expanded that definition to include the obtaining of property by force.id.at.
we presume that congress was aware of the common law meaning of extortion when it enacted.as the supreme court has explained,
w here congress borrows terms of art in which are accumulated the legal tradition and meaning of centuries of practice,it presumably knows and adopts the cluster of ideas that were attached to each borrowed word in the body of learning from which it was taken and the meaning its use will convey to the judicial mind unless otherwise instructed.in such case,absence of contrary direction may be taken as satisfaction with widely accepted definitions,not as a departure from them.
evans,at.quoting morissette united states.significantly,congress did not qualify the term in any way that suggests that we should read extortion as excluding the common law definition.the fact that extortion is listed with kidnapping and robbery does not compel us to give the term a narrower meaning or one predicated on force or violence.
the amendment to does not become superfluous if we read extortion to include extortion under color of official right.bribery and extortion under color of official right are not.bribery of a public official extends to the individual who offers the bribe as well as to the public official who accepts the bribe misappropriation,theft,or embezzlement of public funds by or for the benefit of a public official will also capture conduct not punishable as extortion under color of official right because misappropriation,theft,and embezzlement do not necessarily require the quid pro quo of an official action.see evans,at.
the supreme court recent decision in united states santos,d,does not change our analysis of the statute.in santos,the supreme court examined the word proceeds as it was used in.see id.at.the court concluded that the term,left undefined in the statute,was ambiguous as to whether it meant profits or receipts,and so defined it in the more terms of profits,based on the rule of lenity.id.at.
critical to the issue here,the court began its analysis by reaffirming the principle that w hen a term is undefined,we give it its ordinary meaning.id.at.this principle both starts and ends our analysis.the term extortion has an ordinary meaning and it is not ambiguous.unlike the word proceeds,extortion has a common law meaning and federal statutes use the term to mean both extortion by violence and extortion under color of official right.see,evans,at.james united states,d scalia,dissenting citing the travel act,the hobbs act,rico,and the model penal code as examples of statutes with a broad interpretation of extortion.
lazarenko has not directed us to any statute where congress used the word extortion and meant only extortion by violence or only extortion under color of official right.santos.at observing that congress sometimes has defined proceeds to mean receipts and sometimes profits.the ambiguity that the court wrestled with in santos is simply absent with respect to extortion.
interstate transportation of stolen 
lazarenko also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence for his conviction on count for interstate transportation of stolen property.count alleges a transfer of million from lazarenko lip handel account in switzerland to kiritchenko abs trading account at bank of america in california.as noted earlier,this charge requires a tracing of the fraud proceeds,not simply a commingled account.what is totally missing here is evidence from the key account at the hungarian postabank,from which the money was transferred into the lip handel account.
according to the testimony of the former director of nikopolsky,boris velychko,in,lazarenko deputy negotiated for nikopolsky to loan million to a dutch company,van der ploeg,on behalf of naukovy to purchase wheat.the million was transferred to van der ploeg account at abn amro bank in the netherlands in december.the loan to naukovy was repaid in local currency,which,according to velychko,was devalued in.on january,million was transferred from the abn amro account to agafonov account at postabank in hungary.in june,million was transferred from the postabank account to lazarenko lip handel account in switzerland.in july,million was transferred from the lip handel account to kiritchenko abs trading account at bank of america in san francisco.it is this final transfer that is charged as the interstate transportation of stolen property in count.
anyone who transports,transmits,or transfers in interstate or foreign commerce any goods,wares,merchandise,securities or money,of the value of or more,knowing the same to have been stolen,converted or taken by fraud is guilty of interstate transportation of stolen property.we will uphold the conviction if,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,there is sufficient evidence for a rational juror to find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.jackson,at.
the ledger from van der ploeg account at abn amro shows a transfer of million to an account at postabank,and the ledger for lazarenko lip handel at union bank of switzerland shows a receipt of million from postabank,but the glaring gap is that there are no records from postabank at all.the government was unable to produce any documents from postabank itself.lazarenko asserts that this gap is fatal to the government charge of interstate transportation of stolen property because without those records it is impossible to know whether the million that was transferred to lip handel was the proceeds of fraud or derived from the proceeds of fraud.we agree.
the district court instructed the jury that to find lazarenko guilty of interstate transportation of stolen property,the funds that were transferred must be the proceeds of fraud or derived from the proceeds of fraud.this rule has its roots in united states poole,cir.there,the defendant,poole,deposited a check that contained funds into his bank account and then,on the same day,wrote a check on that account for an amount identical to the amount that had been deposited.id.at.he deposited that check into an bank.id.the fifth circuit reversed the conviction because the bank account into which poole deposited the funds had sufficient clean funds to cover the amount of the check that was transported across state lines.id.
the government relies on the seventh circuit ruling in united states quintanilla,cir,to argue that it does not matter whether there were sufficient clean funds in the postabank account to cover the transfer of million to the lip handel account.in quintanilla,the defendants were found guilty of defrauding the heileman brewing company corporate sponsorship program and convicted of,among other charges,interstate transportation of stolen property.id.at.defendant monreal,the director of the program,devised a scheme to receive kickbacks from organizations who received sponsorship awards.id.the money passed from heileman to the organization and the organization would,in turn,pass a portion to monreal.id.quintanilla was the director of one of the organizations,operation search,that had kicked money back to monreal.id.quintanilla argued on appeal that operation search had sufficient clean funds in its account each time a kickback check was drawn and transported to monreal.id.at.the seventh circuit rejected this argument.it explained that,
t he evidence at trial showed,and quintanilla does not dispute,that he agreed to pay monreal a portion of every heileman grant that operation search received.accordingly,the ultimate source of the funds used to pay monreal was heileman.the evidence also showed that quintanilla followed monreal directions concerning exactly how the kickbacks were to be made there is no suggestion that these directions were not followed to the last detail.given the nexus between the heileman grants and the kickbacks made to monreal,we do no t think liability hinges in this case on whether or not operation search had sufficient clean funds in its bank account each time a kickback check was drawn and transported across state lines to monreal.
id.at footnote omitted.the court looked at the purpose behind,and noted specifically that the statute was meant to prevent those who were attempting to utilize the channels of interstate commerce make a successful get away.id.at quoting united states sheridan.it concluded that l ooking to the substance of quintanilla conduct,it is apparent that the checks he caused to be transported in interstate commerce represented,and were directly derived from,fraudulently obtained heileman funds.id.
quintanilla does not save the government in this case because the evidence of the nexus between the grants and the kickbacks in that case was sufficient.here,the chain of alleged kickbacks from the wheat deal is missing a few links.more significantly,though,the jury here was instructed in accordance with poole and the government did not object to the premises underlying that decision.
in any event,even if we infer that lazarenko was connected to the wheat deal because it was negotiated by his deputy and he received a payment that represented approximately fifty percent of the proceeds,postabank records are still required for there to be sufficient evidence that lazarenko subsequent transfer of million to kiritchenko constituted interstate transportation of stolen property.the government argument that the transfer of million to lazarenko lip handel account was the proceeds of fraud because the fraud was not complete until the money reached lazarenko does not persuade us that the postabank records are unnecessary.
for the million transferred from lazarenko lip handel account to kiritchenko abs trading account to be property,it must have contained at least of the million transferred to van der ploeg in the phony wheat deal.we can not look only at whether the million contained at least of the million transferred into lazarenko lip handel account as the government urges because the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to the government shows only that the million payment was an extortion payment,fifty percent of the proceeds from the phony wheat transaction the fraud was lazarenko deputy arranging for nikopol to give van der ploeg million to buy wheat that was never purchased.that fraud was completed when the money was transferred to van der ploeg.
the record supports an inference that lazarenko extorted million from agafonov,because lazarenko always extorted half of the profits from businesses.but making an extortion payment and completing a fraud are entirely different propositions.the million extortion payment also may have been money derived from the phony wheat deal.without the records from postabank,which would show whether there were clean funds in the account from which agafonov could make the required payment to lazarenko,this inference is speculation.in short,the evidence reflects money into the hungarian account and money out of the account,but missing is evidence about the account itself and whether the transferred money was directly traceable to the fraud itself.see morgan,at.accordingly,we reverse lazarenko conviction on count 
retroactive misjoinder
