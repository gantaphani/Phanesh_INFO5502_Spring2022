penal code section sometimes called the freeze and seize law,permits the superior court in certain white collar criminal cases to take possession of assets under defendants control and to preserve them for the payment of restitution.a person who claims an interest in frozen assets may seek their release by filing a verified claim with the superior court,subd.e.in this case,the superior court denied a claim filed by the person whose name appeared on a frozen bank account controlled by defendants,finding the claimant failed to show she actually owned any of the money in the account.the court of appeal,reasoning that the people had the burden to show by clear and convincing evidence the claimant did not own the disputed funds,reversed.we conclude the court of appeal erred and,thus,reverse.
background 
defendants youssef semaan and lilliane semaan pled guilty to a complaint charging them with felony counts arising out of a credit card scheme the scheme exploited courtesy checks mailed by credit card issuers to cardholders in order to encourage the cards use.using courtesy checks,defendants would overpay by thousands of dollars the balance due on a credit card a card issuer that received an overpayment would credit the account instead of refunding the overpayment,thus temporarily increasing busting out the amount that could be charged on the card defendants would then spend the credit limit before the courtesy check was dishonored for insufficient funds.defendants also submitted fraudulent credit applications to merchants in order to finance purchases,and then used courtesy checks on credit card balances to delay collection.through this scheme,defendants ultimately stole over million,committing in the process counts of grand theft,subd.a and counts of fraudulently drawing checks without sufficient funds.based on these offenses,defendant youssef semaan was sentenced to years in state prison and defendant lilliane semaan to years probation.defendants were also ordered to pay in restitution.see,subd.i a b.
while the criminal case was pending,the people filed a petition under section to preserve assets and property for the payment of restitution.see,subd.e.the superior court granted the petition and appointed a receiver to take possession of a list of assets and property the people had identified in the course of their investigation as being in defendants control.
among the frozen assets were bank accounts in the names of marie semaan and elham cherfan,both of whom appear to reside in lebanon and are of defendant youssef semaan.both women filed claims asking the court to release money from the frozen accounts.see,subd.e.the superior court,after an extensive evidentiary hearing,rejected both claims.neither claimant appeared at the hearing or submitted a declaration.while each claimant in her written claim asserted ownership of some of the frozen funds held in her name,the claims were verified by the claimants jointly retained attorney and,thus,while procedurally proper,had no evidentiary value.code civ,subd.a.both claimants,through an accountant expert witness,attempted to trace to the frozen accounts funds once assertedly belonging to them.claimant elham cherfan sought to prove that of the funds held in her name represented defendants repayment of a loan.but the purported loan was not documented,and the evidence did not support her expert conclusion about the circumstances under which the loan was supposedly made.the superior court ultimately found that the accountant opinion testimony concerning the loan lack ed credibility and denied the claim for insufficient evidence.the court of appeal affirmed this part of the superior court decision,and cherfan has not sought review of the court of appeal decision as to her.we therefore do not consider her claim further.
as mentioned,the superior court also denied the claim of marie semaan hereafter marie.marie did not appear at the hearing and made no sworn statements in support of her claim.in an amended claim,which was also verified by her attorney,marie asserted that in the frozen bank account is the sole property of claimant and said money is not the fruits or product of any criminal activity.as mentioned,however,the amended claim factual assertions had no evidentiary value.code civ,subd.a.
at the hearing on her claim,marie attorney presented a single same accountant mentioned opined,based on her effort to trace the source of the funds in the frozen bank account,that marie owned the funds.the witness had not met or spoken to marie.the witness investigation of the bank account showed a beginning balance of,deposits of representing social security payments in the name of marie and elias semaan a deposit of representing the proceeds of the sale of a house on mountain court in brea,california,and a transfer of from another account in marie name.
the people,for their part,accepted the expert witness conclusions about the source of the funds but endeavored to show that marie name was used by defendants as an alias for financial transactions.through of marie own accounting expert witness,and through direct examination of a detective serving on the financial crimes task force of the united states secret service,the people showed the following defendants possessed and used for their own benefit more than six credit cards in marie name.defendants also possessed a driver license and social security card in marie name.all checks written on the account,and all atm withdrawals from the account,were for the benefit of defendants all of these transactions totaling occurred at a time when marie was not in the united states.the registered address for the bank account was a post office box rented by defendant youssef semaan in marie name.a signature card existed for the bank account,but neither witness claimed any expertise in handwriting identification and neither attempted to authenticate the signature as marie.the several documents purporting to bear marie signature in fact bore apparently very different signatures,none of which was shown to be her own.ownership of the house was unclear.in her amended claim,marie asserted that her deceased husband simon semaan owned the brea house in that document she did not,however,claim an ownership interest in the house,as opposed to the funds in the account.while a last will and testament for simon semaan was in evidence,the will contained no listing of assets.the brea house was sold by defendant youssef semaan while marie was in lebanon,under a power of attorney purportedly executed by her in beirut.but the people questioned the power of attorney authenticity,and no witness attempted to authenticate marie signature on the document.prior to the sale,and while marie was in lebanon,a deed to the house was created in her name the people questioned the deed authenticity,and it was not shown to be genuine.finally,the escrow check payable to marie representing the proceeds of the sale was endorsed and deposited into the bank account while she was out of the country.one attempt,apparently by marie,to withdraw money from the bank account from overseas failed for unknown reasons.
based on this evidence,the superior court rejected marie claim.the court held that,a lthough marie may have once had some property interest in the mountain court residence,she has failed to show evidence that she owned any of the money in the wells fargo account thus,it is the order of this court that marie claim is denied.
the court of appeal reversed.in the court view,once marie met her initial burden of establishing legal title to the bank funds from the sale of her home,the burden of producing evidence shifted to the people to refute by clear and convincing evidence her legal title to the funds.the court based this conclusion on evidence code section,which provides that t he owner of legal title to property is presumed to be the owner of the full beneficial title.this presumption may be rebutted only by clear and convincing proof.the court acknowledged that there is evidence of defendants control over marie bank account funds,and that it is possible defendants were using marie account for money laundering n
