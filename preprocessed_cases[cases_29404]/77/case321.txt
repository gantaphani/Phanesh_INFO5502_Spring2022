shauna mumma appeals the substantive reasonableness of her sentence,which is and months higher than the top of the applicable range under the united states sentencing guidelines or guidelines.we have jurisdiction under and affirm.
background 
during the fall of,mumma and her husband douglas mumma applied for and received a line of credit at bank of the prairie in olathe,kansas.in support of that application,mumma provided the bank with two signed documents that gave a false social security number.the following year,the mummas filed for bankruptcy.in the bankruptcy petition,which mumma signed,mumma falsely represented that she did not have any bank accounts by failing to disclose the existence of the bank of the prairie account.
in april,a federal grand jury returned a indictment based on the false statements in her bank of the prairie loan application and in her bankruptcy petition.she was arrested that month and released on bond.in september,mumma waived prosecution by indictment and was charged by information with one count of making a false statement to a financial institution in violation of and one count of bankruptcy fraud for failing to disclose all bank accounts in violation of.she subsequently pleaded guilty to both counts.mumma,who is not a party to this appeal,was also charged with and pleaded guilty to bankruptcy fraud of the same type as his wife.
a presentence report psr was prepared.the psr reported that mumma had several prior arrests and convictions for financial crimes.specifically,in the eleven years prior to the charges in the instant case,mumma had five prior convictions for passing worthless checks one conviction encompassed three separate counts,three prior arrests for passing worthless checks that were never prosecuted,a conviction for impairing a security interest by selling a car without the consent of the secured party,and a conviction for forgery.based on her criminal history,mumma was placed in criminal history category iii.with a total offense level of eight,see a,b b,a,the advisory guidelines range was months imprisonment 
on january,the day before mumma was scheduled to be sentenced,the district court received an from a united states probation officer in florida suggesting that the mummas had defrauded florida residents linzel and chelsea carty from may to december while the mummas were out on bond in this case.the district court gave the to counsel,continued the hearing to permit them to investigate the matter,and instructed counsel that it would hear evidence and arguments regarding the matter at the rescheduled sentencing hearing.the court indicated that the ultimate sentence would depend on whether the allegations could be proved.if they were,it would consider a sentence above the guidelines range.otherwise,it would follow the guidelines and impose a sentence.
at the sentencing hearing,the court heard testimony from fbi special agent randal wolverton,who had been assigned by the government to investigate the relationship between the mummas and the cartys.agent wolverton testified,based on a discussion with carty,an affidavit from carty,and copies of the cartys bank statements,that between may and december the mummas obtained approximately from the cartys and did not repay them.
according to agent wolverton the two couples struck up a friendship in may month after the mummas were arrested and released on bond for the charges that underlie this the mummas moved into a house across the street from the cartys.on may,mumma came to the cartys house and explained that he and his wife had moved from kansas to florida.he went on to say that they had purchased the house across the street from the cartys and were having financial problems related to the purchase.specifically,mumma told the cartys that he had a business in kansas,and he had written a check from the business to another company in exchange for a certified check to present at closing on the house.according to mumma,the business check bounced because his former business partner had emptied the account,so the mummas needed to pay for the bad check.mumma told the cartys that he would be arrested if he did not get the money.he also assured the cartys that he could repay them because he expected to receive a commission check of within the month.carty and his wife felt the mummas had fallen on hard times,so on may,mumma and carty went to the cartys credit union,and carty gave mumma a certified check in the amount of payable to amscot.the cartys later learned that the mummas were actually only renting the house.
shortly after the loan,mumma told carty she was going to be arrested because she had written bad checks.she needed plus a fee to cover a bounced check she had written in order to register a vehicle in florida.consistent with mumma story,mumma said that the check had bounced because mumma former business partner had wiped out the checking account.carty gave mumma a certified check to cover the bounced check and fee.
carty also established a for the mummas at the cartys credit union after she learned that the mummas could not obtain a bank account and needed to be able to deposit checks they received from a handyman business mumma had recently started.on july,mumma transferred from the cartys account to the without the cartys permission.carty was able to reverse of this transfer,but had already been spent.the mummas then proceeded to overdraw the.mumma deposited a check into the to cover the overdraft,but the check was worthless as it was written on an account the mummas had closed.the mummas moved away shortly thereafter.
after agent wolverton testified,mumma was given the opportunity to testify about the cartys but declined to do so the district court then asked counsel to address the central issue presented at the hearing the extent,if any,to which the court should consider the carty conduct.indeed,the court made clear that it was troubled by agent wolverton testimony that mumma had engaged in additional fraudulent acts while she was on bond having promised this court that she would not commit any other crimes,and that such conduct spoke directly to her character.see a requiring sentencing courts to consider the nature of the offense and characteristics of the offender.for his part,counsel for mumma contended that the evidence at the hearing was not reliable,that the alleged conduct did not constitute relevant conduct under,and that a sentence was appropriate.
on march,the court issued a sentencing memorandum and order.the court noted that conduct that could not be considered relevant conduct under could nonetheless be considered under a.turning to that statute,the court set forth several factors it considered relevant to sentencing.those factors included the seriousness of the offenses bankruptcy fraud and making a false statement to a financial institution,see a a,and the need for the sentence to deter future criminal conduct and protect the public given mumma long history of financial crimes,see a b,c.in addition,the court noted that mumma conduct raised an inference that she may have committed undetected bankruptcy fraud in the past,and it found that mumma was not remorseful.the court also emphasized that mumma engaged in fraudulent activities while simultaneously receiving the benefit of being released on bond in this case.the court summarized 
given the unchallenged information before the court,there is no doubt that mumma was involved in fraudulent activities while,at the same time,was receiving the benefit of not being detained in connection with this case.had she been detained,the problems suffered by the cartys would not have happened.this,along with the other factors just mentioned,further justifies a sentence in excess of that called for by the advisory guidelines.
the court then rejected the suggestion that mumma should serve anything other than substantial time in prison and sentenced her to months imprisonment,which is months higher than the top of the guidelines range.
