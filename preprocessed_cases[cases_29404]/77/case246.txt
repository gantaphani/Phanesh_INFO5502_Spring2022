mark spangler appeals his jury convictions on counts of wire fraud,seven counts of money laundering,and one count of fraud.we focus on three of spangler arguments raised on appeal that the district court abused its discretion in barring his expert witness from testifying,and that the exclusion of the expert testimony violated his sixth amendment right to present a defense that the district court abused its discretion in permitting testimony about his status as a fiduciary and that the district court violated his fifth amendment rights by failing to strike count from the second superseding indictment we have jurisdiction under,and we affirm.
on may,a grand jury returned a second superseding indictment charging spangler with counts of wire fraud,seven counts of money laundering,and one count of fraud.at trial,the government presented evidence of the following 
spangler was a registered investment adviser and a onetime chairman of the national association of personal financial advisors.from the early until,spangler headed a seattle investment firm known during the relevant time period as the spangler group,which serviced between twenty and client families at any given time.
in,spangler set up five investment funds,two of which the equity investors group,llc equity and the income investors group,llc income are particularly relevant for purposes of this appeal.spangler clients expected that the money they put into equity and income would be invested in companies and that investment decisions would be made by an outside investment manager,rather than spangler.these expectations found support in the private placement memoranda ppms for the funds.indeed,the version of the ppm for equity,which was drafted by william carleton,spangler attorney,provided that the securities in which equity invests are expected to be traded in public markets and that spangler would use southeastern asset management,to make investment decisions.both ppms provided that the funds investment objectives could be changed only by a vote of the owners.
the ppms also contained disclaimers,which the defense emphasized at trial.for example,the ppms warned clients that the investments to be made involved a high degree of risk and that no investment in these securities should be made by any person who is not in a position to lose the entire amount of such investment.at trial,carleton described these warnings as boilerplate.
in,spangler and carleton organized spangler ventures,which consisted of a series of investment funds dedicated to startup companies.according to carleton,the purpose of spangler ventures was to offer startup company investing separate from the five funds set up in.spangler was intimately involved in two of the startups in which the spangler ventures funds invested terahop and tamarac.spangler served as chairman of both entities and held other positions as well.
despite his apparent intent to separate the funds invested in spangler began to move money from equity and income into terahop and tamarac,all without his clients consent.although he sometimes transferred the money directly,he often funneled the money through the spangler ventures funds first,largely because he stood to gain of any profits made by spangler ventures under the terms of those funds.
spangler diversion of cash from equity and income to terahop was especially problematic because terahop lost more than million between and.given terahop poor financial performance,terahop frequently could not make interest payments on loans it had taken from income.accordingly,terahop borrowed money from equity and various spangler ventures funds to make the payments,and income,in turn,used the money to pay quarterly dividends to investors.in this way,spangler operated a circular ponzi scheme,using his clients money to generate their interest payments.
to conceal evidence of wrongdoing,spangler provided his clients with carefully worded quarterly statements titled portfolio performance analyses.these statements referred to the funds invested in equity as marketable equities and the funds invested in income as specialty bonds.investments in private equities were listed in a separate category,creating the illusion that only a small percentage of funds was dedicated to private investments such as startup companies.in reality,however,a much larger portion of spangler clients portfolios was invested in private equities,as funds invested in equity and income were also being moved into terahop and tamarac.for example,a portfolio report for one of spangler clients from the last quarter of represented that the client had less than of his portfolio invested in terahop when of his portfolio was actually invested in the startup.
in,spangler sent letters to his clients and asked them to sign new ppms for equity,income,and other funds.the letters informed spangler clients of name changes for some of the funds e,equity became sg growth investors group,and income became sg income investors group.the new ppms gave spangler discretion to invest funds himself rather than with the assistance of an outside investment adviser.further,the revised ppm for equity changed the language of the original ppm stating that securities were expected to be traded in public markets to read that securities may be traded in public markets.the ppms did not mention terahop or tamarac directly,and spangler clients testified that they did not closely review the new ppms or seek legal advice before signing them,largely because they trusted spangler and relied on his expertise.
concerned about their investments in the wake of the economic downturn of,some of spangler clients asked him to liquidate their investments in equity and income,which spangler could not accomplish within the time constraints established by the ppms.when spangler informed his clients that he needed to seek new investors to liquidate their interests,they told him that the plan sounded like a ponzi scheme.from there,the situation unraveled,and in the spangler group was forced into receivership.the receiver was able to recover some of spangler clients funds,but many of his clients lost millions.
at trial,spangler rested after the government case without testifying or offering other evidence.on november,the jury found spangler guilty of of the counts charged,finding him not guilty of one count of wire fraud.on march,the district court sentenced him to months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release.spangler timely appealed,challenging only his convictions.
discussion 
whether the district court abused its discretion in barring spangler expert witness from testifying 
spangler first argues that the district court erred in precluding his expert witness,john keller,from testifying.we review a district court decision to exclude expert testimony for an abuse of discretion.see united states laurienti,cir.
before trial,spangler counsel disclosed keller and three other potential expert witnesses.the keller disclosure stated as follows 
john keller is a forensic accountant and former criminal investigator with the internal revenue service.he will testify that he reviewed the receiver investigation of the spangler group businesses.he will testify that based on his review of the receiver analysis that there were no unexplained diversions of assets.keller personally reviewed several portfolio position reports and portfolio performance summaries.he compared various account statements with the spangler company database of client records.he found nothing in this analysis that let sic him to believe that there was any attempt to make false representations to client sic about their account balances or account activity.he saw nothing in the client data reports to suggest that spangler was inappropriately diverting client funds for his own benefit.keller has also reviewed the client portfolio analysis to determine the client rates of return on their investments and compared them to rates of return if the clients had invested money into index funds or kept their money in southeast asset management.
the government moved to exclude all four expert witnesses under federal rule of evidence and d
