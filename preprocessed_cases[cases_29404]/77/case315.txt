background 
between february and september,galloway,a licensed real estate broker,participated in a conspiracy to defraud the united states by obtaining mortgages and mortgage insurance for unqualified home buyers.he referred potential home buyers to warren williams,who prepared false social security numbers,false pay stubs and forms,false credit reports,and other false information for inclusion in mortgage loan applications.these applications were submitted to mortgage companies and later sent to the federal housing authority fha,an agency of the united states department of housing and urban development hud.galloway would attend closings on these transactions and receive real estate commissions.galloway would then pay williams a kickback.
following galloway conviction,the probation officer prepared an initial presentence investigation report psr.the psr,relying largely on the government initial sentencing statement,concluded that galloway fraudulent conduct caused a loss to hud in the amount of.this calculation was based upon mortgage defaults of and by tanya pickett and kendrick brame,respectively.however,the psr also recommended increasing the loss by the amount of galloway commissions,which totaled,resulting in a total loss of.the psr also recommended a restitution order of.
galloway objected to the psr.he argued that his commissions should not be included in the calculation of hud loss.he also argued that the government should be estopped from claiming a loss on the pickett default because the government failed to claim such a loss at pickett sentencing.therefore,galloway argued the actual loss was,based upon the brame default,and that the loss calculation and restitution order should be limited to that amount.in an addendum to the psr,the probation officer stood by his recommendation.the district court held a sentencing hearing but continued the hearing because it concluded further information was needed to resolve this dispute.
however,by the time the district court held its next sentencing hearing,the dispute over the amount of loss galloway caused became further complicated by the fact that the parties had changed their positions.both the government and the probation officer increased their loss calculations due to the discovery of an additional loss of,which was associated with the home purchased by lanay collins,another.in addition,the government offered a new formula on how to calculate the total loss.the government argued that the total loss should include the actual loss to hud plus galloway commissions on transactions for which there was no loss.according to this formula,the government amended its loss calculation to at the same time,the probation officer continued to include all of galloway commissions in the total loss calculation and thus concluded the total loss equaled 
in response,galloway argued hud suffered no loss on any of the transactions in which he participated.withdrawing his earlier concession regarding brame default,he claimed he was not responsible for the loss associated with collins or brame default because each occurred on refinanced loans,not loans galloway helped them fraudulently obtain.he also amended his argument concerning the pickett default,explaining that evidence revealed her home was sold in a foreclosure action for more than the balance owed.accordingly,he argued his sentence should not be enhanced on the basis of hud loss because he caused none,and likewise,he should not be ordered to pay restitution.
to address galloway arguments,the government called as a witness,marc friedland,a program management analyst for hud.friedland testified that the actual loss to hud on the brame default was,not,and confirmed that the losses associated with the pickett and collins defaults were and,respectively.friedland further testified that,under the streamline process,hud evaluated brame and collins refinance applications using information that appeared on their primary mortgage applications,and they could not have received their refinanced loans without first obtaining their primary mortgages.accordingly,the government argued that galloway should be held responsible for the brame and collins losses,even if they occurred on loans they subsequently obtained without his involvement.
the district court concluded that galloway fraudulent conduct caused a loss to hud,but further concluded it could not reasonably quantify the precise amount of loss given the conflicting data submitted by the government.therefore,the district court chose to estimate the loss using galloway total gain commissions of,an undisputed amount.applying section of the united states sentencing guidelines or guidelines,the district court calculated a total offense level of,which included a base offense level of pursuant to a,a enhancement pursuant to b c,for a loss of more than but less than,and a enhancement pursuant to for use of a special skill the district court departed downward to a criminal history category of i,resulting in a guideline sentencing range of months,and imposed a sentence of months and day and years supervised release.the district court imposed restitution in the amount of galloway total gain.
on appeal,galloway does not challenge the district court enhancement for use of a special skill,he only challenges the enhancement and restitution order that resulted from the district court use of his commissions as the estimate of hud loss.

at the outset,we note that the amount of loss,if any,that resulted from galloway fraudulent conduct affects whether the or version of the guidelines applies to this case.the district court initially applied the version but amended its findings and conclusions using the version after the parole officer raised ex post facto concerns in light of this issue,we review the district court sentence determination under both the and
