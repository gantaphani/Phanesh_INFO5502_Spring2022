in this white collar criminal case,we address the scope of,which prohibits theft from programs,receiving federal funds,by agents of the organizations which administer those programs.specifically,we consider whether an independent contractor with managerial responsibilities may be an agent under.
john vitillo,vitillo corporation,and vitillo engineering,were charged with several counts of theft,in violation of a a,and conspiracy.a federal jury convicted each defendant on all counts.defendants filed a fed.crim.a motion for a new trial based on alleged prosecutorial misconduct.the district court denied the motion on april.through new counsel,and approximately six months after trial,defendants filed a rule b b motion to dismiss the indictment for failure to state an offense.the district court denied this motion on july.on september,the district court sentenced john vitillo to imprisonment and the corporate defendants to probation,and ordered all defendants to pay in restitution.defendants appeal the restitution order,as well as the district court april and july orders.
because we find that independent contractors such as john vitillo and his corporations,vitillo corporation and vitillo engineering,are not excluded from the d definition of agent and because the indictment sufficiently states a federal offense,we will affirm the district court order denying defendants motion to dismiss the indictment.because we find no prejudice with regard to prosecutorial misconduct,as the evidence of guilt is overwhelming,we will affirm the district court order denying defendants motion for a new trial.finally,because we find the restitution figure sufficiently grounded in the evidence,we will affirm the judgment of sentence.
background 
at the relevant times,the reading regional airport the airport or rra,located in berks county,pennsylvania,was a small airport that provided services to private and commuter airplanes.the airport was owned by the city of reading and managed by the reading regional airport authority the authority or rraa,a local government agency that received significant funding from the federal aviation administration.one of the authority projects was its terminal expansion project.of the approximately million the authority received from the federal government between and,approximately million was set aside for this project.
because the rra was a small,regional airport,the authority did not have a primary engineer on staff.in,the authority appointed john vitillo company,the vitillo group,later reorganized into the vitillo and a subsidiary,vitillo engineering,of which he was president,to serve as the authority primary engineer and principal engineering consultant.vitillo and his companies,which billed for their work at an hourly rate,worked for the authority from through.during this time period,vitillo managed several projects at the airport,the largest of which related to managing the terminal expansion project,which took over two years to complete.
on june,assistant united states attorneys ausas robert goldman and kathleen rice accompanied several fbi agents as they executed a search warrant at the office of vitillo corporation.the government suspected that john vitillo and his companies were engaged in a massive overbilling scheme to defraud the authority.during this search,the fbi agents seized various time cards and billing records.additionally,with the consent of vitillo attorney,whose presence had been requested,special agent thomas neeson interrogated john vitillo about his companies billing practices.the interview was not recorded but was conducted in the presence of the ausas,who later served as trial counsel.
a federal grand jury in the eastern district of pennsylvania returned an indictment against vitillo and his companies,charging each with three counts of theft from an organization receiving federal funds,in violation of a a,and one count of conspiracy to violate,in violation of.defendants pleaded not guilty to all counts.at trial,the government presented substantial evidence that vitillo and his had been in dire financial condition prior to contracting with the created fraudulent invoices for work that was never actually performed at the airport,thus defrauding the authority of hundreds of thousands of dollars.agent neeson testified against the vitillo defendants,as did vitillo own employees,who described their involvement in the fraudulent billing scheme corporate sets of phony and real time cards seized from vitillo corporation their testimony.
during opening statements and witness examination,ausa goldman made the jury aware that he and his,ausa rice,had been present when agent neeson interrogated john vitillo.defense counsel objected and unsuccessfully moved for a mistrial,alleging that the prosecutors were improperly vouching for agent neeson credibility.also,during of vitillo,ausa goldman repeatedly asked vitillo to comment on the veracity of agent neeson,but no objections were lodged.
the jury returned a verdict,finding vitillo and his companies guilty on all four counts.the vitillo defendants filed motions for a new trial and to dismiss the indictment,but both motions were denied.they never filed a motion challenging the sufficiency of the evidence.the district court sentenced john vitillo to months of imprisonment and two years of supervised release.the corporate defendants were sentenced to years of probation.defendants were also ordered to pay in restitution,jointly and severally.the district court based this figure on evidence of loss presented during trial and in the presentence investigation report.
ii.discussion 
the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to.appeal was timely.we have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to and.
sufficiency of the indictment 
as a preliminary matter,the parties quibble over whether the vitillo defendants challenge to the indictment is a jurisdictional or pleading challenge.their motion to dismiss the indictment for lack of jurisdiction was filed pursuant to.b b,which states that,at any time while the case is pending,the court may hear a claim that the indictment or information fails to invoke the court jurisdiction or to state an offense.the vitillo defendants alleged in the district court,as they do on appeal,that the indictment fails to set forth facts establishing that they are an agent of a local government agency receiving federal funds as that term is defined in d.they do not assert that we lack jurisdiction to consider the appeal.they can not,as defects in an indictment do not deprive a court of its power to adjudicate a case.united states cotton,d see also lamar united states.rejecting claim that the court had no jurisdiction because the indictment does not charge a crime against the united states.rather,they argue that the indictment fails to plead sufficient facts to establish a violation of a federal offense.we conclude that vitillo challenge to the indictment is more properly characterized as a pleading challenge than one of jurisdiction.united states panarella,cir indeed,we are unsure whether use of the term jurisdictional to refer to challenges to the sufficiency of an indictment is anything more than simply a label used to announce the conclusion that a particular defense survives a guilty plea.plenary review applies.united states whited,cir.
another threshold issue is whether we should consider the factual record developed at trial in assessing the sufficiency of the indictment.this issue arises because of the unusual procedural posture of this vitillo defendants challenged the sufficiency of the indictment long after the jury returned its guilty verdict.because the sufficiency of the evidence is not an issue on appeal the vitillo defendants waived their right to challenge the jury verdict by failing to do so within the time limit under rules,or,the government argues that our review should be confined to the four corners of the indictment.in contrast,the vitillo defendants argue that it defies logic to deny the court an opportunity to consider the complete record before it,but they cite no authority for this proposition.specifically,they argue that we should consider the engineering consultant agreement executed by the vitillo group,and the rraa because the indictment specifically refers to that contract.
it is that a n indictment returned by a legally constituted and unbiased grand jury,like an information drawn by the prosecutor,if valid on its face,is enough to call for trial of the charge on the merits.the fifth amendment requires nothing more.costello united states.footnote omitted and emphasis added.indeed,we have previously held that,for purposes of rule b later superceded by rule b b,a charging document fails to state an offense if the specific facts alleged in the charging document fall beyond the scope of the relevant criminal statute,as a matter of statutory interpretation.panarella,at emphasis added see also united states taylor,cir the validity of an indictment is not affected by the form of the evidence considered,and an otherwise valid indictment can not be challenged on the ground that the grand jury based it on inadequate or incompetent evidence.we conclude that the vitillo defendants rule b b challenge to the sufficiency of the indictment should be decided based on the facts alleged within the four corners of the indictment,not the evidence outside of it 
an indictment is generally deemed sufficient if it sic contains the elements of the offense intended to be charged,sufficiently apprises the defendant of what he must be prepared to meet,and allows the defendant to show with accuracy to what extent he may plead a former acquittal or conviction in the event of a subsequent prosecution.united states rankin,cir quotation marks and citations omitted.an indictment must allege more than just the essential elements of the offense.see panarella,at we are thus constrained to reject the government contention that an indictment or information charges an offense,for purposes of rule b later superceded by rule b b,as long as it recites in general terms the essential elements of the offense,even if the specific facts alleged in the charging instrument fail to satisfy those elements.an indictment fails to state an offense if the specific facts alleged in it fall beyond the scope of the relevant criminal statute,as a matter of statutory interpretation.id.
statutory interpretation of 
when interpreting a federal criminal statute,we must pay close heed to language,legislative history,and purpose in order strictly to determine the scope of the forbidden conduct.dowling united states,d.any ambiguity in the language of a criminal statute should be resolved in favor of the defendant.united states bass,d.however,is extremely broad in scope,united states,cir citing salinas united states,d,as that statute seeks to ensure the integrity of vast quantities of federal funds previously unprotected due to a serious gap in the law,united states cicco,cir quoting the legislative history of.see also united states rooney,cir citing the legislative history of and concluding that congress intended the terms of the statute to be construed broadly.
section prohibits,inter alia,an agent of a local government agency that receives more than in federal funds from stealing from that agency property valued at more than the term agent is defined as a person authorized to act on behalf of another person or a government and,in the case of an organization or government,includes a servant or employee,and a partner,director,officer,manager,and representative.d.
the vitillo defendants argue that,as a matter of statutory interpretation,the term agent does not apply to them as they are described in the indictment.the indictment alleges that vitillo group,was appointed by the authority as the primary engineer and principal engineer consultant for the authority and the rra and that,by written agreement,vitillo engineering,was made the construction manager of the rra expansion project with compensation to be paid to defendant vitillo engineering,based upon the number of hours worked emphasis added the vitillo defendants argue that these specific allegations are insufficient to place them within the ambit of d definition of agent.specifically,the vitillo defendants point out that the indictment fails to establish that they had any control over any federal funds,because vitillo engineering,through vitillo corporation,had to bill the authority for services on an hourly basis.
because d does not define an agent as someone who necessarily controls federal funds,we conclude that the vitillo argument fails.see united states phillips,cir garza,dissenting t he expansive statutory definition of agent recognizes that an individual can affect agency funds despite a lack of power to authorize their direct disbursement.according to the statutory definition,an agent is merely a person with authority to act on behalf of the organization receiving federal funds,and can include,inter alia,an employee,officer,manager or representative of that entity.d.there is nothing in the statute to suggest that we should consult extrinsic sources,such as the restatement of agency,in attempting to further define agent.to do so might result in the improper importation of extraneous language into the statutory text.phillips,at garza,dissenting we must interpret d as written,and can not use hornbook agency principles to restrict the broad definition of agent that congress provided.see also comprehensive crime control act of,at,code cong,agency is defined in d and require s no further explication.
the vitillo defendants propose a second dubious interpretation.they argue that,because the term independent contractor which would apply to the vitillo defendants according to the facts alleged in the not a term listed in d,the vitillo defendants are by definition excluded from the statute coverage.we reject this argument as well because the d list that includes the terms servant,employee,partner,director,officer,manager,and representative is,by its own plain language,not exhaustive.
we therefore conclude that,as a matter of statutory interpretation,d does not by definition exclude an independent contractor who acts on behalf of a b entity as a manager or representative of that entity.
construction of the factual allegations in the indictment 
having concluded that an independent contractor may be covered by,we consider whether the indictment alleges facts sufficient to demonstrate that the vitillo defendants acted on behalf of the authority or airport as managers or representatives of those entities.in doing so,we construe the factual allegations in the indictment liberally.that is because indictments which are tardily challenged are liberally constructed in favor of validity.united states wander,cir citing united states pheaster,cir see also united states watkins,cir.although the failure of an indictment to state an offense is a fundamental defect which can be raised at any time,judicial interests require that such challenges be made at the earliest possible moment.pheaster,at.one interest is in avoiding the needless waste of limited judicial resources.see also united states panarella,cir criticizing the rule permitting a defendant who enters an unconditional guilty plea to challenge on appeal the charging instrument failure to allege facts sufficient to state an offense.another important interest is in discouraging tactical delays by defendants seeking a convenient ground of appeal in the event of a guilty verdict.pheaster,at see also panarella,at citing wayne lafave et,criminal procedure d,at ed.the facts of various cases indicate that the practice of sandbagging,by deliberately postponing the objection,continues as to these defects,particularly the failure to charge an offense.we will uphold the indictment against vitillo unless it is so defective that it does not,by any reasonable construction,charge an offense under.united states childress,quotation marks and citations omitted.
applying this principle along with the requirement of.c that an indictment be a plain,concise,and definite written statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged,we address whether the indictment alleges facts sufficient to establish that the vitillo defendants were agents under.the indictment alleges that john vitillo was president of vitillo group,that vitillo group,became vitillo engineering,that john vitillo created vitillo corporation and vitillo engineering,became a subsidiary of vitillo corporation that vitillo engineering,was the primary engineer and principal engineer consultant for the authority and the rra that vitillo engineering,submitted its bills to the authority through vitillo corporation and that john vitillo signed the contract with the authority on behalf of vitillo engineering,making vitillo engineering,the construction manager of the rra expansion project.
section d defines an agent as,inter alia,a manager of the b entity receiving federal funds.therefore,in light of the statutory interpretation we have conducted above,we conclude that the indictment alleges facts sufficient to establish that the vitillo defendants were agents under.the indictment thus properly states the federal offense for which the vitillo defendants were convicted.
prosecutorial misconduct 
john vitillo alleges that the federal prosecutors improperly sought to undermine his credibility throughout the trial by repeatedly emphasizing their presence at the fbi raid and interview and thus vouching for the reliability of agent neeson testimony as to vitillo inculpatory statements,which vitillo denied ever making and explicitly asking vitillo whether agent neeson was lying while on the witness stand.vitillo objected to the alleged vouching during trial and in his motion for a new trial,but he never objected to any of the was agent neeson lying questions,during or after trial 
the decision to grant or deny a motion for a new trial lies within the discretion of the district court,united states cimera,cir,and the district court ruling on a challenge to prosecutorial statements objected to at trial is reviewed for abuse of discretion.united states brennan,cir.we will review the vouching issue for abuse of discretion and harmless error.however,because vitillo did not object to the was agent neeson lying questions,we will review that issue for plain error.united states boone,cir.to establish plain error,vitillo must prove that there was error,a deviation from a legal rule,the error is clear under the law at the time of appellate review,and the error affected substantial rights,affected the outcome of the proceedings.united states harris,cir see also johnson united states,d united states olano,d.if all three elements are established,we may exercise our discretion and award relief,johnson,at,but only if the defendant is actually innocent or the error seriously affect s the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.olano,at.citation omitted.
was the witness lying 
an important issue at trial was whether john vitillo confessed to agent neeson during an interview that took place on the day the fbi searched the vitillo corporation offices.vitillo testified at trial that no such confession was made,whereas agent neeson testified to the contrary.the jury had to make a credibility determination.vitillo argues that the government improperly bolstered the testimony of agent neeson by explicitly asking vitillo whether agent neeson was a liar or lying,which placed vitillo in the unfavorable position of having to accuse a government agent of committing perjury.
at the time of trial,several courts of appeal had held this type of questioning improper because it tended to infringe on the jury exclusive role as arbiter of witness credibility.see,united states thomas,cir united states williams,cir united states sanchez,cir united states sullivan,cir united states boyd,united states richter,cir.we have recently joined this chorus.united states harris,cir today,we follow our sister circuits and hold that asking one witness whether another is lying is inappropriate.it is clear that,under current law,it was improper for the prosecutor to ask vitillo whether agent neeson was lying.
however,under the plain error standard,a new trial is not warranted here.the prosecutor questions,while improper,were not prejudicial in light of the overwhelming evidence of vitillo guilt presented at trial.see,boyd,at under plain error standard,such questions improper but not prejudicial in light of,inter alia,strong evidence of defendant guilt.brian boyer,vitillo program manager for the terminal expansion project,testified in detail about how he assisted vitillo in submitting false,inflated bills to the airport,in accordance with vitillo instructions.boyer testified that,in february,vitillo directed him and james purcell,vitillo corporation accounting assistant,to bill the airport a minimum of per month,without regard to the number of hours actually worked.james purcell testified and confirmed boyer testimony.both men explained how this overbilling scheme continued for several months.purcell testified that the bills were inflated between to percent.
boyer testified that,when the authority notified vitillo that his companies work for the airport was going to be audited,vitillo instructed him to compare the time cards recording the hours actually worked with the invoices submitted for payment.heather brightbill and becky huyett,employees in the vitillo corporation accounting department,also testified that vitillo instructed them to conduct similar comparisons.purcell,brightbill and huyett each testified that vitillo ordered them to create false time cards to reflect the hours invoiced rather than the hours actually worked and to remove the real time cards from the job file and replace them with the phonies.brightbill testified that this process took several months.purcell,brightbill and huyett testified that the fake time cards were to be submitted to the airport for auditing purposes.purcell testified that vitillo attempted to hide the original invoices,spreadsheets,and job status reports for the airport contract.the fbi recovered sets of fake and real time cards from vitillo offices,and hundreds of these cards were submitted into evidence at trial.
this is strong evidence of guilt.furthermore,this evidence stands apart from the disputed confession that gave rise to the prosecutorial misconduct.although the prosecutor was agent neeson lying questions were improper and may have improperly bolstered agent neeson testimony to vitillo detriment,there is no doubt that the government case was amply supported by other strong evidence of guilt.had the government case been based primarily on vitillo purported confession,the prosecutor misconduct may have resulted in prejudice warranting a new trial.such was the case in united states combs,cir,where the case essentially boiled down to whether the defendant had confessed to a dea agent.the agent testified that the defendant had confessed,the defendant testified to the contrary,and the prosecution and the district judge forced the defendant to answer the question was the agent lying vitillo case is much different.there is strong evidence of his guilt unaffected by the prosecutor misconduct.plus,the district court did not place its imprimatur on the improper questioning.unlike in combs,there is no prejudice here because the error did not affect the outcome of the proceedings,we need not address whether it seriously affected the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.
vitillo claims that the government committed further prosecutorial misconduct during his and at other times during the trial by subtly,yet effectively,vouching for agent nee son testimony.specifically,vitillo argues that the government assured the jury that agent neeson was telling the truth about vitillo confession by repeatedly emphasizing the fact that ausas goldman and rice were present during the interview when the confession allegedly took place.by informing the jury of their presence,the prosecutors implied that they knew what vitillo actually said to agent neeson,which in turn assured the jury that agent neeson was testifying truthfully.if agent neeson was lying,vitillo argument goes,the officers of the court and representatives of the department of have known this and thus would not have introduced agent neeson testimony and relied on it to the extent that they did.as noted above,defense counsel unsuccessfully objected to the alleged vouching at trial and by motion we review the district court decision for abuse of discretion and harmless error.
for vouching to occur,two criteria must be met the prosecutor must assure the jury that the testimony of a government witness is credible,and this assurance must be based on either the prosecutor personal knowledge,or other information not contained in the record.united states harris,cir quotation marks and alterations omitted citing united states walker,cir.the prosecutor assurance may be based on either an explicit or implicit reference to information outside the record.walker,at.vouching is not permitted because it can jeopardize the defendant right to be tried solely on the basis of the evidence presented to the jury as the prosecutor imprimatur may induce the jury to trust the government judgment rather than its own view of the evidence.id.at citing united states young,d.
during the government opening statement,ausa goldman described the fbi raid and agent neeson subsequent interrogation of vitillo and informed the jury that ausa kathleen rice and myself are there.later,on direct and,the prosecutors made similar passing reference to their presence at the fbi raid and interview and also repeatedly used the pronoun we meaning the prosecutors and the fbi agents when asking questions about what vitillo admitted to the government that day.although it is not clear from the record,government counsel stated at oral argument before this court that ausas goldman and rice actually waited in a car as the fbi agents searched vitillo offices only later,after the search was over,did the ausas enter the offices to observe agent neeson interview with vitillo.government counsel informed us that it was common practice for prosecutors who had observed a defendant interview to later serve as trial counsel should the government bring the case that far.counsel also informed us that it was unusual,although not unheard of,for prosecutors to accompany agents into the field and later serve as trial counsel.
we are concerned by the existence of this practice.it may give rise to the temptation to vouch.if a prosecutor will be tempted at trial to refer to his or her presence at the interview,the prosecutor would do better not to attend the interview.moreover,a prosecutor who wants to testify as a witness should withdraw as trial counsel for the case.we are also troubled by the prosecutors comments at trial.the prosecutors should not have made the jury aware that they were present during the execution of the search warrant or during vitillo interrogation.
that said,vitillo case is different from most of our other vouching cases in that the challenged comments took place during opening statements and witness examination rather than during closing argument.see,harris,at alleged vouching occurred during closing argument united states brennan,cir same united states saada,cir same united states,cir same walker,at same united states,cir same united states bethancourt,cir same united states zehrbach,cir same but see united states milan,cir no vouching where challenged comments made during witness examination united states helbling,cir no prejudice where alleged vouching occurred during opening statements and closing argument.the government seizes upon this difference to argue that assurances constituting vouching under walker must be clearly presented to the jury during closing argument.vitillo argues vouching can occur at any time during the trial.although our cases suggest that vouching most often occurs during summation,we agree with vitillo that vouching may occur at any point during trial,provided the two elements set forth in walker and recently reiterated in harris are satisfied.
we next consider whether vouching actually occurred in this case.on one hand,it was certainly for the prosecutors to mention their presence at the fbi raid and interview.we hope the united states attorney for the eastern district of pennsylvania will instruct his assistants accordingly.on the other hand,the comments challenged here are more subtle than the comments giving rise to reversible error in our previous vouching cases.for example,in,we found error and prejudice where the prosecutor assured the jury during closing argument that two key government witnesses testified truthfully with regard to two alleged agreements entered into by defendants.at.the prosecutor stated they the government witnesses told the government they fixed prices twice and i can guarantee you the justice department does give two for one deals they had to plead guilty to both price fixing conspiracies and their sentence reflected that.id.at emphasis added.similarly,in,we found error and prejudice where,during closing argument,the prosecutor told the jury that it was insulting and ridiculous to think that the united states would put on a witness who would lie and assured the jury that agent lugo did not lie to you.at alterations omitted.
nevertheless,we conclude that,in the instant case,the prosecutors comments and questions referring to their presence at vitillo interview constituted vouching.the prosecutors assured the jury that agent neeson testimony was credible based on their personal observations of agent neeson interrogation of vitillo.for example,ausa goldman asked vitillo this question on cross examination then,after we talked,agent neeson talked to you concerning the inflating of the bills,he then asked you about changing the time cards and do you remember admitting to agent neeson at that time you changed the time cards because we had to cover the inflated hours,do you remember that,vitillo the clear implication of this question and other questions and statements like it is that agent neeson testimony was credible because the prosecutors attended the interview and knew for a fact that agent neeson was testifying truthfully 
ultimately,however,a new trial is not required here in light of the strong evidence of vitillo guilt.the prosecutors vouched by implicitly assuring the jury that agent neeson truthfully testified that vitillo confessed to him.vouching aimed at the witness credibility and based on evidence is deemed error,at.error is harmless where it is highly probable that the error did not contribute to the judgment and the court has a sure conviction that the error did not prejudice the defendant.id.quoting zehrbach,at en banc substituting harmless error analysis for per se rule announced in united states diloreto,cir.prejudice is determined by examining the scope of the comments and their relationship to the proceeding,the extent of any curative instructions,and the strength of the evidence against defendants.id.
as discussed above,the government strongest evidence came not from agent neeson recounting of the purported confession but rather from the vitillo employees who described the overbilling scheme in detail and the hundreds of bogus time cards supporting their testimony.furthermore,the district judge instructed the jury that y ou are the sole and exclusive judges of the facts and y ou determine the credibility of the witnesses.the district judge also instructed the jury that the statements and arguments of counsel are not evidence in this case.it is therefore highly probable that the prosecutors passing reference to their presence at the fbi interview did not prejudice vitillo.compare helbling,at finding prosecutor vouching to be inappropriate but not prejudicial where evidence of defendant guilt was overwhelming and the district judge gave effective curative instructions and zehrbach,at same with,at finding prosecutor vouching prejudicial where it tainted crucial testimony,the government case was weak,and the jury instructions failed to neutralize the harm done by the government.we are convinced that any potential error with regard to vouching is harmless 
restitution 
finally,vitillo challenges the restitution figure set by the district court vitillo argues that the additional added to the jury general loss finding of more than was not based on evidence pres
