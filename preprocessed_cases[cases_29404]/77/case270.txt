background 
ruff worked as a materials supervisor at sacred heart medical center shmc between january and october.in this capacity,he had access and authority to record receipt of inventory,to make adjustments to the inventory account,and to modify purchase orders to include additional items for inventory.ruff took advantage of this authority to steal worth of shmc inventory and sell it over ebay.when confronted by his employer,ruff readily admitted his illegal conduct and cooperated with federal investigators.in december,he pled guilty to one count of health care fraud,in violation of,four counts of theft,embezzlement and conversion of property and assets of a health care benefit program,in violation of,and four counts of money laundering,in violation of a.the presentencing report calculated ruff guideline range as months.
at a may,sentencing hearing,the district judge began his analysis by accepting the guideline range as accurate and noting its advisory nature.acknowledging that he was required to impose a sentence that sufficient,but not greater than necessary to comply with the provisions of the law,the judge then considered the sentencing factors embodied in a.with respect to aggravating factors,he noted the crime was serious given the manner in which it was committed and the amount of property it involved.he went on to emphasize a host of mitigating factors,including ruff history of strong employment his cooperation and clear remorse his support from his siblings the absence of potential risk to the public and the appropriateness of restitution and his mental health issues and gambling addiction.with respect to this final factor,ruff admitted that he had lost approximately to compulsive gambling,and that he had participated in counseling for pathological gambling and depression between november and march.the judge observed that ruff would clearly benefit from continued mental health treatment for his illness and,considering all of the factors,committed ruff to the custody of the united states board of prisons bop for months and one day,recommending that he serve his sentence at geiger to allow him to participate in work release,get counseling and attend visits with his son.he also placed ruff on three years of supervised release.
less than one week later,the judge learned that geiger could house ruff only if his confinement was as a condition of supervised release.reconvening a hearing on may,the judge amend ed the judgment by committing ruff to the custody of bop for one day and placing him on three years supervised release.as a condition of his supervised release,ruff was required to serve a term of confinement of one year and one day in a confinement facility.the judge again recommended that ruff spend this period at geiger to facilitate his work release,treatment and child visitation.
standard of review 
the abuse of discretion standard applies to all sentencing decisions,both those within and outside of the guidelines.see gall united states,d united states carty,cir en banc.we first must ensure that the district court did not commit a significant procedural error and then consider the sentence substantive reasonableness.see gall.at united states rising sun,cir.although we consider the totality of the circumstances,including the degree of variance for a sentence imposed outside the g uidelines range,extraordinary circumstances are not needed to justify a sentence outside the guidelines range and we must give due deference to the district court decision that the sentencing factors warrant a particular variance.carty,at see also gall.at.this standard reflects the common theme throughout the supreme court recent sentencing breathe life into the authority of district court judges to engage in individualized sentencing.united states whitehead,cir per curiam internal quotation marks omitted.
the government first contends that the district court committed a procedural error by failing to address any of the sentencing factors during the may,hearing.because we can not reasonably consider this second hearing in isolation from the may hearing,when the court analyzed the sentencing factors in detail,the district judge failure to reiterate his previous analysis from the week before does not constitute procedural error.
the district court is statutorily required at the time of sentencing,to state in open court the reasons for its imposition of the particular sentence.c.it is most helpful for this to come from the bench,but adequate explanation in some cases may also be inferred from the record as a whole.carty,at.the district court articulated its reasoning to the degree required for meaningful appellate review during the may hearing.united states,cir.discovering that the intended sentence was not feasible in its original structure,the judge convened the may hearing to modify the sentence specifically to allow the bop to effectuate the sentence the judge had initially proposed.it is plain that the judge considered this second hearing a mere continuation of the first.it would elevate form over substance to require the judge to reiterate the sentencing factors at the second hearing,as the only alteration was the terminology he used both before and after the second hearing,ruff was required to spend months and one day of confinement in a residential center,where he could receive counseling for his gambling addiction,participate in work release to help pay restitution and have periodic visitations with his son as bop might approve.applying the judge reasoning from the may hearing to the substantively identical sentence imposed at the may hearing,we conclude that there was no procedural error.united states crisp,cir holding that the reasoning for the probationary sentence carried over to the five hour prison sentence that was imposed after the district court learned that the criminal statute required some incarceration.
for similar reasons,we are not persuaded by the government argument that ruff sentence is substantively unreasonable.the original sentence was reasonable in light of the mitigating factors the judge discussed in detail during the may hearing.gall.at,holding that a sentence of months probation when the applicable guideline range recommended to months imprisonment was reasonable based on district court reasoning whitehead,at affirming sentence based on district court reasoning.the dissent emphasizes that certain factors discussed in gall are not present here.dissent at.the clear message in gall,however,is that we must defer to the district court reasoned and reasonable decision that the a factors,on the whole,justified the sentence.at.gall happened to discuss maturation and because they were the basis of the district court reasoned decision in that case,but it is the reasoned decision itself,not the specific reasons that are cited,that triggers our duty to defer.here,the district judge plainly satisfied this requirement,relying on factors such as treatment,cooperation and familial support to arrive at his chosen sentence.i ntimately familiar with the nature of the crime and the defendant role in it,as we are not and able to appraise ruff sincerity,as we can not,the district court was in a superior position t
