in this case we must determine the propriety of several jury instructions including those relevant to the issue of criminal liability for acts of an agent.in addition we must address the question of whether the aggravated white collar crime enhancement can be construed for ex post facto purposes as similar to a continuing offense in which it is appropriate to address conduct before and after the enactment of a statute increasing criminal penalties.
in the published portions of this opinion,we find no error in the jury instructions regarding agency principles.we also find application of the increased punishment prescribed by the aggravated white collar crime enhancement in this case did not violate the ex post facto prohibitions of either the state or federal constitutions.

on appeal,williams makes three arguments.first,he contends the court erred in instructing the jury with caljic because it violated williams constitutional rights by deterring candor in jury deliberations.second,he contends the court instruction on agency and agent requires reversal because it eliminated the elements of control and knowledge from the jury consideration under corporations code section.finally,he contends the application of the aggravated white collar crime enhancement to transactions that occurred before its enactment violates the ex post facto and due process clauses of the united states and california constitutions.we reject williams arguments and affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
we state the facts and reasonable inferences in the light favoring the people as the party prevailing at trial.people ochoa cal th,d.
williams owned three corporations southern california mergers and acquisitions scma,onyx oil and gas management onyx,and coastline financial coastline.scma was a mineral acquisition company.by selling private promissory notes,scma was able to raise working capital in order to acquire oil and gas leases.scma would then assign the leases from scma to onyx.onyx then structured the oil and gas leases into limited partnerships with onyx acting as the general partner.coastline acted as their licensed financial brokerage.it was responsible for selling mutual funds,onyx limited partnerships and scma promissory notes.
from to,each of williams corporations played a different role in developing and executing what is known as a ponzi scheme scma was responsible for acquiring oil and gas lease interests in oil and gas.williams would determine which properties to acquire,set the prices for the lease interests,and sell them to onyx,who would structure limited partnerships in the interests.coastline was then responsible for selling the limited partnerships in the oil and gas lease interests and the scma promissory notes.
according to the testimony of previous coastline brokers,williams and his son,brian rogers,gave scripts to the employees,who used them to solicit investments.the brokers would use the scripts when cold calling customers from a list the management provided them.according to the testimony of former brokers,these lists consisted primarily of the names of retired people over the age of.each of the scripts was tailored to sell the customer on one of the products,partnerships in the oil and gas leases or the scma promissory notes.the scripts contained standard sales pitches for each product and standard rebuttals for hesitant customers.they instructed the brokers to tell customers that the limited partnerships were for people seeking to preserve capital and monthly income,and they were fully secured by government agency bonds.the broker would quote a rate of return and indicate that it was annual with monthly distributions.the script used for selling the scma promissory notes also assured customers that the notes were fully backed with government agency bonds.on some occasions,williams and the other managers monitored the brokers through the use of snooper telephones where the supervisors could listen in on the brokers conversations with clients.during some of these solicitations,the supervisors,including williams,would get on the telephone and close the deal.
in addition to the information provided on the scripts,much of the brokers knowledge of the limited partnerships and promissory notes came from coastline staff meetings.during these meetings,the brokers were given information regarding the status of the production in the oil and gas fields.the brokers received daily reassurances from williams and other supervisors that things were going well in the oil and gas patches and that a number of them were producing.the brokers were also encouraged by williams to reload,which meant calling clients on the day they received distribution checks in order to persuade them to reinvest the money.the brokers believed that coastline was selling limited partnerships in oil and gas wells that were backed by government securities,which would pay a certain rate of income to investors,and the investors would eventually get their money back plus some income.
after working for coastline for some time,a few of the former brokers testified as to some questionable business practices they observed.one broker,christopher tate,testified he heard brokers calling banks to find out how much money customers had before soliciting them.he brought this information to the attention of williams,but the practice continued.another former broker,eric gorshe,testified that he saw some papers indicating that the potential for recovery of reserves on some of the oil and gas fields was nonexistent despite the reassurances he received from williams.gorshe questioned williams about this and asked for proof of sales of oil and gas reserves,but he was refused the information.williams assured another broker that the limited partnerships were backed by government bonds.the broker later discovered they were bonds that matured in years.
the prosecution produced three experts to testify about the corporations actions.the first expert was a petroleum engineer who testified as to the suitability of the fields williams purchased for oil and gas production.he testified that the wells owned by williams have a typical life of to years.williams wells,however,had originally been drilled in the,and only one of the sites had produced anything in the preceding years.
the second expert was a former employee of the california department of corporations.he testified that neither scma nor any of the limited partnerships applied for or obtained permits from the department of corporations to sell their.the intent of the permit process is to provide safeguards for investors,and if there is a product involved,such as oil leases,the intent is to assure investors the leases are as represented.there are exemptions to the permit process,however,that have substitute protections.under the private placement exemption,no permit is required to sell if the seller and buyer have already established a preexisting personal or business relationship,or if the investor is sophisticated enough to understand the transaction.the sophistication analysis also requires a broker to factor in the suitability of the investor in terms of his ability to absorb the particular type of risk.even if an investor is sophisticated enough to qualify under the private placement exemption,there still must be an adequate amount of meaningful and understandable disclosure.
here,the private placement memorandum and the statements of the brokers were the basis for disclosure.under these circumstances,it was critical that coastline disclosure be complete and understandable,so as not to omit or misrepresent any material facts.the expert then opined that the limited partnership interests,the scma promissory notes and the investment contracts are among the most risky and speculative investments in the marketplace.these types of investments are not suitable for elderly investors,retired investors,investors on a fixed income,or investors looking for safety and security.he also opined that the private placement memorandum was meaningless and not understandable to the average investor.it was couched in legalistic terms and its language was dense and convoluted.in addition,the pro formas provided by the company,which projected a steady production of oil and gas,were wholly inconsistent with the operating history.finally,the expert opined that the coastline offering materials were fraudulent and there was no way to sanitize them.
the prosecution next expert was a forensic accountant who examined the bank records of williams and the three corporations in order to trace the money from certain investors and determine the flow of the funds between the different accounts.despite tracing numerous investors checks,the accountant found only one check reflecting deposits from the sale of oil and gas.she traced the path of investor checks and found that there were instances in which checks from new investors were used to pay old investors.this conclusion was confirmed by a former certified public accountant who had quit working for williams because he thought williams was selling additional investments in order to pay back the distributions that were promised to past investors.
the victims in this case were of similar backgrounds.the majority of them were elderly,ranging in age from to at the time of trial.coastline brokers contacted most of them by telephone and solicited investments.none of the victims were told of the risky and speculative nature of the investments,and,in fact,a few of the investors indicated to the brokers the need for conservative and safe investments.several of the investors testified that the customer agreements,which were filled out by the brokers,contained false information.some of the victims testified that their net worth as indicated on the customer agreements far exceeded their actual net worth,and others testified that the agreements overstated their previous involvement in business and financial investments.in addition,a few of the victims stated that they received neither a private placement memorandum nor other investment information from coastline,or they received such information only after having sent their investment check.in fact,after receiving investment information,one victim told the broker she did not understand the materials,and in response the broker reassured her and told her to sign.after investing with coastline,the victims received distribution checks for a period of time,but the amounts decreased and the distributions eventually stopped altogether.when investors finally tried to contact coastline,they received no response.
discussiona.caljic 
otherwise cause 
williams was convicted of six counts of violating corporations code section before,a violation of this section did not require scienter,that is,guilty knowledge at the time the representation or omission occurs.people johnson d,disapproved by people simon cal th,fn,d.in people simon,supra,cal th,d,however,the california supreme court concluded that knowledge of the falsity or misleading nature of a statement or of the materiality of an omission,or criminal negligence in failing to investigate and discover them,are elements of the criminal offense in section.id.at,d.here,williams does not challenge the court instruction defining a violation of corporations code section.the court specifically instructed the jury on all the necessary elements required,including the scienter requirement,before a corporations code section violation could occur.rather,the dispute revolves around the instructions that described williams criminal liability for the acts of his agents.he contends that the court instruction defining agency and agent eliminated the elements of knowledge and control required for criminal liability under an agency theory or on an aider and abettor theory.
the relevant portion of the contested jury instruction reads as follows where a principal directly authorizes or otherwise causes a crime to be committed through the instrumentality of an agent,the law holds the principal responsible for the acts of the agent as though he personally committed them.this part of the instruction williams challenges appears to have been drawn directly from witkin.witkin epstein,california criminal law ed.introduction to crimes,one may be a principal,in the criminal law sense,where he directly authorizes or otherwise causes a crime to be committed through the instrumentality of an innocent agent.williams contends that the above italicized language allowed the jury to convict him of violating corporations code section without finding that he had control over the employees,had knowledge of the material misrepresentations or omissions,and allowed the illegal practice to continue.we disagree.
reading the above italicized language in isolation might allow for an overly expansive interpretation of criminal liability.arguably,a jury could infer criminal liability based on a variety of circumstances regardless of williams knowledge and control of his agents.the circumstances under which a person may otherwise cause a result are numerous,many of which do not require knowledge or control.therefore,there is some support for the proposition that otherwise cause,read in isolation,improperly exposes williams to criminal liability for the acts of his agents.this reading,however,is taken out of context.williams position does not consider the modifying language around the phrase,nor does he take into account the additional instructions given by the court in connection with the challenged instruction.
the otherwise cause phrase can not be interpreted without considering the modifying language within the given instruction.first,the phrase is juxtaposed with another phrase that allows for criminal liability on behalf of an agent who directly authorizes the prohibited conduct.a principal who directly authorizes certain conduct clearly has the knowledge of such conduct and the control to permit or prohibit the continuation of the agent actions.it would be an unreasonable construction of the sentence to interpret the otherwise cause phrase in the abstract,and thus ignore the knowledge and control elements present in the language preceding it.a reasonable juror would surely understand the directly authorizes language as modifying and providing context to the challenged phrase.
the instruction interpreted in its entirety provides further context to the otherwise causes phrase.in two preceding paragraphs,the instruction specifically states that the term agent means one who acts for or in place of another by authority from the other agency is the relationship which results from the manifestation of consent by one person to another that the other shall act on his behalf and subject to his control and consent by the other so to act.the principal must in some manner indicate that the agent is to act for him and the agent must act or agree to act in his behalf and subject to the principal control.in the absence of the essential characteristic of control,there is no agency.the court instructed that the existence of control by williams was a prerequisite finding to the conclusion that an agency relationship existed.therefore,the principal can cause a crime to be committed through an innocent agent only if the principal is in a position to control the activities of the
