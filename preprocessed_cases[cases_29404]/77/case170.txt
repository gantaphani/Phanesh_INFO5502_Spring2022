a jury convicted william davis of two counts of bank fraud,after which the district court calculated a range of to months.the court imposed a sentence of one day in prison because,among other reasons,davis was years old at the time of sentencing and because he had committed the underlying crimes years earlier.we reverse because the second explanation for the court sentence represents an inappropriate sentencing factor on this record.
in,davis applied for and received a million line of credit from a local bank for fries correctional equipment of kentucky,a business in which he was a part owner and president.davis agreed to be a personal guarantor of the line of credit.when the bank renewed the line of credit in,davis submitted a financial statement that omitted a debt he had incurred during the previous year.
fries correctional defaulted on the loan in,and the bank,invoking the personal guarantee,filed a civil action against davis.in april,during a deposition in the civil action,davis claimed that he no longer owned several securities listed in the financial statement.other financial documents,however,showed this claim to be false,revealing that he had continued to own the securities until october,when he sold them.
in,davis and his wife declared bankruptcy.and in august,the federal government notified davis that it intended to initiate criminal proceedings against him as a result of the defaulted loan.when the davis bankruptcy ended in,the bank had yet to recover roughly in loan proceeds.
on december,the government indicted davis.and on may,a jury convicted him of two counts of bank relating to the omission of the loan from his financial statement,the other relating to the false claims he made during his april deposition.
in august,the district court sentenced davis.applying the guidelines,it used a level of and added levels due to the amount of the loss.the court rejected davis requests for a downward departure based on 
acceptance of responsibility,see ja noting that davis had contested the facts and the implications to be drawn from them 
rehabilitation,see ja there,quite frankly,is no evidence that this defendant now is an improved human being over what he was before this offense ja citing davis testimony at sentencing as an additional justification for denying the departure and noting that the testimony was not as candid as perhaps it could be 
the government delay in bringing the indictment,see ja it would be difficult to say that a prosecution brought within the applicable statute of limitations is something outside the heartland of cases and beyond the thinking of the framers of the guidelines.and 
the claim that the guidelines range did not accurately reflect the seriousness of the offense,see ja noting that the sentencing range did not overstate the seriousness of the offense.
all of this left davis with a guidelines range of to months.normally,the court noted,it would be inclined to sentence in the middle or upper reaches of the guideline range,ja,but it decided to impose a sentence on each of the two counts to run concurrently and years of supervised release.in choosing the low end of the guidelines range,the court relied on davis age at the time and the delay between the bank fraud and sentencing years.the court did not impose restitution because davis could not afford it.
on appeal,this court affirmed davis conviction but remanded the case for resentencing.see united states davis,cir.as to the sentencing aspect of its decision,the court reasoned that the district court had calculated the sentence under the guidelines manual instead of the more lenient version in effect when davis committed the offense the version,and that the court imposition of a sentence under mandatory guidelines violated united states booker,d.see davis,at.
on april,the district court resentenced davis.using the version of the guidelines,the district court set davis base offense level at,then applied an enhancement due to the amount of the loss,see,then added a enhancement for planning in committing the offense,see id.b.after concluding that davis did not deserve a downward departure,the court determined that his criminal history category i and his offense level intersected at an advisory guidelines range of to months.see ja.
the court then considered the other factors listed in a in deciding whether to deviate from the guidelines range.it first considered davis characteristics and history,see a,noting his age years and seven months,that he was retired,that he had moved back to ohio to be near his family and his grandchildren and that he had one prior offense which was committed when he was a young man,ja.the court turned to the offenses of conviction,see a,which the court recognized were serious when committed and that they remain serious,ja.the court pointed out,however,that the offenses had been committed years ago.id.it also noted that the defendant age and the length of time between the commission of the offenses and the date of sentencing warranted consideration after booker even though they were not proper to consider as grounds for a downward departure under the guidelines.id.
in addressing the public interest in safety,see a c,the court concluded that the public is in no danger from this defendant because davis is retired,h e does not control a business and in all probability has no desire to do so,ja.as for punishment,see a a,the court noted that for punishment to be effective it must be reasonably close to the offense committed or it becomes,while not cruel and unusual,it becomes,i think,doubly erroneous,ja.the court was also satisfied that the factors that it set forth are such that the sentence will not promote disrespect for the law.see a a.as for deterrence,see a b,the court concluded that any it was a day or years or anything in between would be sufficient to deter this defendant from committing further crimes,ja.
because the court believed that the factors in this case are unique enough,it concluded that others who might be inclined to commit bank fraud are not likely to engage in that course of conduct in the hope that they will be treated as leniently as the defendant.id.the district court reasoned that the public interest in rehabilitation,see a d,had been because davis had been,in effect,rehabilitated by the passage of time,ja.the potential for disparity in sentence between persons similarly situated who commit certain crimes,see a,was likewise not a concern because i n th e court opinion,and recollection,it has dealt with very few people who were brought before the court for sentencing years after the fact,ja.restitution also was not an issue because,as the court had found at davis original hearing a finding the government did not appeal,davis had no ability to pay restitution.
taking all of these considerations into account,the court sentenced davis to one day in prison for each of the two counts running concurrently and with credit for the one day served when the marshals took him into custody,three years of supervised release including one year of home confinement and hours of community service.
on appeal,this court reversed.see united states davis,cir.we held that davis age at the time of sentencing and the gap in time between the crimes and his sentencing hearing years did not justify such a substantial months to one day.see id.at.the supreme court granted davis certiorari petition,vacated our decision and remanded the case for reconsideration in light of gall united states,d.see davis united states,d.
in united states grossman,cir,we explained gall impact on appellate review of district court variances 
while gall permits appellate courts,i n reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence outside the guidelines range,to continue to take the degree of variance into account and consider the extent of a deviation from the guidelines,it offers two important qualifications.at.it reject s an appellate rule that requires extraordinary circumstances to justify a sentence outside the guidelines range.id.and it reject s the use of a rigid mathematical formula that uses the percentage of a departure as the standard for determining the stre
