thomas anderson and anthony heppner,founders of the skyward group investment club,were convicted by a jury of mail fraud offenses based on misrepresentations they made to investors and their diversion of invested funds to their own use.they appeal from the judgment.we affirm.
heppner and anderson started the skyward group skyward investment club in and served on its board of directors.both men solicited individuals to become members of skyward club by representing that funds loaned to the club would be invested to generate returns for the members.heppner and anderson were both involved in administering the club.they provided members with loan agreements and membership application forms,and they also received completed loan agreements and payments that had been mailed to skyward.heppner frequently signed the loan agreements.both men were authorized signers on at least one skyward bank account.
members paid an annual membership fee to cover the club expenses,and their investments were structured as loans to skyward.members expected that their loans would be used for investment purposes and believed they would make substantial or extraordinary profits when their money was returned.some members received written earning projections on the loaned funds,but the returns were not guaranteed.although many members did not know the details of the investment scheme,some thought it had something to do with overseas currency trading.under skyward mentor program,members who persuaded other people to join skyward were told that they would receive a portion of the profits earned by each person they brought into the club.skyward used the united states mail to administer the club,to receive members funds,and to communicate with members about their accounts.
appellants portray skyward as a faith based club and suggest that members of the club shared a spiritual belief which affected their decision to invest with skyward.it is not clear,however,what the nature of those beliefs might have been,how many members might have shared them,or what role they might have played in skyward operations.the only representation touching on religion which appellants point to in the record was skyward july update to members which stated,praise the lord.we have been blessed before misleadingly reporting that preliminary requirements had been completed and that trading had begun.
skyward received over million from more than investors between february and march.benefit reports were sent to members indicating that their money was in a skyward account.skyward did attempt to invest some of the money in deals handled by tim oliver,an attorney who was a friend of heppner and who had employed heppner in his mortgage business.although these investments failed and led to losses of around,skyward did not disclose the losses to its members or other information about difficulties with its investments.rather,skyward issued optimistic updates suggesting investments were progressing and benefit reports showing that members had made a profit on their loans.some members testified at trial that they decided to loan more money to skyward based on these misleading updates and reports.
both heppner and anderson drew money from skyward for their own use.their withdrawals began as early as may.by the government accounting,over went to heppner personal benefit,either directly or through his personal trust anderson received over.some of the cashier checks members sent to skyward to invest were deposited directly into anderson personal account or were cashed by him.member funds were also funneled to another member of skyward board of directors.there was evidence that only about was returned to investors.
in heppner and anderson were indicted on twenty counts of mail fraud three of these were dismissed on the government motion.after various pretrial motions were denied,the case proceeded to a jury trial.to prove its case the government presented evidence that included testimony from skyward members and oliver,as well as financial records and documents.a portion of heppner september testimony before the commodity futures trading commission cftc was admitted over appellants objections.appellants also complained that the government had failed to disclose certain evidence to which they were entitled,and that the trial judge declined to give their requested jury instruction on materiality.at the close of the government case,anderson and heppner moved for a judgment of acquittal which was denied.
after a ten day trial each appellant was convicted of counts of mail fraud,in violation of and.the district court sentenced anderson to months on each count and heppner to months on each count,to be served concurrently,followed by three years of supervised release.the court also ordered appellants to pay restitution of to victims of their fraud.
after trial appellants moved for a judgment of acquittal or a new trial,claiming that there had been insufficient evidence and that the government had failed to disclose information to defense counsel in violation of brady maryland,d.they also argued that they were entitled to a new trial based on juror misconduct.the district court denied these motions,concluding that the claims had no merit.these appeals followed.
heppner and anderson appeal their convictions and request a new trial based on alleged trial errors.they object to the district court instructions on materiality,suggesting that they were deprived of the opportunity to explore and present their first amendment defense.they also assert that the government improperly ignored the religious motivations of skyward members and committed brady violations.both argue that the district court erred in admitting heppner testimony before the cftc,and anderson contends that the admission of this testimony violated his rights under the confrontation clause.the government responds that all of these claims are unfounded.it argues that it provided abundant proof on the materiality element of their offenses and denies that it committed any brady violations.it contends that heppner cftc testimony was admissible and did not prejudice anderson since he was not mentioned in it and the district court instructed the jury to consider it only in respect to the case against heppner.
appellants first claim that the government did not establish the materiality element of mail fraud charges against them and suggest that the government infringed on their religious freedom by presenting the materiality issue in a purely secular light.they argue that because the decisions of skyward members to invest were based on their spiritual beliefs,there was no proof that statements by appellants to the members were material to their investment decisions.citing the first amendment case united states ballard,they contend that the district court erred by refusing to give their requested jury instruction on materiality and that they are therefore entitled to a new trial.the government responds that the convictions were supported by overwhelming evidence,that ballard is inapposite,and that the record does not support a new trial.
we review the rejection of a defendant proposed instruction for abuse of discretion.united states meads,cir.in order to be convicted of mail fraud,a defendant must have made a material falsehood materiality is an essential element of the offense.see preston united states,cir per curiam,citing neder united states,d.in general a falsehood is material if it has a natural tendency to influence,or is capable of influencing,the decision of the decisionmaking body to which it was addressed.id.at,quoting neder,at.alteration in original.heppner and anderson wanted the court to instruct the jury that if the materiality decision as to any count turned on the genuineness of the religious beliefs of an investor or either defendant,the defendants should be found not guilty on that count.the district court declined to give their proposed instruction and instead instructed the jury that a material fact is a fact which would be of importance to a reasonable person making a decision about a particular matter or transaction.
