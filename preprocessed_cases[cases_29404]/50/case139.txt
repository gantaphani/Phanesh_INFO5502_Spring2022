the retirement group trg filed this action alleging numerous individually named defendants formerly affiliated with trg,had established a business in competition with trg.the complaint alleged that advisors had misappropriated trg trade secrets,which advisors were using to solicit trg existing customers to change their patronage to advisors competing business.trg sought and obtained a preliminary injunction that enjoined numerous categories of conduct by advisors.this appeal challenges the preliminary injunction only insofar as it barred advisors from d irectly or indirectly soliciting any current trg customers to transfer any securities account or relationship from trg to advisors or any or registered investment advisor other than trg.
factual and procedural backgrounda.the parties 
in the early,jastremski and frank cuenca formed an association and began doing business under the name the retirement group.they operated that association on an informal basis until approximately.however,when jastremski regained some of his securities licenses,he formally assumed a partnership interest in trg 
trg business had two components a component and a registered investment advisor ria component.some of trg customers entered into a direct securities account relationship with a securities,which cleared the securities transactions for the customer and held the account for the customer.during the relevant period,securities services network,ssn was the that provided those services to trg customers.trg had independent contractor relationships with various registered representatives including some of the defendant advisors here licensed by the securities exchange commission sec to sell securities and provide investment advice to customers,and these registered representatives rrs also entered into independent contractor relationships with ssn.
the ria component of trg business,as described by jastremski,involved rrs acting under a ria to provide investment advice to customers on a basis.the customer entered into an independent investment advisor agreement with the rr that granted the rr under the ria limited discretion regarding the account,and that custodied the customer securities with broker dealers.
trg spent substantial resources to develop its customer base through seminars and other marketing efforts,and approximately percent of trg customers were obtained from these marketing efforts.trg conducted seminars throughout the country to generate leads,had its agents pursue leads through telephonic contacts with prospective customers,and had its agents spend many hours in telephonic contact with customers and brokers.by the time advisors terminated their relationship with trg,a database maintained by trg contained the names of customers and potential customers as well as contact information for these persons essential to maintaining trg business,and trg took precautions to maintain the confidentiality of its database one of those precautions was that no person was allowed to access the secure database unless and until that person had signed an agreement requiring him or her to maintain the confidentiality of information in the database additionally,trg secure database was configured to preclude electronic copying of any information in that database.
b.the dissolution 
during the summer of,cuenca told jastremski that he was terminating his relationship with jastremski and was joining a different company defendant monarch retirement investments monarch that would be competing with trg.monarch had been formed by several individuals defendants lambrix,sullivan,laub and mcelderry who had been independent contractors for trg.shortly after cuenca joined monarch,defendant galante who had also been an independent contractor for trg also terminated his relationship with trg and thereafter joined monarch.
advisors contacted many of their customers to inform them that advisors were switching to a new ria,as well as to a new,and provided the customer with a form if the customer wanted to follow them and designate sii investments,sii as the,and that advisors would be their rr at sii and their designated independent advisor.for many of the customers contacted,advisors obtained the names and contact information from databases owned and maintained by independent third parties,including ssn.at least one advisor had many of his customer names and contact information on a personal list he maintained 
c.the lawsuit 
trg filed this action that as amended alleged numerous claims.insofar as relevant to this proceeding,however,trg alleged advisors had misappropriated the confidential information contained on trg secure database,the confidential information constituted trade secrets of trg,and advisors were using the confidential information to solicit existing customers of trg to leave trg and transfer their accounts to advisors,as well as to solicit prospective customers.
trg sought and obtained a preliminary injunction precluding advisors from engaging in numerous categories of conduct.the fourth category of enjoined conduct category,and the only aspect of the preliminary injunction challenged in the present proceeding,included a prohibition against advisors from d irectly or indirectly soliciting any current trg customers to transfer any securities account or relationship from trg to advisors or any or registered investment advisor other than trg.a separate category of the injunction category provided advisors were enjoined from u sing in any manner trg information found solely and exclusively on trg databases.however,s imilar information found on servers,databases and other resources owned and operated by other entities or businesses is excluded from the injunction.
trg subsequently filed an application for an order to show cause re contempt,asserting advisors had violated the terms of the injunction by,among other things,continu ing to contact trg customers in an effort to solicit their business even after three ex parte hearings to stop this conduct and despite trg counsel numerous letters advising advisors that this conduct would not be tolerated.advisors opposed the application,and for an order clarifying or modifying the injunction.advisors asserted the conduct enjoined by category did not define the term solicit,advisors were left to guess at what conduct might violate the injunction under the recurring circumstances then confronting advisors and therefore advisors moved to modify category to clarify what conduct was proscribed.the court declined to modify the injunction.
advisors timely appealed the order granting trg motion for preliminary injunction advisors challenge only the injunctive relief granted by category,asserting the relief granted violates edwards arthur andersen llp cal th,d,edwards and is beyond the relief otherwise authorized under california law 
analysisa.legal framework 
advisors assert the court injunction against directly or indirectly soliciting any current trg customers to transfer any securities account or relationship from trg to advisors or any broker dealer or registered investment advisor other than trg is invalid.to determine this issue,we are required to examine and resolve the tension between two competing strands of legal principles in california.the first strand,on which advisors rely,provides that california courts refuse to enforce most noncompetition agreements as violative of a strong public policy,embodied in business and professions code section,favoring free competition.the competing strand,on which trg relies,provides that california courts will protect an employer from the misappropriation of its trade secrets by anyone,including its former employees.we examine each in turn.
a t common law and in many states,a restraint on the practice of a trade or occupation,even as applied to a former employee,is valid if reasonable.bosley medical group abramson d.however,california long ago rejected the rule of reasonableness when it enacted civil code sections through,the predecessor sections to business and professions code sections through.at least since,a noncompetition agreement has been void unless specifically authorized by sections or.bosley,at.these legislative enactments settled public policy in favor of open competition,and rejected the common law rule of reasonableness,and t oday in california,covenants not to compete are void,subject to several exceptions edwards,supra,cal th at,d.
because edwards appears pivotal to resolution of this appeal,we examine it in detail.there,the employee edwards signed a nonsolicitation agreement,substantively indistinguishable from the nonsolicitation agreement in this case,as a condition to his employment with andersen.when andersen was forced to sell edwards practice group to a third party,the third party hsbc agreed to hire edwards but required as a condition of hiring that edwards obtain a termination of agreement tonc to obtain employment with hsbc.the tonc required,among other things,that edwards voluntarily resign from and release andersen from any and all claims against andersen.in exchange,andersen would agree to release edwards from the noncompetition agreement however,andersen would not release edwards from the noncompetition agreement unless he signed the tonc.edwards signed hsbc offer letter but refused to sign the tonc in response,andersen terminated edwards employment and refused to release him from the noncompetition agreement,and hsbc therefore withdrew its offer of employment to edwards.edwards,supra,cal th at,d.
edwards complaint against andersen alleged a claim for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage.the edwards court noted an essential element of the claim was a showing there was an intentional act by the defendant designed to disrupt the relationship that was wrongful,independent of its interfering character.della penna toyota motor sales,cal th,d.a n act is independently wrongful if it is unlawful,that is,if it is proscribed by some constitutional,statutory,regulatory,common law,or other determinable legal standard.quoting korea supply lockheed martin cal th,d.edwards,supra,cal th at,d.the trial court ruled against edwards on this claim,concluding the noncompetition agreement did not violate section because it was narrowly tailored and did not deprive edwards of his right to pursue his profession,and therefore andersen conduct in requiring edwards to sign the noncompetition agreement and tonc was not an unlawful act.ibid.in the court of appeal,edwards argued the independently wrongful act requirement was met because,in part,the noncompetition agreement was illegal under section,which rendered andersen demand that he give consideration to be released from it against public policy.the court of appeal agreed,holding section invalidated the noncompetition agreement and therefore purporting to require edwards to sign the tonc as consideration to be released from the noncompetition agreement was an independently wrongful act for purposes of edwards intentional interference with prospective economic advantage claim.edwards,at,d.
the edwards court,affirming the court of appeal analysis of the invalidity of the noncompetition agreement,noted section protects the important legal right of persons to engage in businesses and occupations of their choosing edwards,supra,cal th at,d,quoting morlife,perry th,d,and under section plain meaning an employer can not by contract restrain a former employee from engaging in his or her profession,trade,or business unless the agreement falls within one of the exceptions to section.edwards,at,d.importantly,the edwards court rejected andersen argument that the term restrain under section should be construed as meaning simply to prohibit,so that only contracts that totally prohibit an employee from engaging in his or her profession,trade,or business are illegal,and therefore a mere limitation on an employee ability to practice his or her vocation would be permissible under section,as long as it is reasonably based.edwards,at,d.edwards also rejected andersen assertion that california decisional authority has embraced the rule of reasonableness in evaluating competitive restraints,the predicate to andersen claim that only broad agreements that prevent a person from engaging entirely in his chosen business,trade or profession violate section and a greements that do not have this broad merely regulate some aspect of conduct,to prevent raiding employer personnel are not within the scope of s ection.id.at,d.instead,concluded edwards,the decisional law on which andersen relied involved noncompetition clauses in situations in which express statutory exceptions to section were applicable.edwards,at,d.
edwards also rejected andersen argument that california should superimpose a nonstatutory exception to section by adopting the limited or exception discussed by the ninth circuit in campbell board of trustees of leland stanford junior university cir,which the trial court in edwards relied on to uphold the noncompetition agreement.edwards noted the campbell court,despite acknowledging california had rejected the common law rule of reasonableness with respect to restraints on the ability to pursue a profession,nevertheless concluded section only makes illegal those restraints which preclude one from engaging in a lawful profession,trade,or business and remanded the case to the district court to allow the employee to prove the noncompetition agreement at issue completely restrained him from practicing his profession within the meaning of section.edwards,supra,cal th at,d,campbell,at.edwards declined to adopt campbell approach because campbell,in concluding california courts have excepted from section agreements that bar one from pursuing only a small or limited part of the profession campbell,at,appeared to have confused the import of boughton socony mobil oil d.and king gerold d,and andersen reliance on those cases for carving out an exception to section was similarly misplaced.edwards noted boughton did not involve a restriction on the employee practice of a profession or trade,but took the form of a covenant in a deed to a parcel of land that specified the land could not be used as a gasoline service station for a specified time period.edwards,at,d,boughton,at.edwards also noted boughton relied on king,which involved a claim of unfair competition.edwards,at,d,king,supra.because king did not merely involve an injunction against a former employee manufacture and sale of goods house trailers,but instead involved an injunction involving the former employee alleged use of a trailer design substantially similar to his former employer the inventor of the design,edwards concluded king was not authority for the proposition that noncompetition clauses imposing a limited or were excepted from section.edwards,at,d.
edwards recognized other federal cases had followed campbell exception to section,but concluded california courts have neither embraced the ninth circuit exception nor endorsed its reasoning,and concluded 
w e are of the view that california courts have been clear in their expression that section represents a strong public policy of the state which should not be diluted by judicial fiat.quoting scott snelling and snelling.section is unambiguous,and if the legislature intended the statute to apply only to restraints that were unreasonable or overbroad,it could have included language to that effect.we reject andersen contention that we should adopt a exception to section and leave it to the legislature,if it chooses,either to relax the statutory restrictions or adopt additional exceptions to the rule under section.edwards,supra,cal th at,d.
although edwards reaffirmed the broad california rule that invalidates noncompetition agreements falling outside of exceptions,edwards expressly stated it was not address ing the applicability of the trade secret exception to section.edwards,supra,cal th at,fn,d.
trade secrets 
an equally lengthy line of cases has consistently held former employees may not misappropriate the former employer trade secrets to unfairly compete with the former employer.the court in morlife perry,supra,th at pages to,d,articulating the competing considerations,stated 
while it has been legally recognized that a former employee may use general knowledge,skill,and experience acquired in his or her former employment in competition with a former employer,the former employee may not use confidential information or trade secrets in doing so.our supreme court recognized the delicate balance between promoting unfettered competition and protecting business from unfair conduct in continental moseley cal d,equity will to the fullest extent protect the property rights of employers in their trade secrets and otherwise,but public policy and natural justice require that equity should also be solicitous for the right inherent in all people,not fettered by negative covenants upon their part to the contrary,to follow any of the common occupations of life a former employee has the right to engage in a competitive business for himself and to enter into competition with his former employer,even for the business of those who had formerly been the customers of his former employer,provided such competition is fairly and legally conducted.citation.id.at.to be sure,we acknowledge the important legal right of persons to engage in businesses and occupations of their choosing yet also fundamental to the preservation of our free market economic system is the concomitant right to have the ingenuity and industry one invests in the success of the business or occupation protected from the gratuitous use of that by others.
in accordance with these principles,the courts have repeatedly held a former employee may be barred from soliciting existing customers to redirect their business away from the former employer and to the employee new business if the employee is utilizing trade secret information to solicit those customers.see american credit indemnity sacks d.in the absence of a protectable trade secret,the right to compete fairly outweighs the employer right to protect customers against competition from former employees accord,aetna.maintenance west cal d.thus,it is not the solicitation of the former employer customers,but is instead the misuse of trade secret information,that may be enjoined.southern cal.disinfecting lomkin d.accord,hollingsworth solderless terminal turley cir,we think the applicable california law is that the employer will be able to restrain by contract only that conduct of the former employee that would have been subject to judicial restraint under the law of unfair competition,absent the contract.
numerous courts have concluded customer lists can qualify for trade secret protection.see gordon landau cal d,gordon schwartz d,gordon wasserman d.although courts are reluctant to protect customer lists to the extent they embody information readily ascertainable through public sources,such as business directories where the employer has expended time and effort identifying customers with particular needs or characteristics,courts will prohibit former employees from using this information to capture a share of the market.such lists are to be distinguished from mere identities and locations of customers where anyone could easily identify the entities as potential customers.morlife perry,supra,th at,d.
evaluation 
we distill from the foregoing cases that section bars a court from specifically enforcing by way of injunctive relief a contractual clause purporting to ban a former employee from soliciting former customers to transfer their business away from the former employer to the employee new business,but a court may enjoin tortious conduct as violative of either the uniform trade secrets act the unfair competition law by banning the former employee from using trade secret information to identify existing customers,to facilitate the solicitation of such customers,or to otherwise unfairly compete with the former employer.viewed in this light,therefore,the conduct is enjoinable not because it falls within a exception to section ban on contractual nonsolicitation clauses,but is instead enjoinable because it is wrongful independent of any contractual undertaking.
application of these principles here convinces us the injunctive provisions of category on its face violate edwards and,when viewed in counterpoise with the injunctive provisions of category,can not rationally be upheld as an injunction limited in scope to the only legitimate protection,enjoining the misappropriation of trg trade secrets for which injunctive relief may be issued.first,the injunctive provisions of category purport to bar advisors from engaging in conduct substantively indistinguishable from the contractually proscribed conduct that,concluded edwards,was violative of the protections of section accordingly,the facial language contained in category transgresses section under edwards.
additionally,we are convinced category can not be upheld as an injunction designed to have the limited effect of protecting against the misappropriation of trg trade secrets,because the injunctive provisions of category already grant the full range of trade secret protections to which trg is entitled.category of the injunction,which advisors do not challenge,barred advisors from u sing in any manner trg information found solely and exclusively in trg databases italics added but expressly excluded from its ambit the use of s imilar information found on servers,databases and other resources owned and operated by other entities or businesses.thus,absent the provisions of category,advisors could compete with trg for the business of trg existing customers by employing all available resources and information except for those materials because it is found solely and exclusively on trg databases constituting protectable trade secrets.accordingly,category adds nothing to further the legitimate scope of protections protection of trg trade secrets to which trg is entitled,and can only operate to preclude the precise type of competition edwards declares is otherwise permissible.
trg raises several arguments to support its assertion that category is both a valid protection of its trade secret information and a proper adjunct to the distinct provisions of category.first,trg asserts the conduct enjoined by category is outside the boundaries of edwards because edwards expressly excepted from its ruling noncompetition clauses falling within the trade secret exception to section.however,edwards did not approve the enforcement of noncompetition clauses whenever the employer showed the employee had access to information purporting to be trade secrets.instead,edwards merely stated it was not required to address the applicability of the trade secret exception to section edwards,supra,cal th at,fn,d,because it was not germane to the claims raised by the employee.
trg next asserts that numerous cases have ruled former employees may not solicit customers of the former employer,and an injunction may be issued to prevent such solicitation.however,we have already concluded it is not the solicitation of the customers,but is instead the unfair competition or misuse of trade secret information,that may be enjoined.see,thompson impaxx,th,d antisolicitation covenants are void as unlawful business restraints except where their enforcement is necessary to protect trade secrets.indeed,although trg cites numerous cases holding an employee may be enjoined from soliciting persons on his or her employer customer lists,thompson rationale for rejecting an analogous argument which we echo here explained respondents argue that the cases hold that a covenant which barred the salesmen from soliciting business from customers for one year after termination of employment passed muster under section.however,respondents leave out the core of the cases reasoning the information about the customers could be protected because it was confidential,proprietary,a trade secret.thompson,at,d,italics added.
the bedrock of trg argument appears to be that the trial court properly enjoined advisors from soliciting trg customers because the trial court necessarily concluded that the only way advisors could have known the names and contact information of trg customers to enable advisors to solicit such persons was if advisors had misappropriated trade secret information found solely and exclusively on trg databases.however,trg d
