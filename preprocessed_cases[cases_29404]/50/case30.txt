this case requires us to decide the constitutionality of two louisiana statutes,one that regulates the labeling of catfish,la stat.ann.c the catfish statute,and another that regulates the use of the word cajun on food products,id.at d,e the cajun statute.appellee piazza seafood world,llc piazza is a louisiana company that imports seafood and distributes it under the trade names cajun boy and cajun delight.it sued the commissioner of the louisiana department of agriculture and forestry,bob odom,to enjoin the commissioner from enforcing the catfish and cajun statutes against the company.the district court granted summary judgment in piazza favor with respect to the statutes and enjoined the commissioner from enforcing either statute against piazza,concluding that the catfish statute was preempted by t and that the cajun statute,as applied to piazza,violated the first amendment.the district court also denied the commissioner motion for new trial regarding the catfish statute,which the court treated as a motion to reconsider,reiterating that the catfish statute was preempted and finding in the alternative that it violated the dormant foreign commerce clause.for the reasons stated below,we affirm.
background and procedural history 
this case represents the next chapter in an ongoing saga regarding the labeling of catfish.in may,congress passed legislation limiting the class of fish sold in interstate commerce to which the label catfish could be applied.see farm security and rural investment act of,a,stat,codified at,t.this legislation was prompted by increased sales of vietnamese pangasius bocourti in the united states as basa catfish.see kerrilee kobbeman,legislative note,hook,line and sinker how congress swallowed the domestic catfish industry narrow definition of this ubiquitous bottomfeeder,see also cong.rec.daily ed.may,statement of hutchinson with this provision,we were trying to end the deceptive and economically destructive practice of mislabeling vietnamese basa cong.rec.daily ed,statements of barry,pickering,and shows describing the purposes behind the legislation.the american catfish industry was heavily impacted by the sale of these fish under the catfish name sales of domestic catfish dropped significantly and domestic catfish farmers were forced to lower their prices.kobbeman,supra,at see also cong.rec.statements of barry,pickering,and shows detailing the impact of foreign catfish on the american market.the new federal catfish labeling law,codified at and t,provided that the term catfish could only be considered a common or usual name or part thereof for fish classified within the family ictaluridae only labeling or advertising for fish classified within that family could use the term catfish and a food would be deemed misbranded if it purported to be or was represented as catfish,unless it was fish classified within the family ictaluridae,t.after this legislation was passed,vietnamese pangasius bocourti,members of the family pangasiidae,could no longer be labeled catfish only fish from the family ictaluridae,native to america,could bear the lucrative catfish label.
around the same time,louisiana discovered that american ictaluridae were being farmed in china and sold in the united states as catfish,and it passed legislation limiting further the class of fish to which the catfish label could be applied.sess.law serv.act west.specifically,louisiana stated that only ictaluridae grown in the united states could be labeled catfish.ann.c this lawsuit arose out of application of that law,as well as a louisiana law limiting the use of the word cajun on food products,to an american importer and distributor of chinese ictaluridae.
piazza is a louisiana limited liability company that has been selling seafood wholesale in louisiana for more than fifty years thirty years ago,it began marketing some of its products under the trade names cajun boy and cajun delight,and today it sells all of its products under those names.although piazza originally sold mostly louisiana seafood,percent of the food products it sells currently are imported from overseas.its customers are largely institutional buyers that resell piazza products to wholesalers and restaurants,but piazza sells about one percent of its products to grocery stores that resell its products directly to the public.one of the products piazza sells is cajun catfish from the family ictaluridae that is imported from china the catfish and the cajun boy and cajun delight trade names are what is at issue in this case.
in march,commissioner odom ordered several of piazza customers not to sell,offer for sale,apply,move or remove any of piazza products because the reference to catfish on piazza chinese catfish violated louisiana catfish as a result of this action,cases of piazza catfish were seized piazza brought suit,seeking an injunction against commissioner odom to prevent him from enforcing the catfish statute against the company.piazza argued that the catfish statute was preempted by t and unconstitutional under the commerce and equal protection clauses.the district court eventually granted partial summary judgment in piazza favor as to the catfish statute,finding that the statute was preempted by t because of an actual conflict between the state and federal laws the court did not address piazza alternative constitutional claims regarding the catfish statute at that time,although it did mention that it saw potential commerce clause problems with the statute.
while the original suit was pending,the louisiana legislature passed house bill,which repealed the grandfather clause in louisiana cajun statute that had previously protected the use of the word cajun in a product name if that name was a trademark or trade name legally registered with the state of louisiana as of may,without the protection of the grandfather clause,all of piazza inventory violated the cajun statute.piazza accordingly amended its complaint in the district court,seeking a second injunction against commissioner odom,this one to prevent the commissioner from enforcing the cajun statute against piazza piazza argued that the cajun statute was unconstitutional under the first amendment and the commerce,equal protection,due process,and takings clauses.around the same time,commissioner odom filed a motion for new trial as to the catfish statute.the district court again found in piazza favor,granting partial summary judgment in piazza favor as to the cajun that the statute,as applied to piazza,violated the first denying the commissioner motion for new trial as to the catfish that the catfish statute was preempted and finding in the alternative that it violated the dormant commerce clause by discriminating against foreign commerce the court never addressed piazza alternative constitutional claims regarding the cajun statute.
the commissioner timely appealed the district court denial of his motion to reconsider as to the catfish statute and its partial summary judgment as to the cajun statute he argues on appeal that the district court erred in holding that the catfish statute is preempted by t that the district court erred in reaching its alternate conclusion that the catfish statute violates the dormant commerce clause and that the district court erred in holding that the cajun statute,as applied to piazza,violates the first amendment.
ii.the catfish statute 
generally,this court reviews the denial of a motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion.fletcher apfel,cir.however,if a party appeals from the denial of a rule e motion that is solely a motion to reconsider a judgment on its merits,de novo review is appropriate.id.considering commissioner odom arguments on appeal,it is apparent that he intended to appeal the merits of the underlying summary judgment,accordingly,we review his claims regarding the catfish statute de novo 
the district court held that the catfish statute violated the dormant commerce clause because it was a protectionist measure that discriminate d against foreign commerce in favor of local interests.we agree.
the commerce clause states that congress shall have power to regulate commerce with foreign nations,and among the several states,and with the indian tribes.const.art.i,cl.although the commerce clause speaks only of congress power,it has long been understood that there is a dormant or negative aspect of the commerce clause that limits the power of the states to regulate commerce.see camps,town of harrison,d or.waste,dep t of envtl.quality,d dennis higgins,d new energy of limbach,d see also solid waste mgmt.ass pine belt reg l solid waste,cir acknowledging the supreme court dormant commerce clause jurisprudence.this negative aspect of the commerce clause applies both to the foreign commerce clause commerce with foreign nations,see,wardair canada.dep t of revenue,d,and to the interstate commerce clause commerce among the several states,see,camps,at,although the scope of congress power to regulate foreign commerce,and accordingly the limit on the power of the states in that area,is greater,see,kraft foods,iowa dep t of revenue and,d noting that the constitutional prohibition against state taxation of foreign commerce is broader than the protection afforded to interstate commerce,in part because matters of concern to the entire nation are implicated citation omitted wardair canada,at.in the unique context of foreign commerce,we have alluded to the special need for federal uniformity in international relations and with respect to foreign intercourse and trade the people of the united states act through a single government with unified and adequate national power.internal quotation marks and citation omitted japan line los angeles,d stating that a more extensive constitutional inquiry is required in foreign commerce clause cases because a state regulation may impair federal uniformity in an area where federal uniformity is essential.
state regulations violate the dormant commerce clause by discriminating against or unduly burdening foreign or interstate commerce.see,or.waste,at.interstate commerce clause kraft foods,at.foreign commerce clause.regulations that facially discriminate are virtually per se invalid,camps,at.explaining that discriminatory regulations are strictly scrutinized solid waste mgmt.ass n,at same see also kraft foods,at.absent a compelling justification,a state may not advance its legitimate goals by means that facially discriminate against foreign commerce,whereas regulations that merely burden commerce are valid unless the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits.or.waste,at.quoting pike bruce church,d.
in the context of the interstate commerce clause,if a state regulation is found to be nondiscriminatory,the court examines the nature of the local interest and whether alternative means could achieve that interest with less impact on interstate commerce.solid waste mgmt.ass n,at.if a legitimate local purpose is found,then the question becomes one of degree.and the extent of the burden that will be tolerated will of course depend on the nature of the local interest involved,and on whether it could be promoted as well with a lesser impact on interstate activities.id.quoting pike,at.however,in the context of the foreign commerce clause,other considerations come into play nondiscriminatory state regulations affecting foreign commerce are invalid if they create a substantial risk of conflicts with foreign governments or undermine the ability of the federal government to speak with one voice in regulating commercial affairs with foreign states.new orleans ass plaquemines port,harbor terminal,cir quoting japan line,at.
commissioner odom focuses his arguments on appeal on the interstate commerce clause.he argues that the catfish statute does not discriminate against interstate commerce because it does not meet any of the factors listed in exxon governor of maryland,d,namely,the catfish statute does not prohibit or limit the flow of goods into the state,creates no barriers whatsoever against the importation of goods,does not place added costs on goods,and does not distinguish between and companies in the wholesale or retail market.the commissioner misses the point.the problem with the catfish statute is not that it discriminates against interstate commerce,but that it discriminates against foreign commerce.and this discrimination appears on the face of the statute the catfish statute treats domestic catfish differently from foreign catfish to the benefit of the former and the detriment of the latter.see or.waste,at.defining discrimination in the commerce clause context.therefore,the commissioner citation to exxon is inapposite.exxon involved a statute that did not facially discriminate,see exxon,at.plainly,the maryland statute does not discriminate against interstate goods,nor does it favor local producers and refiners.accordingly,the court was using the factors cited by commissioner odom to determine whether the statute in question unduly had a discriminatory effect,see id.at.those factors are irrelevant in a case involving facial discrimination 
commissioner odom also challenges the district court decision by arguing that congress somehow condoned louisiana legislation.we recognize that congress may permit a state to enact legislation that would otherwise violate the commerce clause,but its intent to do so must be expressly stated.new orleans ass n,at citing.timber,wunnicke,d.the fact that the state policy involved appears to be consistent with federal even that state policy furthers the goals we might believe that congress had in an insufficient indicium of congressional intent.timber,at.there is no express statement in either of the statutes cited by the commissioner,t or the lanham act,regarding the power of the states to enact catfish labeling legislation that discriminates against foreign commerce.see t lanham act,et.the commissioner relies on his interpretation of the purposes of t and the lanham prevent the labeling of foreign fish as catfish and to prevent initial interest confusion,support his position that federal law allows the actions employed by louisiana,but even if we agreed with his interpretation of those statutes,his reliance on their purposes,rather than their express language,indicates that congress has made no express statement regarding state catfish labeling laws that discriminate against commerce.a state statute that violates the commerce clause can not be saved by a showing that it is consistent with the purposes behind federal law.timber,at.
because we find that the catfish statute discriminates on its face against foreign commerce,we presume that it is invalid.see kraft foods,at.to overcome this presumption,the commissioner must demonstrate that the catfish statute serves a legitimate local purpose that can not be adequately served by reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives.new energy of,at.see also kraft foods,at.this the commissioner has not done because he thinks the catfish statute does not discriminate,he only comes forward with evidence that the statute burden is minimal in relation to its local benefits.this evidence,even if accepted as true,is not enough to satisfy the commissioner heightened burden under strict scrutiny review.see camps,at.stating that because the appellant made no effort to defend the statute under the per se rule,the court would not address whether strict scrutiny was satisfied.absent a compelling justification,which the commissioner has not offered,the catfish statute is invalid.because we find that the catfish statute violates the dormant foreign commerce clause,we do not address whether it is preempted
