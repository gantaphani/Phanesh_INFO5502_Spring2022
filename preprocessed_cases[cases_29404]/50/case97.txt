there are three central issues in this appeal.first,we must decide whether the district court abused its discretion in entertaining a declaratory judgment action regarding a noncompetition agreement nca filed by william manuel against convergys corporation and its subsidiaries collectively convergys.second,we must decide whether the district court erred in ruling that georgia has sufficient contacts with the declaratory judgment action to justify application of georgia law to the nca.under georgia law,the nca is invalid and unenforceable.third,we must decide whether the district court properly applied georgia law in dismissing convergys trade secret counterclaim.finding no reversible error,we affirm.
background 
a large,publicly traded company with its principal place of business in ohio,convergys offers information management and customer management services worldwide.a subsidiary sells outsourced human resource services for large public and private employers hr outsourcing.in,manuel joined this subsidiary as a sales manager,and in june he was promoted to director of sales.at all times during his employment with convergys,manuel lived and worked in florida.
pursuant to the promotion in,manuel signed the nca.this agreement prohibits manuel from competing with convergys or soliciting its customers for two years following the termination of his employment.the nca contains a provision requiring the application of ohio law and states that any disputes related to the nca may be brought in the state and federal courts of hamilton county,ohio.
on march,manuel interviewed with mellon financial corporation mellon for a position with its hr outsourcing sales team,working either in atlanta,georgia or charlotte,north carolina.while there is some factual dispute as to whether manuel first chose to work in north carolina,he eventually was offered the job in georgia.as to the nca,manuel advised mellon that he did not believe convergys would view mellon as a competitor and would not challenge his employment.nevertheless,manuel and mellon discussed the possibility that convergys might sue to enforce the nca.
manuel subsequently sought counsel.his newly hired lawyer concluded that the nca constituted an illegal restraint of trade under georgia law and that manuel should therefore be free to work for mellon in georgia.manuel lawyer warned,however,that if convergys obtained an ohio judgment validating the nca,a georgia court would likely enforce it.the lawyer therefore recommended that the only thing manuel could do to prevent this scenario would be to file first in georgia,exh.f at.
after accepting mellon offer on april,manuel met with the georgia lawyers who would file this action.on april,manuel resigned from convergys,although he agreed to stay on until the middle of the month.during that time,manuel told convergys that he was not going to work for a competitor and that he had not accepted a job with another company.on april,manuel signed an apartment lease in georgia and obtained a georgia driver license.on april,manuel filed suit against convergys in georgia seeking a declaration that the nca was illegal,invalid,and unenforceable.
six days later,a senior executive at convergys told manuel that he might be able to structure his job with mellon so that he would not violate the nca.nevertheless,the lawsuit against convergys proceeded.on may,convergys removed the case to the district court for the northern district of georgia.on the same day,convergys filed suit against manuel and mellon in an ohio state court for violation of the nca and misappropriation of trade secrets.subsequently,convergys filed a counterclaim in this action that alleged misappropriation of trade secrets.the company also requested that the district court defer ruling on manuel motion for summary judgment pending resolution of the ohio action.the district court denied convergys motion and granted both manuel motion for summary judgment and manuel motion to dismiss convergys counterclaim.
ii.discussion 
a.the declaratory judgment action 
the decision to hear a declaratory judgment action is reviewed for abuse of discretion.wilton seven falls,d old republic union ins.tillis trucking,cir.the supreme court has described this discretion as unique and substantial.wilton,at.at.as we have stated previously,the abuse of discretion standard allows a range of choice for the district court,so long as that choice does not constitute a clear error of judgment.rasbury irs,cir internal quotations omitted.
the factors relevant in deciding whether to hear a declaratory judgment action are equitable in nature.see kerotest fire equip.as such,the supreme court has warned against a rigid and mechanical approach in applying the federal declaratory judgments act.id.our court has previously recognized convenience of the parties and the forum connection with the controversy as relevant,albeit nonexclusive,factors.see amerada petroleum marshall,cir.some courts simply apply the same general factors that are considered in a motion to transfer under a see,patent dev.am.hosp.supply,essentially the same factors that are of significance on a motion to stay a action come into play on a motion to transfer under section a.
where two actions involving overlapping issues and parties are pending in two federal courts,there is a strong presumption across the federal circuits that favors the forum of the suit under the rule.see,united states fire ins.goodyear tire rubber,cir describing the rule as church of scientology of cal.united states dep t of defense,cir noting that the rule should not be disregarded lightly.we are no exception.see merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,haydu,cir.moreover,we require that the party objecting to jurisdiction in the forum carry the burden of proving compelling circumstances to warrant an exception to the rule.id.
in determining whether compelling circumstances exist,we have recognized that for declaratory judgment actions one equitable consideration is whether the action was filed in apparent anticipation of the other pending proceeding,dep t of the treasury,cir see also amerada petroleum,at noting that filing a declaratory judgment action in anticipation of suit in another forum is an equitable consideration which the district court was entitled to take into account.even if a court finds that a filing is anticipatory,this consideration does not transmogrify into an obligatory rule mandating dismissal.see,at.such a finding still remains one equitable factor among many that a district court can consider in determining whether to hear a declaratory judgment action.see see also wilton,at.at.
in this case,convergys argues that ohio is the proper forum for full resolution of this action.convergys two central objections to the georgia forum are that manuel lied to convergys about his employment with mellon to surreptitiously win a race to the courthouse,and that manuel engaged in improper forum shopping and selected a forum with a slight and manufactured connection to the controversy.central to our analysis is the fact that georgia was the forum in which this action was filed first.see merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,at cir in the absence of compelling circumstances,the court initially seized of the controversy should be the one to decide the case.we remain unconvinced that compelling circumstances exist to justify not only an exception to the rule,but also to justify the abrogation of the district court informed discretion.
as to the first objection,convergys alleges that manuel purposely lied about where he was going to work so that he could file suit in georgia before convergys was able to directly threaten him with imminent litigation in ohio.in convergys view,manuel won an illicit race to the courthouse and the district court thereby erred in rewarding him with a declaratory judgment action.while manuel behavior was not exemplary,it does not rise to a level that would require us to conclude that the district court abused its discretion.see keener convergys,cir.in keener,which is strikingly similar to this case,a convergys employee admittedly lied to the company about his future employment to avoid enforcement of a similar nca.id.at.that employee then took a job with a competitor of convergys in georgia.id.while there,he filed a declaratory judgment action challenging the validity of a nca.id.we found that this misrepresentation,combined with keener preemptive declaratory suit,deprived convergys of the opportunity to enforce a nca in ohio.id.nevertheless,we agreed with the district court determination that the application of georgia law was not arbitrary or constitutionally impermissible because convergys would be attempting to enforce the nca against keener,who is living and working in georgia,where the effects would be felt.id.at.having previously concluded,under very similar facts,that the application of georgia law by the district court was neither arbitrary nor constitutionally impermissible,we conclude in this case that the initial decision to entertain the declaratory action by the district court is also not an arbitrary or impermissible decision 
additionally,the district court conclusion that manuel filing was not improperly anticipatory has support in the record.distinguishing,which upheld a decision to dismiss a declaratory judgment action when the action was filed the day after receipt of a letter promising judicial proceedings if an assessed penalty was not paid forthwith,the district court reasonably concluded that a similar threat was not present in this case.see,at.at no point did convergys threaten manuel with specific legal proceedings.instead,the district court found that convergys did not immediately file suit to enforce the nca against manuel even after learning of his new employer,but continued to seek assurances that manuel job would not violate the agreement.while there undoubtedly was a reasonable apprehension that a controversy existed sufficient to satisfy the constitutional requirements for a declaratory judgment action,this is not equivalent to an imminent threat of litigation.otherwise each time a party sought declaratory judgment in one forum,a defendant filing a second suit in a forum more favorable to defendant could always prevail under the anticipatory filing exception,intercontinental florist.
even if manuel were directly threatened,our precedent does not stand for the proposition that the district court was required to dismiss a declaratory judgment action when the action was filed in apparent anticipation of another proceeding.see,at.instead,our precedent stands for the proposition that the district court did not abuse its discretion in relying on that fact to dismiss the action.id.that choice,which involves a number of considerations,remains vested in the district court absent a clear error of judgment.see kerotest,at.at.
as to the second objection,convergys argues that the filing in georgia constituted improper forum shopping.we agree with the district court that there is nothing inequitable in manuel seeking legal advice and later choosing to work in a state that shared his view that the nca was invalid and unenforceable.see mccuin texas power light,cir the existence of these choices among various jurisdictions not only permits but indeed invites counsel in an adversary system,seeking to serve his client interests,to select the forum that he considers most receptive to his cause.moreover,an analysis of the equitable considerations available to the district court does not compel the conclusion that georgia connections to this action are slight or manufactured.several relevant considerations favor the georgia forum.apart from being the forum where the action was first filed,manuel works and lives in georgia,where the alleged violation of the nca occurred.additionally,many,if not most,of the potential witnesses that convergys might have called in this action are located in florida,a neighboring state to georgia.the relative means of the parties also favor the georgia forum.manuel is a georgia resident who chose a georgia forum and his means are not comparable to convergys.additionally,convergys counterclaim alleges that manuel violated the georgia trade secrets act by taking a job with mellon in georgia.most of the documents and witnesses relating to this claim would likely be found in georgia.
in contrast,several considerations disfavor the ohio forum.the nca was not executed in ohio.manuel did not have an office in ohio.the alleged breach of the contract did not take place in ohio.the location of documents and the ease of access to sources of proof do not favor ohio.furthermore,the district court noted that there were serious questions as to whether the ohio has personal jurisdiction over manuel.additionally,the choice of law clause requiring application of ohio law is of dubious relevance to this analysis,because this court has already ruled in a previous case against convergys that this clause is not enforceable in georgia.keener,at.
in short,the range of considerations available to the district court in deciding whether to entertain the declaratory action is vast and the deference afforded to its decision is substantial.see kerotest,at.at the factors relevant to wise administration are equitable in nature.necessarily,an ample degree of discretion,appropriate for disciplined and experienced judges,must be left to the lower courts.in its opinion,the district court even noted manuel federalism argument,which relied on a georgia statute that provided a litigant with a right to have his case accelerated when a defendant files a subsequent action in another state on the same controversy additionally,there has been no showing that the district court was incapable of resolving the parties entire controversy.thus,we find ample support in the record that the district court decision to hear the declaratory judgment action was not an abuse of discretion.
convergys alleges that georgia has no significant contacts with the parties or events giving rise to the dispute and argues that the application of georgia law to the nca is therefore unconstitutional under allstate ins.hague,d.keener is once again on point.the application of georgia law is not arbitrary or constitutionally impermissible because convergys would be attempting to enforce the nca against keener,who is living and working in georgia,where the effects would be felt.keener,at.that is also true in this case.despite convergys assertions to the contrary,the fact that manuel conducted legal research before relocating to georgia to live and work does not render the application of georgia law to the nca unconstitutional.
applying keener,the district court did not err in concluding that the nca was contrary to georgia public policy and that georgia law therefore applied.see id.at.under georgia law,the court correctly held that the nca was unenforceable due to its overbreadth and indeterminate geographic reach.see id.convergys does not dispute that the nca is unenforceable under georgia law.
convergys trade secrets counterclaim 
on a motion to dismiss,the standard of review is the same for the appellate court as it was for the trial court.spain brown williamson tobacco,cir internal quotations omitted.thus,w e review de novo the district court grant of a motion to dismiss under rule b for failure to state a claim,accepting the allegations in the complaint as true and construing them in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.hill white,cir.
convergys pleaded its trade secrets counterclaim under both georgia and ohio law.the claim alleges that convergys entrusted manuel with the following kinds of trade secret and confidential business information pricing price lists programs and processes sold,licensed,or developed by convergys technical data,plans,and specifications relating to present and future development projects financial and marketing data computer programs,systems,and software processes improvements designs and redesigns.convergys further alleges that manuel will inevitably use this confidential information during his employment with mellon.under the liberal pleading standards of federal rule of civil procedure a,convergys contends that it satisfied the requirement for a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the
