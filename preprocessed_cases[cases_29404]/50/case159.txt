defendant jerome cotton appeals from the trial court order issuing a preliminary injunction in favor of his former employer,plaintiff readylink healthcare readylink.the preliminary injunction contains paragraphs a and paragraph a enjoins cotton from soliciting readylink employees and customers,including readylink agents,nurses,remote recruiters,hospitals,and other healthcare facilities and professionals under contract with readylink.paragraph b enjoins cotton from using or disclosing readylink trade secrets or other confidential information cotton took or received from readylink.paragraph b lists numerous items as protectable trade secret items.
cotton contends the trial court abused its discretion in issuing the preliminary injunction because readylink is not likely to prevail on its claims and failed to establish it would suffer irreparable harm in the absence of the injunction.cotton also claims the injunction should have been denied because it is premised on an unenforceable clause.in addition,cotton argues many of the enjoined items are not trade secrets and the injunction language is vague and ambiguous.
since cotton only appealed paragraph a of the injunction,we address only those challenges pertaining to that portion of the injunction.we conclude there was no abuse of discretion enjoining the conduct specified in paragraph regardless of the enforceability of the noncompetition agreements,there is sufficient evidence establishing that cotton misappropriated trade secrets there remained an imminent threat of him using the trade secret information to solicit readylink employees and customers and readylink likely would suffer irreparable harm unless the injunction was granted.under such circumstances,the injunction was proper.we also reject cotton contention paragraph a of the preliminary injunction is vague and ambiguous,with the exception of certain language in the injunction which is overly broad and ambiguous and thus must be stricken.
factual and procedural background 
readylink is a licensed healthcare service provider,with a nurse staffing division which provides healthcare facilities and professionals with nurses.readylink recruits,interviews,and hires nurses as its own employees and then assigns them to its customer healthcare providers who request nurses.the nurses are recruited by readylink agents and remote recruiters,and are normally under contract with readylink for a three month period.readylink is responsible for paying its nurses according to the compensation terms agreed to in the nurses employment contracts with readylink.readylink provides its nurses with benefits and workers compensation and malpractice coverage.
readylink enters into separate contracts with its healthcare provider customers wherein the customers agree to pay readylink a specified fee for readylink providing them with nurses.readylink uses a portion of that fee to pay its nurses and retains the remainder.
according to the declaration of elizabeth ann watts,executive of readylink corporate division,and cotton former supervisor,readylink has invested a great deal of time,money,and effort developing its database of nurses and healthcare provider customers.this information is used to recruit nurses and service its clientele.the databases have economic value because they are the result of extensive expenditures of time,effort and money,and the materials contain information not generally known within the trade,and the materials represent substantial research and compilation of existing and prospective customer data,as well as existing and prospective client nurse data readylink paid and invested tens of thousands of dollars in procuring these lists and rendering them useful,and readylink invested a great deal of employee time in developing and making these lists useful,the financial and compensation plan information are plans developed and created by readylink at significant costs and time and they involve numerous confidential documents and these innovative programs are unique in the industry and give readylink a competitive advantage.one such plan readylink developed is a unique compensation plan referred to as the per diem program,which nurses tend to favor over competitors compensation plans.
in her supplemental declaration,watts further states that the value of various enumerated proprietary and confidential items is extraordinary.developing an ongoing database and its maintenance is the lifeblood of readylink entire business.the company employs hundreds of full time employees to maintain and develop our data base.readylink has invested very heavily in the development of our systems and files,education programs,special to give us an edge in the competition from the first day of business readylink actively recruited employees,building an electronic database on each employee that must be continually updated and managed just as any employee database would be.this endeavor has been very costly.readylink has a workforce of over people in the office working on the development and maintenance of that database and mobile work force.this information,according to watts,is not generally known to the public or readylink competitors.
readylink employs a sales force to recruit nurses,secure new business,and service existing customers.in july,readylink hired cotton.in september,cotton signed an employment agreement and employee confidentiality,and agreement pertaining to maintaining confidentiality and nondisclosure of readylink proprietary information,including readylink trade secrets.
in section of the employment agreement cotton agreed not to directly or indirectly,hire,provide information to others who may want to hire,solicit,or encourage to leave,any employee,consultant,client,agent,independent contractor,or contractor of readylink for three years after termination of cotton employment.cotton also agreed not to accept employment with any client or client facility to which s he may have worked with or for,or have been assigned while an employee of readylink without the prior written approval of readylink for three years after termination of cotton employment.
in january,cotton became a readylink nurse recruiting agent.cotton signed an agent agreement and another proprietary confidential information,agreement.the agreement stated in detail proprietary information that cotton was prohibited from disclosing,including those items listed in paragraph b of the preliminary injunction.it also contained a section stating that in order to forestall disclosure of proprietary information,upon cotton termination,he was prohibited for three years thereafter from soliciting readylink employees or customers attempting to divert business from readylink and engaging in any business in competition with readylink business.
on march,readylink fired cotton for stealing readylink records containing proprietary and confidential information.cotton authorized a search of his residence and storage locker.during the search,the police recovered one or two boxes of stolen readylink documents.cotton was also caught,while employed at readylink,on videotape entering readylink private offices late at night and copying payroll practices,confidential documents,and notes.although the police investigated the theft,cotton was not prosecuted.
upon termination of his employment,cotton signed a declaration acknowledging misappropriation and improper use of readylink confidential and proprietary information attempting to form his own company in competition with readylink and improperly soliciting readylink employees to staff his company and investors for his new company.
despite agreeing in his declaration not to become employed at any other healthcare staffing company,he began working at a readylink competitor,registry network,two weeks after his termination at readylink.
in april,readylink sued cotton and his new employer,registry network,for violating the uniform trade secrets act utsa,et,unfair competition,intentional interference with economic relations,tortuous interference with prospective business advantage,breach of contract,and defamation.readylink requested injunctive relief,as well as damages prohibiting cotton from disclosing readylink proprietary information to registry network and soliciting readylink employees and customers.readylink alleged cotton stole confidential and proprietary information concerning readylink finances,clients,employee contacts,payroll practices,and business methodology.
in april,after readylink notified registry network of cotton theft of readylink confidential and proprietary information,cotton employment at registry network terminated.
in april,shortly after filing its lawsuit,readylink requested a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction.in july,the court granted readylink a preliminary injunction but,since the court did not order a bond posted,the preliminary injunction was deemed invalid and dissolved.in october,readylink again requested a preliminary injunction and for some unknown reason,which is not reflected in the record,the court denied readylink injunctive relief without prejudice.in january,readylink again requested a preliminary injunction,which the court granted in march 
in the preliminary injunction,the trial court enjoined cotton from engaging in or performing two categories of activity specified in paragraphs a and b of the order.paragraph a states that cotton shall cease and desist and refrain from engaging in any solicitation of readylink healthcare employees,or agents,nurses,or remote recruiters,or anyone under contract with readylink healthcare or associated with readylink healthcare hospitals under contract with readylink healthcare and any other healthcare facility or healthcare professional in a business relationship with readylink healthcare in regard to the nurse staffing business.paragraph b enjoins cotton from using or disclosing trade secrets or other confidential information taken or received from readylink healthcare in any manner.the injunction lists the enjoined trade secret items.
cotton appealed the preliminary injunction by filing a notice of appeal expressly appealing paragraph a of the order granting preliminary injunction.
notice of appeal 
readylink argues that cotton appeal is limited to paragraph a of the preliminary injunction order.cotton does not refute this contention in his reply brief.cotton filed a notice of partial appeal from the order granting a preliminary injunction against cotton.cotton states in his notice of appeal that he is only appealing paragraph a of the order granting preliminary injunction.
in determining whether cotton appeal is limited to that portion of the preliminary injunction specified in the notice of appeal,we must first determine whether the specified portion is severable the well recognized rule is that there may be an appeal from a part of a judgment only if that part is severable.citations.where portions of a judgment are truly severable,the appellate court is without jurisdiction to consider the parts from which no appeal has been taken.citations.and the appellate court will consider the portion before it independently of the other parts.citations.modification or reversal of the portion of the judgment from which the appeal has been taken has no effect upon the other portions.citations.american enterprise,van winkle cal d,see also gonzales novick constr.cal d.
as explained in gonzales novick constr,supra,cal d at,ordinarily an appeal from a specific portion of a judgment would leave the parts not appealed from unaffected,and it would logically follow that such unaffected parts must be deemed final,being a final judgment of the facts and rights which they determine t he court upon such partial appeal can inquire only with respect to the portion appealed from.ibid,quoting whalen smith cal.
paragraph a of the preliminary injunction order enjoins cotton from soliciting readylink employees,nurses,healthcare providers,and others under contract with readylink.although cotton filed a partial appeal limiting his appeal to paragraph a,in his opening appellant brief cotton challenges not only paragraph a but also paragraph b of the order.since cotton only appealed paragraph a of the injunction,this court lacks jurisdiction to consider cotton challenge to paragraph b enjoining the use or disclosure of trade secrets.paragraph b is not so intimately connected with the part appealed from that a reversal of that part would require a reconsideration of the whole case in the court below.gonzales novick constr,supra,cal d at,quoting whalen smith,supra,cal.at.
as a consequence,we apply the general principle that an appeal from a distinct and independent part of a judgment does not bring up the other parts for review in the appellate court.gonzales novick constr,supra,cal d at,quoting whalen smith,supra,cal.at.this opinion is thus limited to review of paragraph a of the preliminary injunction order and paragraph b will stand as a final adjudication.
injunctive relief 
cotton contends the trial court abused its discretion granting readylink a preliminary injunction.he claims there is insufficient evidence that readylink will prevail on the merits and suffer irreparable harm in the absence of the preliminary injunction.
since cotton only appealed the portion of the injunction enjoining solicitation paragraph a,we limit our discussion solely to the sufficiency of evidence as to paragraph a of the injunction concerning cotton solicitation of readylink employees and customers.
standard of review 
a preliminary injunction is governed by the following principles in deciding whether to issue a preliminary injunction,a trial court weighs two interrelated factors the likelihood the moving party ultimately will prevail on the merits,and the relative interim harm to the parties from the issuance or nonissuance of the injunction.whyte schlage lock th,d,quoting hunt superior court cal th,d,see also american credit indemnity sacks d.
we apply the abuse of discretion standard of review in reviewing the lower court order granting the preliminary injunction.the law is well settled that the decision to grant a preliminary injunction rests in the sound discretion of the trial court.citations.a trial court will be found to have abused its discretion only when it has exceeded the bounds of reason or contravened the uncontradicted evidence.citations.further,the burden rests with the party challenging the injunction to make a clear showing of an abuse of discretion.citations.american credit indemnity sacks,supra,d at.this court does not resolve conflicts in the evidence,reweigh the evidence,or assess the credibility of witnesses.citation.thus,even when presented by declaration,if the evidence on the application is in conflict,we must interpret the facts in the light most favorable to the prevailing party and indulge in all reasonable inferences in support of the trial court order.whyte schlage lock,supra,th at,d.
b.the likelihood of prevailing 
cotton argues readylink is not likely to prevail on the merits because readylink is seeking permanent injunctive relief based on an illegal covenant not to compete and on readylink items that are not protectable trade secrets.we disagree while it has been legally recognized that a former employee may use general knowledge,skill,and experience acquired in his or her former employment in competition with a former employer,the former employee may not use confidential information or trade secrets in doing so.morlife,perry th,d.this is precisely what cotton attempted to do and there remains the threat he will do so in the future if not enjoined.we acknowledge the important legal right of persons to engage in businesses and occupations of their choosing.however,we also recognize that,fundamental to the preservation of our free market economic system,there is the concomitant right to have the ingenuity and industry one invests in the success of the business or occupation protected from the gratuitous use of that by others.morlife,perry th,d.
here,there is ample evidence supporting the trial court finding that readylink is likely to prevail on its misappropriation of trade secret claim brought under the utsa and unfair competition claim bus,et.
trade secrets 
as regards cotton challenge to paragraph a,there is overwhelming evidence that in soliciting readylink employees,nurses,and healthcare provider customers,cotton used trade secret information within the meaning of the utsa.we note,however,our decision regarding trade secret status is based upon the appellate record and is not a final adjudication on the merits.citations.the ultimate determination of trade secret status is subject to proof presented at trial.whyte schlage lock,supra,th at,d.
a trade secret,as defined in the utsa,as information,including a formula,pattern,compilation,program,device,method,technique,or process,that derives independent economic value,actual or potential,from not being generally known to the public or to other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use and is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy,subd.d.
civil code section,subdivision a of the utsa allows a plaintiff to recover damages for losses caused by misappropriation of trade secrets,and civil code section,subdivision a provides that a ctual or threatened misappropriation may be enjoined.under civil code section,subdivision c,affirmative acts to protect a trade secret may be compelled by court order.
the court may also enjoin the use or disclosure of trade secrets under the unfair competition provisions,particularly business and professions code section,which provides for injunctive relief against a ny person who engages,has engaged,or proposes to engage in unfair competition 
in the instant case,upon cotton termination from readylink,he admitted he misappropriated proprietary and confidential information from readylink,and that disclosure of such information violated local,state,and federal law.he also admitted that as a consequence of misappropriating such information,it would not be possible for him to engage in the healthcare staffing business without indirectly or inadvertently using or disclosing such proprietary information.
the declarations supporting readylink injunction also provide overwhelming evidence that cotton intended to start his own nurse staffing business in competition with readylink,using readylink trade secret information.before and after readylink fired him,he illicitly solicited readylink employees and nurses,using readylink proprietary and confidential information,such as readylink databases containing lists of readylink nurses,employees,and healthcare facility customers,compilations of compensation,employment preferences,contact information,nurse applications and tests,and readylink unique per diem program.
the supporting declarations sufficiently establish that this trade secret information has potential economic value because readylink went to great expense to compile the data and the information would enable a competitor to recruit away from readylink nurses and employees under contract with readylink.
furthermore,readylink took reasonable steps to ensure the secrecy of its trade secret information by requesting employees to sign nondisclosure agreements.cotton entered into two employment agreements in which he agreed not to use or disclose readylink proprietary and confidential information.
we further note that,by not appealing paragraph b of the preliminary injunction,which enjoins the use or disclosing of readylink trade secret information,cotton has in effect conceded these items are enjoinable trade secrets.in addition,cotton does not argue in his appellant opening brief or reply that each and every item enjoined in paragraph b is not a trade secret,thus conceding that some of the enjoined items are protectable trade secrets.
as explained in hollingsworth solderless terminal turley,mere solicitation of an employee,under no contract of employment,to leave and associate with a competing firm is not illegal.citation.however,if either the defecting employee or the competitor is guilty of some concomitant,unconscionable conduct,the injured former employer has a cause of action to recover for the detriment he has thereby suffered.citation.thus,if there is a misappropriation of trade secrets as a concomitant of the solicitation,citation,relief would be granted.
here there is sufficient evidence establishing that readylink is likely to prevail on its trade secret misappropriation claims.the evidence supports a reasonable finding that at the time of the preliminary injunction hearing there existed a threat that cotton would use misappropriated trade secret information to solicit readylink employees and customers who had contracts with readylink.the holding in courtesy temporary service,camacho d,a factually similar case,supports this conclusion.
in courtesy,the plaintiff,a temporary employment agency,provided various companies with temporary workers.the defendants,former employees of the agency,admitted scheming to form a competitive business and compiled a list of the agency major customers while employed by the agency.the agency sued the defendants for unfair trade practices and injunctive relief for setting up a competing agency.the trial court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining the former employees from soliciting the agency customers and temporary labor force.the trial court also found,however,that the agency customer list and related information was unprotected work product,and thus denied an injunction enjoining use and disclosure of the information.
the courtesy court reversed the trial court ruling denying the injunction,concluding the customer list was a protectable trade secret under the utsa and unfair competition statutes.in reaching this conclusion,the courtesy court noted that the utsa and case law establish that a customer list procured by substantial time,effort,and expense is a protectable trade secret.courtesy temporary service,camacho,supra,d at.such a list is a protectable trade secret even if the list contains information available to the public or competitors e ven if the customers names could be found in telephone or trade directories,such public sources would not disclose the persons who ultimately made up the list of plaintiff customers.citation.it is the list of persons who actually purchase courtesy services that constitute confidential information.courtesy,supra,at.
the courtesy court thus concluded that here,the evidence established that courtesy customer list and related information was the product of a substantial amount of time,expense and effort on the part of courtesy.moreover,the nature and character of the subject customer information,billing rates,key contacts,specialized requirements and markup rates,is sophisticated information and irrefutably of commercial value and not readily ascertainable to other competitors.thus,courtesy customer list and related proprietary information satisfy the first prong of the definition of trade secret under section.courtesy temporary service,camacho,supra,d at.
likewise,here,some of the enjoined information might have been available to the public to readylink competitors but there is substantial evidence establishing that readylink lists of hospitals and nurses,as well as other proprietary and confidential information listed in the preliminary injunction,were procured by substantial time,effort,and expense.
considering the admitted misappropriation of sophisticated,detailed customer information and active solicitation by cotton in the instant case,the trial court granting readylink injunctive relief was not an abuse of discretion.courtesy temporary service,camacho,supra,d at.in courtesy,the court also found that the trial court should have granted a preliminary injunction under the unfair competition provisions,business and professions code section,et.courtesy,supra,at.the court concluded that,even if courtesy customer list would not qualify as a trade secret under section,the unfair and deceptive practices of employees in stealing courtesy customers should have been enjoined under business and professions code section et ibid.
in discussing unfair competition,the court in courtesy explained that a former employee has the right to compete with his former employer,even for the business of those who had formerly been the customer
