dtm research,dtm,a maryland limited liability company,commenced this diversity action against at t corporation at t,seeking a declaratory judgment,injunctive relief,and million in damages.the complaint alleges that at t misappropriated dtm trade secrets during the course of contract negotiations between the two companies involving at t possible employment of dtm expertise in data mining.during the course of discovery,at t issued subpoenas to agencies of the united states and persons who have dealt with the agencies to discover evidence in support of at t hypothesis that dtm claimed trade secrets related to technology that dtm misappropriated from the united states.when the district court granted the united states motion to quash the subpoenas,based on the united states assertion of a state secrets privilege,at t moved for summary judgment on the ground that the district court protective order precluded it from defending the case effectively.the district court denied at t motion,but agreed to certify two issues to this court under b.although the questions can not be definitively answered in the absence of,we affirm the district court conclusions at this stage of the proceedings.
in connection with at t interest in efficiently marketing its telecommunications products and services to the rapidly growing market by better exploiting its own extensive databases,it entered into negotiations with dtm in early.dtm claimed special knowledge and expertise in analyzing large amounts of data and offered its orca blue process,which it described as a new and unprecedented group of methods,techniques and processes for mining and analyzing immense quantities of call detail data,to identify,for marketing purposes,various segments of the population from records.because dtm claimed that its knowledge and information were trade secrets,it demanded that at t personnel who would be evaluating orca blue enter into confidentiality agreements.
at t personnel signed the confidentiality agreements and then worked with dtm personnel to set up a demonstration of dtm data mining techniques in a limited market in san diego.following the demonstration,at t acknowledged that the results were promising.the parties could not,however,agree on a contract because at t believed that the million asking price was too high and that it would be better served if it used its own capability to complete the task of data mining.at t also believed that issues of customer confidentiality counseled against awarding the contract to dtm because the operation of orca blue might require sharing confidential consumer information with dtm.
following at t rejection of dtm proposals,dtm filed this action,alleging that at t terminated negotiations only after obtaining its trade secrets in orca blue and that at t then incorporated the secret information into its already existing technology,thereby allowing it to enhance its capabilities at the expense of dtm.at t defense is,in part,based on its belief that aspects of orca blue had been misappropriated by dtm from the united states in the course of work that dtm and other companies had earlier performed for the united states.at t also believes that the alleged trade secrets involve technology commonly used throughout the industry.
to discover evidence relating to its defenses,at t issued subpoenas to various agencies of the united states,as well as to various commercial entities that allegedly had worked in developing technology for the united states to obtain evidence to prove that whatever trade secret existed in orca blue did not belong to dtm but rather to the united states.the united states intervened and,invoking the state secrets privilege,moved to quash at t subpoenas.the united states took no position on whether the technology at issue is similar to any technology that it owns but claimed that any inquiry into technology of the type described in at t subpoenas would threaten national security.the district court granted the government motion and severely circumscribed at t discovery in this area.at t then filed a motion for summary judgment,arguing that the district court order quashing its subpoenas prevented at t from freely and fairly defending the claims brought against it and that therefore the district court should enter judgment in favor of at 
after denying at t motion,the district court nevertheless granted at t request to certify two issues to this court under b.the district court posed the following questions 
did the court,in its opinion and order of december,correctly hold that fee simple ownership is not an element of any of the claims set forth in plaintiff dtm complaint against defendant at t for violation of the maryland trade secrets act count i,violation of a confidentiality agreement between the parties count ii,quantum meruit count iii,and unjust enrichment count iv 
do the court orders of december,and november,which preclude inquiry into the alleged theft of dtm of trade secrets from the government based on the government assertion of the state secrets privilege deny at t a fair trial and therefore require termination of all or any part of this litigation 
by order dated april,we granted permission to appeal.
on the first question posed,the district court,applying maryland law,which the parties agree applies,ruled 
the court is persuaded by dtm argument that the sense of fee simple absolute not necessary and that mere possession is sufficient to sustain a cause of action under the maryland uniform trade secrets act.as dtm points out,neither the act nor the case law itself explicitly require s the plaintiff in a trade secrets case to be the outright owner of the trade secret at issue.but dtm is also correct from a historical standpoint.
maryland law of conversion fully reflects this heritage.in order to recover for conversion,one must either have been in actual possession or have had the right to immediate possession in the converted asset.
the court concludes that possession,not ownership or right to title,is all that is required to sustain a cause of action under the uniform trade secrets act.accordingly,the court finds that at t ownership defense would not constitute a valid dispositive defense and that preclusion of discovery into the issue of dtm ownership of the orca blue technology can have no prejudicial impact on the ability of at t to continue in this litigation.

contending that the district court erred in this ruling,at t argues that well established principles of trade secrets law oblige a plaintiff,as part of its prima facie case,to establish that it owns the trade secret that is the subject of the dispute,see surgidev eye,first element in a trade secret claim is that the plaintiff is the owner of a trade secret,or that the plaintiff has come to possess the trade secret,either by way of assignment,license,or some other means of conveyance from the owner or discoverer such that the owner no longer has a right to use the trade secret,see licorish exxon,dist.lexis.accordingly,at t argues that proof that dtm possession of the trade secrets in orca blue is wrongful would provide it a complete defense against dtm suit,regardless of the manner by which at t obtained the trade secret.
dtm accepts the proposition that as part of its prima facie case,it must show either that it developed the trade secret at issue or otherwise is in lawful possession of it.it asserts that it is prepared to present evidence at trial on the means by which it developed orca blue to satisfy this obligation.dtm,however,disagrees with at t contention that if at t proved that dtm misappropriated orca blue technology from a third party,at t would be exonerated of its own misappropriation of that technology from dtm.dtm relies on the maryland law of theft which provides that i t is not a defense to theft that the property was taken,obtained,or withheld from a person who had obtained possession of the property by illegal means,b.
to the extent that a trade secret misappropriation case draws on principles of personal property law,we agree with the district court that a traditional analysis
