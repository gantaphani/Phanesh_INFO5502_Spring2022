in hameid national fire ins.of hartford cal th,d,hameid,the court considered the scope of the term advertising as it is used in standard commercial general liability cgl insurance policies.the court found that advertising and solicitation are mutually exclusive terms.because cgl policies do not cover liability incurred for acts of solicitation,the court found that a claim arising solely out of the appellant solicitation of individuals was not covered by the appellant cgl policy.
here we consider a variant of the cgl policy,which,unlike the policy considered in hameid,contained the following definition of advertisement advertisement means a notice that is broadcast or published to the general public or specific market segments about your goods,products or services for the purpose of attracting customers or supporters.contrary to appellant argument,this definition,while not considered by the court in hameid,did not expand the scope of the policy advertising coverage to include personal promotion or solicitation of business.
because the record here does not disclose the occurrence of any activity which was covered under the advertising provisions of appellant policy,the trial court did not err in granting the insurer motion for summary judgment.
a.the underlying claim 
in june plaintiff rombe corporation rombe was a franchisee of trc staffing services trc,a nationwide temporary employment agency.on june,rombe invited customers and employees of its franchise to a breakfast meeting at a hotel.at the meeting rod beals,one of rombe principals,announced that rombe would no longer be affiliated with trc.rather,beals announced rombe would be starting a new employment agency,smart staffing solutions.beals asked those in attendance to become customers and employees of the new agency.the breakfast meeting and rombe plans were later reported in an internet newsletter.
on the following day,june,rombe sent trc a letter advising trc that rombe would not be renewing its franchise agreement when that agreement expired on september.
on september,trc sued rombe.trc alleged causes of action for breach of contract,misappropriation of trade secrets and unfair competition.
coverage litigation 
at the time trc filed its complaint against rombe,rombe was covered by a premier businessowners policy issued by defendant amco insurance company amco.the policy amco issued was in many important respects similar to the cgl policy considered in hameid.like the policy in hameid,amco policy provided liability coverage for advertising injuries.like the policy considered in hameid,the advertising offenses covered by amco policy included slander or libel violation of the right to privacy copyright,title or slogan infringement and misappropriation of advertising ideas or style of doing business.as we noted at the outset,unlike the policy considered in hameid,the amco policy included the following definition of advertisement a notice that is broadcast or published to the general public or specific market segments about your goods,products or services for the purpose of attracting customers or supporters.
rombe tendered defense of the trc complaint to amco.because amco did not believe the complaint or any information provided by rombe disclosed the existence or potential existence of any covered claim,amco declined rombe tender of defense.
trc and rombe eventually entered into a settlement agreement.
after settling with trc,rombe filed a complaint against amco alleging that in failing to provide it with a defense to the trc claim,amco was liable for breach of contract and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.rombe filed a motion for summary adjudication and amco filed a for summary judgment.
the trial court granted amco motion.although the trial court found that the market segment qualification in the policy definition of advertisement might be broad enough to include the breakfast rombe hosted,neither the breakfast nor the press report involved any use of trc advertising idea or any other covered advertising offense.judgment was entered in favor of amco,and rombe filed a timely notice of appeal.
discussion 
summary judgment may be granted only when a moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.code civ.proc,subd.c.where the motion is brought by a defendant,the defendant will bear the burden of persuasion that one or more elements of the cause of action in question can not be established,or that there is a complete defense thereto.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d,aguilar.in accordance with federal law,all that the defendant need do is to show that one or more elements of the cause of action can not be established by the plaintiff.citation.in other words,all that the defendant need do is to show that the plaintiff can not establish at least one element of the cause of example,that the plaintiff can not prove element although he remains free to do so,the defendant need not himself conclusively negate any such example,himself prove not aguilar,supra,cal th at,d,fns.omitted.
in broadly outlining the law of summary judgment,the supreme court stated if a party moving for summary judgment in any action would prevail at trial without submission of any issue of material fact to a trier of fact for determination,then he should prevail on summary judgment.in such a case the court should grant the motion and avoid a trial rendered useless by nonsuit or directed verdict or similar device.aguilar,supra,cal th at,d.
importantly,as amco points out,we review the trial court ruling,not its rationale thus,we are not bound by the trial court stated reasons for granting summary judgment.california automobile ins.hogan th,d accord kids universe th,d.
familiar principles govern adjudication of the insurer duty to defend.in horace mann ins.barbara cal th d,horace mann we observed a liability insurer owes a broad duty to defend its insured against claims that create a potential for indemnity.gray zurich insurance supra,cal d,gray.as we said in gray,the carrier must defend a suit which potentially seeks damages within the coverage of the policy.id.at,italics in original.implicit in this rule is the principle that the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify an insurer may owe a duty to defend its insured in an action in which no damages ultimately are awarded.citations.horace mann,supra,cal th at,d.
the determination whether the insurer owes a duty to defend usually is made in the first instance by comparing the allegations of the complaint with the terms of the policy.facts extrinsic to the complaint also give rise to a duty to defend when they reveal a possibility that the claim may be covered by the policy.gray,supra,cal d at.horace mann,supra,cal th at d.as one court of appeal has put it,f or an insurer,the existence of a duty to defend turns not upon the ultimate adjudication of coverage under its policy of insurance,but upon those facts known by the insurer at the inception of a third party lawsuit.citation.hence,the duty may exist even where coverage is in doubt and ultimately does not develop.citation.saylin california ins.guarantee d.
the insured desire to secure the right to call on the insurer superior resources for the defense of third party claims is,in all likelihood,typically as significant a motive for the purchase of insurance as is the wish to obtain indemnity for possible liability.as a consequence,california courts have been consistently solicitous of insureds expectations on this score.see,horace mann,supra,cal th d,cna casualty of california seaboard surety d.montrose chemical superior court cal th,d.
as it did in the trial court,rombe argues the breakfast it hosted,and the later internet report of the breakfast and rombe plans constituted the use of another advertising idea in your advertisement within the meaning of the coverage provisions of amco policy.rombe contends that the breakfast was arguably a form of advertisement to specific market segments.in attempting to establish the requisite advertising offense,rombe relies on the fact that in its underlying lawsuit,trc alleged misappropriation of its trade secrets and customer lists.ro
