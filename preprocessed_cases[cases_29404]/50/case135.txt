code of civil procedure section hereafter section provides in any action alleging the misappropriation of a trade secret under the uniform trade secrets act title commencing with section of part of division of the civil code,before commencing discovery relating to the trade secret,the party alleging the misappropriation shall identify the trade secret with reasonable particularity subject to any orders that may be appropriate under section of the civil code.italics added.in the published portion of our opinion,we hold that section does not require in every case that a trade secret claimant explain how the alleged trade secret differs from the general knowledge of skilled persons in the field to which the secret relates.rather,such an explanation is required only when,given the nature of the alleged secret or the technological field in which it arises,the details provided by the claimant to identify the secret are themselves inadequate to permit the defendant to learn the boundaries of the secret and investigate defenses or to permit the court to understand the designation and fashion discovery.further,the trade secret designation is to be liberally construed,and reasonable doubts regarding its adequacy are to be resolved in favor of allowing discovery to go forward.
background 
william brescia appeals from the judgment of dismissal entered in favor of respondents sylvester stallone and john arnold after the trial court sustained,without leave to amend,respondents demurrer to brescia third amended.for ease of reference,we refer to the operative pleading simply as the.brescia alleges that respondents participated with other in misappropriating brescia trade secrets,which he describes in the as follows a formula,manufacturing process,marketing plan,funding plan and a distribution and sales plan for a high protein,low carbohydrate pudding with an extended shelf life and a stable and appealing consistency and most important,when mass produced,an appetizing flavor.
briefly,the background to this appeal is as follows.after a dispute at a trade show at which brescia accused keith angelin and his company,freedom foods,llc,of stealing his ideas,angelin and freedom foods sued brescia for trade libel and other claims.in response,brescia filed his.brescia alleges that he developed his pudding product,called pro pudding pak,with the assistance of christopher scinto,a food scientist,who worked directly for brescia.the high protein,low carbohydrate qualities of the pudding were unique,unlike any other pudding on the market.brescia contracted with two companies,performance worldwide usa,performance and instone,llc,for the sale and distribution of the pudding,subject to confidentiality and nondisclosure provisions.thereafter,keith angelin,who had been vice president of marketing for performance,left that company and formed his own,freedom foods.angelin,freedom foods,instone,and christopher scinto then conspired to steal brescia ideas,and freedom foods and instone began producing and selling a pudding based on brescia formula and business plan.
brescia named as,among others,angelin,freedom foods,scinto,and instone.he added respondents as individual in november,more than two years after the was initially filed.he alleges that respondent stallone is chairman of the board of instone,and respondent arnold is chief executive officer.of the named,only respondents are parties to this appeal.moreover,although brescia alleged several causes of action,the only one relevant here is his statutory claim against respondents under the uniform trade secrets act,et for misappropriation of trade secrets.
in april,respondents filed motions for a protective order regarding brescia noticing their depositions and requesting production of documents relating to their finances.the motions argued,inter alia,that brescia refused to identify his alleged trade secrets with the reasonable particularity required by section,and that,therefore,he was not entitled to discovery in his trade secret action.respondents were the only to seek a protective order for brescia failure to comply with section.discovery had long ago commenced as to the other.
in opposing respondents motions,brescia argued that he had adequately described his trade secrets in his,and also that he had produced documents in discovery identified by bates stamp number that would reveal evidence of the formula and manufacturing process.at a hearing in may,the court ruled that brescia had not yet adequately identified the trade secret.the court continued the protective order motions to july,and ordered brescia to make a further disclosure.
the next day,brescia filed a notice of compliance with the court order.this may trade secret designation,filed under seal,grouped the alleged secrets into the categories of marketing strategies,budget and finance,formula,and manufacturing process.each classification referred to attached documents pages in all that,according to brescia,specifically detail ed each and every trade secret misappropriated.
in response to brescia trade secret designation,respondents filed a supplemental motion for a protective order regarding the initial round of discovery,and another separate protective order motion directed against a second round of discovery.respondents argued that brescia still had not identified his alleged trade secrets with the reasonable particularity required by section.instead,he had provided pages of,documents that failed to distinguish what the purported trade secrets were.further,relying on advanced modular sputtering,superior court th,d advanced modular respondents argued that brescia failed to distinguish the purported trade secrets from matters generally known to skilled persons in the commercial food science industry.
in opposition,brescia argued that,by citing to specific pages in the documents attached to his trade secret designation,he had adequately specified his trade secrets.he also noted that he had detailed the formula for his pudding in discovery responses.
hearing respondents motions in july,the court ruled that brescia trade secret description was inadequate because,by citing to voluminous documents,it obscured rather than refined the description.the court continued respondents protective order motions,and invited brescia counsel to succinctly and with particularity lay out the trade secrets without surplusage,instead of essentially hiding the alleged trade secret in plain view by putting lots of clutter around it.
in august,brescia filed under seal the trade secret designation that is at issue in this appeal.in it,he identified two alleged trade secrets his pudding formula and his manufacturing process.he described his pudding formula,as follows attached under seal as exhibit is a single page,containing a list of the specific ingredients that constituted brescia pudding formula in the last quarter of.the list identifies each ingredient by its common name and the percentage it constitutes of the total pudding.the second list identifies the same ingredients listed by their supplier and brand name.brescia alleges that this formula is a trade secret.as promised,exhibit contained two lists,one of which gave the common name of ingredients and their respective percentages in the final product ranging from percent to percent,and the other of which gave the brand name and supplier.
the trade secret designation described brescia manufacturing process as follows attached under seal as exhibit is a single page description of the manufacturing process for pudding described above as of the last quarter of.brescia alleges that this manufacturing process is a trade secret.the attached exhibit listed each step in the mixing,testing,and code marking of the pudding.
respondents filed additional briefing,arguing that brescia new trade secret designation was insufficient because neither the formula nor the manufacturing process was distinguished from matters within the general knowledge of persons skilled in the commercial food science field.respondents requested that the court take judicial notice of certain documents from the united states patent and trademark office.the documents related to a patent application made by christopher scinto,who according to brescia allegedly helped brescia develop his formula,and who claimed to have developed the formula for the pudding sold by freedom foods and distributed by instone.the documents showed that the patent and trademark office rejected scinto patent application,concluding that the high protein,low carbohydrate pudding formula submitted by scinto and its ingredients would have been obvious to persons of ordinary skill in the food science industry when the formula was developed.respondents argued that,because scinto pudding formula and ingredients were obvious to persons of ordinary skill in the industry,brescia should be required,as part of his designation,to describe what it is about his formula that distinguishes it from matters of general knowledge within the food science industry,and thus makes it a trade secret.
on september,the court once again heard argument on the sufficiency of the section designation in connection with respondents motions for a protective order.in the meantime,respondents had filed a demurrer to brescia,along with a motion to strike,which were also scheduled for hearing the same day.
at the september hearing,the court granted the respondents request for judicial notice of the patent and trademark office records,and stated that its tentative ruling was that brescia trade secret designation was inadequate.relying on advanced modular,the court reasoned that brescia trade secret designation was defective,because it made no attempt to identify why certain aspects or all of the aspects of the manufacturing process are anything other than matters generally known to persons skilled in the field,and no attempt to indicate why the peculiar product formulation here that is stated with precision is a trade secret,as opposed to the typical ingredients involved in formulating other,puddings.as we explain below in connection with brescia contention that the court procedure was unauthorized,the parties,in an attempt to expedite any appeal,stipulated that if the court determined the trade secret designation insufficient,it could use respondents demurrer to the as a procedural device to dismiss brescia trade secret misappropriation claim for failure to comply with section.
the court then heard argument from brescia attorney,who contended that the trade secret designation was adequate.he distinguished advanced modular,on which the court relied in its tentative ruling,on the ground that it dealt with a very complicated technical area in which it would be difficult for a court to determine whether the designation was sufficient.brescia,however,stated a precise formula and manufacturing process for a pudding.further,the law did not require that information be patentable in order to constitute a trade secret.
the court commented that brescia submission was silent on the question whether his alleged trade secrets were known to skilled persons in the field.the court explained so by its silence it doomed to failure,because there no attempt even to commence to describe why this formula is unique and not known to others.it just is a formula.likewise,it is a cooking or manufacturing process of many steps.some of which apparently,according to matters of which i believe i can take judicial notice are actually fairly familiar when you are trying to make a comparable product.the court ruled that the trade secret designation was inadequate,and stated p ursuant to the advance stipulation of the parties,the demurrer to the is deemed sustained as to respondents without leave to amend.the court later entered a judgment of dismissal,and,following denial of his motion for reconsideration,brescia appealed.
discussion 
sustaining the demurrer for failure to comply with section 
ii.the adequacy of brescia august trade secret designation 
brescia contends that the trial court erred in finding his trade secret designation inadequate for failing to explain how his alleged trade secrets differ from matters within the general knowledge of skilled persons in the field of commercial food science.in the unusual procedural posture of this case,we deem this issue to be one of law which we review de novo,depending on undisputed facts the contents of brescia august trade secret designation and the interpretation of section.
although we do not agree with brescia contention that a trade secret claimant can never be required to particularize how the alleged trade secret differs from prior products,we agree that the trial court erred in imposing such a requirement here.we conclude that whether a trade secret designation adequately distinguishes the allegedly protected information from the general knowledge of skilled persons in the field is a function of the particularity of the is,a function of whether the stated details themselves are sufficient,given the nature of the alleged secret and the technology in which it arises,to permit the defendant to ascertain whether and in what way the information is distinguished from matters already known,and to permit the court to fashion appropriate discovery.absent a showing that the details alone,without further explanation,are inadequate to permit the defendant to discern the boundaries of the trade secret so as to prepare available defenses,or to permit the court to understand the identification so as to craft discovery,the trade secret claimant need not particularize how the alleged secret differs from matters already known to skilled persons in the field.further,consistent with precedent,the trade secret designation is to be liberally construed,and reasonable doubts regarding its adequacy are to be resolved in favor allowing discovery to go forward.
section and advanced modular 
the uniform trade secrets act,et creates a statutory cause of action for the misappropriation of a trade secret.see witkin,summary of cal.law ed.equity,et it defines a trade secret as information,including a formula,pattern,compilation,program,device,method,technique,or process,that derives independent economic value,actual or potential,from not being generally known to the public or to other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use and is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy,subd.d.
when adopting the uniform trade secrets act in,the california legislature also enacted a separate statutory provision,now found in section part of the civil discovery act,which requires,in relevant part,that i n any action alleging the misappropriation of a trade secret under the uniform trade secrets act,before commencing discovery relating to the trade secret,the party alleging the misappropriation shall identify the trade secret with reasonable particularity.italics added see computer economics,gartner group d,computer economics discussing legislative history of former section,subd.d.the statute was intended to codify diodes,franzen d.diodes,that before a trade secret defendant must submit to potentially costly litigation and discovery,the complainant should describe the subject matter of the trade secret with sufficient particularity to separate it from matters of general knowledge in the trade or of special knowledge of those persons who are skilled in the trade,and to permit the defendant to ascertain at least the boundaries within which the secret lies.id.at.the purpose of such a requirement,as expressed in diodes,was to supply sufficient data to give both the court and the defendant reasonable notice of the issues which must be met at the time of trial and to provide reasonable guidance in ascertaining the scope of appropriate discovery.ibid.
it has since been said that section serves four interrelated goals first,it promotes claims and dissuades the filing of meritless trade secret complaints.second,it prevents plaintiffs from using the discovery process as a means to obtain the defendant trade secrets.citations.third,the rule assists the court in framing the appropriate scope of discovery and in determining whether plaintiff discovery requests fall within that scope.citations.fourth,it enables defendants to form complete and defenses,ensuring that they need not wait until the eve of trial to effectively defend against charges of trade secret misappropriation.citation.advanced modular,supra,th at,d,quoting computer economics,supra,d at.
the leading case construing section is advanced modular,supra,th,d,which involved alleged trade secrets in the field of sputtering the process of depositing a thin and even film of material onto a silicon wafer or other substrate.id.at,d.the plaintiff manufactured sputtering equipment,and claimed that the defendant misappropriated eight trade secrets in manufacturing its own sputtering machine.id.at,d.the defendant contended that the plaintiff trade secret designations were inadequate under section,and produced expert witness declarations to show that the alleged trade secrets were too vaguely described to distinguish them from information that is already known in the industry.id.at,d.the plaintiff,in turn,produced expert declarations stating that the trade secrets were adequately described,that they involve d information not commonly known in the industry,and that the defendant experts were being purposefully obtuse when they claim ed confusion over the nature or boundaries of the alleged trade secrets.ibid.
in construing section,the court observed that t he letter and spirit of section require the plaintiff,subject to an appropriate protective order,to identify or designate the trade secrets at issue with sufficient particularity to limit the permissible scope of discovery by distinguishing the trade secrets from matters of general knowledge in the trade or of special knowledge of those persons skilled in the trade.citations.advanced modular,supra,th at,d.analogizing a trade secret designation to a pleading,the court stressed that the designation should be liberally construed in favor of the trade secret claimant,and that doubts about its adequacy should be resolved in favor of permitting discovery to go forward.id.at,d.
further,the court emphasized the flexibility of the statutory standard reasonable particularity mandated by section does not mean that the party alleging misappropriation has to define every minute detail of its claimed trade secret at the outset of the litigation.nor does it require a discovery referee or trial court to conduct a miniature trial on the merits of a misappropriation claim before discovery may commence.rather,it means that the plaintiff must make some showing that is reasonable,fair,proper,just and rational citation,under all of the circumstances to identify its alleged trade secret in a manner that will allow the trial court to control the scope of subsequent discovery,protect all parties proprietary information,and allow them a fair opportunity to prepare and present their best case or defense at a trial on the merits.citations.the degree of particularity that is reasonable will differ,depending on the alleged trade secrets at issue in each case.where,as here,the alleged trade secrets consist of incremental variations on,or advances in the state of the art in a highly specialized technical field,a more exacting level of particularity may be required to distinguish the alleged trade secrets from matters already known to persons skilled in that field.nothing in section precludes the trial court from considering relevant evidence,including expert witness declarations,on the adequacy of a designation to describe the alleged trade secrets and distinguish them from prior art.but it remains true that,at this very preliminary stage of the litigation,the proponent of the alleged trade secret is not required,on pain of dismissal,to describe it with the greatest degree of particularity possible,or to reach such an exacting level of specificity that even its opponents are forced to agree the designation is adequate.advanced modular,supra,th at,d.
applying this standard,the court found the plaintiff trade secret designation adequate under section here,sputtered films the plaintiff has identified eight alleged trade secrets,each with several discreet features that,in combination with one another,form the alleged trade secrets.it has described how it believes the combination of these features distinguish the alleged trade secrets from the prior art,or matters within the general knowledge of persons in the sputtering industry.ams and its experts contend the alleged trade secrets are well known in the industry and that they have been described in a vague or overbroad manner.sputtered films experts dispute both contentions.we have no doubt the experts will continue to disagree on these crucial questions.for our purposes,at this prediscovery stage of the proceedings,it is appropriate to recognize the existence of this credible dispute,but not necessarily to resolve it.where,as here,credible experts declare that they are capable of understanding the designation and of distinguishing the alleged trade secrets from information already known to persons in the field,the designation should,as a general rule,be considered adequate to permit discovery to commence.our discovery statutes are designed to ascertain the truth,not suppress it.any doubt about discovery is to be resolved in favor of disclosure.advanced modular,supra,th at,d.
distinguishing the trade secret from prior art 
at issue in the present case is brescia august trade secret designation.in finding that designation inadequate,the court reasoned that advanced modular required brescia to specify precisely how his pudding formula and manufacturing process were distinguished from matters known to skilled persons in the commercial food science industry.we disagree that advanced modular required such a showing here.
the seminal decision is diodes,the genesis of section.the court in diodes stated that the trade secret complainant should describe the subject matter of the trade secret with sufficient particularity to separate it from matters of general knowledge in the trade or of special knowledge of those persons who are skilled in the trade,and to permit the defendant to ascertain at least the boundaries within which the secret lies.diodes,supra,d at,italics added see also whyte schlage lock th,d finding several trade secret designations adequate because drafted with sufficient detail to permit defendant to identify and understand the protected information,and finding one too broad to enforce because it did not differentiate between truly secret information and new product information which has been publicly disclosed.in other words,as envisioned in diodes,the burden on the trade secret claimant is to provide a level of detail adequate to distinguish the subject information from general knowledge or knowledge of skilled persons in the field.the defendant may then use that level of detail to determine the limits of the trade secret by investigating whether the information disclosed is within the public domain meaning it is not a trade secret,subd.d,or to develop the defenses of independent development or ready ascertainability meaning there was no misappropriation because section was intended to codify diodes,the statute should be interpreted consistent with it.thus,at its inception,section was intended to require the trade secret claimant to identify the alleged trade secret with adequate detail to allow the defendant to investigate how it might differ from matters already known and to allow the court to craft relevant discovery.
advanced modular does not depart from the principle that the level of particularity determines whether the designation adequately distinguishes the alleged trade secret from prior art.advanced modular observed that the trade secret plaintiff must identify the alleged trade secrets with sufficient particularity to limit the permissible scope of discovery by distinguishing the trade secrets from matters of general knowledge in the trade or of special knowledge of those persons skilled in the trade.citations.advanced modular,supra,th at,d.in this language,the court was not creating a requirement for all cases,divorced from the particularity requirement itself,of explaining how the trade secret differs from prior art.the court wa
