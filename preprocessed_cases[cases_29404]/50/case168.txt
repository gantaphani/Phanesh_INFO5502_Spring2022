the doctrine of inevitable disclosure permits a trade secret owner to prevent a former employee from working for a competitor despite the owner failure to prove the employee has taken or threatens to use trade secrets.under that doctrine,the employee may be enjoined by demonstrating the employee new job duties will inevitably cause the employee to rely upon knowledge of the former employer trade secrets.no published california decision has accepted or rejected the inevitable disclosure doctrine.
in this opinion,we reject the inevitable disclosure doctrine.we hold this doctrine is contrary to california law and policy because it creates an covenant not to compete restricting employee mobility.
this holding leads us to affirm the trial court order denying the application of schlage lock company schlage for a preliminary injunction and granting the motion of douglas whyte whyte and kwikset corporation kwikset to dissolve a temporary restraining order.we reach the issue of inevitable disclosure because we conclude certain information schlage seeks to protect does constitute trade secret,but the evidence presented below,viewed as it must be through the lens of the applicable standard of review,fails to establish actual or threatened misappropriation.
schlage is a subsidiary of defendant ingersoll rand company ingersoll rand.kwikset and schlage manufacture and sell locks and related products.they are fierce competitors and vie intensely for shelf space at the home depot,which is the major seller of locks and alone accounts for percent of schlage sales.
whyte worked as schlage of sales and was responsible for sales to the home depot and other big box retailers such as homebase,lowe,menard,and sears.whyte signed a confidentiality agreement to protect schlage proprietary information and agreed to abide by schlage code of ethics,which forbids disclosure of confidential information for personal or noncompany uses.whyte did not sign a covenant not to compete.
the home depot periodically conducts a review of its suppliers product lines,prices,pricing and marketing concessions,and ability to deliver product.the home depot uses this line review to determine which products it will sell and which products to remove from its shelves.as part of the line review,the home depot usually asks vendors,such as kwikset and schlage,to submit proposals for pricing and marketing concessions and for the amount of promotional discounts and advertising funds,and to present information about product changes and new products.
the home depot conducted a line review with schlage in february.the home depot followed schlage recommendation to remove kwikset titan brand of locks and to expand schlage presence on its shelves.whyte participated in the line review and in drafting the line review agreement confirming the business relationship between schlage and the home depot.
whyte sales abilities impressed kwikset president,christopher metz.metz realized whyte was killing my team,and asked him what it would take to get him to leave ingersoll rand whyte apparently got what it took,for he accepted a position with kwikset on june.he did not resign from schlage,however,until june participating on behalf of schlage in confidential meetings with the home depot on june.
whyte departed schlage on june.schlage was not pleased with whyte,and the parting was not amicable.schlage contends whyte left to revenge belittling comments made by schlage president,robert steinman,and contends whyte disavowed a confidentiality agreement,stole trade secret information including a copy on computer disk of the line review agreement with the home depot,and lied about returning company information.whyte denies taking any trade secrets,claims he reaffirmed the confidentiality agreement,and contends that in the exit interview on june steinman vowed to destroy his career.
on june,whyte became kwikset of sales for national accounts.his job duties at kwikset are substantially similar to those at schlage handling the lock products account for the home depot and other big box retailers.
proceedings below 
whyte defection to kwikset ignited a firestorm of litigation.ingersoll rand sued whyte in colorado state court,seeking an injunction against him.ingersoll rand urged the colorado state court to issue an injunction based upon the doctrine of inevitable disclosure.the colorado court denied the request for an injunction on june.
whyte then filed this suit against ingersoll rand and schlage on june.whyte sought,among other things,damages for interference with contract and a declaration of his freedom to work for kwikset.
on july,schlage filed a for unfair competition,misappropriation of trade secrets,breach of contract,breach of fiduciary duty,intentional and negligent interference with economic relations,and conversion.the next day,schlage brought an ex parte application to restrain whyte temporarily from using or disclosing trade secrets,pending a hearing on an application for a preliminary injunction.the court granted the ex parte application on july and issued a temporary restraining order enjoining whyte from using or disclosing categories of trade secret information and ordering whyte to return any such information in his possession.in response,whyte turned over a garbage bag of shredded documents and a ziploc bag containing seven destroyed floppy disks and nine destroyed zip disks.
the court permitted expedited discovery,and discovery ensued.the results of this discovery,as well as declarations,exhibits,and briefs were submitted in support of and in opposition to the application for preliminary injunction.at the first hearing on the application,the court rejected the inevitable disclosure doctrine,but took the matter under submission to consider issuing an injunction based upon actual or threatened misappropriation.
the parties submitted additional declarations,exhibits,requests for judicial notice,and briefs before the next hearing.whyte filed a motion to dissolve the temporary restraining order,which schlage opposed.
at a second hearing on october,the court stated it would deny the application for an injunction.in announcing the ruling,the court stated the information schlage sought to protect was not trade secret i do think these things rise i do think these are trade secrets.the court reflected,i think whyte should be able to go about his business,but added,c ertainly if it is proven somehow that he used specific information,well,there is money damages.
later on october the court entered a minute order denying the preliminary injunction and granting whyte motion to dissolve the temporary restraining order without stating its reasons.schlage then filed and withdrew a lengthy motion for reconsideration.
schlage and ingersoll rand appealed from the october order.rand did not for injunctive relief and did not bring or join in the application for a preliminary injunction,it is a party to the complaint and is sufficiently aggrieved by the order to have standing to appeal.code civ,county of alameda carleson cal d.the trial court denied schlage application for a stay pending appeal,and we denied schlage petition for writ of supersedeas.
standard of review 
injunctions in the area of trade secrets are governed by the principles applicable to injunctions in general.hilb,rogal hamilton ins.services robb th,fn,d.in deciding whether to issue a preliminary injunction,a trial court weighs two interrelated factors the likelihood the moving party ultimately will prevail on the merits,and the relative interim harm to the parties from the issuance or nonissuance of the injunction.hunt superior court cal th,d.generally,the ruling on an application for preliminary injunction rests in the sound discretion of the trial court.the exercise of that discretion will not be disturbed on appeal absent a showing that it has been abused.citations.ibid.denial of a preliminary injunction will be upheld on appeal if the trial court did not abuse its discretion with respect to either the question of success on the merits or the question of irreparable harm.cohen board of supervisors cal d,hart cult awareness network th,d.
whether the trial court granted or denied a preliminary injunction,the appellate court does not resolve conflicts in the evidence,reweigh the evidence,or assess the credibility of witnesses.hilb,rogal hamilton ins.services robb,supra,th at,d.t he trial court is the judge of the credibility of the affidavits filed in support of the application for preliminary injunction and it is that court province to resolve conflicts.ibid.thus,even when presented by declaration,if the evidence on the application is in conflict,we must interpret the facts in the light most favorable to the prevailing party and indulge in all reasonable inferences in support of the trial court order.ibid.
schlage acknowledges the abuse of discretion standard of review,but misapplies it.schlage focuses upon the trial court comments made during the october,hearing that the information schlage sought to protect was not trade secret.based on those oral comments,schlage argues the trial court denied the injunction for that reason alone,and therefore abused its discretion by failing to address schlage request for an injunction under the theory of misappropriation of confidential information,to reach the issue of actual or threatened misappropriation,and to balance the hardships in denying the injunction.
we can not presume,however,the trial court ended its analysis with its determination of no trade secrets or that its oral comments reflect all of its reasons for denying the injunction.the trial court denied the preliminary injunction in a minute order without explanation.we review that order,not the court reasons,davey southern pacific cal,caro smith th,d.the trial court was not required to prepare a statement of decision or explain its reasoning the denial of a preliminary injunction does not require any statement of decision or explanation.metro traffic control,shadow traffic network th,d.t he fact that the court conclusion is set forth in summary fashion does not mean the court failed to engage in the requisite analysis,or that its analysis was incorrect.city of los altos barnes th,d.for purposes of appellate review,we therefore presume the court considered every pertinent argument and resolved each one consistently with its minute order denying the preliminary injunction.
because we review the correctness of the order,and not the court reasons,we will not consider the court oral comments or use them to undermine the order ultimately entered.selfridge carnation d.oral opinions or statements of the court may not be considered to reverse or impeach the final decision of the court which is conclusively merged in its findings and judgment birch mahaney d,remarks made by a trial judge during a trial or argument,or even an opinion filed by him,can not be used to impeach a formal decision,order or judgment later made or entered.here,where the trial court was not required to prepare a statement of decision or explain its reasons for denying the injunction,it is especially important to refrain from using the court oral comments as a basis for reversal.in that situation,reviewing the trial court oral comments would in effect require the trial court either to prepare a statement of decision where none is required or to say nothing during argument to avoid creating grounds for impeaching the final order.we decline to place the trial courts in such an untenable position.
discussion 
the appeal moot 
before turning to the merits,we address whyte suggestion that the appeal is moot because schlage trade secret information has become stale.schlage responds that most of the trade secret information has a useful of two years so that m ost of the information delineated in items a through t of the tro is current today.
an appeal becomes moot when an event occurs which,through no fault of the respondent,renders any appellate decision ineffective in providing the parties relief.eye dog foundation state board of guide dogs for the blind cal d,woodward park homeowners garreks,th,d.an injunction against misappropriation of trade secrets should only last as long as is necessary to preserve the rights of the parties and as long as is necessary to eliminate the commercial advantage that a person would obtain through misappropriation.american paper packaging products,kirgan d.see also,subd.a.
whyte cites no evidence or authority showing an injunction is no longer necessary to eliminate whatever commercial advantage he might have obtained through the alleged misappropriation.whyte has not moved to dismiss the appeal as moot,and we find no basis to do so.
has schlage sufficiently identified information constituting trade secrets 
a trade secret is information,including a formula,pattern,compilation,program,device,method,technique,or process that derives independent economic value,actual or potential,from not being generally known to the public or to other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use and is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy,subd.d.
schlage sought to enjoin use of a range of alleged trade secrets,identified in paragraph of the temporary restraining order as information about schlage new products pricing of schlage products sold to its customers profit margins on schlage products sold to its customers schlage costs in producing the products it sells to its customers e.the home depot line review documents pricing concessions made by schlage to its customers promotional discounts made by schlage to its customers advertising allowances made by schlage to its customers volume rebates made by schlage on its products to its customers marketing concessions made by schlage to its customers schlage market research data advertising strategy plans for calendar year trade discounts made by schlage to its customers payment terms offered by schlage to its customers and offered by schlage to schlage rebate incentives made by schlage to its customers schlage advertising,sales and promotion budgets finishing processes for new and existing schlage products composite material process technologies,the unique composite materials used by schlage in its products and the processes applied to those composite materials schlage,and year strategic plan documents schlage personnel information 
whyte contends these broad categories of business information are not described with sufficient particularity to deserve trade secret protection.he also contends,as the trial court stated orally,that none of these categories of information constitutes trade secrets.schlage argues it has described its trade secrets with the required specificity and the information schlage has identified is trade secret and schlage made reasonable efforts to maintain the information secrecy.we discuss these contentions in turn,and conclude,based upon the evidence submitted,that some of the information schlage sought to protect was trade secret.
our decision regarding trade secret status is based upon the appellate record and is not a final adjudication on the merits.cohen board of supervisors,supra,cal d,hilb,rogal hamilton ins.services robb,supra,th at,d.the ultimate determination of trade secret status is subject to proof presented at trial.
whether schlage sufficiently identified its trade secrets 
with the exception of category schlage new product information,we conclude schlage identified its trade secrets with the requisite specificity.at this stage,a party seeking to protect trade secrets must describe the subject matter of the trade secret with sufficient particularity to separate it from matters of general knowledge in the trade or of special knowledge of those persons who are skilled in the trade,and to permit the defendant to ascertain at least the boundaries within which the secret lies.diodes,franzen d.
categories through of the temporary restraining order meet this requirement.they are drafted with sufficient detail to permit whyte to identify and understand the protected information.schlage descriptions made pursuant to code of civil procedure section,subdivision d,in supplemental briefing,and in declarations remove any doubt about the boundaries within which the secret s lie.diodes,franzen,supra,d at.
kwikset had no difficulty in understanding the scope of the putative trade secret information.in deposition,kwikset president christopher metz was asked,one by one,whether each category of information from the temporary restraining order was confidential.metz understood the scope and meaning of each category because he testified such information was confidential to kwikset and he had no reason to believe it was not confidential to schlage.
category,regarding schlage new product information,is too broad.although information about a company new products certainly can be trade secret,vacco industries,van den berg th,d,i nformation about schlage new products is too broad to enforce because it does not differentiate between truly secret information such as formulas and product design and new product information which has been publicly disclosed.schlage does not address whether the information in category personnel sufficiently described or constitutes trade secrets,and so that argument is waived.huntington landmark adult community ross d.
whether the information identified by schlage is trade secret 
the test for trade secrets is whether the matter sought to be protected is information which is valuable because it is unknown to others and which the owner has attempted to keep secret.abba rubber seaquist d.
we first address schlage efforts to maintain the confidentiality of its trade secrets.r easonable efforts to maintain secrecy have been held to include advising employees of the existence of a trade secret,limiting access to a trade secret on need to know basis,and controlling plant access.legis.com,west ann.ed.foll,see also courtesy temporary service,camacho d.
the record shows that schlage trade secrets are,with one significant exception,not publicly disseminated and are subject to a confidentiality agreement signed by schlage executives,including whyte.requiring employees to sign confidentiality agreements is a reasonable step to ensure secrecy.mai systems peak computer,cir.further,kwikset considers such information to be confidential.
the exception is category home depot line review documents.it does not appear schlage maintained the confidentiality of the line review documents because they were disclosed to the home depot.schlage asserts the line review documents and related information are subject to a secrecy agreement between schlage and the home depot.but,as schlage conceded at oral argument,a secrecy agreement is not in the record.without a secrecy agreement,the home depot presumably could give the line review documents to kwikset and other schlage competitors.because a secrecy agreement is not in the record,for purposes of this appeal we do not treat as trade secret or confidential information the line review documents,as well as any other information disclosed to the home depot.for the same reason,any information such as price concessions,trade discounts and rebate incentives disclosed to schlage customers can not be considered trade secret or confidential for purposes of this appeal.
thus,we conclude,based upon the appellate record,schlage made reasonable efforts to maintain the secrecy of its trade secret information,except for the home depot line review documents and other information disclosed to the home depot or other schlage customers.
we next address whether the information schlage seeks to protect derives value from being unknown to others.we review below the categories of information identified by schlage in the temporary restraining order except for categories,and and conclude they meet this test.
information related to schlage competitive pricing and marketing of products categories,c,d,f,g,h,i,j,m,n,and 
these categories identify schlage pricing,profit margins,costs of production,pricing concessions,promotional discounts,advertising allowances,volume rebates,marketing concessions,payment terms and rebate incentives.these categories relate to the price that schlage sells its lock products to its big box retailer and other customers like the home depot and is used by schlage to price its products competitively.the information in these categories has independent economic value because schlage pricing policies would be valuable to a competitor to set prices which meet or undercut schlage.
cases have recognized that information related to cost and pricing can be trade secret.see courtesy temporary service,camacho,supra,d at.billing and markup rates irrefutably of commercial value si handling systems,heisley cir,cost and pricing information trade secret lumex,highsmith,pricing,costs,and profit margins treated as trade secrets.
whyte contends schlage cost and pricing information is merely general methods of doing business,which can not be protected as trade secret.see fortna martin d,pricing and bidding methods not trade secrets if only general methods of doing business.in so arguing,whyte fails to distinguish between cost and pricing data unique to schlage which may qualify as trade secrets and commonly used industry formulas for setting prices which do not.the court in si handling systems,heisley,supra,at page,drew this distinction to conclude that cost and pricing information not readily known in the such as the cost of materials,labor,overhead,and profit trade secret.the cases relied upon by whyte are inapposite for the same reason.see aetna.maintenance west cal d,plaintiff failed to prove its procedure for estimating contracts was a secret american paper packaging products,kirgan,supra,d.list of readily ascertainable customers not trade secret.
schlage strategic and marketing plans and marketing research categories,l,p,
these categories refer to the results of confidential marketing research advertising and marketing strategy,plans,and techniques and schlage strategic plan.this information would be valuable if known by a competitor because it would allow the competitor to predict and counter schlage advertising and marketing.schlage marketing strategy and plans including its strategic plan constitute trade secrets under california law.see duncan stuetzle cir,fn.schlage market research does not enjoy such blanket trade secret protection.marketing research can be trade secret if it explores the needs of numerous,diverse buyers,but is not protectible if it relates to a single prominent buyer that is presumably aware of its own needs si handling systems,heisley,supra,at see also metro traffic control,shadow traffic network,supra,th at,d customer preferences and requirements not trade secret.thus,schlage marketing research is not trade secret if it relates solely to the home depot,or any one prominent customer,needs.
information related to schlage process technologies categories and 
the information in these categories includes specific casting technology,flow technology,manufacturing technologies,and schlage electroplating and plating bath chemistries and methods.whyte does not contend schlage process technologies are not trade secret,and indeed such technical is the quintessential trade secret.see,subd.d trade secrets include formulas,methods,techniques,or processes vacco industries,van den berg,supra,th,d surgidev eye technology,and cases cited at fn.milgrim,trade secrets b,c.
schlage other theories 
we do not reach schlage alternative argument the trial court abused its discretion in failing to issue an injunction under either a breach of confidence theory or under business professions code section because we have concluded schlage did identify information constituting trade secret.because no secrecy agreement appears in the record,for purposes of the appeal the home depot line review documents can not be deemed confidential and therefore can not form the basis of a breach of confidence theory.our conclusion below that the evidence does not establish actual or threatened misappropriation also disposes of those alternative grounds for injunctive relief.
did whyte engage in actual or threatened misappropriation 
we turn to the issue whether whyte engaged in actual or threatened misappropriation.the court may enjoin a ctual or threatened misappropriation of a trade secret,subd.a.misappropri
