for the second time in recent years we are called upon to construe the scope of rule of the california rules of court rule,which governs recovery of costs allowed following a successful appeal.last year the supreme court affirmed a decision by this court,and held that rule d f does not authorize an award of costs for interest expenses and fees incurred to borrow funds to deposit as security for a letter of credit that was procured to secure an appeal bond.rossa falk construction,cal th,rossa.here,the respondent borrowed money to deposit with the trial court in lieu of securing an appeal bond.after its appeal was successful,it was allowed to recover the more than interest paid on the borrowed funds as a cost of appeal.the costs were included in an amended judgment from which this timely appeal was perfected.
we first consider whether rule and the reasoning of rossa preclude the appellant recovering the interest paid on the borrowed funds as a cost of appeal.we conclude this type of interest is likewise precluded.next,we consider whether a recent amendment of rule,which expressly allows recovery of interest in this situation,and which became effective during the pendency of this appeal,should be given retroactive application.we conclude that it should not.in light of these conclusions,we modify the amended judgment by deleting the interest,and affirm the modified,amended judgment.
background 
this dispute arose out of the decision of insurance broker frederic holbrook to change his employment from andreini company andreini to maccorkle insurance service,maccorkle,taking a list of clients with him.at the conclusion of a bench trial,the trial court concluded that holbrook did not breach his contract with andreini or otherwise misappropriate andreini trade secrets.however,the court further concluded that maccorkle and its chief executive officer bernard lauper were guilty of misappropriating andreini trade secrets.damages were awarded against maccorkle and lauper in the amount of.andreini,maccorkle,and lauper all appealed.division four of this district affirmed the judgment in favor of holbrook,and reversed that part of the judgment against maccorkle and lauper.andreini maccorkle ins.service,non pub.opn.in short,it was a complete win for maccorkle and lauper who will hereafter be collectively referred to as maccorkle.
maccorkle did not post an appeal bond,electing instead to deposit with the clerk of the trial court,an amount he borrowed.in april,following receipt of the remittitur,and after the supreme court had granted review of our decision in rossa,maccorkle filed a memorandum of costs for the expenses incurred on the appeal,seeking representing the net interest on the amount borrowed,identifying this item as other expenses reasonably necessary to secure surety bond.no longer able to rely on our opinion in rossa,but clearly hoping that its reasoning would be vindicated,andreini moved to tax this item of maccorkle and lauper claimed costs.relying on cooper westbrook torrey hills,llp th cooper,which we had declined to follow in our rossa opinion,maccorkle argued that the interest was allowable under rule.the matter was extensively argued to the trial court in july.believing the equities in this case probably weigh against the award of the interest,the court nevertheless felt bound to follow cooper.the court then entered an amended judgment awarding maccorkle in costs on appeal pursuant to rule,from which andreini perfected this timely appeal.
in rossa,our supreme court considered that part of rule which at the time authorized recovery as appeal costs the cost to procure a surety bond,including the premium,the cost to obtain a letter of credit as collateral,and the fees and net interest expenses incurred to borrow funds to provide security for the bond or to obtain a letter of credit,unless the trial court determines the bond was unnecessary.rule d f.the appellant in rossa had secured a standby letter of credit for that a surety required before posting an appeal bond.the bank issuing the letter of credit in turn required the appellant to deposit the face value of the letter of credit with the bank.the appellant had to borrow the money to satisfy the bank requirement,thereby incurring almost in interest,plus a fee of more than to extend the line of credit.having won on appeal,the appellant sought to recover these sums,and was rejected by the trial court,then by this court,and finally by the supreme court.rossa,supra,at.two points of the supreme court decision are central.
first,after an extensive examination of the principles governing recovery of costs of appeal and the evolution of what is now rule,the court noted that provisions allowing the recovery of costs historically have been strictly construed,and that this approach was retained after the legislature empowered the judicial council to prescribe rules for appellate practice.rossa,supra,at.the court then explained why this history and approach supported denying recovery of the fee and interest related to the letter of credit 
construing rule d f to extend to defendant interest payments and fees related to its line of credit would be inconsistent with the historic principle that cost provisions are to be strictly construed.neither the language of the rule nor its history indicates that the universe of items recoverable was being expanded by the judicial council in to include more remote or indirect costs of acquiring a letter of credit,such as interest and fees paid on credit lines from which funds were drawn to secure a letter of credit.given that interest expenses may far exceed all other costs more than tripling the costs in this case,we would expect a clear expression of an intent to allow the recovery of this item.as the court of appeal observed below,courts do not lightly presume that substantial changes occur by misdirection,vague terms or ancillary provisions,or in a cryptic manner.citation.e ven if we were not required to strictly construe cost provisions,more general principles of statutory construction weigh in favor of construing rule reference to the cost to obtain a letter of credit to encompass only the direct charges imposed in connection with the acquisition of a letter of credit 
rule d f refers to two items the cost of a surety bond and the cost of a letter of credit.as explained above,surety bonds and standby letters of credit are instruments that provide assurance that an obligation will be paid,but they do not involve a transfer of funds unless the applicant defaults.due to its financial situation,an applicant may have to borrow assets to secure payment before these instruments will be issued,but borrowing funds is distinctly different from obtaining a bond and a standby letter of credit a loan is a means to acquire assets to satisfy the judgment,while a bond and a letter of credit are a means to verify that assets are available to pay the judgment.due to these differences,the charges for a loan typically will be substantially greater than the charges for a secured bond or letter of credit.moreover,interest charges and related fees for a loan may vary greatly,depending on the creditworthiness of the judgment debtor,current interest rates,and other terms of the loan,rendering such charges unpredictable and potentially many times greater in amount than other costs.
if we adopt a restrictive meaning of the reference in rule d f to the cost to obtain a letter of credit,interpreting it to encompass only the direct charges for a letter of credit,the cost will be similar in amount to the cost to procure a surety bond,and similar in character with respect to the service it is acquiring verification of assets.if we adopt a more expansive meaning,interpreting it to encompass interest charges and fees incurred to borrow funds to secure the letter of credit,that item of cost will be markedly dissimilar to the cost to procure a surety bond,with respect to both the size and nature of the expenses incurred.therefore,we adopt the restrictive meaning of the cost to obtain a letter of credit,and reject an interpretation that encompasses interest expenses incurred in acquiring asset
