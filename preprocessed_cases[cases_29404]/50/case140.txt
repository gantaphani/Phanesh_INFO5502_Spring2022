the associate membership agreement 
in securing employment with wfg,each contracting defendant executed an ama included in the ama are nine covenants,six of which are particularly relevant here.in section d,the contracting defendants agree that during the term of the ama and for a period of two years thereafter they shall refrain from inducing any of their wfg customers to terminate,reduce coverage under or replace any of the products and services which have been sold by the associate or downline associates.section d provides the associate shall not induce any other wfg associates or employees to terminate their relationship with wfg during the same period or hire,induce or attempt to hire or induce any such persons to sell or solicit products and services which are competitive with the products and services for any person or entity other than wfg.

the complaint 
on june,wfg filed a first amendment complaint against defendants alleging claims for breach of contract,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,conversion,violation of the uniform trade secrets act and the unfair competition law,intentional and negligent interference with prospective economic advantage,and unjust enrichment the complaint alleges that from november through february,wfg discovered the contracting defendants were using wfg confidential information and trade secrets,including associate and customer lists as well as sales and marketing information and documents,to solicit wfg agents to leave wfg and join hbw.wfg further alleges the contracting defendants continue to use wfg proprietary and confidential information notwithstanding the fact that each of them received a letter demanding that they cease and desist doing so,and continue to induce or attempt to induce wfg clients to terminate or reduce coverage under or replace products and services selected,approved and designated by wfg.
jeff crawford and james crawford are named as defendants on all causes of action other than breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant,on the allegation that they are aiding and abetting the contracting defendants in soliciting wfg associates and customers and in using wfg confidential information and trade secrets.the complaint refers to a telephonic conference call that took place on april,during which jeff crawford invited several wfg associates to join hbw.attached to the complaint is a copy of a flyer that was sent to the associates that contains a comparison of hbw and company b,which was subsequently identified as wfg.the complaint further alleges that defendants kennedy and moore actively participated in the call with jeff crawford knowledge.as to james crawford,the complaint specifically alleges that he attempted to recruit four wfg associates and represented to one of them that wfg was for sale.james crawford also forwarded a powerpoint presentation to associates that contains information about wfg commission structure and other information that was designed to persuade the associates to join hbw.a copy of this presentation is attached as an exhibit to the complaint.
in the prayer for relief,wfg seeks to enjoin defendants from using or disclosing wfg confidential information and trade secrets and to compel them to return all documents containing such information or trade secrets.wfg also seeks to enjoin defendants from any further solicitation of wfg associates or customers to the extent such business practices violate the agreements,covenants and business practices sought to be protected by this complaint.the complaint also seeks general and punitive damages.
the motion 
on august,defendants filed their motion to dismiss the complaint as a slapp suit pursuant to section.defendants contended that all of wfg claims were based on defendants speech and conduct in furtherance of the exercise of their right of free speech in connection with a public issue,as contemplated by subdivision e of section.specifically,defendants asserted that their speech and conduct involved the pursuit of lawful employment pursuant to bus.as well as workforce mobility and free competition,all of which are matters of public interest and protected public policy.defendants further argued that wfg could not show a likelihood of prevailing on the merits because the covenants of the ama they allegedly violated were void under business and professions code section.defendants also claimed wfg could not establish that any of them had improperly used wfg confidential information or trade secrets.in support of the motion,each defendant submitted a declaration denying all of the allegations against them in the complaint.
in opposing the motion,wfg argued that defendants had failed to satisfy the first prong of the statute because,among other things,the complaint involves private conduct,done in a forum,resulting in the violation of a private contract and unfair misappropriation of wfg confidential trade secret information.wfg also asserted the communications at issue were exempt from the statute under section,subdivision c.finally,wfg claimed it would prevail on all of its claims,and offered supporting declarations and documentation.
defendants filed a reply to wfg opposition in which they reiterated their previous argument as to how the communications giving rise to the complaint involved a matter of public interest.in challenging wfg contention that its claims fell within the commercial speech exception to the statute as contemplated by section,subdivision c,defendants asserted among other things that plaintiff is not challenging the content of the statements made but rather the very fact such communications occurred 
after a hearing,the court found that defendants had failed to meet their burden of proving that the conduct and communications upon which wfg claims were based involved a matter of public interest,as required by section,subdivision e.accordingly,the motion was denied.this appeal followed.
discussion 
defendants contend their motion should have been granted because they met their burden of establishing that the complaint arose from protected activity,and wfg failed to demonstrate a likelihood of succeeding on the merits of any of its claims.we agree with the trial court that defendants failed to meet their burden of proof on the first prong of the statute,that wfg complaint is based on acts in furtherance of defendants free speech rights.the burden thus never shifted to wfg to show a probability of prevailing on the merits,and the motion was properly denied.
the statute provides that a cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion to strike,unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim,subd.b.we review the trial court ruling on an motion de novo.soukup law offices of herbert hafif cal th,fn,d,rohde wolf th,d.in undertaking our review,we construe section broadly,subd.a.
a defendant who files an motion bears the threshold burden of showing that the complaint arises from protected activity.club members for an honest election sierra club cal th,d.if the defendant is able to make that showing,the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show a probability of prevailing.zamos stroud cal th,d,city of cotati cashman cal th,d.
for our purposes,the law applies to claims arising from speech or conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest,subd.e.as courts applying the statute have recognized,the arising from requirement is not always easily met.citations.equilon enterprises consumer cause,cal th,d.a claim does not arise from constitutionally protected activity simply because it is triggered by such activity or is filed after it occurs.city of cotati cashman,supra,cal th at,d.rather,the focus is on the substance of the lawsuit.t he critical point is whether the plaintiff cause of action itself was based on an act in furtherance of the defendant right of petition or free speech.citations.id.at,d.in other words,the act underlying the plaintiff cause or the act which forms the basis for the plaintiff cause of action must itself have been an act in furtherance of the right of petition or free speech.citation.equilon,supra,at,d.to determine whether the arising from requirement is met,we look to the pleadings,and supporting and opposing affidavits stating the facts upon which the liability or defense is based,subd.b equilon,supra,at,d.
we agree with the trial court that none of the claims in wfg complaint are subject to dismissal under section.all of the allegedly wrongful conduct and speech that plaintiffs attribute to defendants was committed in a business capacity,and was directed at a competitor associates and customers for the sole purpose of promoting the competing business as a superior employer and provider of products and services.in asserting otherwise,defendants erroneously identify generalities that might be derived from their speech rather than the specific nature of what they actually said and did.their focus on specific statements for the first time on appeal comes too late,and in any event the statements they identify are not of interest to the public and are essentially irrelevant to all of wfg claims.even if defendants could establish that this speech was protected,it was merely incidental to the conduct upon which the complaint is based and is therefore insufficient to trigger the requirements of the statute.
in the trial court,defendants argued that the speech and conduct giving rise to wfg claims was protected activity because the pursuit of lawful employment pursuant to bus.and workforce mobility and free competition are matters of public interest and protected public policy.they made no mention of the actual content of the communications at issue,and acknowledged wfg is not challenging the content of the statements made but rather the very fact such communications occurred on appeal,however,defendants add new arguments that focus on the specific content of the speech.because these arguments were not raised below,they are waived.martinez scott specialty gases,th,d.
in any event,neither argument has merit.while employee mobility and competition are undoubtedly issues of public interest when considered in the abstract,one could arguably identify a strong public interest in the vindication of any right for which there is a legal remedy.the fact that a broad and amorphous public interest can be connected to a specific dispute is not sufficient to meet the statutory requirements of the statute.dyer childress th,d.by focusing on society general interest in the subject matter of the dispute instead of the specific speech or conduct upon which the complaint is based,defendants resort to the,synecdoche theory of public issue in the statute,where t he part is considered synonymous with the greater whole.commonwealth energy investor data exchange,th,d commonwealth.in evaluating the first prong of the statute,we must focus on the specific nature of the speech rather than the generalities that might be abstracted from it.citation.ibid.
this rule has been recognized in a line of cases affirming the denial of motions,none of which are cited in defendants opening brief.in rivero american federation of state,county,and municipal employees,th,d rivero,a union asserted that the publications giving rise to a public university employee complaint for libel and slander involved an issue of public interest because unlawful workplace activity is a matter of public interest particularly where it occurs at a publicly financed institution.id.at,d.in rejecting that argument,the court reasoned if the union were correct,discussion of nearly every workplace dispute would qualify as a matter of public interest.we conclude,instead,that unlawful workplace activity below some threshold level of significance is not an issue of public interest,even though it implicates a public policy.id.at,d,italics added.
in consumer justice center trimedica international,th,d trimedica,the maker of an herbal supplement for female breast enlargement sued for fraud and false advertising claimed the action involved a public issue because herbal dietary supplements are a matter of public interest.the court disagreed trimedica speech is not about herbal supplements in general.it is commercial speech about the specific properties and efficacy of a particular product,grobust.if we were to accept trimedica argument that we should examine the nature of the speech in terms of generalities instead of specifics,then nearly any claim could be sufficiently abstracted to fall within the statute.id.at,d.
in commonwealth,supra,th,d,a telemarketing firm and one of its employees were sued for soliciting a corporation shareholders to purchase services purporting to protect them from investment scams.analogizing the case to rivero and trimedica,the court reasoned selling an herbal breast enlargement product is not a disquisition on alternative medicine.lying about the supervisor of eight union workers is not singing one of those old pete seeger union songs,there once was a union maid.and,in the case before us,hawking an investigatory service is not an economics lecture on the importance of information for efficient markets.id.at,d.the court added that the general importance of consumer information does nothing to make the sales pitch here implicate an issue of public interest.just because you are selling something that is i
