in,voters passed proposition,which made numerous fundamental changes in the regulation of automobile and other types of insurance.calfarm ins.deukmejian cal d,calfarm.formerly,the open competition system of regulation had obtained,under which rates were set by insurers without prior or subsequent approval by the insurance commissioner century ins.garamendi cal th,d,century.proposition altered this system by adding to the insurance code article entitled reduction and control of insurance rates.california auto.assigned risk plan garamendi d.caarp.this new article required,among other things,approval by the insurance commissioner of the state of california hereafter commissioner for all insurance rate increases see id.at,and provide d for consumer participation in the administrative ratesetting process walker allstate indemnity th,d.
pursuant,in part,to statutes enacted as part of proposition,the commissioner promulgated section of title of california code of regulations hereafter regulation under regulation,subdivision a,e ach insurer writing in excess of ten million dollars in certain lines of insurance o n or before march of every year shall file a community service statement with the department of insurance statistical analysis bureau in los angeles.the statement must contain specified statistical information concerning the insurer business in the state of california,organized by zip code,including information described as record a data.record a data consists of the total earned exposures and total earned premiums,and the total number of exposures new,exposures canceled,and exposures,stated separately for each line of insurance and zip code.reg,subd.b.the statement,including the record a data,is subject to insurance code section,pursuant to regulation,subdivision c.and insurance code section provides that a ll information provided to the commissioner pursuant to this article shall be available for public inspection,and the provisions of section d of the government code and section of the insurance code shall not apply thereto.
in this case,we consider the validity of the public inspection provision found in regulation,subdivision c and the scope of the public disclosure mandate of insurance code section.we conclude that the public inspection provision of regulation,subdivision c is valid and insurance code section does not incorporate the exemption from disclosure found in government code section,subdivision k,and does not therefore exempt information protected by the trade secret privilege from disclosure.
as required by regulation,state farm mutual automobile insurance company,state farm fire and casualty company and state farm general insurance company collectively state farm filed a community service statement with the commissioner in.in a letter accompanying its statement,state farm wrote state farm insurance companies consider the information contained in record a,b,and c herein as privileged and confidential.it is proprietary in nature,constitutes trade secret material,and is not to be disseminated beyond the designated recipients without the express written consent of the state farm insurance companies.
despite state farm invocation of the trade secret privilege,the commissioner,without notifying state farm beforehand,provided its community service statement to david birny birnbaum upon his request pursuant to regulation and insurance code section.after learning about this,state farm sent a letter to the commissioner,protesting the release of its trade secrets to birnbaum and asking the commissioner to take all reasonable steps to retrieve this information.the commissioner then sent a letter to birnbaum stating that it had inadvertently released the information and asking him to return it.birnbaum,however,refused to do so.
state farm then filed this action against birnbaum and the commissioner,seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.in its complaint,state farm alleged that the information contained in the community service statement is confidential and constitutes trade secrets belonging to state farm and is not subject to public inspection under insurance code section.it sought,among other things,the return of its trade secret information and an injunction barring birnbaum from using or disclosing that information.
soon thereafter,the southern christian leadership conference of greater los angeles,and the consumers union of,collectively interveners,successfully intervened in the action.in their complaint,the interveners sought a declaration that the community service statement and data insurers file with the commissioner are public records subject to public inspection and not exempt from public disclosure.
state farm then amended its complaint.the amended complaint included the interveners and clarified that only the record a data was a trade secret.state farm also added two declaratory relief claims.first,it sought a declaration that c is invalid to the extent that it purports to make insurance code applicable to data submitted by state farm pursuant to,and purports to make data submitted in confidence by state farm pursuant to publicly available.second,it sought a declaration that insurance code does not abrogate trade secret rights that trade secret protections apply to information submitted under insurance code that state farm data submitted in record a constitutes a trade secret and that,if insurance code applies to data submitted pursuant to,state farm data submitted in record a to each of its community service statements must be held as confidential by the commissioner and can not be produced pursuant to a public records act request.
after the trial court dismissed birnbaum from the action both the commissioner and the interveners moved for summary judgment.the court granted both motions.in granting the commissioner motion,the court held that the commissioner did not exceed his powers in enacting and implementing ccr c,and state farm has not shown that there is an exception to the requirements of ccr c and insurance code for information which would otherwise be considered a trade secret.in granting the interveners motion,the court held that there is no triable issue as to any material fact there is no showing by state farm of economic value of the record a data in the community service statements,cal.tit,and the community service statements and record a data are not a trade secret the california department of insurance did not exceed its powers in promulgating section of title of the california code of regulations to ensure that insurers do not unfairly discriminate against poor and ethnic communities and the community service statements and data insurers file with the california department of insurance pursuant to cal.tit,are public records subject to public inspection under regulation c and cal.and are not exempt from public disclosure.
the court of appeal affirmed first,the court concluded that state farm had standing to bring an action to prevent the commissioner from disclosing its record a data.second,the court held that the commissioner did not exceed his statutory authority by making community service statements subject to the public disclosure mandate of insurance code section.third,the court found no trade secret exception to the public disclosure mandate of insurance code section.according to the court,insurance code section declared a general rule requiring disclosure without exceptions and did not incorporate the exemption from disclosure for statutory privileges found in government code section,subdivision k.thus,state farm could not shield its record a data from public inspection by asserting the trade secret privilege codified in evidence code section.finally,the court held that,even if the trade secret privilege applied,it still would not protect state farm record a data.relying on uribe howie d,the court held that evidence code section,even if applicable,could not shield this data from disclosure because the public interest is better served by disclosure than by nondisclosure.as a result,the court declined to consider state farm contention that there was a triable issue of fact as to whether its record a data is a trade secret.
we granted review.
before the court of appeal,state farm contended the commissioner exceeded his statutory authority by making community service statements subject to the public disclosure mandate of insurance code section and that california code of regulations,title,section,subdivision c was invalid to the extent that it purport ed to do so.according to state farm,only information submitted pursuant to article of chapter of part of division of the insurance code hereafter article must be disclosed under insurance code section,and community service statements do not contain such information.the court rejected this contention.citing insurance code section it concluded that article is not only about rates and rate regulation it also concerns other factors that may impermissibly affect the availability of insurance.thus,i t was well within the authority of the commissioner to conclude that requiring insurers to submit the information contained in those statements would facilitate his obligations to implement and enforce article.in a convoluted argument,state farm now challenges this holding.we,however,find the public inspection provision of regulation,subdivision c to be valid.
in reviewing the validity of a regulation,o ur function is to inquire into the legality of the regulations,not their wisdom.morris williams cal d.the commissioner has broad discretion to adopt rules and regulations as necessary to promote the public welfare.calfarm,supra,cal d at.thus,our task is limited to determining whether the regulation is within the scope of the authority conferred,and is reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of the statute.agricultural labor relations bd.superior court cal d.in this case,state farm only challenges the authority of the commissioner to enact the public inspection provision of regulation,subdivision c.we must therefore conduct an independent examination see century,supra,cal th at,d,and determine whether in enacting the specific rule the commissioner reasonably interpreted the legislative mandate fox san francisco residential rent.bd.d.
the challenged portion of regulation,subdivision c provides that community service statements are subject to insurance code section.as relevant here,insurance code section states that all information submitted to the commissioner pursuant to article shall be available for public inspection because all information provided pursuant to article encompasses insurance code sections to subject to public disclosure under insurance code section,the validity of the regulation depends on whether the statutes in article authorize the commissioner to require community service statements.
in answering this question,we first find that office of administrative law oal opinions approving regulation are irrelevant.the approval of a regulation by the oal shall not be considered by a court in any action for declaratory relief brought with respect to a regulation,subd.c,italics added see also jimenez honig d,fn.the courts are precluded from considering the opinion of the oal in reviewing the validity of the regulation.thus,we reject state farm claim that we are constrained by holdings of the oal.as such,we may consider all the article statutes cited as authority for the promulgation of regulation,subdivision c,insurance code sections,and determining the regulation validity.see note,foll.regulation.
nor,contrary to state farm contention,did the court of appeal consider whether insurance code section actually incorporates provisions of the unruh act and other business laws.rather,the court correctly observed that insurance code section made the business of insurance subject to the state antitrust and unfair business practice laws and to the unruh civil rights act.see also farmers ins.exchange superior court cal th,d,merely modifies preexisting law,to provide,in essence,that insurers are subject to the unfair business practices laws in addition to preexisting regulations under the mcbride act,as amended.based on the breadth of these business laws,the court then concluded that article encompasses more than rate matters and addresses other factors that may impermissibly affect the availability of insurance.
in doing so,the court of appeal correctly found that the commissioner did not exceed his authority by promulgating the public inspection provision of regulation,subdivision c.as part of proposition,article s stated purpose was to protect consumers from arbitrary insurance rates and practices,to encourage a competitive insurance marketplace,to provide for an accountable insurance commissioner,and to ensure that insurance is fair,available,and affordable for all californians.historical and statutory notes,west ann.ed.foll.to this end,article gives the commissioner broad authority over insurance rates caarp,supra,d at,and expressly precludes him from approving rates that are excessive,inadequate,unfairly discriminatory or otherwise in violation of chapter of the insurance code,subd.a.through insurance code section,subdivision a,the article also subjects the business of insurance to laws prohibiting discriminatory and unfair business practices.thus,article is not limited in scope to rate regulation.it also addresses the underlying factors that may impermissibly affect rates charged by insurers and lead to insurance that is unfair,unavailable,and unaffordable.
as such,the commissioner undoubtedly has the authority under article to gather any information necessary for determining whether these factors are impermissibly affecting the fairness,availability,and affordability of insurance.this information necessarily includes statistical data relevant to the commissioner determination that a california community is underserved by the insurance industry.see reg,subd.c using information from community service statements,the commissioner shall issue the commissioner report on underserved communities which will report those communities within california,designated by zip code,that the commissioner finds to be underserved by the insurance industry.therefore,the commissioner reasonably concluded that community service statements fall within his legislative mandate under article.accordingly,we conclude that the commissioner did not exceed his statutory authority by promulgating regulation,subdivision c,and subjecting these statements to the public disclosure mandate of insurance code section.
although the public inspection provision of regulation,subdivision c is a valid regulation,the scope of disclosure required by the regulation depends on the scope of disclosure required by insurance code section.according to state farm,insurance code section,by expressly barring the application of the exemption from public disclosure codified in government code section,subdivision d,establishes that the rest of government code section applies.specifically,state farm contends government code section,subdivision k which exempts from disclosure r ecords,the disclosure of which is exempted or prohibited pursuant to federal or state law,including,but not limited to,provisions of the evidence code relating to privilege controls.thus,trade secret information privileged under evidence code section should be exempt from public disclosure under insurance code section.see cbs,block cal d,subd.k merely incorporates other prohibitions established by law.
the interveners contend insurance code section establishes an absolute rule in favor of public disclosure,and its language barring the application of government code section,subdivision d merely buttresses this rule.thus,according to the interveners,neither government code section,subdivision k nor evidence code section applies to a records request.as explained below,we agree with the interveners.
