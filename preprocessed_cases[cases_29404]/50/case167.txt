an aerospace manufacturer subcontracted with an engineering company for development of a new aircraft refueling system.subject to a confidentiality agreement,the manufacturer revealed trade secrets to the subcontractor in order to facilitate the design of a new device for the system.after the relationship disintegrated,the subcontractor contracted with the united states air force to create a similar device.the manufacturer sued the subcontractor for misappropriation of trade secrets under the california uniform trade secrets act utsa.the subcontractor denied using trade secrets,claiming it reverse engineered and independently developed the device.the principal issue in this case is who bears the burden of proof with respect to that claim.the manufacturer sought a trial court instruction that placed the burden of proof on the subcontractor,arguing the subcontractor was in the better position to bear that burden.the trial court refused the manufacturer proposed instruction.the jury found for the subcontractor.
the law deals with this problem by shifting the burden of producing evidence,not the burden of proof,which remains with the plaintiff or the party asserting an affirmative defense,and does not shift.the practical effect of this allocation is to require a defendant to produce rebutting evidence once the plaintiff has presented a prima facie and credible case.this is a fair allocation,well suited to a fair result.there are limited exceptions and some confusion in the reported cases.but the basic principles controlling this allocation of burdens remain intact.they govern the issue presented in this case.
for this reason,in the published portion of this opinion,we find no error in the court ruling on the proposed instruction.we also conclude that under the facts of the case,even if there was error,it was not prejudicial.in the nonpublished portion of the opinion,we reject the claim that evidence was improperly admitted.
factual and procedural summary 
sargent fletcher,sargent fletcher,designs and manufactures aircraft refueling systems.able corporation able,is an engineering company that designs mechanical devices for the aerospace industry.
sargent fletcher designed the,an refueling system,in the late.the system typically mounts on the wings of a lockheed tanker aircraft and allows refueling of aircraft such as fighter jets and helicopters.the functions using a hose and drogue system.a control assembly runs the hose and reel portion of the hose and drogue system.the control assembly is the brain of the system,governing the extension,retraction,and storage of the hose.the brain automatically maintains a constant tension on the probe to prevent the hose from snapping or becoming too loose during refueling.in the early,the air force contracted with sargent fletcher to replace the original brain,which had controls,with an updated control system.sargent fletcher subcontracted work for development of the microprocessor controls to able.in order to perform under its contract,able needed access to sargent fletcher proprietary information on the design.sargent fletcher provided that access to able.
in september,while the companies were in the midst of developing the new technology,sargent fletcher filed for bankruptcy protection.the company that purchased sargent fletcher pulled out of the contract with able,but the two firms continued to work together without a written agreement.
able withdrew from the collaboration in december.able then won an air force contract to build a system to replace the.sargent fletcher sued able,alleging misuse of its trade secret information.able generally and specifically denied all allegations in sargent fletcher complaint and pleaded affirmative defenses,none of which asserted reverse engineering or independent derivation.
the case was tried to a jury.the trial lasted seven weeks.each party presented volumes of evidence bearing on whether able improperly used sargent fletcher trade secret.sargent fletcher proposed an instruction that would have placed the burden of proof for the element of use of the trade secret onto able if you believe that sargent fletcher disclosed any trade secrets for its series aerial refueling system to able,and that able subsequently manufactured a substantially similar system,the burden then shifts to able to prove that it in fact developed its hose reel system independently,that is,without the use of any of sargent fletcher trade secrets.the trial court rejected the instruction.after five weeks of deliberation,the jury reached a verdict for the defendant,able.in a special verdict,the jurors found nine to two that at least one of sargent fletcher drawings and specifications contained a trade secret to which able had access,but that able did not use one or more of the trade secrets in designing,manufacturing,or testing its own product.sargent fletcher has appealed from the ensuing judgment.
discussion 
under the utsa,a prima facie claim for misappropriation of trade secrets requires the plaintiff to demonstrate the plaintiff owned a trade secret,the defendant acquired,disclosed,or used the plaintiff trade secret through improper means,and the defendant actions damaged the plaintiff,see frantz johnson,nevada supreme court detailing similar elements for the same provision of the utsa total care physicians,superior court of delaware detailing similar elements for the same provision of the utsa.improper means includes theft,bribery,misrepresentation,breach or inducement of a breach of a duty to maintain secrecy,or espionage through electronic or other means,but r everse engineering or independent derivation alone shall not be considered improper means,subd.a.
during the trial,the parties presented extensive evidence and testimony to convince the jury that able did or did not misappropriate sargent fletcher trade secrets.there is no issue on appeal as to sufficiency of the evidence to support the jury verdict in favor of able.because there is not,there is no need to discuss the technical details of sargent fletcher claim that able improperly used its technology or that able could not have independently derived or reverse engineered the device.instead,the issues are whether the trial court erred in rejecting sargent fletcher proposed jury instruction or in admitting able documentary evidence and,if so,the effect of that error.the principal objection to the instruction was that it would have shifted the burden of proof to show proper use onto the defendant.able also asserted various technical objections,which we do not discuss since able principal objection is well taken.
we begin with a discussion of key terms burden of proof and burden of producing evidence.attorneys,judges,and commentators often have confused these terms and the concepts they represent.as the united states supreme court observed,for many years the term burden of proof was ambiguous because the term was used to describe two distinct concepts.burden of proof was frequently used to refer to what we now call the burden of notion that if the evidence is evenly balanced,the party that bears the burden of persuasion must lose.but it was also used to refer to what we now call the burden of party obligation to come forward with evidence to support its claim.director,office of workers compensation programs greenwich collieries,d see mccormick,evidence ed.burden of proof.
the terms burden of proof and burden of persuasion are synonymous.witkin,cal.evidence ed.burden of proof,mccormick,evidence,supra,burden of proof.because the california usage is burden of proof,we use that term here.
except as otherwise provided by law,a party has the burden of proof as to each fact the existence or nonexistence of which is essential to the claim for relief or defense that he is asserting.to prevail,the party bearing the burden of proof on the issue must present evidence sufficient to establish in the mind of the trier of fact or the court a requisite degree of belief commonly proof by a preponderance of the evidence.the burden of proof does not shift during remains with the party who originally bears it,mathis morrissey th,d smith santa rosa police th,d mccormick,evidence,supra,burden of proof.
historically in california,the burden of producing evidence or burden of production also has been known as the burden of going forward with the evidence.people valverde d,mathis morrissey,supra,th at,d witkin,cal.evidence ed.burden of producing evidence.here,we use burden of producing evidence as that is the california code usage.
unlike the burden of proof,the burden of producing evidence may shift between plaintiff and defendant throughout the trial.see,cal.law revision com,west ann.ed.foll,witkin,cal.evidence,supra,burden of producing evidence,mccormick,evidence,supra,burden of proof.initially,the burden of producing evidence as to a particular fact rests on the party with the burden of proof as to that fact,subd.b wigmore,evidence chadbourn ed.if that party fails to produce sufficient evidence to make a prima facie case,it risks nonsuit or other unfavorable determination.mathis morrissey,supra,th,d witkin,cal.evidence,supra,burden of producing evidence,wigmore,evidence,supra.but once that party produces evidence sufficient to make its prima facie case,the burden of producing evidence shifts to the other party to refute the prima facie case.see,cal.law revision com,west ann.ed.foll,witkin,cal.evidence,supra,burden of producing evidence,wigmore,evidence,supra.even though the burden of producing evidence shifts to the other party,that party need not offer evidence in reply,but failure to do so risks an adverse verdict.ibid.once a prima facie showing is made,it is for the trier of fact to say whether or not the crucial and necessary facts have been established.ibid.
sargent fletcher argues that able should have borne the burden of proof to demonstrate it did not use the plaintiff trade secret through improper means the second element for misappropriation under the utsa.able counters that although the burden of producing evidence may have shifted to it if sargent fletcher established a prima facie case,the burden of proof to demonstrate use of a trade secret through improper means remained with the plaintiff,sargent fletcher.we agree.
as we have seen,california law provides that e xcept as otherwise provided by law,a party has the burden of proof as to each fact the existence or nonexistence of which is essential to the claim for relief or defense that he is asserting.the party claiming that a person is guilty of crime or wrongdoing has the burden of proof on that issue.in sum,the plaintiff generally bears the burden of proof to establish its prima facie case.
as we also have discussed,to prove misappropriation of a trade secret under the utsa,a plaintiff must establish among other things that the defendant improperly used the plaintiff trade secret.thus,under evidence code sections and,the plaintiff bears the burden of proof on that issue,both at the outset and during trial.on the other hand,the defendant bears the burden of proof on new matter and affirmative defenses.rancho santa margarita vail cal d.both sides agree that reverse engineering and independent derivation are not affirmative defenses.we turn to whether they are new matter.there are no reported california cases on the point.
the only california state authority sargent fletcher cites is a nonpublished california superior court case cybertek computer products,whitfield.but a written trial court ruling has no precedential value.santa ana hospital medical center belshe th,d.cybertek has no value in this court.droeger welsh sporting goods cir,a federal case applying california law before the utsa was adopted,is the primary decision on which sargent fletcher relies to demonstrate that the defendant should bear the burden of proof for the second element.but droeger actually places the burden of proof on the plaintiff and describes the shift of the burden of producing evidence to the defendant as a number of cases have pointed out see,bolt associates,alpine geophysical associates,cir,and cases cited therein,disclosure of the secret to the defendant,followed by manufacture of a closely similar device by the defendant,shifts to the defendant the burden of going forward with the evidence to prove,if it can,that it arrived at the process by independent invention.id.at fn,italics added.ironically,the authority cited in droeger,bolt associates,stands for the opposite proposition.applying new jersey common law not the utsa,the court placed the burden of proof on the defendant to show reverse engineering.bolt associates,alpine geophysical associates,supra.these cases further illustrate the confusion in the courts concerning the distinction between the burden of proof and the burden of producing evidence.
we turn to the statute.the statutory design indicates that the legislature did not intend independent derivation or reverse engineering to be new matter or an affirmative defense.the references to independent derivation and reverse engineering are embedded within the definition of improper means,subd.a.they are not set off as separate defenses or even separate definitions.it is the plaintiff burden to show improper use as a part of its prima facie case.proof that defendant use resulted from independent derivation or reverse engineering is evidence that there was no improper use on its part.the defendant does not have a burden of proof to make that showing.but it acts at its peril if it fails to present evidence that rebuts the plaintiff showing.in some cases,its failure to do so may require judgment in plaintiff favor.see cal.law revision com,west ann.ed.foll.
stated another way,the two claims improper use and denial of such use are opposite sides of the same coin.the plaintiff proof that another party used plaintiff trade secret,to which that party gained access properly,for a limited purpose,or otherwise,and that the party identical or similar product incorporates the same design,is a prima facie showing that the party did not independently derive or reverse engineer the product.see moore kulicke soffa industries,cir.
evidence of independent derivation or reverse engineering directly refutes the element of use through improper means.thus,a party that claims it independently derived or reverse engineered a component does not introduce new matter or an affirmative defense,but a traverse.see rancho santa margarita vail,supra,cal d at,a plea controverting the original cause of action and tendering no new issue is a mere traverse and can not be properly described as a plea setting up new matter bevill zoura th,d where,however,the answer sets forth facts showing some essential allegation of the complaint is not true,such facts are not new matter,but only a traverse.citation.
even if the utsa does not require placing the burden of proof for reverse engineering or independent derivation on able,sargent fletcher argues the trial court should have placed it there because able is in a better position to bear that burden.
on rare occasions,the courts have altered the normal allocation of the burden of proof.national council against health fraud,king bio pharmaceuticals,th,d.in evaluating whether to shift the normal allocation of the burden of proof,the courts consider a number of factors the knowledge of the parties concerning the particular fact,the availability of the evidence to the parties,the most desirable result in terms of public policy in the absence of proof of the particular fact,and the probability of the existence or nonexistence of the fact.lakin watkins associated industries cal th,d,quoting cal.law.revision com,west ann.ed.but the exceptions are few,and narrow.
courts shift the burden of proof for causation when it is impossible for the plaintiff to prove its case otherwise.summers tice cal d,court placed burden of proof for causation on defendants where the plaintiff could not prove which of two hunters fired the shot that struck him haft lone palm hotel cal d,court placed burden of proof for causation on hotel that failed to provide statutorily required lifeguard because its statutory violation not only endangered victims,but deprived plaintiffs of witness to establish causation sindell abbott laboratories cal d,court shifted burden of
