on october,plaintiff scott epstein epstein filed a complaint against defendant bard,bard in the suffolk county superior court,requesting damages arising from bard alleged breach of contract and infringement of epstein intellectual property rights.bard removed the case to the united states district court for the district of massachusetts.on july,the district court dismissed counts two through eight and count ten.on november,the district court dismissed counts one and nine.epstein herein appeals from both decisions.we affirm.
epstein is a designer and manufacturer of medical devices and an officer and principal of sme design technology,sme.at some point the brief lacks dates,epstein entered into a business relationship with bard,a developer,manufacturer,and marketer of medical technology.according to the complaint,epstein worked in cooperation with bard urological division bud to develop improvements to certain medical devices,including catheters.epstein agreed to provide a minimum of of the improved as the tigertail to bud at a price of per catheter.between december,and january,epstein entered into a series of confidentiality agreements with bard concerning the tigertail technology.
at a later unspecified date,epstein sought to sell or license his catheter technology to bud.bud declined and informed him that it was discontinuing the product line.but on october,epstein wrote a letter the october,letter to the president of bud,noting that 
it has been brought to my attention that tigertail tm is still available through bard urology,which under the circumstances is confusing to me.we have not supplied bud with product for about one year and therefore i have to wonder where additional inventory has come form sic.this letter is an attempt to ascertain this information because it has been established and is well defined that the bud tigertail tm technology and concept is the intellectual property of sme design.any second source manufacture utilizing sme design technology which includes material and process information would have to be licensed form sic and approved by sme design.
on january,epstein sent a letter the january,letter,saying i also want to voice my disappointment regarding bud failure to resolve this issue.epstein observed that i find myself dealing with people that i can not trust.the issue is more and more complicated now that my trade secrets have been divulged and the soft tip product line is successful.finally,epstein warned that if there was no satisfactory response from bud within days,we will end up in court.

bard filed a notice of removal under,and the case was entered in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts on november.on july,the district court dismissed counts two through eight,and in a separate opinion issued on november,the district court dismissed counts one and nine.
the district court dismissed epstein complaint under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.under that rule,a complaint can properly be dismissed for failure of the pleading to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.b.it is axiomatic that a complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.conley gibson,d.we review a rule b dismissal de novo,considering all facts in the complaint to be true.isla nena air,cessna aircraft,cir.
statutes of limitations 
for statute of limitations purposes,the district court found that epstein cause of action accrued with the october,letter.although epstein claims that the district court determination as to the accrual date was in error,we find no mistake.
the relevant statute of limitations periods are three years for tort claims.laws ch,four years for violations.laws ch,and four years for breach of contract claims governed by the uniform commercial code.laws ch,and the limitations period begins to run when a plaintiff discovers,or any earlier date when she should reasonably have discovered,that she has been harmed or may have been harmed by the defendant conduct.bowen eli lilly.the discovery rule provides that the limitations period is tolled until events occur or facts surface which would cause a reasonably prudent person to become aware that she or he had been harmed.felton labor relations com n.a plaintiff is considered to be on inquiry notice when the first event occurs that would prompt a reasonable person to inquire into a possible injury at the hands of the defendant.szymanski boston mut.life ins.
the district court found that epstein was on notice that bud was improperly using his technology as of the october,letter.in the letter,epstein stated in relevant part that it has been brought to my attention that tigertail tm is still available through bard urology despite the fact that w e have not supplied bud with product for about one year.in the same letter epstein wrote that the situation is confusing to me because it is well defined that the bud tigertail technology and concept is the intellectual property of sme design and any use of that property would have to be licensed form sic and approved by sme design.from this language,the district court concluded that epstein was clearly on notice that bud was improperly using his technology since he knew that bud continued to sell the tigertail tm and he,the sole supplier of the product,was not supplying it to bud.
epstein contends that the district court erred in its determination that the letter demonstrates that he was clearly on notice of a possible injury to his rights as of the october,letter because it was merely an inquiry for more information.epstein further maintains that the letter was a response to a rumor that might have been incorrect,and that he neither knew,nor should have known that he had been harmed by bard conduct as of october.he insists that o nly after receiving a proper reply from bard,or other reliable sources,could the statute of limitations begin to accrue.we find this argument to be wholly unpersuasive.
epstein suggests that because he was uncertain as to the nature and extent of his injury when he wrote the october,letter,he could not have been on inquiry notice as of that date.this argument completely misunderstands the concept of inquiry notice.the discovery rule does not require that a plaintiff know the specific details pertaining to an alleged harm,but instead it imposes a duty to investigate on a plaintiff who has cause for concern.doucette handy harmon.critically,knowledge of every fact necessary to prevail on the claim is not required to put the plaintiff on inquiry notice and trigger the accrual period.int l mobiles corroon ellis.in this case,we have no doubt that epstein had cause for concern.the october,letter makes plain that epstein had reason to believe that bard was making unauthorized use of his intellectual property.in the letter,epstein made clear his belief that sme owned the tigertail,and that bard was selling it despite the fact that sme was not providing it.in his own brief,epstein admits that,by writing the letter,he acted as a reasonably prudent person in his situation would,he inquired into the truth of the matter.we agree that a reasonable person would have inquired into the issue and therefore find that the district court properly deemed epstein to have been on inquiry notice as of october.
epstein next argues that the district court erred by dismissing his cause of action as because the determination as to when he knew or should have known of his cause of action was a question of fact requiring resolution by a jury.he points out that i n most instances,the question of when a plaintiff knew or should have known of its cause of action is one of fact that will be decided by the trier of fact.taygeta varian associates.however,we have held that g ranting a motion to dismiss based on a limitations defense is entirely appropriate when the pleader allegations leave no doubt that an asserted claim is.lachapelle berkshire life ins,cir.in this instance,epstein pleadings actually refer to and rely on the october,letter.he challenges only the district court determination as to the legal significance of the letter.we find therefore that the district court did not err by dismissing epstein cause of action as without presenting it to a jury.
epstein next argues that even if his cause of action accrued on october,his claims are not because the doctrine of fraudulent concealment applied to toll the statutes of limitations fraudulent concealment is a tolling doctrine codified in.laws.ch.under that section,
i f a person liable to a personal action fraudulently conceals the cause of such action from the knowledge of the person entitled to bring it,the period prior to the discovery of his cause of action by the person so entitled shall be excluded in determining the time limited for the commencement of the action.
the supreme judicial court of massachusetts has held that,in the absence of a fiduciary relationship,the statute of limitations may be tolled under this doctrine if the wrongdoer concealed the existence of a cause of action through some affirmative act done with intent to deceive.puritan med,cashman,citation and internal quotation marks omitted.the district court found that the tolling doctrine did not apply because epstein had not alleged that bard acted affirmatively to deceive him.epstein insists that determination was in error.in his complaint,epstein claims that bard acted to deceive him by affirmatively concealing certain material facts about its use of his intellectual property and making false promises regarding its intention to undertake further inquiry into his concerns,inducing epstein to delay taking legal action in reliance upon these promises.
in his complaint,epstein alleged that bard concealed and suppressed material facts as to bard notification to the food and drug administration pertaining to the bud soft tip catheter bard filing a master design history for their internal records bard resubmitting the to the fda to substantiate additional claims like radiopacity and tip strength bard dissemination to third parties of plaintiff technology,intellectual property and trade secrets bard use of plaintiff technology,intellectual property and trade secrets without permission and bard use of plaintiff technology,intellectual property,and trade secrets to apply for a patent.there is no elaboration on any of these allegations.
bard maintains that these allegations do not adequately support a claim for fraudulent concealment,and we agree.under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure,it is incumbent upon the plaintiff to plead with particularity the facts giving rise to the fraudulent concealment claim.geils band employee benefit plan smith barney shearson,cir.it is that t his rule entails specifying in the pleader complaint the time,place,and content of the alleged false or fraudulent representations.powers boston cooper,cir.epstein complaint falls far short.he fails to explain the time,place,content or significance of the facts that bard allegedly concealed and entirely fails to explain how bard actions constituted fraud as to him.
epstein also contends that bard affirmatively attempted to deceive him by making false promises regarding its intention to investigate the issues raised in epstein letters.it is epstein position that he acted in reliance upon this delaying tactic when he decided to postpone bringing suit.specifically,epstein explains that a letter from bard counsel dated november,indicated that bard seemed intent on initiating a dialogue,and although that letter stated that bard would come forward with affidavits to negate epstein assertions,ultimately bard entirely failed to forward any affidavits or answer any inquiries whatsoever.the district court did not find this argument persuasive,and neither do we.in massachusetts,e ven in cases of fraud there is no concealment by mere failure to disclose if the aggrieved party has full means of detecting the fraud.lynch signal finance of quincy.here,epstein patently had the means to detect the alleged fraud.regardless of what bard might have suggested in its november,letter,epstein should have detected at some point during the nearly four years before he finally filed suit that no affidavits were forthcoming.in fact,epstein own january,letter makes plain that he did detect the alleged fraud.writing again to the president of bud,he noted that i find myself dealing with people that i can not trust and warned that if there was no satisfactory response from bud within days,we will end up in court.in his own opposition to bard motion to dismiss,epstein pointed out that f rom the first indicia of foul play,despite epstein best efforts to acquire the requisite knowledge to concretely establish his causes of action,bard wholly failed to answer epstein inquiries.we do not address the question of whether the tactics epstein describes could ever constitute fraudulent concealment because by definition,from the first indicia of foul play,epstein was on notice of the alleged fraud.
amending the complaint 
epstein finally argues that the district court committed reversible error by failing to afford him the opportunity to amend his complaint.in his opposition to bard motion to dismiss,epstein requested leave to amend his complaint under rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure in the event that the complaint did not meet with the particularity requirements of.b.epstein claims that the district court should have interpreted this section of his opposition as a motion to amend his complaint.the district court did not respond to the request,and epstein now contends that the court erroneously failed to allow epstein even one opportunity to comply with the particularity requirements of.b.
even assuming that the motion to amend was properly before the district court,epstein faces an uphill battle.an order denying leave to amend will be overturned only where the district court has abused its discretion.manzoli,cir johnston holiday inns,cir.
epstein correctly points out that there is a liberal amendment policy underlying rule.hyatt hotels of puerto rico,cir.rule a provides in relevant part that a party may amend the party pleading only by leave of court and leave shall be freely given when justice so requires.a.however,although a district court denial of a chance to amend may constitute an abuse of discretion if no sufficient justification appears a district court need not grant every request to amend,come what may,cir,overruled on other grounds by educadores puertorriqueños en acción hernández,cir.although he now claims that the district court failed to allow him even one opportunity to comply with the particularity requirements of.b,we note that epstein could have properly pled fraudulent concealment in his complaint.he has alleged no new facts or arguments to suggest that an amendment would have strengthened his case in the slightest.critically,we have held that w here an amendment would be futile or would serve no legitimate purpose,the district court should not needlessly prolong matters,at.we find no abuse of discretion.
for the foregoing reasons,we affirm the decision of the district court.costs are awarded to the appellee.
epstein also originally named futuremed interventional,and crossbow ventures,as defendants.the district court dismissed all claims against these parties,and because epstein does not appeal that decision,we do not consider them in this opinion.
epstein also sought an injunction prohibiting bard from designing,manufacturing,selling,distributing,and licensing products that were designed,developed,and produced using his technology.the district court did not address this issue separately,and because epstein does not raise it on appeal,we do not consider it.
