this is a first impression trade secret civil discovery case.we hold that code of civil procedure section formerly code of civil procedure section,subdivision d,which provides that discovery relating to a trade secret may not commence until the trade secret is identified with reasonable particularity,is not limited in its application to a cause of action under the uniform trade secrets act utsa,for misappropriation of the trade secret,but extends to any cause of action which relates to the trade secret.we also hold that where the plaintiff makes a showing that is reasonable,fair,proper,just,rational,the trade secret has been described with reasonable particularity,and is sufficient to permit discovery to commence.
the trial court february,order adopts an inappropriately strict construction of the term reasonable particularity and erroneously distinguishes between a cause of action for misappropriation of trade secrets and other causes of action which also depend upon the same alleged misappropriation.accordingly,we vacate the february,order and remand the matter for further consideration in light of the rules articulated herein.
facts and proceedings 
sputtered films,sputtered films manufactures sputtering equipment.sputtering is the process of depositing a thin and even film of material onto a silicon wafer or other substrate.sputtered films machines have many industrial applications such as coating silicon wafers during the semiconductor manufacturing process.it alleges that it has spent the last years researching and developing sputtering processes,culminating in the design and construction of the series iv and the endeavor sputtering machine,both of which employ sputtered films unique trade secret and patented technology.
sputtered films alleges that it laid off its former employees,petitioners sergey mishin and rose,due to a down turn in its business.as an accommodation to him,sputtered films gave mishin permission to service sputtering machines sold to its former customer,agilent technologies,agilent.mishin and curran then formed petitioner advanced modular sputtering,ams.within four years,ams was sputtered films competitor and was selling sputtering machines to agilent and other customers of sputtered films.
sputtered films alleges that ams was able to develop the competing knock off machine so quickly because it used trade secrets that mishin and curran misappropriated when they left sputtered films.its complaint alleges causes of action specific performance of the confidentiality agreement each former employee executed in favor of sputtered films,breach of those contracts,breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing implied in those contracts,misappropriation of trade secrets,unfair competition,unfair business practices,interference with prospective economic advantage,conversion,unjust enrichment,and declaratory relief.each cause of action incorporates and depends upon the foundational allegation that petitioners have misappropriated sputtered films trade secrets.
on ams motion,the trial court granted a protective order pursuant to former section,subdivision d now redesignated,which bars discovery until sputtered films identifies the specific trade secrets it alleges have been misappropriated.the trial court also appointed a discovery referee,an experienced civil litigation attorney,to recommend a resolution of this and other discovery disputes in this complex litigation 
sputtered films has since filed three additional trade secret designations,refining and restating the parameters of its claimed trade secrets.ams has objected to each designation,submitting the declarations of expert witnesses to support its contention that the claimed trade secrets are too vaguely described to distinguish them from information that is already known in the industry.sputtered films has,of course,rebutted these objections with expert witness declarations of its own.these experts declare,among other things,that the trade secrets are adequately described,that they involve information not commonly known in the industry,and that ams experts are being purposefully obtuse when they claim confusion over the nature or boundaries of the alleged trade secrets.on each occasion,the discovery referee and trial court have found sputtered films designation insufficient to identify the trade secrets with reasonable particularity.as a result,the parties have created a voluminous record,expended thousands of dollars on attorney fees and expert witnesses,and consumed considerable judicial resources without ever even beginning to conduct discovery.
after considering sputtered films third and final designation of trade secrets,the discovery referee concluded that there remained a lack of meaningful particularity as to each designated trade secret.although the referee acknowledged that six of the eight claimed secrets consist of a combination of features which plaintiff suggests are unique to its equipment or processes,he complained that the individual features of the trade secrets were not identified with adequate particularity to apply them meaningfully.he did not address sputtered films contention that the combination of these features was itself unique and secret.the referee also noted that sputtered films had not described how ams was allegedly misappropriating the second feature of its first claimed trade secret,nor had it produced a complete copy of its source code,which comprises the fifth claimed trade secret.
finding this third designation inadequate,the referee recommended that discovery by sputtered films relating to the allegations of misappropriation of trade secrets should be further stayed.discovery in all other respects should proceed.if the plaintiff wishes to purse its cause of action for misappropriation of trade secrets,it should proceed with the preparation of a further designation,or seek a determination from the court s that the designation last presented is adequate.as we shall explain,this was the seed of error.
unfortunately,the trial court cultivated this seed by adopting the referee recommendations as its order,noting that sfi is not foreclosed from filing a fourth designation of trade secrets but that must be done within days.the trial court further ordered however,unless good cause is shown,the trade secrets cause of action will be dismissed in days unless a fourth designation has been filed and the referee has been given an adequate opportunity to consider it.
ams filed a petition for writ of mandate to reverse that portion of the trial court order which permits sputtered films to conduct discovery on all causes of action other than its cause of action under the utsa for misappropriation of trade secrets.sputtered films filed its own writ petition,challenging the trial court finding that its third designation of trade secrets did not satisfy former section,subdivision d.we summarily denied both writ petitions.
ams petitioned our supreme court for review.sputtered films opposed the petition for review and also requested,pursuant to california rules of court,rule a,that the court review the additional question whether the trial court erred in ruling its trade secret designations inadequate.our supreme court granted ams petition for review and transferred the matter to us with directions to issue an order to show cause why the relief sought in the petition should not be granted.no.thereafter,sputtered films filed a writ petition,renewing its request that we review the trial court finding that its trade secrets designation did not satisfy section,subdivision d.no.we issued orders to show cause with respect to both petitions,ordered them consolidated for purposes of oral argument and disposition,and now vacate the trial court order of february.
standard of review 
ordinarily,the m anagement of discovery lies within the sound discretion of the trial court.consequently,appellate review of discovery rulings is governed by the abuse of discretion standard.johnson superior court th,d.the questions presented here,however,do not concern the management of discovery.rather,they require us to construe the mandate,imposed by section,that trad
