in this case we determine whether penal code section,which requires the imposition of a minimum county jail sentence as a condition of probation upon conviction of certain theft offenses,applies to the theft of property other than money,including trade secrets we conclude that it does.
on april,an amended complaint was filed charging defendant with the theft of a trade secret,in violation of section,subdivision b.it was further alleged as a sentence enhancement that the loss exceeded million within the meaning of section,subdivision a,and as a restriction on the granting of probation that the theft was of an amount exceeding within the meaning of sections and.defendant pleaded no contest to the theft charge,a charge based upon evidence that he had printed out confidential design specifications for certain computer chips on the last day of his employment as an electrical engineer at digital equipment corporation and also had done so on the following day.this evidence was obtained during execution of a search warrant at his home a few days later.the confidential specifications potentially could be useful in designing other technology.defendant waived preliminary hearing and jury trial on the section enhancement allegation.he objected,however,to the potential application of section to his sentence.he did not object to the application of.
a hearing was held in the superior court on the limited question of whether section applies to the theft of property other than money,including trade secrets.the court concluded that the provision applies to the theft of all property of a certain value,including trade secrets.defendant subsequently admitted the truth of an amended enhancement allegation,subd.a loss exceeding million,and further admitted that the theft was of an amount exceeding.in accordance with the requirements of section,the court suspended imposition of sentence and placed defendant on probation for a period of three years on condition that he serve three months in county jail,with credit for time served of seven days.the court granted a stay of the jail term pending appeal 
the court of appeal reversed,concluding that section applies only to the theft of what it termed monetary property.we granted the attorney general petition for review.
defendant stands convicted of theft,specifically a violation of section,subdivision b,which provides b every person is guilty of theft who,with intent to deprive or withhold the control of a trade secret from its owner,or with an intent to appropriate a trade secret to his or her own use or to the use of another,does any of the following steals,takes,carries away,or uses without authorization,a trade secret.the statute defines the term trade secret as follows information,including a formula,pattern,compilation,program,device,method,technique,or process,that a derives independent economic value,actual or potential,from not being generally known to the public or to other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use and b is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy,subd.a.
the trial court determined that section applies to such a theft.this statute,entitled the economic crime law of,requires that a defendant who is convicted of certain theft offenses and is granted probation shall be sentenced to at least days in the county jail as a condition of probation,subd.e.it also subjects persons who are convicted of qualifying offenses and are granted probation to exacting requirements with respect to reporting assets and income see,subds.h o,and imposes stringent restitution requirements upon convicted defendants,subds.g,p s.in addition,a defendant must pay a surcharge to the county equalling percent of the restitution ordered,subd.g.the statute also renders ineligible for probation those defendants alleged and found to have been previously convicted of a specified felony,subd.b.
as relevant to the present case,the statute provides this section shall apply only to a defendant convicted of a felony for theft of an amount exceeding fifty thousand dollars in a single transaction or occurrence.this section shall not apply unless the fact that the crime involved the theft of an amount exceeding fifty thousand dollars in a single transaction or occurrence is charged in the accusatory pleading and either admitted by the defendant in open court or found to be true by the trier of fact.aggregate losses from more than one criminal act shall not be considered in determining if this section applies,subd.a.
the court of appeal determined that section may not be applied to persons convicted of the theft of trade secrets.it examined the words of the statute and the legislative history of the enactment and,concluding that the statute is at best ambiguous,applied the rule of lenity to give defendant the benefit of the doubt.
closely examining the text of the statute,the appellate court turned first to the dictionary.the court asserted that in ordinary usage,t he word amount is defined as the total number or quantity a principal sum and interest on it.citation.the only number,quantity,or sum designated in subdivision a is described in dollars.there is no specific reference to other property to which the subdivision might apply.one could argue that there is no language in the subdivision that could reasonably be construed as including other kinds of property.phrasing such as,property taken is of a value exceeding or property worth more than would have had such an effect,but is not present.the court of appeal declared that its function was to interpret statutory language,but not to insert omitted language regarding the value or worth of the property taken.the court also inferred an intent that section apply only to monetary theft from the circumstance that,in those portions of the statute imposing upon a convicted defendant the duty to disclose assets for the purpose of ensuring appropriate restitution,the legislature referred not simply to dollar amounts but to disclosure of property exceeding certain worth or value.the court of appeal also pointed to other references in the penal code to property according to its value,and declared that these examples establish that the legislature knew how to make the distinction between monetary property and other property where its worth would be at issue and did so in section.
our task is one of statutory interpretation and,as with any statute,it is to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent.citations.we turn first to the words of the statute themselves,recognizing that they generally provide the most reliable indicator of legislative intent.people gardeley cal th,d.we examine the meaning of the phrase convicted of a felony for theft of an amount exceeding fifty thousand dollars,keeping in mind that the words must be interpreted in context.see people lawrence cal th,d.
in outlining the circumstances under which a person given a probationary term for a theft offense must be sentenced to a minimum period in custody and subjected to demanding restitution requirements,section does not specify that the theft must involve that it must involve what is referred to by the court of appeal as monetary property and by defendant as a cash equivalent.
the crime of theft,of course,is not limited to an unlawful taking of money.rather,e very person who shall feloniously steal,take,carry,lead,or drive away the personal property of another,or who shall fraudulently appropriate property which has been entrusted to him or her,or who shall knowingly and designedly,by any false or fraudulent representation or pretense,defraud any other person of money,labor or real or personal property,or who causes or procures others to report falsely of his or her wealth or mercantile character and by thus imposing upon any person,obtains credit and thereby fraudulently gets or obtains possession of money,or property or obtains the labor or service of another,is guilty of theft,subd.a.
the crime of theft may involve the theft of trade secrets indeed,in enacting section,the legislature specified that the theft of trade secrets is akin to the theft of any other property.see stats,it is the purpose of this act to clarify and restate existing law with respect to crimes involving trade secrets and to make clear that articles representing trade secrets,including the trade secrets represented thereby,constitute goods,chattels,materials and property and can be the subject of criminal acts.
in the absence of evidence to the contrary,we may infer that when the legislature referred in section to persons convicted of a felony for theft,it had in mind the general definition of theft,including the broad categories of property that may be the subject of theft pursuant to section.
the court of appeal and defendant,however,focus upon the words an amount exceeding fifty thousand dollars,asserting that this language refers specifically to the theft of money or property that is the equivalent of money.even examining the quoted words in isolation,however,we are not persuaded that they bear so restricted a meaning or that they exclude reference to the value of the property stolen.returning to dictionary definitions,we observe that the term amount is defined variously as a the total number or quantity b the quantity at hand or under consideration the whole effect,significance,or import or a principal sum and the interest on it.collegiate dict.ed,italics added.another source refers specifically to value as a possible meaning of the word amount,defining the term,in relevant part,as follows the sum total to which anything mounts up or reaches the full value,effect,significance,or import.oxford english dict.ed,italics added.
because the word amount may be understood to refer to the value of an item,and because the crime of theft includes any personal property,we do not find that the words relied upon by the court of appeal and by defendant provide adequate support for their position.indeed,had the legislature intended that section be applied only to thefts of cash or cash equivalents,the word amount in the statutory phrase amount exceeding fifty thousand dollars would have been superfluous.furthermore,despite their emphasis upon this phrase,even the court of appeal and defendant do not assert that the statute is limited to the theft of a certain amount of currency,but would extend the reach of the statute to monetary property or cash equivalents terms that are not found in the statute and that we find difficult to apply.
in this connection,the court of appeal offered the suggestion that the statute may apply to the theft of anything where a definite,quantified amount can be ascertained from the face of the document,such as checks,promissory notes,bonds,this interpretation,of course,is not found in the language of the statute and is subject to its own problems of scope and valuation.reference to the face of the document suggests that coins would not be included,even though coins constitute monetary property.difficult questions could be presented,for example,by the theft of rare coins whose face value may be negligible but whose market value may be more than would be a theft of money,but of what nature or amount similar anomalies could be presented by the theft of a worthless bond issued by a company or the theft of a promissory note in which the obligation has been satisfied.
we observe that in another related statute the legislature has used the term amount to signify value.section supplies a sentence enhancement when a defendant takes,damages,or destroys any property in the commission or attempted commission of a felony,with the intent to cause that taking,damage,or destruction,when the loss exceeds a dollar amount specified by the statute,subd.a.the additional term of imprisonment varies,depending upon whether the loss exceeds fifty thousand dollars or specified greater amounts.despite the circumstance that a felony and loss involving damage or destruction of property by definition clearly would not be limited to cash or cash equivalents,the statute further provides the additional terms provided in this section shall not be imposed unless the facts of the taking,damage,or destruction in excess of the amounts provided in this section are charged in the accusatory pleading and admitted or found to be true by the trier of fact,subd.c,italics added.
another example in which amount refers to value is found in section.the punishment for the crime of vandalism depends upon whether the amount of defacement,damage,or destruction is four hundred dollars or more,or the amount is or more,subd.b.vandalism is punishable only as a misdemeanor i f the amount of defacement,damage,or destruction is less than four hundred dollars,subd.b a.obviously,in using the term amount,the legislature was not concerned with defacement of currency or financial instruments,but with defacement of property of a certain value.see also code civ,jurisdictional amounts in civil cases.
to interpret section as limited to the theft of cash or cash equivalents also would be inconsistent with express legislative intent.the legislature addressed problems of certain white collar crimes,specifically theft,in enacting section.as the legislature own statement of intent discloses,that body intended to remedy the perceived relative unfairness arising from the light probationary sentences meted out to white collar criminals,as well as to provide reliable tools to ensure that victims of white collar criminals receive restitution,and to provide financial support for investigation and prosecution of white collar crime.
the legislature declared in enacting section m ajor economic or white collar crime is an increasing threat to california economy and the of its citizens.the legislature intends to deter that crime by ensuring that every offender,without exception,serves at least some time in jail and by requiring the offenders to divert a portion of their future resources to the payment of restitution to their victims.white collar criminals granted probation too often complete their probation without having compensated their victims or society.probation accompanied by a restitution order is often ineffective because county financial officers are often unaware of the income and assets enjoyed by white collar offenders thus,it is the legislature intent that the financial reporting requirements of this act be utilized to achieve satisfactory disclosure to permit an appropriate restitution order.white collar criminal investigations and prosecutions are unusually expensive.these high costs sometimes discourage vigorous enforcement of white collar crime laws by local agencies.thus,it is necessary to require white collar offenders to assist in funding this enforcement activity.it is the intent of the legislature to have this legislation accomplish the punishment,deterrent,and rehabilitative goals contemplated by the united states supreme court as stated in kelly robinson,d restitution ordered as a condition of probation is not dischargeable in bankruptcy.stats,ch,reprinted in historical and statutory notes,west ann.supp.foll.
we observe that the term white collar crime is a relatively broad one and is not limited to losses involving cash or cash equivalents.it generally is defined as a nonviolent crime usu ally involving cheating or dishonesty in commercial matters.examples include fraud,embezzlement,bribery,and insider trading.black law dict.ed.the legislature has applied the term white collar crime to fraud and embezzlement in section,a statute that provides for enhanced prison terms for recidivists committing these offenses when the offense involves a pattern of taking of more than one hundred thousand dollars.like the crime of theft,fraud and embezzlement are not limited to the unlawful acquisition of cash or cash equivalents.see,embezzlement,fraud offenses.indeed,frequently fraud and embezzlement simply are methods by which a charged theft is accomplished.see,subd.a and pattern jury instructions caljic theft by trick and device caljic theft by embezzlement and caljic theft by false pretences.
because the crime of theft includes a wide range of property and the term white collar crime has a broad meaning,we find it improbable that the legislature intended to address only
