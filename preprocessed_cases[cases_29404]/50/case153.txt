factual and procedural summary 
background information 
wssi complaint alleges the following wssi,a company that maintains industrial water systems,hired kent radford and robert caslava as independent contractors.radford and caslava agreed to keep confidential wssi customer information and work guidelines.several years later,radford and caslava formed a competing company,and then solicited wssi customers by using the confidential information and making fraudulent and disparaging statements about wssi,including that it used illegal and carcinogenic chemicals in its cleaning process.defendants also allegedly engaged in numerous acts of harassment,including reporting wssi to the national response center and the national terrorist hotline,falsely claiming that wssi was pouring illegal carcinogenic chemicals into public drainage systems throughout southern california.mann,supra,th at,d.
based on these and additional facts,wssi filed a complaint asserting causes of action against radford and caslava,and their business entity.defendants filed an motion on four of those claims interference with contractual relationship,intentional interference with prospective economic advantage,defamation,and trade libel.defendants argued the claims were subject to the statute because defendants reports to the government agencies were in furtherance of their constitutional right to petition the government and defendants statements were made in connection with a public issue,subds.e,e.
in opposition to the motion,wssi filed its president declaration,stating that defendants made false reports about wssi to the national response center and the national terrorist hotline,and defendants had made false statements to wssi customers.wssi president denied that wssi used illegal chemicals or poured them into city or storm drains.wssi also filed a declaration from a wssi client,stating that caslava and radford informed him that wssi was using an illegal chemical and illegally dumping the sanitizing solution down storm drains.
the trial court denied the motion to strike,finding the challenged claims did not arise from an act in furtherance of defendants right of petition or free speech.on appeal,we affirmed the order denying the motion on all causes of action,except that we reversed on the trade libel cause of action.mann,supra,th at,d.in so doing,we applied law that requires a party moving to strike under the statute to show the challenged cause of action arose from a specified protected activity,and if this burden is met the plaintiff must show a probability of prevailing on the claim.id.at,d.we further followed precedent holding that the statute applies if a cause of action alleges both protected and unprotected activity unless the protected conduct is merely incidental to the unprotected conduct.id.at,d.rejecting defendants arguments,we clarified that an motion must be denied if the plaintiff shows a probability of prevailing on any theory underlying the mixed cause of action.id.at,d.
under these legal principles,we held wssi defamation and trade libel claims were mixed causes of action,subject to the statute because they were based,in part,on defendants act of reporting a suspected crime to interested governmental agencies and seeking a governmental investigation.mann,supra,th at,d see,subd.e.as to the reports to government agencies,we recognized they were absolutely privileged,subd.b,thus eliminating any actionable theory arising from defendants alleged false reports to the government.as to the statements to customers,we determined that wssi met its burden to show a probability of prevailing on its defamation claim,rejecting defendants evidentiary objections and contentions that their alleged wrongful communications with wssi customers were privileged.mann,supra,at,d.on the trade libel claim,we held wssi did not show a probability of prevailing because wssi did not present any evidence showing it had suffered a specific pecuniary loss as a result of the defendants communications with wssi customers.id.at,d see erlich etner d.unlike defamation,trade libel requires evidence of specific pecuniary loss.
on wssi interference claims,we held these claims were not subject to the statute because they arose from defendants communications with wssi customers,and not from statements made to governmental agencies.mann,supra,th at,d.we rejected defendants alternate contention that the interference causes of action were subject to the statute because they were based on protected speech in connection with an issue of public interest.id.at,d.we reasoned that that a lthough pollution is a matter of general public interest,the focus of the statute must be on the specific nature of the speech rather than on generalities that might be abstracted from it d efendants alleged statements were not about pollution or potential public health and safety issues in general,but about wssi specific business practices.id.at,d.
we thus affirmed the court order to the extent it denied defendants motion to strike the two interference claims and the defamation claim,and reversed the order to the extent it denied the motion on the trade libel claim.mann,supra,th at,d.we awarded defendants costs on appeal.id.at,d.
attorney fees proceedings 
shortly after we remanded the case and before the parties began discovery on the merits of the remaining causes of action against defendants,defendants moved in the superior court for attorney fees pursuant to section,subdivision c,which states a prevailing defendant on a special motion to strike shall be entitled to recover his or her attorney fees and costs.in support,defendants counsel submitted a billing summary showing defendants incurred attorney fees of for time spent on the motion in the trial court,and for time spent on the appeal.defendants also stated they incurred in fees for time spent in bringing the attorney fees motion.thus,defendants sought a total of as prevailing parties in the proceedings.
in a supporting declaration,defense counsel confirmed the accuracy of the time records,and stated that counsel was required to conduct extensive research on the issue of whether a mixed cause of action is subject to the statute and that each of the challenged causes of action concerned similar legal issues pertaining to the applicability of the statute.counsel asserted that the time spent was reasonable given numerous unsettled issues in slapp law at the time the case was brought and considering the difficulty of the litigation,the skill required,the attention given to the matter,and the success of defendants attorneys efforts.counsel further stated w e worked efficiently,but at the same time we took the necessary steps to prepare our briefing and for the oral argument before the reviewing court.
in opposing the attorney fees request,wssi argued defendants were not the prevailing parties because the court of appeal affirmed the trial court order refusing to strike three of the four challenged causes of action and even assuming defendants were prevailing parties,the attorney fees award should be limited to reflect that defendants prevailed on only one cause of action and that they did not achieve any level of success relative to the entire litigation.
in reply,defendants argued that the court need not decide the prevailing party issue because the court of appeal already has decided it by awarding defendants their costs on appeal.defendants thus asserted that all that remains for this court to do is to fix the amount of the attorneys fees and costs to be awarded 
after oral argument,the court permitted the parties to file additional briefing on the apportionment issue,whether the court should award attorney fees only with respect to work performed on the successful portions of the motion.the court thereafter granted defendants motion,awarding defendants in attorney fees and in costs.the court explained its ruling as follows defendants ultimately prevailed on the motion to strike plaintiffs trade libel cause of action.moreover,the court of appeal determined that defendants are the prevailing party given the court of appeal found that defendants are entitled to costs on appeal.as the prevailing party,defendants are entitled to an award of reasonable attorney fees and costs pursuant to section apportionment of attorney fees is improper given that the same facts,law,and damages were involved in all causes of action challenged in the motion.the court in this ruling,however,awards a lesser sum of attorney fees to defendants.that lesser sum is reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances of this action.
discussion 
wssi contends the court erred in finding that defendants were prevailing parties on the motion,and alternatively,in failing to reduce the attorney fees to reflect defendants limited success on the motion.
prevailing party 
section,subdivision c provides that a prevailing defendant on a special motion to strike shall be entitled to recover his or her attorney fees and costs.under this provision,any slapp defendant who brings a successful motion to strike is entitled to mandatory attorney fees.ketchum moses cal th,d,ketchum.
in computerxpress,jackson th,d computerxpress,the court considered the issue of whether a defendant who partially prevails on an motion where the court strikes some but not all of the challenged causes of action is a prevailing defendant under section,subdivision c.computerxpress,at,d.in examining this question,the court rejected the plaintiffs reliance on civil code section and instead focused on the statutory distinction between prevailing defendants and prevailing plaintiffs.computerxpress,at,d.unlike a prevailing defendant who is entitled as a matter of right to attorney fees,a prevailing plaintiff is entitled to attorney fees only if the motion was frivolous or is solely intended to cause unnecessary delay,subd.c.finding this distinction reflected the legislature strong preference for awarding attorney fees to successful defendants,the court stated the phrase prevailing party should be interpreted broadly to favor an award of attorney fees to a partially successful defendant.computerxpress,supra,at,d.the computerxpress court additionally relied on similar judicial interpretations of statutory schemes that likewise distinguish between prevailing plaintiffs and defendants in the analysis.id.at,d see hensley eckerhart,d hensley los angeles times alameda corridor transportation authority th,d,subd.d see also wallace consumers cooperative of berkeley,d.
based on these authorities,the computerxpress court held the defendants were prevailing parties because they were successful in striking five of the nine challenged causes of action alleged in the complaint.computerxpress,supra,th at,d.the court stated the defendants lack of success on a portion of the motion was relevant to the amount of fees awarded,and not on the issue of whether they were prevailing parties id.at,d.the court thus remanded for the trial court to determine the attorney fees incurred for bringing the motion challenging the causes of action stricken from the complaint.id.at,d.
distinguishing computerxpress,a court of appeal recently held the defendants who were successful in striking only one cause of action were not prevailing parties under the statute.endres moran th,d.in endres,the plaintiffs alleged the defendants had committed numerous torts and engaged in a conspiracy as a part of a wrongful attempt to control a church.the defendants moved to strike the entire complaint under section,but were successful only as to the conspiracy cause of action.endres,at,d.the trial court declined to award attorney fees to the defendants,finding that the relief granted was minimal compared to the objectives of their motion.ibid.the appellate court affirmed,emphasizing that defendants accomplished nothing by bringing the motion the possible recovery against defendants did not change.the factual allegations which defendants had to defend did not change.the work involved in trying the case did not change.defendants burden concerning their jurisdictional defense did not change.the case was essentially the same after the ruling on the special motion to strike as it was before.the results of the motion were minimal and insignificant,fully justifying the court finding that defendants should not recover fees.id.at,d.
we agree with the legal analysis and results reached by both the computerxpress and endres courts.given the express legislative preference for awarding fees to successful defendants,a party need not succeed in striking every challenged claim to be considered a prevailing party within the meaning of section.a contrary conclusion would require a partially prevailing defendant to bear the entire cost of the litigation at the outset of the case.this would create a strong disincentive for a defendant to bring the motion,undermining the legislative intent to encourage defendants to utilize the procedure to eliminate slapp claims and to discourage plaintiffs from bringing meritless slapp claims.see ketchum,supra,cal th at,d.on the other hand,there is no reason to encourage a defendant to bring an motion where the factual and legal grounds for the claims against the defendant remain the same after the resolution of the motion.endres moran,supra,th at,d.where the results of the motion are minimal or insignificant a court does not abuse its discretion in finding the defendant was not a prevailing party.id.at,d conc.opn.of mosk,see los angeles times alameda corridor transportation authority,supra,th at,d.
we thus hold that a party who partially prevails on an motion must generally be considered a prevailing party unless the results of the motion were so insignificant that the party did not achieve any practical benefit from bringing the motion.the determination whether a party prevailed on an motion lies within the broad discretion of a trial court.see jackson homeowners.monte vista th,d.we review this determination on an abuse of discretion standard.
applying these principles,we conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining defendants were prevailing parties in the underlying litigation.defendants successfully eliminated the trade libel cause of action.although trade libel bears similarity to the defamation claim that remained in the litigation,the two causes of action are not identical.whereas defamation concerns injury to the reputation of a person or business,trade libel involves false disparagement of the quality of goods or services.guess,superior court d.erlich etner,supra,d at.the elimination of the trade libel cause of action thus had the potential to narrow the litigation with respect to the damage issues and the focus of the claimed false statements.additionally,the mann court acknowledgment that an absolute privilege applies to defendants reports of wssi activities to government entities precluded wssi from thereafter pursuing any recovery based on defendants communications with government agencies.mann,supra,th at,d.by bringing the motion,defendants thus successfully narrowed the scope of the lawsuit,limiting discovery,reducing potential recoverable damages,and altering the settlement posture of the case.
in its reply brief,wssi contends that even assuming there was a factual basis for the trial court to have found defendants were prevailing parties,the order must be reversed because the trial court did not exercise its discretion on this issue.wssi argues that the trial court erroneously based its prevailing party finding on this court award of appellate costs to defendants in the prior appeal.mann,supra,th at,d.we agree that the trial court reliance on the appellate cost award in mann was improper.a prevailing party with respect to an appellate cost award is not necessarily the same as a prevailing party under the statute.compare,subd.c with cal.rules of court,rule.moreover,although a prevailing party is generally entitled to costs on appeal,appellate courts have the discretion to deviate from the general prevailing party rule in the interests of justice,and make any award or apportionment of costs that it determines is appropriate.cal.rules of court,rule a see eisenberg et,cal.practice guide civil appeals writs the rutter group,see dobbins hardister d.stuckey stuckey d.because the mann decision was silent on the reason for the cost award,the trial court erred in inferring the award reflected a determination that defendants were the prevailing parties for purposes of the proceedings.
the court reliance on the appellate cost award,however,was not prejudicial because it was merely an alternate basis for the trial court conclusion on the prevailing party issue.in its written order,the court stated it found defendants were the prevailing parties based on their success in striking the trade libel cause of action.absent a contrary indication,we presume this finding constituted an independent ground for the prevailing party finding.an order is presumed correct all inferences are drawn in favor of the order and error must be affirmatively shown.see howard thrifty drug discount stores cal th,d,corenevsky superior court cal d,denham superior court cal d.
ii.amount of attorney fees 
wssi alternatively contends the court erred in refusing to reduce the claimed attorney fees to reflect that defendants were unsuccessful on three of the challenged causes of action and that these causes of action remained in the litigation after the motion was resolved.
the trial court awarded defendants,which constituted its claimed fees of minus.the court did not explain the basis for this amount or the reduction,except to state that it found the was reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances.the court also expressly declined to apportion the fees between the successful and unsuccessful causes of action because it found the same legal and factual theories were involved on each of the claims.
the california supreme court has upheld the lodestar method for determining the appropriate amount of attorney fees for a prevailing defendant on an motion.ketchum,supra,cal th at,d.under this method,a court assesses attorney fees by first determining the time spent and the reasonable hourly compensation of each attorney.id.at,d.the court next determines whether that lodestar figure should be adjusted based on various relevant factors id.at,d,including a plaintiff limited success in the litigation sokolow county of san mateo d.californians for responsible toxics management kizer d.see also feminist women health center blythe th,d.in determining the lodestar amount,a prevailing party generally may not recover for work on causes of action on which the party was unsuccessful.see computerxpress,supra,th at,d.
defendants do not dispute these general principles,but contend a reduction was inappropriate in this case because the facts and law were essentially the same on the cause of action for which they were successful the trade libel claim and the causes of action on which they did not prevail the defamation and interference claims.they argued below,and the court agreed,that because the legal work on each of the causes of action was overlapping,apportionment was improper because it was not possible to separate the claims.they rely on judicial interpretations of various statutes,in which the courts have held that attorney fees need not be reduced for work on unsuccessful claims if the claims are so intertwined that it would be impracticable,if not impossible,to separate the attorney time into compensable and noncompensable units.bell vista unified school dist.th,d see,reynolds metals alperson cal d,akins enterprise th,d.
although we recognize that courts have frequently adhered to the general rule of nonapportionment if claims are overlapping,we are not bound by these decisions because they concern different attorney fee statutes.the issue of the proper amount of fees to be awarded when an attorney time is attributable to recoverable and nonrecoverable claims depends on the legislative intent and policies underlying the specific scheme at issue.see carver chevron,th,d interpreting cartwright act to hold that fees on common issues should not be awarded to defendant on contract claims because the award would undermine legislative intent underlying the cartwright act cassim allstate ins.cal th,d,brandt fees may not be obtained for all attorney services even if claims are overlapping hensley,supra.court should reduce for partial success even where work on claims was overlapping.in examining this issue in the context of section,subdivision c,we find instructive the united states supreme court decision in hensley,supra,d.
the hensley court considered an attorney fees award to the prevailing plaintiffs in a federal civil rights action under which a prevailing plaintiff is presumptively entitled to fees.hensley,supra,at.see.although the plaintiffs prevailed on some claims but not others,the district court awarded the plaintiffs their fees attributable to all claims because the court found overlapping factual and legal issues involved in those claims and a reduction would fail to consider several relevant factors,including the relative importance of various issues and the extent to which plaintiffs prevailed on the issues.id.at.the supreme court held that because of the interrelated nature of the facts and legal theories,the district court did not err in refusing to apportion the fee award mechanically on the basis of respondents success or failure on particular issues.ibid.the court,however,remanded the case for the court to exercise its discretion as to whether the attorney fee award should be reduced to account for the plaintiffs lack of success on several claims.the court explained that w here the plaintiff has failed to prevail on a claim that is distinct in all respects from his successful claims,the hours spent on the unsuccessful claim should be excluded in considering the amount of a reasonable fee.where a lawsuit consists of related claims,a plaintiff who has won substantial relief should not have his attorney fee reduced simply because the district court did not adopt each contention raised.but where the plaintiff achieved only limited success,the district court should award only that amount of fees that is reasonable in relation to the results obtained.id.at,italics added.in conducting this analysis,a court may attempt to identify specific hours that should be eliminated,or it may simply reduce the award to account for the limited success.id.at,italics added.
accordingly,under hensley,a partially prevailing party is not necessarily entitled to all incurred fees even where the work on the su
