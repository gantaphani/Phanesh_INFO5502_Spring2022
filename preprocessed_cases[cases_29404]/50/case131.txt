plaintiff ajaxo ajaxo,sued defendant e trade financial corporation e trade for misappropriation of trade secrets under the california uniform trade secret act,cutsa e trade liability was established in a prior trial where a jury determined that e trade had willfully and maliciously misappropriated ajaxo trade secrets.see ajaxo e trade group th,ajaxo i.this matter comes to us following the second trial in which the single factual dispute before the jury was the extent to which e trade had been unjustly enriched by its misappropriation.
under the cutsa,ajaxo was entitled to recover damages for its actual loss caused by the misappropriation and also for e trade unjust enrichment not taken into account in computing ajaxo actual loss,subd.a.if neither actual loss nor unjust enrichment were provable,the trial court had discretion to order e trade to pay ajaxo a reasonable royalty,subd.b.electing to pursue damages measured only by e trade unjust enrichment,ajaxo submitted evidence intending to show that e trade had been enriched by more than million.the jury rejected the evidence,accepting instead e trade data,which showed that e trade had lost over million.that is,e trade net enrichment was less than zero.but when ajaxo asked the trial court to award reasonable royalties,the court rejected the request,concluding that unjust enrichment was provable,there was just no net amount in terms of actual damages.ajaxo argues on appeal that this was error.we agree.
the jury verdict demonstrates that e trade lost money it was not enriched by its misappropriation of ajaxo trade secrets.unjust enrichment may have been theoretically provable since there was evidence that could have supported a monetary award,but in the end it was not proved.section,subdivision b does not impose a theoretical or speculative standard of provability.the standard is factual.a measure of damages may not be provable for lack of sufficient evidence.or it may not be proved,as happened here,where the jury concludes that the defendant did not profit from its wrongdoing.either way,it is not provable for purposes of section,subdivision b.
ajaxo raises several additional arguments pertaining to the trial court pretrial rulings.we reject each of those.we shall reverse the judgment and remand the matter for further proceedings as described below.
factual background 
in september,e trade,an financial services company,entered into a nondisclosure agreement nda with ajaxo by which e trade agreed to maintain the confidence of information it received while evaluating ajaxo wireless software.ajaxo i,supra,th at.at the time,e trade clients could trade stocks via the internet but could not use wireless handheld devices to do so.e trade was looking for a partner with which it could develop a wireless stock trading capability.id.at.ajaxo offered to license its product to e trade for.id.at.e trade made a counter offer but ultimately withdrew it,claiming that ajaxo was too small to be an e trade partner.id.at.
in december,e trade selected everypath everypath,as its wireless vendor,even though everypath did not then have a suitable wireless product.within a couple of months,however,everypath raised sufficient venture capital to finance its development of the wireless technology e trade was looking for.in march,e trade and everypath entered into a service provider agreement pursuant to which everypath was to provide e trade with wireless trading capability.ajaxo i,supra,th at.
evidence produced at the first trial showed that e trade was connected to everypath both financially and through its personnel.everypath had obtained funding from a venture capital fund managed by arrowpath ventures llc,which employed former e trade employees.in addition,e trade had contributed percent of the capital in the venture capital fund,giving e trade an indirect financial stake in everypath.ajaxo i,supra,th at.
ajaxo soon suspected that everypath development of the wireless trading technology had been facilitated by e trade misappropriation of trade secrets that ajaxo had communicated to e trade under the nda.ajaxo believed that e trade had disclosed the trade secrets to everypath and that everypath,with knowledge of the illegitimate source of the information,used them to develop the technology it sold back to e trade.
procedural background 
ajaxo sued both e trade and everypath,alleging a cause of action for breach of contract against e trade and a cutsa cause of action against both defendants.ajaxo i,supra,th at.prior to the first trial,ajaxo intended to put on evidence of both its actual losses and defendants unjust enrichment resulting from the misappropriation.ajaxo had retained an expert witness who was prepared to testify that ajaxo lost profits amounted to more than million.id.at.ajaxo withdrew the expert after e trade moved to exclude the expert testimony but before the trial court ruled upon e trade motion.at trial,ajaxo relied solely upon an unjust enrichment measure of damages.
at the close of ajaxo case in chief in the first trial,the trial court partially granted defendants motion for nonsuit on the cutsa cause of action,holding that ajaxo had not submitted sufficient evidence of damages for misappropriation as measured by e trade unjust enrichment.the court did allow the jury to determine liability under the cutsa,recognizing that ajaxo might be entitled to reasonable royalties if defendants had indeed misappropriated the trade secrets.ajaxo i,supra,th at.the jury found that e trade had breached the nda and awarded ajaxo million for that claim ibid.the jury also found that both defendants had willfully and maliciously misappropriated the trade secrets but it did not make a monetary award because it had not been asked to do so.id.at.
in its first appeal,ajaxo argued that the trial court had erred by taking the damages issue from the jury.this court agreed.we noted that ajaxo had based its contract cause of action upon the same facts it used to prove the misappropriation claim the two causes of action were inextricably linked.ajaxo i,supra,th at.further,the only theory of recovery ajaxo had pursued on its claim for breach of contract was the theory of unjust enrichment.the same evidence ajaxo had presented to prove its contract damages would have been sufficient to prove unjust enrichment resulting from e trade misappropriation.there was also evidence upon which the jury could have found everypath to have been unjustly enriched.id.at.ajaxo i concluded,therefore,that the trial court had erred in finding insufficient evidence of defendants unjust enrichment resulting from the misappropriation and remanded for a new trial on that issue.ibid.the million judgment in favor of ajaxo on the contract cause of action was unaffected by our decision in ajaxo 
the second trial 
by the time of the second trial,everypath was out of business and had made an assignment for the benefit of its creditors.everypath turned out to be a complete,go to zero,complete loss.the trial court bifurcated the case against everypath so that the matter proceeded against e trade only.in other pretrial rulings the trial court excluded evidence pertaining to the financing of everypath and any evidence relating to the supposed joint liability of e trade and everypath.the court also refused to admit copies of e trade statements filed with the securities and exchange commission we shall describe these rulings in more detail in the discussion below.
at trial,ajaxo evidence of e trade unjust enrichment included evidence of the price at which it had offered to license its product and the price e trade suggested in response.it also included the testimony of ajaxo expert,walter bratic,who opined that e trade misappropriation was responsible for percent of the profit generated by all e trade clients who opened accounts from september through december,the period of time during which e trade had presumably been using the misappropriated trade secrets.bratic assumed that because wireless trading was one of the four primary business strategies e trade had identified in its filings,one fourth of all new accounts opened during the relevant time period had been opened because e trade was able to offer wireless trading.one fourth of the profit generated from all new accounts opened during the pertinent time period was about million.bratic did not consider e trade actual profits from wireless trading or the fact that no more than one half of percent of e trade clients ever traded on wireless devices.at the close of ajaxo case in chief,e trade moved for nonsuit.the trial court denied the motion,concluding that there was enough evidence to go to the jury on the issue of e trade unjust enrichment.
e trade then produced evidence to show that its wireless trading strategy had been less successful than anticipated.the market for wireless trading peaked in march and declined from there.joseph raymond,an e trade employee,prepared a summary of revenue and expenses related to wireless trading for the period during which e trade had been using the misappropriated trade secrets.the summary exhibit showed that e trade wireless trading transactional costs,team costs labor devoted to the wireless project,and monthly service provider fees paid to everypath,exceeded wireless trading commissions every quarter,resulting in a loss of about million.relying upon e trade quarterly financial statements,everypath invoices,and team costs listed in exhibit,e trade expert terry lloyd opined that e trade had lost approximately million.an alternate calculation resulted in a net loss of about million.wireless trading did pan out.
the jury was instructed that the amount of e trade unjust enrichment was the value of e trade benefit that would not have been achieved except for its misappropriation less the amount of e trade reasonable expenses the jury found that the value of the benefit conferred upon e trade by the misappropriation was and that e trade reasonable expenses were,resulting in a net loss of approximately million.
following the verdict,ajaxo asked the trial court to make an award of reasonable royalties under section,subdivision b,which,as we noted above,permits such an award if neither actual loss nor unjust enrichment is provable.e trade opposed the request,arguing that both actual losses and unjust enrichment were provable because there was evidence in the record to support either measure of damages.the trial court found that unjust enrichment was provable because the jury found that ajaxo had proven unjust enrichment damages against e trade with no net amount in terms of actual damages.based upon this finding,the trial court denied ajaxo request for reasonable royalties and did not reach the question whether actual losses were provable.the trial court rejected ajaxo requests for exemplary damages and for an injunction and denied its new trial motion.judgment was entered in favor of e trade.this timely appeal followed.
contentions 
ajaxo raises three issues on appeal.first,ajaxo argues that the trial court erred in excluding evidence of investments in everypath,which,ajaxo claims,would have supported its unjust enrichment claim against e trade.second,ajaxo maintains that the trial court erred in excluding e trade forms because they would have been useful to impeach e trade revenue calculations.finally,ajaxo contends that the trial court had discretion to award reasonable royalties under section,subdivision b because the verdict demonstrated that unjust enrichment is not provable.
discussion 
everypath investment evidence 
prior to trial,e trade moved to limit the opinions of ajaxo damages expert,walter bratic.bratic had offered three alternative theories of unjust enrichment.in addition to his primary theory based upon the percentage of new clients acquired during the pertinent time period,bratic posited that e trade had been benefitted by everypath receipt of million in venture funding just a few months after e trade first disclosed the trade secrets to everypath.bratic second alternative theory was that e trade had been unjustly enriched by million,the market value bratic assigned to ajaxo trade secret based upon the increased valuation of everypath.
the trial court granted e trade motions in limine to exclude bratic two alternative theories,explaining that the investment in everypath was not relevant to determining the unjust enrichment of e trade.i just do see the connection.i think it will confuse the jury.there would be large numbers out there that are just unrelated to the issue of how much e trade benefitted.it may be perfectly admissible as to everypath,but not as to e trade.for the same reasons,the court also excluded an arrowpath web page,which stated that everypath codevelopment of the wireless technology with e trade had led directly to a successful financing of million,and any evidence of public offerings and other financing of everypath.ajaxo maintains that the evidence was relevant.
we review the trial court ruling for abuse of discretion.specifically,the appellate court scrutinizes a decision on a motion to bar the introduction of evidence as irrelevant for such abuse it does so because it so sic examines the underlying determination whether the evidence is indeed irrelevant.people alvarez cal th.
to be relevant,evidence of financial investments in everypath had to have some tendency in reason to prove the amount by which e trade had been unjustly enriched by its misappropriation of ajaxo trade secret.a defendant unjust enrichment is typically measured by the defendant profits flowing from the misappropriation.a defendant profits often represent profits the plaintiff would otherwise have earned.rest d restitution tent.draft,com.where the plaintiff loss does not correlate directly with the misappropriator benefit,as is the case here,the problem becomes more complex.there is no standard formula to measure it.a defendant unjust enrichment might be calculated based upon cost savings or increased productivity resulting from use of the secret.bourns,raychem cir.increased market share is another way to measure the benefit to the defendant.medical staffing network,ridgway.recovery is not prohibited just because the benefit can not be precisely measured.but like any other pecuniary remedy,there must be some reasonable basis for the computation.acree general motors acceptance th.
another crucial point is that unjust enrichment,as the phrase is used here,is,in effect,synonymous with restitution.dinosaur development,white d.the phrase unjust enrichment is used in law to characterize the result or effect of a failure to make restitution of or for property or benefits received under such circumstances as to give rise to a legal or equitable obligation to account therefor.id.at,italics added,quoting lucky auto supply turner d.
the increase in everypath capitalization is not a reasonable basis upon which to compute e trade unjust enrichment because it does not represent property or benefits received by e trade.the capitalization of everypath may have indirectly benefitted e trade because it allowed everypath to develop the wireless trading technology that e trade ultimately used to offer wireless trading to its customers.but that benefit is measured by the profit e trade earned by using the wireless technology,evidence of which was introduced at trial.
the only other way e trade could have benefitted from the investment in everypath was through e trade stake in the arrowpath venture capital fund.e trade undoubtedly hoped to realize some return on that investment.if it had,e trade might be liable in restitution to ajaxo.but ajaxo could not show that e trade ever realized any return on that investment at all.
ajaxo argues that the increased capitalization of everypath established the market value of the secrets e trade misappropriated.in support,ajaxo cites the restatement of restitution,section,which provides,where a person is entitled to a money judgment against another because by fraud,duress or other consciously tortious conduct the other has acquired,retained or disposed of his property,the measure of recovery for the benefit received by the other is the value of the property at the time of its improper acquisition,retention or disposition this section of the restatement is inapplicable to the present situation.e trade did not obtain exclusive possession of the secrets so that it was not benefitted to the extent of their full market value.as comment a to section of the restatement of restitution makes clear,the section applies only when the plaintiff has been deprived of title to or possession of the property.here,ajaxo was not deprived of its secrets.other than disclosing them to everypath,e trade did not publish the secrets.ajaxo retained possession of the secrets and could still license its technology to others.under the common law,where the plaintiff retains the use of the secret,as here,and where there has been no effective disclosure of the secret through publication the total value of the secret to the plaintiff is an inappropriate measure of damages for misappropriation.university computing cir,fn.omitted university computing.
we recognize that in ajaxo i,we held that evidence of investments in everypath was relevant to the issue of e trade liability.see ajaxo i,supra,th at.but liability was not at issue in the proceedings presently on review.it is for that reason we also reject ajaxo suggestion that the investment evidence is relevant because e trade and everypath are jointly liable.the remittitur called for a retrial on the issue of damages only.prior to the second trial,the trial court denied ajaxo motion to establish that e trade was jointly and severally liable for any unjust enrichment enjoyed by everypath and it granted e trade motion to exclude evidence of joint and several liability.accordingly,evidence of the investment capital everypath received as a result of the misappropriation was not relevant to any disputed issue of fact in the second trial,so the trial court did not err in excluding it.
ajaxo next argues that the trial court abused its discretion in excluding e trade forms filed during the time e trade was making use of the trade secrets.the trial court denied ajaxo pretrial request for judicial notice of the forms and excluded the documents from evidence.later in the trial,after considering whether to admit portions of the statements,the trial court stood by its earlier ruling,stating,i not going to allow the in,any part of it.i going to go back to my original ruling.these documents are complex.they confusing.i think to give context you have to give them more than they possibly need.the experts relied on them.they testified from them.so for the record,that evidence that you need,if you talking about four pillars of whatever it is,it all here anyway.so i going to deny that.
ajaxo now argues that the documents are relevant to the credibility of e trade financial evidence.in particular,the form for shows e trade commission revenues for as,whereas the corresponding figure reported in exhibit is approximately million less than that.ajaxo argues that it could have used this discrepancy to attack the figures in exhibit,which is the evidence upon which the jury apparently relied.ajaxo concedes that it did not seek to admit the evidence for the purpose of impeachment and did not raise that basis for its admissibility until it made its motion for new trial.accordingly,the argument necessarily relates to the trial court decision denying that motion.when we review an order denying a new trial we review the entire record,including the evidence,and make an independent determination as to whether the claimed error was prejudicial.city of los angeles decker cal d.having reviewed the record,we detect no prejudice here.
in excluding the forms,the trial court implicitly relied upon evidence code section,which permits the exclusion of relevant evidence where its probative value is substantially outweighed by the risk that admitting the evidence will necessitate undue consumption of time or create substantial danger of undue prejudice,of confusing the issues,or of misleading the jury.it is not reasonably likely that,had ajaxo sought to admit the forms for impeachment,the trial court would have ruled any differently than it did initially.the forms were complex and confusing and contained a plethora of irrelevant data that could have prejudiced the jury against e trade based solely upon its multimillion dollar revenue stream.using the forms for impeachment would not have changed that.moreover,if the forms had been admitted to point out the million discrepancy,e trade would almost certainly have offered some explanation for the difference,whether by showing how the figures were calculated or even by admitting some arithmetic error.whatever the explanation,it would just have added to the confusion.
the thrust of ajaxo argument is that if the jury had been alerted to the fact that exhibit underreported revenue by million it might have rejected the rest of the data contained in exhibit.but exclusion of the documents did not prevent ajaxo from highlighting that discrepancy.ajaxo could have pointed out the inconsistency in its examination of its own expert,who relied upon the forms in forming his opinions.moreover,even if ajaxo had highlighted the discrepancy,a different result is not reasonably probable.although million is a lot of money,it is less than percent of the annual revenue reported in any of the documents.a percent adjustment of each of the figures in exhibit would still result in a net profit from wireless trading of significantly less than zero.in short,ajaxo was not unfairly prejudiced by exclusion of the forms.
reasonable royalties 
introduction 
ajaxo final argument is that the trial court erred in refusing to consider an award of reasonable royalties.a reasonable royalty is a fee imposed upon a defendant for his or her use of a misappropriated trade secret.under the cutsa,reasonable royalties are allowed in two situations.in the context of injunctive relief reasonable royalties may be imposed where it would be unreasonable to enjoin future use of a misappropriated trade secret,subd.b.when calculating a monetary remedy for the past use of a misappropriated trade secret,a court may order reasonable royalties i f neither damages for actual loss nor unjust enrichment caused by misappropriation are provable,subd.b.ajaxo argument relates to the latter situation.in that situation a reasonable royalty is an attempt to measure a hypothetically agreed value of what the defendant wrongfully obtained from the plaintiff.by means of a suppositious meeting between the parties,the court calculates what the parties would have agreed to as a fair licensing price at the time that the misappropriation occurred.vermont microsystems,autodesk,cir,vermont microsystems and see university computing,supra,at.
it is settled that,in fashioning a pecuniary remedy under the cutsa for past use of a misappropriated trade secret,the trial court may order a reasonable royalty only where neither actual damages to the holder of the trade secret nor unjust enrichment to the user is provable.morlife,perry th.california law differs on this point from both the uniform act and federal patent law,neither of which require s actual damages and unjust enrichment to be unprovable before a reasonable royalty may be imposed.cacique,robert reiser,cir,see west laws ann.trade secrets act,a,reasonable royalties available i n lieu of damages measured by any other methods claimant is entitled to compensation for patent infringement,in no event less than a reasonable royalty.
in the present case,ajaxo did not prove either its actual loss or e trade unjust enrichment.nevertheless,the trial court held that unjust enrichment was provable and rejected ajaxo request for reasonable royalties on that basis.for reasons we shall explain,this was error.
unjust enrichment 
ajaxo argues that unjust enrichment was not provable because,after all,the jury verdict shows that e trade was not enriched.e trade maintains that,since ajaxo had sufficient evidence of unjust enrichment to support a monetary award had the jury chosen to believe it,unjust enrichment was provable,it was just not proved.in effect,e trade position is that to be unprovable within the meaning of section,subdivision b,a measure of damages must fail as a matter of law,as opposed to the situation here,where the measure was not proved as a matter of fact.
whether e trade unjust enrichment was provable within the meaning of section,subdivision b depends upon how we interpret that statutory provision.this is a purely legal question calling for the independent standard of review.burden snowden cal th.in undertaking that review,o ur fundamental task is to ascertain the intent of the lawmakers.citation.if there is no ambiguity in the language of the statute,then the plain meaning of the language governs.citation.if the statutory language permits more than one reasonable interpretation,we may consider various extrinsic aids,including examination of the evils to be remedied and the legislative scheme encompassing the statute in question.citations.we select the interpretation that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the legislature,with a view toward promoting,rather than defeating,the general purpose of the statute and avoiding an interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences.cypress semiconductor superior court th.
it is certainly true that where the evidence of a measure of damages is insufficient as a matter of law that measure of damages is not provable.this is illustrated by the two cases ajaxo cites.in vermont microsystems,supra,the evidence was too imprecise and speculative to support a finding of either the plaintiff actual losses or the defendant unjust enrichment so,reasonable royalties were allowable under the cutsa.in micro intern.monolithic power systems d,the jury found that the plaintiff was entitled to recover for one misappropriated secret when the plaintiff evidence was based upon the defendant misappropriation of secrets.since there was no reasonable basis upon which the jury could have determined what portion of the defendant enrichment was related to only one secret,unjust enrichment was not provable.id.at.because neither unjust enrichment nor damages had been proven,the trial court granted the plaintiff request for a reasonable royalty.ibid.
in both of the foregoing cases,the plaintiff evidence of its actual loss and the defendant unjust enrichment was insufficient as a matter of law.indeed,there are undoubtedly many cases in which a defendant has either not utilized the stolen secret commercially or has not benefitted in any way that can be measured in monetary terms.in those cases,the plaintiff would be unable to present any sufficient evidence to support a monetary award measured by the defendant unjust enrichment.likewise,a plaintiff actual losses may be speculative or nonexistent.in those types of cases,whether the parties stipulate to the lack of proof or a court rules that the evidence is insufficient,the two measures of damages would not be provable.this is not one of those cases,however,because ajaxo did have sufficient evidence as demonstrated by our decision in ajaxo i and by the fact that ajaxo evidence withstood e trade nonsuit motion in the second trial.but the jury ultimately rejected ajaxo evidence and found instead that e trade made no profit.thus,the question is whether unjust enrichment is provable within the meaning of section,subdivision b,where the evidence of unjust enrichment is sufficient as a matter of law but the jury rejects it as a matter of fact.finding some ambiguity in the plain language of the statute,we look to the legislative history.
the cutsa was derived from the uniform act cypress semiconductor superior court,supra,th at,fn.and,like the uniform act,was intended to codify the common law west laws,supra,trade secrets act,prefatory note,in,when the cutsa was enacted stats,ch.reg.sess,the common law provided that damages for misappropriation could be measured by the plaintiff loss,the defendant unjust enrichment,or by a reasonable royalty set by the trial court.as a general rule,the reasonable royalty measure of damages was only appropriate where the defendant has made no actual profits and the plaintiff is unable to prove a specific loss.jet spray cooler,crampton,fn,citing,among others,university computing,supra,at.in,however,the uniform act did not have any provision allowing for damages measured by a reasonable royalty west laws,supra,trade secrets act,which author roger milgrim characterized in his initial observations as a serious oversight.milgrim on trade secrets definitional aspects,a,fn.citing jet spray cooler,milgrim noted that under the common law,absent provable damages or defendant profits,citation,courts typically award reasonable royalty.milgrim on trade secrets,supra,at,fn.nothing in the cases or the commentaries on the common law suggests that a defendant lack of profit be determined as a matter of law,rather than as a matter of disputed fact.
since the uniform act did not contain a reasonable royalty provision at the time the california legislature drafted the cutsa,our legislature had to draft its own version.the history of assembly bill,by which the cutsa was enacted,does not elaborate on the issue the reasonable royalty provision was added in an early amendment,phrased exactly as it is currently.see,assem.bill,as amended,leg.intent service.other legislative materials shed no light upon the problem before us.see,caucus,analysis assem.bill,leg.intent.service,stating that reasonable royalties would be available if damages or unjust enrichment could not be proved.since the cutsa was intended to codify the common law,it is reasonable to assume that the legislature intended the reasonable royalty amendment to track the common law practice of allowing for reasonable royalties when the plaintiff could not prove any loss and the defendant made no actual profits.there is no reason to believe that the legislature intended the hairsplitting distinction e trade urges here.
the public policies underlying trade secret laws convince us that e trade construction is untenable.trade secret laws in general are designed to promote the sharing of knowledge and to reward innovation.kewanee oil bicron.while all persons have the right to engage in businesses and occupations of their choosing,also fundamental to the preservation of our free market economic system is the concomitant right to have the ingenuity and industry one invests in the success of the business or occupation protected from the gratuitous use of that by others.morlife,perry,supra,th at.stated most broadly,the goal of trade secrets law is to maintain important standards of commercial ethics.kewanee oil bicron,supra,at dvd copy control,bunner cal th.
it would hardly protect or reward innovation if we were to adopt e trade interpretation of section,subdivision b.in university computing,supra,a case decided under the common law,the defendant had stolen a computerized inventory system,intending to sell the system to its own customers,but had not sold the system to anyone before the foul play was discovered.id.at.in discussing the proper measure of damages,the appellate court noted that where the defendant does not make any profit,reasonable royalties could be awarded.the rationale for this seems clearly to be that the risk of defendants venture,using the misappropriated secret,should not be placed on the injured plaintiff,but rather the defendants must bear the risk of failure themselves.id.at.this rationale applies whether the defendant loss is determined as a matter of law or as a matter of disputed fact.
entirely absent from e trade discussion is the fact that a defendant may achieve any number of nonpecuniary benefits by stealing a trade secret.for example,the stolen secrets might reveal that a particular avenue of inquiry would be unsuccessful,thereby saving the defendant significant research and development efforts.but as e trade would have it,even where liability is proved and the defendant has enjoyed some nonpecuniary benefit as a result of the theft,if a plaintiff offers any sufficient evidence to show the defendant was unjustly enriched and the jury rejects the evidence,the trial court would have no discretion to award any monetary relief at all.the defendant would have benefitted by the plaintiff efforts and ingenuity but the plaintiff could not be compensated.this would be inconsistent with t
