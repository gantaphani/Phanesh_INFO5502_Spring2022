the circuit court of cook county certified the following question of law 
in determining whether good cause exists under supreme court rule for the grant of an extension of time to remedy an unintentional noncompliance with a procedural requirement,may the court take into consideration facts and circumstances of record that go beyond the reason for noncompliance 
the appellate court answered this question in the affirmative.d.we granted leave to appeal.for the reasons that follow,we disagree with the appellate court.we hold that in determining whether good cause exists under rule to support an extension of time allowing a party to comply with a deadline set forth in our rules,the circuit court may not take into consideration facts and circumstances in the case that go beyond the reason for noncompliance.accordingly,we reverse the judgment of the appellate court and remand this cause to the circuit court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
this interlocutory appeal has its genesis in a february complaint filed in the circuit court of cook county by plaintiff,vision point of sale,against defendants legacy incorporated legacy and ginger haas.both plaintiff and legacy are engaged in the sale and refurbishing of used equipment and therefore are in direct competition for customers.in its complaint,plaintiff alleged that it had hired haas in january to serve as the executive secretary to plaintiff chief executive officer frank muscarello.according to plaintiff complaint,haas had access to plaintiff confidential and proprietary information,including its customer lists and databases,information containing private and cellular telephone numbers and email addresses,and customer order,pricing and equipment information.the complaint alleged that haas resigned from plaintiff and began employment immediately thereafter with legacy,taking plaintiff confidential and proprietary information with her.plaintiff further alleged that haas stole such information at the direction or with the encouragement of legacy,with the ultimate intent of soliciting plaintiff customers.
plaintiff complaint sought damages from both haas and legacy for breach of fiduciary duty,tortious interference with plaintiff business relationships,unjust enrichment,and violation of the illinois trade secrets act ilcs et west.plaintiff requested that the court,inter alia,permanently enjoin defendants from using its confidential and proprietary information for the benefit of legacy.
plaintiff also sought a preliminary injunction against defendants,requesting that the circuit court prevent any misappropriation of plaintiff confidential and proprietary customer information.after conducting an evidentiary hearing on plaintiff motion,the circuit court entered a preliminary injunction against defendants to maintain the status quo pending the outcome of plaintiff suit.in addition,the circuit court entered several orders that set forth procedures intended to protect plaintiff confidential information and provided a timetable by which the court expected defendants compliance 
for the next several months,the litigation between the parties focused upon defendants failure to comply with the court preliminary injunction orders.as a result,the circuit court held additional hearings and entered another order detailing with greater specificity the method by which its preliminary injunction order was to be implemented,including an updated timetable for compliance.
during this period,proceedings with respect to plaintiff complaint for a permanent injunction were also moving forward.on december,defendants sent to plaintiff their rule request for admission of facts,which consisted of separate requests for admission.defendants did not file their requests to admit with the clerk of the circuit court of cook county at the time of service,contrary to rule c of the circuit court of cook county cook.cir.c eff.may.plaintiff timely responded to each of defendants requests to admit on january.the final page of plaintiff responses was signed by plaintiff counsel on behalf of plaintiff.on the page immediately following the last page of responses,muscarello signed a verification of the responses,which tracked the language set forth in section of the code of civil procedure ilcs west.
on april,defendants filed their motion to strike plaintiff responses to first set of requests to admit and to deem facts admitted.defendants asserted that because plaintiff responses to the requests to admit were deficient,the responses should be stricken and the facts set forth by defendants in the requests be deemed admitted under supreme court rule.defendants maintained that plaintiff responses were defective because,although they were verified by muscarello in accordance with section of the code of civil procedure ilcs west,the final page of the responses themselves did not contain a signature of plaintiff,but only that of plaintiff attorney.defendants asserted that rule and the appellate court decision in moy ng,d,require that a party must sign the final page of the responses,and that a separate section a party signature on the responses final insufficient.in addition,defendants contended that the responses were deficient in that they violated rule c of the rules of the circuit court of cook county cook.cir.c eff.may,which requires that responses to requests to admit must be filed with the clerk of the circuit court.finally,defendants maintained that plaintiff could not establish good cause for any extension of time to remedy these deficiencies pursuant to supreme court rule.
the circuit court granted defendants motion to strike plaintiff responses to defendants request to admit and to deem those facts admitted.the court found that plaintiff responses were deficient in that they failed to comply with moy and rule c of the circuit court of cook county.at the conclusion of the court ruling,counsel for plaintiff orally moved,pursuant to rule,for leave to allow plaintiff further time to serve and file a set of amended responses,which,in addition to containing the section verification,would also contain the signature of muscarello on the last page of the responses.counsel argued that the good cause required to be shown under rule to support this motion was a reading of section of the code of civil procedure,which appeared to allow the use of a verification in submitting responses to requests to admit.the circuit court denied counsel motion.
after the circuit court ruled on the issue,the litigation between the parties proceeded.the defendants alleged continued failure to comply with the circuit court preliminary injunction rulings served as the basis for several contested motions and additional court hearings.during the course of one of these hearings,the circuit court expressed frustration with respect to what it characterized as defendants settled policy of recalcitrance with regard to their lack of compliance with these earlier rulings.this frustration,coupled with the court view that plaintiff responses to defendants requests to admit were deficient only as a result of a technical and inadvertent failure,caused the circuit court to sua sponte reconsider and vacate its prior ruling granting defendants request to deem facts admitted and refusing to allow plaintiff an extension of time pursuant to rule to serve and file an amended response to the requests to admit.the circuit court now determined that under the totality of circumstances in the case,good cause existed under rule for the time extension requested by plaintiff.
defendants objected to the circuit court ruling allowing plaintiff additional time under rule to amend its responses.defendants argued that the circuit court inquiry in determining whether to grant a time extension pursuant to rule is limited to examining only whether plaintiff established good cause for its noncompliance with the deadline,and that the court had erred in focusing upon defendants own,unrelated conduct.accordingly,defendants moved that the circuit court certify this issue for interlocutory appeal under rule a.the circuit court thereafter certified the question of law previously identified at the outset of this opinion.
the appellate court granted defendants petition for leave to appeal.d.the appellate court held that when deciding whether to grant an extension of time for filing a response to a request to admit facts,the circuit court may consider any facts that help it strike a balance between diligence in litigation and the interests of justice.citation.d at.accordingly,the appellate court further held that a circuit court need not restrict its attention to the causes for the delay in the response to the request to admit in determining whether to grant an extension of time under rule.d at.
this court allowed defendant petition for leave to appeal.
in order to answer the certified question,we must construe rule and,to some extent,rule as well.our rule provides 
the court,for good cause shown on motion after notice to the opposite party,may extend the time for filing any pleading or the doing of any act which is required by the rules to be done within a limited period,either before or after the expiration of the time.
our rule provides,in pertinent part 
a request for admission of fact.a party may serve on any other party a written request for the admission by the latter of the truth of any specified relevant fact set forth in the request.
c admission in the absence of denial.each of the matters of fact of which admission is requested is admitted unless,within days of service thereof,the party to whom the request is directed serves upon the party requesting the admission either a sworn statement denying specifically the matters of which admission is requested or setting forth in detail the reasons why he can not truthfully admit or deny those matters or written objections on the ground that some or all of the requested admissions are privileged or irrelevant or that the request is otherwise improper in whole or in part.if written objections to a part of the request are made,the remainder of the request shall be answered within the period designated in the request.a denial shall fairly meet the substance of the requested admission.if good faith requires that a party deny only a part,or requires qualification,of a matter of which an admission is requested,he shall specify so much of it as is true and deny only the remainder.any objection to a request or to an answer shall be heard by the court upon prompt notice and motion of the party making the request.
it is well settled that our rules are to be construed in the same manner as statutes people norris,in re estate of rennick,see also adams northern illinois gas,setting out rules of construction,and our review is de novo in re storment.
both parties acknowledge that this court last interpreted the requirement contained within rule in bright dicke.the parties disagree,however,on its application to the question presented here.defendants initially contend that since bright,this court has moved away from considering rule requests to admit as part of the discovery process and,for that reason,the circuit court usual discretion is more limited in this context than it is with respect to other discovery tools.in addition,defendants maintain that to the extent that bright is still good law,the appellate court analysis is at odds with it.
plaintiff,on the other hand,argues that the appellate court analysis must be upheld because in the time period since bright,certain other decisions of the appellate court have served to narrowly define the requirement contained in rule when the rule is used to seek an extension of time for compliance with rule.plaintiff suggests that the analysis utilized by the appellate court here properly restores to the circuit court,for purposes of rule and rule,the discretion this court chose to vest in it in bright.
given the parties arguments,it is helpful to begin our analysis with a detailed discussion of this court opinion in bright.there,we answered a question of law certified for interlocutory review pursuant to rule a concerning whether a circuit court has discretion under rule to allow a party to file a late response to a rule request to admit.we held that rule vests the circuit court with discretion to allow a party to serve a response to requests to admit after the expiration of the period specified in rule.bright,at,we explained that because rule requests for admission are essentially a discovery tool bright,at,a contrary holding that a circuit court could not grant parties additional time to respond under rule would not only conflict with the plain language of rule,it would also be inconsistent with our view that circuit courts must be allowed to exercise discretion over the conduct of pretrial discovery.bright,at,citing sohaey van cura.
having construed rule to allow a circuit court discretion to permit a party to file a late response to a rule request to admit,this court then considered,in the interests of judicial economy and the need to reach an equitable result,the propriety of the order that gave rise to the appeal.bright,at.the defendant had originally submitted a procedurally deficient response to the plaintiff requests for admission under rule.subsequently,the defendant moved for leave to file an amended response after the time deadline contained within rule had passed.we noted that,in support of her motion,the defendant 
presented a chronology of events pertaining to her response but offered no explanation,however,as to why the deadline was not met.the defendant position was simply that the court should grant her motion because the requested admissions relate to central issues in the case and allowing her to make an untimely response would not prejudice the plaintiff.bright,at.
the circuit court denied the defendant motion on the basis that good cause had not been shown to justify the grant of an extension of time pursuant to rule.
in upholding the ruling of the circuit court,we emphasized that a circuit court discretion to permit a late response does not come into play under the rule unless the responding party can first show good cause for the extension.bright,at.because the bright defendant had offered no explanation as to why she was unable to comply with the time deadline set forth in rule,we concluded that she failed to satisfy the prerequisite for relief found in rule.bright,at.
we rejected the argument advanced by the defendant that the issue of good cause should be considered only if the nonmovant could show that allowing the late response would result in harm.bright,at.we held that the procedure advocated by the defendant would improperly reverse the burden of proof,and that the party opposing such a motion should be under no obligation to show anything.bright,at.accordingly,we instructed that the mere absence of inconvenience or prejudice to the opposing party is not sufficient to establish good cause under rule.bright,at.we further held that when a circuit court is ruling upon a request for extension pursuant to rule,the general rule pertains the burden of establishing grounds for relief is on the party requesting the additional time and that n onmoving parties such as the plaintiff should not be required to justify application of a rule before it will be given effect.bright,at.accordingly,we held that the circuit court correctly denied the defendant motion for extension pursuant to rule.
bright thus stands for the proposition that,under the plain language of rule,a trial court in its sound discretion may extend the time to allow a party to comply with the requirements of rule after the time deadline for compliance has expired if the delinquent party establishes good cause for its noncompliance.as was noted in bright,the fundamental principles which animate our rule have long been part of our case law circuit courts must be allowed to exercise their sound discretion over the course and conduct of the pretrial discovery process.bright,at,see also sohaey,at.
in light of our holding in bright,we must necessarily reject defendants assertion that we,in our subsequent decision in international,shred pax,distanced ourselves from bright by holding that requests to admit are not part of the discovery process.initially,defendants ignore that immediately after we announced our decision in bright,we amended our rule general discovery provisions which vests trial courts with broad powers to supervise the discovery process in order to prevent abuse.specifically,we amended subsection a of rule to include requests to admit within the definition of discovery methods.a.this amendment clearly reinforced our statement in bright that requests for admission are part of the discovery process.bright,at.
in addition to overlooking our amendment to rule,defendants read far too narrowly.involved a question different from that presented both in bright and in the matter before us whether a party failure to respond to a request for admission pursuant to supreme court rule results in a judicial admission even where the requested admission relates to ultimate facts or to legal conclusions,at.in the course of answering that question,we stated 
although requests to admit are often classified as a discovery device and treated as such in practice bright,at,the purpose of admissions is not to discover facts but rather to establish some of the material facts in a case without the necessity of formal proof at trial.requests to admit are a device by which to separate the wheat from the chaff and are intended to circumscribe contested factual issues in the case so that issues which are disputed might be clearly and succinctly presented to the trier of facts.d,at.
our rulings in bright and were intended to underscore that the concept of discovery is not,a view supported by the fact that several definitions exist for this term.for example,black law dictionary defines discovery as t he act or process of finding or learning something that was previously unknown.black law dictionary ed.defendants appear to rely upon this definition in asserting that requests to admit do not constitute discovery,as they do not serve the purpose of uncovering new and unknown information.however,black also defines discovery as c ompulsory disclosure,at a party request,of information that relates to the litigation,and states that t he primary discovery devices are interrogatories,depositions,requests for admissions,and requests for production.black law dictionary ed.this definition of discovery corresponds with our discussion in wherein we stated that requests to admit are useful to separate the wheat from the chaff with the purpose of narrowing the actual contested issues in the case so that they might be clearly and succinctly presented to the trier of fact,at.this concept is also consistent with our belief that discovery is to be utilized to illuminate the actual issues in the case owen mann,quoting sarver barrett ace hardware,as well as to narrow the issues in order to expeditiously reach a disposition which fairly vindicates the rights of the parties sander dow chemical.in light of the above,we therefore disagree with defendants assertion that rule requests to admit are not discovery.we hold,as we did in bright,that requests for admission constitute discovery.
we next address whether the analysis of the appellate court is,as defendants suggest,at odds with bright.the parties disagree over the scope of the inquiry a circuit court may engage in when determining whether good cause has been established to support a time extension pursuant to rule.in addition,the parties also dispute whether our case law has developed a blanket prohibition against raising certain factors in support of a argument.
plaintiff relies upon the opinion of the appellate court below to support its position that when ruling upon a rule motion to allow an extension of time with respect to deadlines set forth in rule,a circuit court is entitled to consider all of the circumstances of a any unrelated conduct of the opposing party occurring during the determining whether good cause exists to grant an extension of time to the noncompliant party.according to plaintiff,our decision in bright supports this reasoning,as there is no language in that opinion which limits the court examination solely to whether the noncompliant party had good cause for failing to meet the deadline.because plaintiff maintains that a circuit court may consider the totality of the circumstances of the entire case in determining whether good cause has been established,plaintiff concludes that the appellate court correctly answered the certified question in the affirmative.
both plaintiff and the appellate court below,however,overlook the fact that in bright we concluded that it is the party moving for an extension of time pursuant to rule who must bear the burden of establishing good cause for the court to grant the time extension and who must submit to the court clear,objective reasons why it was unable to meet the original deadline and why an extension of time should be granted.for this reason,the appellate court analysis here,which focused on reasons wholly unrelated to why plaintiff failed to meet the deadline in the first place,is at odds with bright.in our view,the assessment of whether a delinquent party has established good cause to allow the circuit court to excuse that party noncompliance with the deadlines set forth in rule may not be so broad as to include the entire totality of the circumstances of the case up to that point,including the unrelated conduct of the nonmoving party.to hold otherwise would transform the rule determination into an inquiry allowing matters irrelevant to the discovery process to improperly permeate the analysis.rather,we believe the better approach is one where the delinquent party presents objective reasons to the court as to why the deadline was not met.
that said,we believe plaintiff contentions regarding the appellate court treatment,of the rule inquiry deserve some consideration.plaintiff suggests that the analysis offered by the appellate court below is the only way to ameliorate the often harsh results stemming from a series of decisions which have created a trap for the unwary by unduly limiting the inquiry contemplated by this court in bright by holding that mistake,inadvertence,or attorney neglect can not constitute the sole basis for a determination.see,hammond sbc communications,sbc,d,robbins allstate insurance,d,larson,d,cothren thompson,d,glasco marony,d.
the appellate court opinion in hammond provides a good example of the reasoning espoused in this line of cases.there,the court identified factors to consider in deciding the propriety of a circuit court ruling on a rule extension.the court first noted that,based upon bright,rule allows a trial court to grant extensions with respect to the deadlines in rule as long as good cause is shown.the court then set forth the test it believed should be used to determine good cause 
that is,the responding party can not rely upon the mere absence of inconvenience or prejudice to the opposing party bright,at,or mistake,inadvertence,or attorney neglect as the sole basis for a determination larson,d at,but must,instead,assert some independent basis for allowing the untimely response bright,at,larson,d at.hammond,d at.
as is evident from this excerpt from hammond,our appellate court over time has melded our narrow holding in the mere absence of inconvenience or prejudice to the nonmoving party alone is insufficient to satisfy the a second,broader,harsher,and apparently inflexible standard that mistake,inadvertence,or attorney neglect on the part of the moving party can never serve as the sole basis for establishing good cause to support an extension pursuant to rule.this,in turn,means that under this line of case law,unless the party can present evidence separate and apart from mistake,inadvertence,or attorney neglect to support an argument that there was good cause for the initial delay in compliance,the extension will not be granted.because rule provides that failing to respond to a request to admit deems the requested facts admitted,at,in most instances this result may prove fatal to the case of the delinquent party 
although we agree with plaintiff that the rule which has developed from this line of cases is unduly harsh,we disagree that the answer is to endorse the analysis proffered by the appellate court below.we initially note that we never held in bright that factors such as mere inadvertence or mistake are insufficient as a matter of law to constitute good cause under rule.as we explained above,bright stands for the proposition that,like in any other motion,the movant in a rule motion bears the burden of sustaining its grounds,and rejected the defendant assertion that as long as the nonmovant was not harmed,a rule motion to extend time should be granted.accordingly,it follows that in bright,we held that issues dealing with the nonmoving as whether the nonmovant was inconvenienced or suffered not the proper inquiry in ruling on a rule motion,and therefore determined that good cause is not synonymous with the nonmovant lack of harm.this holding was meant to underscore our strong rejection of the defendant argument in that case,and the opinion was tailored to address whether the circuit court properly determined that the requirement had been met on those specific facts.we did not the appellate court subsequently there is a blanket rule that mistake,inadvertence,or attorney neglect on the part of the moving party can never form the basis of a argument that a rule time extension should be granted.indeed,these types of reasons properly focus the circuit court inquiry on the conduct of the proper movant.
by grafting this blanket prohibition onto our holding in bright,the appellate court has created what has proved to be an unworkable analytical framework that is unduly severe.as defendants note in their brief,several groups within the legal community have submitted proposals to amend rule in an effort to soften the adverse effects on litigation which have followed in the wake of these appellate court decisions.for example,our examination of the transcript of the public hearings held by our rules committee on this issue reveals that much of the concern stems from the application of the blanket prohibition developed by the appellate prohibition repeatedly characterized as draconian rather than from the actual language in rule.those testifying at the hearing generally agreed that even the best of lawyers may make a technical or inadvertent mistake,and that such conduct should not serve as an automatic basis for denying a motion for extension of time,especially since a failure to respond to a request to admit deems the requested facts admitted.indeed,the case before us is illustrative of the problems both practitioners and jurists have faced with respect to the harsh results often obtained under the appellate court engrafted rule.rather than assisting the circuit court in exercising its sound discretion in determining whether a delinquent party has established good cause to justify an extension pursuant to rule,this rule has improperly limited the discretion of our circuit courts in considering objective evidence which may be relevant to the court decision.we note that there is a broad overall policy goal of resolving cases on the merits rather than on technicalities see,shimanovsky general motors,in resolving discovery disputes,the goal is to insure both discovery and a trial on the merits,and that the line of appellate court cases run directly counter to this principle.
rather than endorse,as plaintiff suggests,the analysis of the appellate court below,we believe the problems identified by plaintiff are best resolved by this court today clarifying that we have never held in this context that mistake,inadvertence,or attorney neglect is automatically excluded from the trial court consideration in determining whether good cause exists to grant an extension of time pursuant to rule.accordingly,those appellate court decisions which have grafted this standard onto the analysis we set forth in bright see,hammond sbc communications,sbc,d,robbins allstate insurance,d,larson,d,cothren thompson,d,glasco marony,d,are overruled.
as a final argument,plaintiff contends that the analysis used by the appellate court below should be upheld on the basis that it ensures that a recalcitrant party will not reap the benefit of its noncompliance with court orders.we are not unsympathetic to the frustration experienced both by the circuit court and by the opposing party if one party in the case engages in recalcitrant behavior.but,we have long held that a court is vested with inherent power to enforce its orders and preserve its dignity by the use of contempt proceedings.people warren,see also in re baker,citing cases.in addition,our rule c c authorizes a trial court to impose a sanction,including dismissal of the cause of action,upon any party who unreasonably refuses to comply with any provisions of this court discovery rules or any order entered pursuant to these rules.shimanovsky,at.we stress,however,that a party recalcitrance in complying with an order of the circuit court is an issue separate and apart from the issue of whether a party has established good cause under rule to request an extension of time to comply with a deadline found within this court rules.
in sum,we answer the certified question by holding that in determining whether good cause exists under rule for the grant of an extension of time to remedy an unintentional noncompliance with a procedural requirement,the circuit court may not take into consideration facts and circumstances of record that go beyond the reason for noncompliance.rather,we reaffirm bright holding that the plain language of rule specifically makes good cause a prerequisite to relief,and that the burden of establishing good cause rests on the party seeking relief under rule.the circuit court has the sound discretion to consider all objective,relevant evidence presented by the delinquent party with respect to why there is good cause for its failure to comply with the original deadline and why an extension of time should now be granted.the circuit court may receive evidence with respect to whether the party original delinquency was caused by mistake,inadvertence,or attorney neglect,but may not engage in an inquiry which considers conduct that is unrelated to the causes of the party original noncompliance.we decline,however,to specifically define what constitutes good cause within this context,as that determination is and rests within the sound discretion of the circuit court.absent an abuse of discretion,the decision of the circuit court on this issue will not be disturbed.see reda advocate health care.
having answered the question of law certified for appeal,we next consider the propriety of the circuit court order that gave rise to these proceedings.as in bright,we here engage in this review in the interests of judicial economy and the need to reach an equitable result.see bright,at.
counsel for plaintiff requested that the circuit court allow plaintiff a extension under rule to prepare an amended set of responses to defendants requests to admit after the circuit court found that the responses submitted by plaintiff were deficient for two separate reasons.as a result of finding plaintiff responses deficient on these two grounds,the circuit court struck plaintiff responses and deemed the facts within defendants requests admitted.we address each of the findings of the circuit court seriatim.
first,the circuit court determined that plaintiff responses were deficient in that the final page of the responses was not signed by plaintiff,even though muscarello,on the very next page,verified the responses by certification under penalty of perjury in accord with section of the code of civil procedure ilcs west.defendants contend that the circuit court correctly ruled that plaintiff responses were deficient because they lacked plaintiff signature on their final page.as they did in the circuit court,defendants premise this argument upon the appellate court decision in moy,wherein the court held that because rule requires response by the parties moy,d at,this means that the party responding to the rule request must sign the answer and provide the statement and that the signed and copy of the answer served on the requesting party must be signed and sworn to by the party.moy,d at.in response,reprising the argum
