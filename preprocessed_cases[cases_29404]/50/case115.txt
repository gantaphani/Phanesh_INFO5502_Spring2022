background 
efi,a delaware corporation with its principal place of business in foster city,california,is a world leader in the area of software and hardware imaging solutions for network printing.efi develops,manufactures,and sells print controllers,which are devices that control printers and copiers.kolbet labs is a nevada corporation.efi believes that coyle,a nevada resident,does business as kolbet labs.both coyle and kolbet labs engage in the research and development of computer software and hardware technology that can be used to more efficiently control digital printers and copiers.
coyle filed united states patent application the application on december,which eventually issued as the patent on january.the subject matter of the application concerned an interface card for coupling a computer to an external device.coyle hired two different california firms to prosecute the application.
in late or early,coyle solicited efi and proposed that efi purchase defendants technology related to an interface card for controlling printers and copiers.thereafter,on or about january,efi and kolbet labs entered into a mutual nondisclosure agreement nda,which coyle signed as owner of kolbet labs.the agreement addressed the treatment of certain confidential information disclosed during the course of discussing a business possibility of mutual interest relating to digital image processing.in the nda,the parties agreed to restrict use of the confidential information to reviewing and discussing such information in order to determine whether to enter into a business relationship with the other party.the nda was to terminate after a year,but the obligations of confidentiality as set forth would be binding on the parties for four years after the termination of the nda.finally,the nda was governed by and construed under the laws of the state of california,without reference to conflicts of laws principles.
after the signing of the nda,defendants solicited efi in california repeatedly,providing information regarding defendants technology to efi.at several different times around may and june,coyle attorney in california,newton lee,sent efi various documents relating to the progress of the application,including copies of selected parts of the application.in december,coyle contacted efi in california again to solicit efi purchase of his technology.on december,two of defendants representatives visited efi facility in california to demonstrate coyle interface card.after the visit,efi informed coyle that it was not interested in purchasing the technology.
in september,coyle informed efi by telephone that the claims of the application had been allowed by the patent and trademark office,alleged that the allowed patent claims covered efi print controllers,and continued to report further new developments in his technology.coyle later that month continued to solicit efi by sending documents identifying the claims that had been allowed and additional information on defendants technology.
around the week of november,coyle made telephone calls to efi in california several times,alleging that efi print controllers infringed the claims of the application.in these phone calls,coyle also alleged that efi print controllers contained trade secret information belonging to coyle kolbet labs,and threatened to sue efi for misappropriation of trade secrets and breach of the nda.coyle thereafter repeatedly threatened litigation throughout the next two weeks.
on december,before the patent issued,efi filed a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief against defendants in the district court.efi complaint alleged that efi did not misappropriate any trade secret information belonging to defendants by sales of its print controllers or otherwise,and efi did not breach any nda with defendants.after the patent issued on january,efi amended its complaint to allege that the claims of the patent were invalid.subject matter jurisdiction over these three claims was alleged to exist pursuant to,and.defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction.
on march,the district court granted defendants motion pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure rule b.applying ninth circuit law,the court held that efi failed to show that defendants had purposefully directed its activities at california,thereby failing to establish that defendants had the minimum contacts in california necessary to justify the exercise of jurisdiction over defendants.efi timely appealed,and we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
ii.discussion 
choice of law and standard of review 
we begin with the question whether the personal jurisdiction analysis in this case is pursuant to federal circuit or regional circuit law.the district court applied ninth circuit law of personal jurisdiction to all three claims in the complaint.the parties concur that the district court erred in doing so,asserting that federal circuit law should apply to all three claims.we disagree with both the district court and the parties in this regard because federal circuit law applies to the patent claim and ninth circuit law applies to the state law claims.
our prior decisions make clear that where the personal jurisdictional inquiry is intimately involved with the substance of the patent laws,we apply federal circuit law.akro luker.we thus apply federal circuit law to the patent invalidity claim presented,even in the context presented here,where defendants in the declaratory judgment are the patentees.see id.the district court therefore erred to the extent that it applied ninth circuit law on personal jurisdiction to the patent invalidity claim.however,the declaratory claims of of trade secrets and of contract do not present questions that are intimately involved with the substance of the patent laws.see amana refrigeration,quadlux,analyzing personal jurisdiction question over defendant as to the state law trade libel and defamation claims under regional circuit law.
these claims therefore are governed not by federal circuit but regional circuit law,here that of the ninth circuit 
where the facts upon which the jurisdictional inquiry turns are undisputed,both the ninth and federal circuits review de novo whether a district court has personal jurisdiction over a defendant.akro,at further citations omitted sher johnson,cir.this circuit and the ninth circuit also agree that where the district court disposition as to the personal jurisdictional question is based on affidavits and other written materials in the absence of an evidentiary hearing,a plaintiff need only to make a prima facie showing that defendants are subject to personal jurisdiction.deprenyl animal health,of toronto innovations,data disc.tech,cir.in the procedural posture of a motion to dismiss,a district court must accept the uncontroverted allegations in the plaintiff complaint as true and resolve any factual conflicts in the affidavits in the plaintiff favor.deprenyl,at bancroft masters,augusta,cir.
specific jurisdiction 
efi does not assert general jurisdiction in this case.under general jurisdiction,the exercise of jurisdiction is proper where the defendant has continuous and systematic contacts,helicopteros nacionales de colombia,hall,d,with the forum state,even if those contacts are not related to the cause of action.rather,efi seeks specific jurisdiction over defendants 
determining whether specific personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant is proper entails two inquiries whether a forum state statute permits service of process,and whether the assertion of jurisdiction would be inconsistent with due process.inamed kuzmak,citing genetic implant,citing burger king rudzewicz,d sher,at.in this case,california statute permits service of process to the limits of the due process clauses of the federal constitution.see cal.civ.west,westlaw through ch.of reg.sess.urgency legislation,ch.of.urgency legislation,ch.of.a court of this state may exercise jurisdiction on any basis not inconsistent with the constitution of this state or of the united states.data disc,at stating that california statute is with the outer limits of due process under the state and federal constitutions,as those limits have been defined by the united states supreme court further citations omitted.therefore,the personal jurisdiction analysis in this case narrows to one inquiry whether jurisdiction comports with due process.
under the governing framework of personal jurisdiction,as developed in the supreme court jurisprudence the exercise of jurisdiction over nonresident defendants of a forum state is not inconsistent with due process if the nonresident defendants have certain minimum contacts with the forum such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.int l shoe washington,at.quoting milliken meyer.in general,there must be some act by which defendants purposefully avail themselves of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum state,thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.burger king,at.the contacts made by defendants must therefore by their actions create a substantial connection to the forum defendants have deliberately engaged in significant activities within a state or have created continuing obligations between themselves and residents of the proximately result from the actions by the defendant s themselves,such that it is presumptively not unreasonable to require defendants to submit to the burdens of litigation in that forum as well.id.at.further citations and quotations omitted.
patent invalidity claim 
as discussed supra part,federal circuit law applies to the question of whether the district court properly could exercise personal jurisdiction over defendants as to the patent invalidity claim.this court has adopted a test embodying the supreme court jurisprudence on specific personal jurisdiction.to determine whether jurisdiction over an defendant comports with due process,we look to whether the defendant purposefully directed its activities at residents of the forum state,the claim arises out of or relates to the defendant activities with the forum state,and assertion of personal jurisdiction is reasonable and fair.inamed,at citing akro,at.the first two factors correspond to the minimum contacts prong of the international shoe analysis,and the third factor with the fair play and substantial justice prong.id.citing akro,at.while the plaintiff bears the burden to establish minimum contacts,upon this showing,defendants must prove that the exercise of jurisdiction is unreasonable.id.citing akro,at.
purposefully directed 
we first conclude that defendants contacts were purposefully directed at california.first,coyle repeatedly threatened efi over the telephone in november.we have held that mere threats of infringement directed at the forum state are not sufficient to satisfy due process requirements when exercising jurisdiction over an patentee.red wing shoe,holding that three letters alone do not suffice to create personal jurisdiction.rather,other activities distinct from threats of infringement are required for a patentee to be subject to personal jurisdiction in the forum.silent drive,strong,citing inamed,at quoting genetic implant,at.we thus consider other relevant contacts with california demonstrating that defendants purposefully directed their activities to california.first,while the patent was being prosecuted on coyle behalf,coyle hired a california attorney,newton lee,who contacted efi at various times to report on the progress of the pending application.second,coyle telephoned efi in california at various times between approximately late or early and fall of regarding the subject matter of the technology covered by the patent application.coyle communications are significant in the personal jurisdiction calculus even though coyle was not physically present in california when he made these communications.see burger king,at.i t is an inescapable fact of modern commercial life that a substantial amount of business is transacted solely by mail and wire communications across state lines,thus obviating the need for physical presence within a state in which business is conducted.third,two representatives of defendants visited efi facility in california for the purpose of demonstrating the technology underlying what later issued as the patent.far from being random,fortuitous,or attenuated,id.at,the totality of these contacts sufficiently make out efi prima facie case that defendants,by engag ing in significant activities in california,id.at,purposefully directed their activities to california.
arises out of or relates to 
we next examine whether efi declaratory claim of patent invalidity arises out of or is related to defendants alleged contacts with california.see akro,at.as related supra,part,such contacts include the visit of defendants representatives to demonstrate the technology that formed the subject matter of the patent,and various communications from coyle and his attorney lee to efi concerning the underlying technology of the patent.these contacts with california made by coyle and kolbet labs clearly arise out of or are related to efi claim that the patent is invalid.thus,we conclude that efi has met its prima facie burden of establishing defendants minimum contacts.
reasonable and fair 
once the plaintiff has shown that there are sufficient minimum contacts to satisfy due process,it becomes defendants burden to present a compelling case that the presence of some other considerations would render jurisdiction unreasonable.burger king,at.the reasonableness inquiry encompasses factors including the burden on the defendant,the interests of the forum state,the plaintiff interest in obtaining relief,the interstate judicial system interest in obtaining the most efficient resolution of controversies,and the shared interest of the several states in furthering fundamental substantive social policies.inamed,at,citing asahi metal indus.of,d.here,defendants are unable to demonstrate that it would be unreasonable for the district court to exercise jurisdiction over them.first,it would not impose much of a geographic burden for nevada defendants to litigate in california.second,california has a substantial interest in protecting its residents from unwarranted claims of patent infringement.see deprenyl,at.third,efi also has an undisputed interest in protecting itself from patent infringement.fourth,concerning the interstate judicial system interest in obtaining efficient resolution of disputes,we recognize that coyle has filed a complaint against efi in the district court for the district of nevada alleging,among other things,antitrust violations,patent infringement,and breach of contract.j l,llc elecs.for imaging,no.filed.however,the nevada case can be consolidated with the current action.finally,we see no conflict between the interests of california and nevada in furthering their own respective substantive laws,as the same body of federal patent law would govern the patent invalidity claim irrespective of the forum.
in view of the above,defendants arguments fail to convince the court that this is one of the rare situations in which sufficient minimum contacts exist but where the exercise of jurisdiction would be unreasonable.see beverly hills fan royal sovereign,citing burger king,at.
state law claims 
efi has also asserted two state law claims of of contract and of trade secrets.we apply ninth circuit law in determining whether personal jurisdiction over d
