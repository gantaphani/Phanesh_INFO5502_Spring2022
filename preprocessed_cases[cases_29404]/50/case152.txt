in this appeal we conclude that a collection of state farm insurance companies state farm breached an agreement with their independent contractor agents the agents by imposing trade secret and noncompetition restrictions on certain employees of the agents.consequently,we reverse the judgment in which the trial court refused to grant the agents declaratory and injunctive relief in these respects,and we direct that such relief be granted.
background 
state farm solicits and services its products through a nationwide network of agents,including the agents who comprise the appellants here.
state farm and the agents operate pursuant to similar or forms of a state farm agent agreement collectively.under the,state farm agents are independent contractor s for all purposes.as such they have full control of their daily activities,with the right to exercise independent judgment as to time,place,and manner of soliciting insurance,servicing policyholders,and otherwise carrying out the provisions of the.
pursuant to section i l of the,state farm retains the right to prescribe all policy forms and provisions premiums,fees,and charges for insurance and rules governing the binding,acceptance,renewal,rejection,or cancellation of risks,and adjustment and payment of losses.
the also states that information regarding the names,addresses,and ages of state farm policyholders,the description and location of insured property,and the expiration or renewal dates of state farm insurance come into an agent possession during an agreement with state trade secrets that state farm wholly owns.furthermore,the specifies that,for one year following its termination,an agent may not induce or advise any state farm policyholder credited to his or her account at termination to lapse,surrender,or cancel coverage,and may not solicit any such policyholder to buy any competitive coverage.
finally,the specifies that it constitutes the complete agreement between state farm and its agent,and any agreement changes must be in writing and accepted by both 
as the demands placed on the insurance industry increased over time,state farm agents began hiring employees to meet those demands.prior to,state farm authorized only its agents to bind state farm to insurance obligations or to advise prospective or existing state farm policyholders on its behalf.
beginning in,state farm authorized the employees of agents to act on state farm behalf through what was called the clerical employee agreement ce.the ce was a agreement between state farm,the agent,and the agent employee.although the ce was termed a clerical employee agreement,it actually applied to insurance sales representatives employed by a state farm agent to assist the agent in marketing and servicing prospective and current policyholders,and appoint ed by state farm to act as its state licensed insurance sales representative.
according to state farm,a primary purpose of the ce was to define the scope of authority that state farm was granting to agents who,through their ce employees,sought to bind state farm to risk.the ce was mandatory in the sense that no agent employee was authorized by state farm to advise policyholders or to bind risks on state farm behalf unless the agent and the employee had accepted the ce.
under the ce,an agent could delegate to his or her ce employee binding authority on private passenger motor vehicles,residential risks,and personal insurance coverages,as well as authority to take applications for personal life and health insurance coverages.such delegation did not diminish the agent responsibility for exercise of such authority within state farm rules and the applicable state laws.
in line with the independent contractor status of state farm agents under the,the ce specified that an agent ce employee was not to be considered an employee of state farm for any purpose at any time.subject to the authority noted in the preceding paragraph,the state farm agent was solely responsible for the training,direction,supervision and compensation of the ce employee,and for all obligations imposed upon an employer as respects an employee.under the ce,state farm was to appoint the ce employee as state farm licensed insurance sales representative and could terminate th is appointment.
in,state farm decided to replace the ce with a new agreement called the licensed staff agreement lsa 
the lsa is substantively similar or identical to the ce regarding the agent employment of the lsa employee to assist the agent in marketing and servicing state farm appointment of that employee as its representative the agent delegation to the lsa employee of binding authority over private auto,residential risks,and personal insurance coverages,as well as authority to take applications for personal life and health insurance coverages and the agent,not state farm,being the employer of the lsa employee.
however,the lsa contains three substantive provisions not found in the ce.in the first provision,the lsa recognizes state farm expansion into financial services products and specifies that lsa employees may be involved in activities in connection with those products.as for the two other provisions,the lsa imposes on the lsa employees,respectively,trade secret and nonsolicitation provisions similar to those in the that apply to state farm agents.
the agents sued state farm for breach of contract and for violation of california unfair competition statute bus,et for attempting to apply the lsa.the agents essentially argue that the lsa asserts control over the agents lsa employees in violation of the independent contractor agreement between state farm and the agents.in their complaint,the agents request declaratory and injunctive relief declaring this assertion of control improper,and enjoining it.
in a prior,unpublished opinion in this case,this court reversed a demurrer judgment in favor of state farm.patricia adkins ins.agency,state farm automobile ins,wl nonpub.opn.adkins.we concluded in part that the agents stated a claim for breach of contract against state farm because the lsa added trade secret and noncompetition duties to the agents lsa employees in derogation of the agents independent contractor rights under the adkins,supra.
after a bench trial,the trial court denied the agents declaratory and injunctive relief.the court concluded that,as to those agents who had signed the lsa,there was no evidence presented that any particular provision of the lsa is currently the source of controversy as to these agents or poses any existing conflict between these agents and state farm in the operation of the agents business es.as to those agents who had not signed the lsa,the trial court reasoned that they are not subject to its terms and found that they had not shown that state farm had adversely affected their businesses for failing to sign.
discussion 
on appeal,the agents do not raise any issue involving their unfair competition cause of action.nor do they meaningfully challenge the evidentiary sufficiency of the trial court factual findings.
instead,the agents limit the issue on appeal to one of contractual interpretation the agents allege that state farm attempt to control the agents lsa employees through the lsa violates the contract between state farm and the agents.and the agents focus this allegation on the lsa trade secret and nonsolicitation provisions.
with the appeal whittled to this issue of contractual no extrinsic evidence introduced at trial regarding competing we said in our prior opinion in reversing state farm demurrer retains the same vitality notwithstanding the intervening bench trial.parsons bristol development cal d,see eisenberg et,cal.practice guide civil appeals writs the rutter group,to.we said state farm does not reserve the right anywhere in the independent contractor agreement it has with its agents to determine the conditions of employment of an agent employees the does not specify that the trade secret and noncompetition duties of the agents apply to the agents employees.the lsa thus adds conditions to the terms of employment of the agents lsa employees that state farm can enforce directly against the lsa employees th
