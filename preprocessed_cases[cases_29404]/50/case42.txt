this appeal relates solely to the amount of damages the jury awarded to plaintiff computer systems,mmcs on its claim that defendant marc glassman,mgi misappropriated certain of mmcs trade secrets in violation of ohio law.mgi appeals the district court denial of its motion for remittitur.specifically,mgi contends that the jury award of million in compensatory damages and million in punitive damages is clearly excessive and grossly disproportionate to the loss suffered by mmcs,as that loss is reflected in the evidence presented at trial.we are not persuaded by mgi contention that the award is clearly excessive and we therefore can not say the district court abused its discretion in denying the motion for remittitur.accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
beginning in,mmcs licensed software to mgi for use in mgi pharmacies.the purpose of the software was to maintain prescription and billing records for mgi customers.the software enabled mgi to search those records and bill customers insurers with ease.in addition,as part of the agreement between the companies,mmcs sold to mgi various hardware necessary to implement its pharmacy software.however,mmcs sought to protect the software source code from being divulged to either mgi or anyone else because it contained proprietary material owned by mmcs.to that end,in the parties entered into a source code agreement,which provided that mmcs would place a copy of the source code in escrow.under the agreement,mgi could access the source code only in certain specified emergencies,if the management of mmcs died in a disaster or if mmcs entered bankruptcy.mgi further agreed that if it accessed the source code wrongfully,in a manner not authorized under the agreement,it would pay mmcs damages in the amount of for each pharmacy in which mgi was using mmcs software.
as the year approached,mgi sought to upgrade the computer systems in its pharmacies such that all of the individual systems would be part of a centralized network.mgi set its sights on a system offered by the condor corporation called techrx.but in order to implement techrx,mgi had to convert the data stored on mmcs system to a format compatible with techrx.to accomplish this,mgi elicited bids to complete the conversion from,among others,mmcs and conversions,tpc,a company owned by mgi.mmcs offered to perform the conversion for.tpc offered to do the job for.despite mgi offer to pay mmcs,the latter declined and mgi assigned the conversion to tpc in february or march.
on december,counsel for mmcs sent a letter to kevin yaugher,of mgi,accusing mgi of infringing mmcs copyrights to its software,misappropriating trade secrets,and breaching the parties source code agreement.according to the letter,mgi secretly copied software from an mmcs computer which mgi had withheld from mmcs under false pretenses.the letter alleged that mgi used the software stored on the computer to reconstruct mmcs source code through reverse engineering.the letter demanded in damages,as provided for in the source code agreement for each of mgi pharmacies,which then numbered.the letter further warned that if the amount sought was not received by pst on december,mmcs will terminate all of its agreements with mgi for material breach without further notice.ja.
at the time of the letter,mgi had not yet completed the conversion process and thus some of its pharmacies still depended on mmcs computer system.mgi interpreted the december,letter as a threat to the effect that mmcs might terminate its systems at the mgi pharmacies that still used them.consequently,on december,mgi brought an action against mmcs for injunctive relief in the northern district of ohio.the court held a hearing on mgi motion for a temporary restraining order,at which hearing mmcs agreed to permit mgi to continue using its computer system at the pharmacies where the system was still active.
after first asserting counterclaims against the two companies,on july,mmcs filed a complaint against mgi and tpc in the northern district of ohio.the complaint alleged,inter alia,that mgi had breached the source code agreement and other agreements between the two companies and infringed mmcs copyright in its source code.mmcs brought claims of misappropriation of trade secrets and unfair competition against both mgi and tpc.jurisdiction was premised on diversity of citizenship a,and the copyright claim,a.
prior to trial,the district court dismissed various of mmcs claims and mmcs settled its remaining claims against tpc one of the claims dismissed by the court was mmcs claim that mgi had breached the source code agreement.in granting mgi motion for judgment on the pleadings as to this claim,the court explained that mgi could breach the source code agreement only by obtaining the actual copies of the materials that mmcs placed in the safety deposit box,and not by somehow obtaining or other copies.ja.
on july,mmcs remaining claims against of trade secrets,fraud,and breach of software license to trial.the evidence presented at trial bears out the accusations mmcs counsel made in his december,letter to mgi president.at trial,former mgi employee peter bruno testified that mgi deliberately concealed from mmcs its intention to upgrade to the techrx system and in the meantime transferred an mmcs computer designed for year reliability testing the computer,which mmcs had loaned to mgi,to tpc.mmcs loaned mgi the computer,which mgi stored at its corporate headquarters,exclusively for year readiness purposes.to simulate anticipated effects of the year change,the computer was equipped with the mmcs pharmacy software and a set of expired data.bruno testified that in spring after all readiness issues had been raso,his superior at mgi,instructed him to ship the computer to tpc.although raso did not tell bruno why this was necessary,bruno testified that he knew the reason why,it was for the purpose of converting the files on it to a new system that mgi was going towards.ja.
bruno further testified that mgi was aware that it had purchased the rights to mmcs software only for use at mgi pharmacies,that we could give it to someone else,and that it was assumed that the software was confidential.ja.after tpc received the computer,raso instructed bruno to assist tpc in booting the mmcs software.specifically,raso transferred a phone call from tpc president,phil lisitza,to bruno,who then supplied lisitza with the password to the mmcs system and instructions on running the system.it was bruno understanding that tpc purpose in accessing the mmcs system was to extract mmcs software information that would enable it to prepare a conversion program such that mgi customer data on the mmcs system could be transferred to techrx.finally,bruno testified that when an mmcs representative arrived at mgi headquarters in search of the computer,raso and bruno at raso direction lied and said they did not know where the computer was.ja.
mgi did not controvert bruno testimony and on appeal it concedes liability for misappropriating trade secrets.as to the extent of the misappropriation,mmcs president lisa lundahl testimony was as follows.lundahl recounted how she examined the source code tpc had written for its conversion program.lundahl noticed certain features in the tpc conversion program that were either identical or significantly reminiscent of mmcs source code.in particular,lundahl testified that the tpc conversion program used the same format as the mmcs software for listing a customer health conditions.further,lundahl testified that the tpc conversion program computed dates according to the same unique method used by the mmcs software.lundahl also testified that the tpc conversion program employed the same algorithm that mmcs use s to calculate the prescription number.ja.lundahl explained that the only way tpc could have discovered these features of the mmcs source code is by reconstructing them from the software on the computer.finally,lundahl testified that she discovered a total of instances of tpc use of mmcs source code in her review of the tpc conversion program.
during trial,the court denied mgi motion for a judgment as a matter
