we granted the request for certification of the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit pursuant to california rules of court,rule,to address the following question 
under the california uniform trade secrets act utsa,civil code,section when does a claim for trade secret infringement arise only once,when the initial misappropriation occurs,or with each subsequent misuse of the trade secret 
we conclude that in a plaintiff action against the same defendant,the continued improper use or disclosure of a trade secret after defendant initial misappropriation is viewed under the utsa as part of a single claim of continuing misappropriation accruing at the time of the initial misappropriation 
statement of facts 
the relevant facts,as stated in the ninth circuit certification order to this court,are as follows 
cadence design systems,and avant corporation compete in the field of integrated circuit design automation.both companies design place and route software,which enables computer chip designers to place and connect tiny components on a computer chip.cadence formed in through the merger of several companies.four senior employees left cadence in to found avant,originally known as arcsys.
in march,cadence gerald hsu resigned from cadence to sign on with avant.because hsu possessed valuable business trade secrets and other confidential information,cadence informed hsu that it objected to his working at avant.concerned that hsu would reveal proprietary cadence information when managing avant,cadence sent avant a draft complaint naming avant and hsu as defendants.cadence alleged trade secret misappropriation and other causes of action.in negotiating a settlement of cadence claims,cadence and avant apparently did not discuss avant alleged use of cadence framework ii dfii trade secret source code 
after extensive negotiations,in june,the parties entered into a confidential settlement agreement the agreement or release that included a mutual general release,which provided in part 
cadence,avant and hsu hereby forever release and discharge each other of and from any and all manner of action,claim or cause of action,in law or in equity,suits,debts,liens,contracts,agreements,promises,liabilities,demands,losses,damages,costs or expenses,including without limitation court costs and attorneys fees,which they may have against each other at the time of the execution of this agreement,known or unknown,including but not limited to any claims arising out of,or in connection with,or relating directly or indirectly to the following hsu employment with cadence,the cessation of hsu employment with cadence,any wrongful termination of hsu,any age or race discrimination by cadence with respect to hsu,any anticompetitive activity or unfair competition or trade secret misappropriation by cadence,hsu or avant with respect to cadence,hsu or avant with respect to cadence,hsu or avant or any other actions taken by cadence to with respect to hsu or avant or by hsu or avant with respect to cadence.
the agreement also contained in capital letters a waiver of section with the following language 
these releases extend to claims which the parties do not know or suspect to exist in their favor,which if known by them would have materially affected their decision to enter into this release.
in connection with such waiver and relinquishment,the parties acknowledge that they are aware that,after executing this agreement,they or their attorneys or agents may discover claims or facts in addition to or different from those which they now know or believe to exist but that it is their intention hereby fully,finally and forever to settle and release all of the claims,matters,disputes and differences known or unknown,suspected or unsuspected,which now exist,may exist,or heretofore may have existed against each other in connection with the released matters.in furtherance of this intention,the release herein given shall be and remain in effect as a full and complete release notwithstanding the discovery or existence of any such additional or different claim or fact.
in the summer of,a cadence engineer discovered a bug an error in avant arccell software program that was similar to a bug he had inadvertently created several years earlier when writing source code for cadence dfii product.in december,the santa clara county district attorney executed a search of avant headquarters.among the items seized was a log that showed copying of cadence source code in by a former cadence employee and avant founder.
in december,cadence sued avant for theft of its copyrighted and trade secret source code and sought a preliminary order enjoining the sale of avant arccell and aquarius products.in anticipation of trial,both sides filed for partial summary judgment concerning the effect of the release.avant argued that because cadence had released all its claims existing at the time of the release,any claims based on continuing or future misuse of trade secrets that were stolen prior to the date of the release were now barred.cadence maintained that the only claims it had released were those for misappropriation occurring before the effective date of the release,and not claims to redress avant continuing or new misuses of its trade secrets after the date of the release.
the federal district court ruled on these summary judgment motions on october.reversing its initial order,the district court held that all of cadence trade secret claims for misuse of its dfii trade secrets taken before the release were barred by the release.cadence now is appealing this decision to the ninth circuit.if the release barred cadence claims existing at the time of the agreement,but did not bar future claims,the question still remains what claims existed at the time of the agreement are all of cadence claims for avant trade secret misappropriation part of the same claim,or does each successive misuse of cadence trade secret source code give rise to a separate claim 
ii.discussion 
avant argues that a cause of action for misappropriation of a given trade secret by a particular plaintiff against a particular defendant arises only once,when the trade secret is initially misappropriated.in support of this position,it relies in large part on the rationale set forth in monolith portland midwest kaiser aluminum cir monolith,which applied the california common law of trade secrets.the monolith court rejected the position exemplified by underwater storage,united states rubber,that the wrong is the adverse use of the secret disclosed in confidence each use is a new wrong,and a continuing use is a continuing wrong.underlying this theory is the concept that a trade secret is in the nature of property,which is damaged or destroyed by the adverse use california does not treat trade secrets as if they were property.it is the relationship between the parties at the time the secret is disclosed that is protected.futurecraft clary d.the protected relationship,contractual or confidential,is one to which,as justice holmes observed,some rudimentary requirements of good faith are attached.whether the plaintiffs have any valuable secret or not the defendant knows the facts,whatever they are,through a special confidence that he accepted.the property may be denied,but the confidence can not be.therefore the starting point for the present matter is not property,but that the defendant stood in confidential relations with the plaintiffs du pont de nemours powder masland.the fabric of the relationship once rent is not torn anew with each added use or disclosure,although the damage suffered may thereby be aggravated.the cause of action arises but once.monolith,supra,at,italics added.
on the other hand,cadence asserts that the utsa,which as discussed below was adopted by california in,changed the common law view typified by monolith,and now views trade secrets as property rather than simply as the protection of a confidential relationship.it further reasons that because trade secret misappropriation is the wrongful taking or use of protected property,each new use represents a new claim of misappropriation.as will be discussed,neither cadence nor avant positions are entirely correct.
in order to answer the certified question,we must examine the pertinent language of the utsa.as the court of appeal explained in,slautterback th,d,the utsa was approved by the national conference of commissioners on uniform state laws in and adopted without significant change by california in.west laws ann.trade secrets act,stats,ch.section defines certain key terms of the utsa.trade secret is defined as information,including a formula,pattern,compilation,program,device,method,technique,or process,that derives independent economic value,actual or potential,from not being generally known to the public or to other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use and is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy,subd.d.
misappropriation is defined as acquisition of a trade secret of another by a person who knows or has reason to know that the trade secret was acquired by improper means or disclosure or use of a trade secret of another without express or implied consent by a person who a used improper means to acquire knowledge of the trade secret or b at the time of disclosure or use,knew or had reason to know that his or her knowledge of the trade secret was i derived from or through a person who had utilized improper means to acquire it ii acquired under circumstances giving rise to a duty to maintain its secrecy or limit its use or iii derived from or through a person who owed a duty to the person seeking relief to maintain its secrecy or limit its use or c before a material change of his or her position,knew or had reason to know that it was a trade secret and that knowledge of it had been acquired by accident or mistake,subd.b.
improper means is defined to include theft,bribery,misrepresentation,breach or inducement of a breach of a duty to maintain secrecy,or espionage through electronic or other means.reverse engineering or independent derivation alone shall not be considered improper means,subd.a.
thus,the legal protection accorded trade secrets is fundamentally different from that given to patents,in which the patent owner acquires a limited term monopoly over the patented technology,and use of that technology by whatever means infringes the patent.the owner of the trade secret is protected only against the appropriation of the secret by improper means and the subsequent use or disclosure of the improperly acquired secret.there are various legitimate means,such as reverse engineering,by which a trade secret can be acquired and used.see callman,the law of unfair competition,trademarks,and monopolies.
the most critical section of utsa for purposes of this case is section,which provides an action for misappropriation must be brought within three years after the misappropriation is discovered or by the exercise of reasonable diligence should have been discovered.for the purposes of this section,a continuing misappropriation constitutes a single claim.italics added.
as the court of appeal recognized in,supra,th at pages,d,s ection is derived almost verbatim from section of the uniform act as originally drafted.see west laws,supra,trade secrets act,com.to.it is therefore appropriate to accord substantial weight to the commissioners comment on the construction of what is now section.citations.that comment is there presently is a conflict of authority as to whether trade secret misappropriation is a continuing wrong.compare monolith portland midwest kaiser aluminum chemical,not a continuing wrong under california period upon all recovery begins upon initial misappropriation with underwater storage,rubber,continuing wrong under general period with respect to a specific act of misappropriation begins at the time that the act of misappropriation occurs.this act rejects a continuing wrong approach to the statute of limitations but delays the commencement of the limitation period until an aggrieved person discovers or reasonably should have discovered the existence of misappropriation.if objectively reasonable notice of misappropriation exists,three years is sufficient time to vindicate one legal rights.west laws,supra,trade secrets act,com.to.
the utsa does not define the term continuing misappropriation,but its meaning appears evident in light of the definition of misappropriation.it is the continuing use or disclosure of a trade secret after that secret was acquired by improper means or as otherwise specified in section,subdivision b.thus,for statute of limitations purposes,a continuing misappropriation is viewed as a single claim.the drafters of the utsa explicitly affirmed monolith and rejected the contrary view that misappropriation gives rise to multiple claims each time the trade secret is misused or improperly disclosed.
from our examination of the above statutes,a distinction between a misappropriation and a claim emerges.a misappropriation within the meaning of the utsa occurs not only at the time of the initial acquisition of the trade secret by wrongful means,but also with each misuse or wrongful disclosure of the secret.but a claim for misappropriation of a trade secret arises for a given plaintiff against a given defendant only once,at the time of the initial misappropriation,subject to the discovery rule provided in section.each new misuse or wrongful disclosure is viewed as augmenting a single claim of continuing misappropriation rather than as giving rise to a separate claim.
cadence makes much of the language in section that states,f or the purposes of this section,a continuing misappropriation constitutes a single claim.italics added.based on that language,cadence argues that a continuing misappropriation constitutes a single claim only for statute of limitations purposes.this argument can not withstand scrutiny.the certified question asks when a claim for trade secret infringement arises.the term claim does not have some theoretical meaning apart from the context in which it is used.in the present case,the certified question is asked in the context of a release,which is intended to settle or prevent litigation.therefore,claim must be defined in the context of litigation.if continuing misappropriation is viewed as a single claim for statute of limitations purposes see,supra,th at,d,then it is difficult to fathom how it could be treated as more than one claim for purposes of litigation generally.for example,a plaintiff could not legitimately plead separate claims of misappropriation for each misuse of a trade secret,for to do so would impermissibly evade the statute of limitations.nor can it be asserted that separate claims accruing at different times can have the same limitations period,because that position is contrary to the rule that each civil action possesses its own statutorily prescribed limitations period.see code civ.the only other alternative is to hold that the term claim means one thing in the context of litigation and something else in the context of releases.there is no indication the legislature intended this kind of inconsistency.
in fact,the phrase for purposes of this section can plausibly be explained as a means of contrasting section with section,the only other section to refer to continuing misappropriation.that section states this title does not apply to misappropriation occurring prior to january.if a continuing misappropriation otherwise covered by this title began before january,this title does not apply to the part of the misappropriation occurring before that date.this title does apply to the part of the misappropriation occurring on or after that date unless the appropriation was not a misappropriation under the law in effect before the operative date of this title.italics added.in other words,for purposes of section,a continuing misappropriation is not necessarily a single claim.rather,the claim must be divided in two if the continuing misappropriation took place partly before january,common law claim for misappropriation occurring before that date,and one utsa claim for misappropriation occurring thereafter.indeed,if each misappropriation constituted a single claim,all that section would have had to
