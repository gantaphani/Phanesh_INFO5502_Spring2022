lionel,appeals a jury verdict finding it liable for misappropriation of trade secrets and unjust enrichment,and awarding mike train house,mth damages exceeding million.after unsuccessfully moving the district court for a new trial and judgment as a matter of law,lionel appeals the jury verdict,the district court evidentiary decisions,the specificity with which mth identified its trade secrets,the imposition of joint and several liability,and the amount of the damage award.lionel also appeals the district court order granting mth request for an injunction.because lionel correctly argues that the district court erred in admitting expert testimony and in imposing liability,and because the jury award improperly double counts mth damages,we reverse the district court order denying lionel motion for a new trial and remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.because the district court injunction is based entirely on the jury verdict,we reverse that order as well.
background 
this case involves mth claim that lionel misappropriated mth trade secrets and was unjustly enriched by that misappropriation.before mth brought this claim,the parties were involved in both criminal and civil litigation in south korea,based on the same underlying events.after several individuals associated with lionel were convicted of criminal charges,and lionel and mth settled the civil suit,mth filed the instant complaint against lionel in federal district court.
lionel and mth are both distributors of model trains.the model trains they distribute are scale replicas of actual trains.both lionel and mth contract with third parties for the manufacture of their trains and then release the trains for distribution under their own names.gauge refers to the width of the track collectors tend to collect trains of only one gauge in this case o gauge,so that all their trains can operate on the same track.the trains are manufactured by a process known as zinc,which is a precise method of construction in which molten metal is injected into molds.this method requires extensive design work for the construction of a single train accordingly,designers produce design drawings,which contain all the information necessary to build a train.about to design drawings are required to produce each scale engine.
lionel has been producing model trains since the.in,lionel hired mth,founded by michael wolf,to work with samhongsa,a korean supplier,to design and manufacture trains,for release under lionel name.mth and samhongsa designed and produced several different trains for lionel between and.mth relationship with lionel ended in.between and,lionel used a number of manufacturers,but none produced trains at competitive prices.in,samhongsa began making trains for resale under mth name,a relationship that continued until.
ahn,one of the leading designers at samhongsa from,assisted in designing trains for both lionel and mth during each company relationship with samhongsa.ahn testified that samhongsa designers,subcontract designers,members of various departments at samhongsa,and other subcontractors had access to all samhongsa designs and were allowed to make and retain copies of those designs.ahn also testified that korean designers use a common numbering system in their design drawings to refer to the same parts of the model train.for example,engine parts are numbered in the range by korean design companies.
during the time that samhongsa worked for both lionel and mth,samhongsa subcontracted with a company named korea brass kb,a supplier of wax castings for model trains.kb had been formed in by cho,a former samhongsa employee.in,kb expanded and became a direct supplier and manufacturer of model trains.after cho and yoo chan yang,kb sales agent in the united states,approached lionel in april,lionel placed an order with kb to manufacture two lines.
kb then hired ahn to design trains that it intended to manufacture for lionel.before departing samhongsa,ahn copied design drawings for mth trains onto computer disks ahn testified that he took the drawings to work on them at home,and that the other designers acted similarly.while working for kb,ahn hired chung,a samhongsa subcontractor,to assist him with the drawings for an model train.ahn testified that he instructed chung to draw the designs differently from those produced by samhongsa.
in,lionel distributed the two trains designed and manufactured by kb.after purchasing samples of each model in july of that year,wolf immediately traveled to korea because he was concerned that the trains had been designed and manufactured based on mth design drawings.wolf asked samhongsa to conduct an internal investigation,during which chung admitted to copying samhongsa designs of mth trains and giving them to ahn.korean authorities launched an investigation into whether crimes had been committed in connection with the use of these designs.as part of that investigation,the police seized ahn computer and the computers belonging to other former and current samhongsa employees to determine whether they contained evidence of criminal activity.
the korean authorities prosecuted ahn,along with three other samhongsa employees,for misappropriation of trade secrets,a criminal offense in korea.as part of that case,professor lee,a korean engineering expert,compared pairs of samhongsa and kb drawings and found substantial evidence of copying.a korean court found ahn and three samhongsa employees guilty of the unlawful misappropriation of mth trade secrets.samhongsa then brought a civil suit in korea against ahn,cho,kb,and the three samhongsa employees.the korean court found all of the defendants liable for misappropriation of mth trade secrets.during the defendants preparation for an appeal of that judgment,the parties settled the civil litigation and the case was dismissed.
in,mth filed a complaint against lionel,kb,and yang in the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan,alleging misappropriation of trade secrets unfair competition by the misappropriation of products unfair competition in violation of the lanham act,a violations of korea prevention of unfair competition and trade secret protection law and unjust enrichment.the district court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment as to the count alleging a violation of korea act,and mth withdrew its claims of unfair competition and violations of the lanham act.on may,a jury trial began on the remaining claims,misappropriation of trade secrets and unjust enrichment.
the jury returned a verdict in favor of mth against all defendants on both claims.it awarded mth for lost profits and for future lost profits.the jury also awarded an additional against lionel and against kb and yang for unjust enrichment.further,the court granted mth request for a permanent injunction,prohibiting lionel from using the design drawings at issue.the court denied lionel motion for a new trial and for judgment as a matter of law.lionel now appeals,requesting that we reverse the district court order denying its motion to vacate the jury verdicts as to both liability and damages,and grant either its motion for a new trial or for judgment as a matter of law.lionel also asks that we reverse the district court injunction.
ii.standard of review 
we review de novo a district court refusal to grant a party motion for judgment as a matter of law.greene goodrich avionics,cir.under rule,a court may grant judgment as a matter of law on a particular issue if there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for that party on that issue.a.in cases based on diversity jurisdiction,we apply the forum state substantive standard for determining when judgment as a matter of law is appropriate.greene,at citing morales am.honda motor,cir.for a party to be entitled to judgment as a matter of law after the jury enters an adverse verdict in michigan,the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to the party must fail to establish a claim as a matter of law.forge smith.specifically,judgment as a matter of law is appropriate when viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party,there is no genuine issue of material fact for the jury,and reasonable minds could come to but one conclusion,in favor of the moving party.noble brinker int l,cir.

iii.liability issues 
on appeal,lionel argues that the district court committed three errors related to lionel liability allowing mth to offer improper expert testimony determining that mth had sufficiently identified what actual trade secrets lionel had allegedly misappropriated and admitting into evidence various documents from the korean court proceedings under exceptions to the rule proscribing hearsay evidence.we address these issues in turn.
expert testimony 
mth offered the testimony of jeffery stein,a professor of mechanical engineering at the university of michigan,to establish that lionel design drawings had been copied from drawings samhongsa completed for mth.stein testified that he examined two sets of design drawings,one from and one from,concerning ten different train models,for a total of pairs of drawings.stein testified that his evaluation was based on criteria,including factors such as the drawing title and the part number assigned to the drawing.stein calculated a score from zero to one based on these criteria zero indicated no association between the drawings,and one indicated an extremely high association.stein testified that approximately percent of the kb drawings were copied from samhongsa drawings.stein further testified that designers working independently to develop similar design drawings of the same train would not develop identical or substantially similar drawings,because detailed dimensions can not be gleaned from examining pictures of trains,and thus it was likely that designers would assign slightly different dimensions and measurements to their drawings of the same train part.furthermore,he testified that even if all of the numbers were exactly the same,the way that the information is represented in the drawing,there is a certain amount of creative input that the designer has in terms of how to represent this in the drawing.stein also testified that designers would calculate different tolerances,the acceptable degree to which the completed part could deviate from the design dimensions 
if you make something with a very high tolerance then it very expensive and time consuming to produce,so it always a big engineering decision about when you make a tolerance as to how much it going to be,what is the tradeoff going to be between cost and time and the quality of the final product.
given the delicate decisions that must be made between expense and quality,stein testified that a company engineering team generally decides what the tolerance values for a given product will be.
stein testified that he reviewed the report professor lee prepared,which compared drawing pairs.stein explained that he independently corroborated lee work using a regression analysis to compare it to the drawing pairs stein reviewed.stein testified that he found copying in percent of the drawings,whereas lee found copying in percent.stein regression analysis indicated that his criteria would produce conclusions about copying that were consistent with lee conclusions in percent of the drawings.
lionel argues that the district court should have excluded stein testimony under federal rule of evidence as unreliable,and even if reliable,stein testimony about lee conclusions was improper under rule.as discussed below,we agree on both points and conclude that the errors were not harmless.
a district court must determine whether expert testimony is reliable before it can be admitted under rule see kumho tire carmichael,d federal rule of evidence imposes a special obligation upon a trial judge to ensure that any and all scientific testimony is not only relevant,but reliable.citing daubert merrell dow,d.in daubert,the supreme court identified factors that a court may consider in determining whether an expert testimony is sufficiently reliable,including whether a theory or technique can be or has been tested whether the technique has been subjected to peer review and publication whether the technique has a known or potential rate of error and the existence of standards controlling its operation and whether the theory or technique enjoys general acceptance in a relevant scientific community.daubert,at.see also nelson.gas pipeline,cir.because the daubert factors may not be pertinent in evaluating the reliability of expert testimony in every case,they are neither definitive nor exhaustive.a court must consider whether those factors are reasonable measures of reliability in a given case,however.nelson,at.moreover,even if we determine that stein testimony was improperly admitted,we are not to disturb the jury verdict if the improper admission of that testimony was harmless.see united states smithers,cir conducting analysis after applying daubert factors to determine whether district court erred in excluding expert testimony.
we conclude that the district court abandoned its function by failing to make any findings regarding the reliability of stein testimony.the district court allowed stein to testify as to his opinion of lee report,but failed to make specific findings regarding the reliability of stein own technique for comparing the design drawings as opposed to stein technique of comparing his conclusions to those reached by lee.although the district court failure to make specific findings does not itself require that we vacate the jury verdict,a proper application of the daubert factors in this case reveals that the district court abused its discretion in admitting stein testimony.
first,stein created the criteria with which he compared the design drawings however,there is no evidence that his methodology had ever been tested,subjected to peer review,possessed a known or potential rate of error,or enjoyed general acceptance.although it is true that in some instances but innovative theories will not have been published,and that s ome propositions are too particular,too new,or of too limited interest to be published,daubert,at,the novelty of a theory does not shield an expert testimony from judicial scrutiny.in nelson,although we acknowledged that peer review may not always be available in the case of novel theories or methodology,we emphasized that scrutiny by the scientific community is one of several indicators of good science,in part because it increases the likelihood that substantive flaws in methodology will be detected.at quoting daubert,at.
the novelty of stein theory is not the only reason that his testimony is unreliable.our conclusion is also compelled by the clear evidence that stein lacked a rudimentary understanding of the korean design industry,and was thus unable to identify those aspects of the design drawings that might be indicative of copying.for example,one factor that stein relied upon in evaluating the similarity between two drawings was whether the part was assigned the same number.the record clearly establishes,however,that korean manufacturers share a common numbering system for train parts.for example,all korean design companies assign the number to the train boiler.based on his criteria,however,stein would consider the fact that both mth and lionel design drawings of boilers were labeled as evidence of copying.similarly,stein gave weight to the name each drawing bore.thus,if mth design drawing of a boiler and lionel design drawing of a boiler bore the name boiler,stein interpreted that naming as a sign of copying.in addition to the obvious flaw inherent in a methodology that identifies copying by looking at the names of discrete component parts,stein methodology reveals a lack of insight into this industry by considering the numbers assigned to each train part as evidence of copying.
as indicative of the lack of reliability in his methodology,stein testified that he arbitrarily determined how much significance each of the criteria would have on his assessment of whether there was evidence of copying.among the criteria stein evaluated to determine whether copying was evident in a pair of drawings were part number,part name,the drawings dimensions,when the drawing was made,the distance from the edges to the image,and the color index.stein testified that whether drawings had a similar part name and part number bore more heavily on his assessment than any other criterion.even if stein purposefully placed more significance on part name and number,as opposed to doing so arbitrarily,by discounting the significance of more relevant criteria,stein methodology does not reflect the realities of the korean design industry,and thus can not be relied upon as an adequate test by which the similarities between mth and lionel design drawings can be evaluated.
finally,the record indicates,and mth concedes,that stein not only created his report for the purposes of litigation,but that he created the precise methodology at issue for that purpose as well.we have been suspicious of methodologies created for the purpose of litigation,because expert witnesses are not necessarily always unbiased scientists.turpin merrell dow,cir.other courts,too,have considered whether an expert testimony relates to matters growing naturally and directly out of their own research,or whether the expert testimony has been developed for the purposes of litigation.see,daubert merrell dow,cir noting that this is a very significant fact to be considered.that this methodology was created for the purposes of litigation further supports our conclusion that stein testimony was not reliable under daubert.see nelson,at.
lionel argues that even if stein methodology were adequately reliable under rule,the district court erred in allowing stein to testify as to the conclusions drawn by professor lee.rule of the federal rules of evidence allows an expert to rely on facts not admitted into evidence if those facts are of a type reasonably relied upon by experts in the particular field in forming opinions or inferences upon the subject.although an expert may testify as to his or her opinion formed from facts not admitted into evidence,f acts or data that are otherwise inadmissible shall not be disclosed to the jury by the proponent of the opinion or inference unless the court determines that their probative value in assisting the jury to evaluate the expert opinion substantially outweighs their prejudicial effect.id.
although stein testified about the conclusions he drew based on his examination of the drawing pairs,he also testified extensively about the conclusions reached by professor lee and the degree to which stein and lee conclusions overlapped.mth argues that stein could properly testify about the similarity of his and lee conclusions regarding copying within the drawing pairs,and that the methodology by which stein compared his conclusions with lee a regression analysis meets daubert standards of reliability.lionel does not challenge the general use of regression analysis.rather,lionel correctly argues that,regardless of the methodology stein used to compare his conclusions to those of lee,rule simply does not allow stein to testify as to the degree of similarity between lee conclusions and his own.
stein testimony as to lee report and conclusions,which were not admitted into evidence,was based on hearsay.see.c hearsay is a statement,other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing,offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.other circuits have squarely rejected any argument that rule extends so far as to allow an expert to testify about the conclusions of other experts.see united states tran trong cuong,cir holding that an expert witness could not bolster his opinion testimony by testifying that a expert conclusions were essentially the same as the expert witness united states grey bear,cir we are persuaded that.does not permit an expert witness to circumvent the rules of hearsay by testifying that other experts,not present in the courtroom,corroborate his views.we have also held that a district court erred by admitting expert testimony that was based upon the opinion of others who were not even qualified as experts,nor present at the trial.taylor heller,ohio misc,cir.stein testimony regarding lee conclusions was therefore improperly admitted.
harmless error 
under rules and,the district court abused its discretion in admitting stein testimony regarding his conclusions about the degree of copying between the design drawing pairs,and the similarity between his conclusions and lee.we may,however,overturn the jury verdict based on these evidentiary errors only if they were not harmless.smithers,at.the standard provides that if one can not say,with fair assurance,that the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error,it is impossible to conclude that substantial rights were not affected.depew anderson,cir quoting kotteakos united states.
stein testimony likely had a substantial effect on the verdict.stein was the only expert to testify about the degree of copying between the drawing pairs.without his testimony,the jury would not have learned of lee conclusions,nor would they have heard testimony from any other expert witness regarding the degree of copying.furthermore,as lionel points out,of the drawing pairs,only eleven were presented to the jury.because mth relied on stein testimony as its source of expertise and analysis regarding the degree of copying,it is impossible to conclude with any certainty that stein testimony did not sway the jury verdict.we therefore remand for a new trial.and because there remains a genuine issue of material fact as to whether lionel copied mth design drawings,we also affirm the district court order denying lionel motion for judgment as a matter of law.
specificity of trade secrets 
the first element a plaintiff alleging misappropriation of trade secrets must prove is that the information at issue actually constitutes a trade secret.stromback new line cinema,cir rothschild ford motor,d.for information to constitute a trade secret under michigan law,the information must derive economic value from the fact that it is not known to others who could make use of it,and be the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy.d.lionel does not argue on appeal that the secrecy of the information at issue was not adequately maintained rather,it argues that mth did not introduce evidence indicating what,precisely,constituted the trade secret.
citing emery marcan products,cir,mth argues that design drawings and engineering plans are prima facie trade secrets.id.at i t is well settled that detailed manufacturing drawings and tolerance data are prima facie trade secrets.see also rockwell graphic dev,cir.although it concedes that the design drawings contain some information,mth argues that the drawings contain several kinds of secret tolerances the acceptable degree to which the completed part could deviate from the design dimensions,data and reference points,clearances,pivot points,spring tensions,and specific can not be determined by simply measuring the parts on a manufactured engine or looking at a picture.mth also argues that the design drawings are trade secrets even though certai
