both parties challenge a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york preska,then following a jury trial.at trial,plaintiff brooks company,tydenbrooks tydenbrooks,largely prevailed in its claims against defendant cambridge security seals css and three former tydenbrooks employees with whom tydenbrooks thereafter settled for misappropriation of trade secrets,unfair competition,and unjust enrichment under new york law this case principally involves questions of new york law relating to whether a plaintiff asserting these claims can recover damages measured by the costs the defendant avoided rather than the losses the plaintiff sustained by virtue of the misappropriation and unfair competition.on appeal,the parties agree that there is no decision of the new york state courts to which we can confidently point to decide whether the defendant avoided costs are a permissible measure of damages for these claims.nor,in our view,have the new york courts clearly answered a second question that we are asked to consider,namely,whether prejudgment interest under section a of new york civil practice law and rules cplr is mandatory where a plaintiff recovers,if appropriate,damages as measured by the defendant avoided costs.
for these reasons,the appeal and present two questions that have not been resolved by the new york court of appeals and implicate significant new york state interests.as we reject css other challenges the resolution of these two questions may dispose of this appeal.accordingly,we affirm the judgment as to liability,reserve decision as to damages,and certify the following two questions to the new york court of appeals 
whether,under new york law,a plaintiff asserting claims of misappropriation of a trade secret,unfair competition,and unjust enrichment can recover damages that are measured by the costs the defendant avoided due to its unlawful activity.
if the answer to the first question is yes,whether prejudgment interest under new york civil practice law and rules a is mandatory where a plaintiff recovers damages as measured by the defendant avoided costs.
background 
tydenbrooks is the largest manufacturer of plastic security seals in the united states.css was founded in and began manufacturing plastic security seals at the end of.as relevant here,in tydenbrooks filed this lawsuit against css and former tydenbrooks employees who went to work for css,accusing them of misappropriation of trade secrets,civil conspiracy,unfair competition,and unjust enrichment,all in violation of new york law.
at trial,tydenbrooks claimed that css had copied and profited from tydenbrooks automated process for manufacturing plastic security seals,which are used to detect and prevent tampering with containers and other products.in support of its claim,tydenbrooks introduced evidence that it treated the process as a trade secret.that contention was vigorously disputed by css,which sought to introduce evidence that tydenbrooks manufacturing process was neither secret nor unique.the jury ultimately found that css was liable for misappropriation of a trade secret,unfair competition,and unjust enrichment.
the issue of damages proved to be thornier.tydenbrooks initially sought recovery of its lost profits and sales and disgorgement of css gross profits.it later abandoned those theories,electing instead to pursue an avoided costs theory in which damages are calculated as the total costs css avoided by not developing its own manufacturing process.to support its avoided costs theory at trial,tydenbrooks relied primarily on the testimony of its damages expert,robert vigil.vigil estimated that,as a result of its misappropriation of the manufacturing process,css saved between million and million in costs or million to million when he included costs associated with employee benefit payments in his calculations,vigil assumed that css capital cost savings equaled the capital costs that tydenbrooks incurred to develop its own machines in the first instance.for its part,css did not introduce any expert trial testimony relating to damages and elected instead to rely on its of vigil.on,vigil acknowledged that he tried but failed to calculate css profits because the profit information from css was not sufficient.
at tydenbrooks request,the district court instructed the jury that tydenbrooks sought damages on each of its claims based on the defendants avoided costs.it explained that the jury would have to compare actual costs incurred by the defendant with the costs it would have incurred to produce the same products without the use and knowledge of tydenbrooks manufacturing process.the district court also instructed the jury that it should consider three factors in measuring damages whether css realized savings in research and development costs,including the time and resources typically devoted to researching and developing a new manufacturing process,whether css gained a competitive advantage in being able to bring its plastic indicative security seals to market earlier than competitors,and whether css realized any savings in its operating costs,including savings from the avoidance of certain labor expenses and from increased productivity resulting from the efficiencies of the misappropriated manufacturing process.
on may,the jury rendered a verdict in favor of tydenbrooks and awarded it million in total damages against css million each for three of tydenbrooks four claims under new york law misappropriation of trade secrets,unfair competition,and unjust enrichment.the district court entered judgment on the verdict against css in the amount of million on may.the following day,tydenbrooks moved to amend the judgment to include prejudgment interest from february,to may,at nine percent per annum under sections and of the cplr.in december the district court denied tydenbrooks motion,noting that the jury was specifically instructed that d amages are assessed from the date of the misappropriation unfair use through the date on which the verdict is given.in the district court view,that instruction provided a clear reason to believe that the jury damage award was intended to compensate plaintiff for injuries suffered during the same time period that an award of prejudgment interest would otherwise account for.as a result,the district court concluded,to award tydenbrooks additional interest for that prejudgment period would constitute a windfall double recovery.
this appeal and followed.
discussion 
damages and avoided costs 
as noted,the district court instructed the jury that tydenbrooks sought damages on each of its claims based on the defendants avoided costs,which required the jury to compare actual costs incurred by the defendant with the costs it would have incurred to produce the same products without the use and knowledge of tydenbrooks manufacturing process.joint app x.css argues that it was error to instruct the jury that damages could be calculated based on css avoided costs.it insists that new york law rejects such a measure of damages if the plaintiff losses and the defendant profits are themselves calculable.
we have recognized that the profit unjustly received by a defendant in trade secret cases is an appropriate measure of damages under new york law.softel,dragon med.sci.commc ns,cir.citing david fox sons,king poultry.we have also recognized that t he amount of damages recoverable in an action for misappropriation of trade secrets may alternatively be measured by the plaintiff losses,although we have said this without specifically referencing new york law.tours,whitchurch,cir.and in those trade secret cases where measuring either the defendant profits or the plaintiff losses is too hard or speculative,we have approved the concept of a reasonable royalty award that attempts to measure a hypothetically agreed value of what the defendant wrongfully obtained from the plaintiff.microsystems,autodesk,cir.
even the avoided costs measure of damages finds some support in new york law.a century ago in new york bank note hamilton bank note engraving printing,the new york court of appeals suggested that awarding the plaintiff the amount of costs saved by the defendant as a result of its wrongful use of a proprietary device might reflect an appropriate measure of damages under some circumstances.there,the plaintiff,new york bank note company,had been awarded all of the profits of the defendant,who had used new york bank note proprietary printing press in breach of a contract.recognizing that such an award would hand a windfall to new york bank note because not all of defendant profits necessarily or presumptively proceed ed from the use of the proprietary press,the court of appeals concluded that the plaintiff was entitled to recover,not the profit made by the defendant,but the profit that company made from the use of the restricted presses.id.at.the court of appeals then remanded with instructions that new york bank note be awarded only the difference between the cost of printing on the proprietary presses and the cost of printing by other means or devices open to the defendant.id.at.but new york bank note involved a contract claim,not claims of misappropriation of trade secrets or unfair competition.
our own court also appears to have endorsed a course similar to the district court avoided costs approach in a contract case.in matarese lines,we affirmed an award of damages under new york law based on a calculation of costs avoided by the defendant,cir.there,an agent of the defendant promised the plaintiff one third of the savings that the defendant would accrue from using the plaintiff devices,which were designed to help the defendant stevedores load and unload cargo more safely and efficiently.we concluded that the defendant was liable under a theory of unjust enrichment for its failure to pay,and we approved the district court jury instructions permitting the jury to award damages based on the reasonable value of the use of the devices and the reasonable value of the services rendered by the plaintiff.id.at quotation marks omitted.the value to the defendant,we stated,included savings in the form of lower labor costs,insurance premiums,storage costs,and material costs.id.at.but because matarese involved a claim of unjust enrichment in the context of a specific promise to pay the equivalent of accrued savings,its utility in resolving this case is limited.
recognizing that neither matarese nor new york bank note fully answers the question before us,tydenbrooks urges that we turn to the restatement third of unfair competition the restatement to determine how the new york court of appeals would decide the damages question in this case.relying expressly on matarese,the restatement commends using the amount of avoided costs as a measure of damages in unfair competition cases where the benefit derived by the defendant consists primarily of cost savings,such as when the trade secret is a more efficient method of production.restatement cmt.f reporters note to cmt.f see also id.cmt.although we recognize that comments d and f of section in particular appear to support the avoided costs approach,we can not say with certainty that those provisions of the restatement accurately describe new york law with respect to calculating damages in trade secret and unfair competition cases.we note that the new york court of appeals has never even cited the restatement,while the appellate division has cited it only four times,in ways that are not helpful to our resolution of this appeal.see state autobahn,progressive ins.grp,dep t mann ex rel.akst cooper tire,dep t pullman,llc prudential ins,of,dep t wiener lazard freres,dep t.ten new york supreme court decisions have cited the restatement,all for propositions irrelevant to the damages question at issue here we therefore have little if any reason to think that new york has incorporated the restatement black letter or comments into its law on trade secrets or unfair competition.
in short,neither our court nor the new york courts appear to have approved the specific type of award in this case that is,the costs that css avoided by using tydenbrooks manufacturing process.to the contrary,new york courts have suggested that the measure of damages in trade secret cases,even when measured by reference to a defendant profits,should correspond to a plaintiff losses as a means of compensation.see epstein eng g,cataldo,dep t suburban graphics supply nagle,dep t hertz avis,dep t am,neptune meter,dep t.assuming new york requires that trade secret damages bear some connection to the plaintiff losses,it is not apparent to us that assessing damages based on the defendant avoided costs satisfies the requirement.whether avoided costs can be a measure of damages in trade secret cases under new york law presents,then,an unresolved policy decision that the new york court of appeals is better situated than we are to make.caronia philip morris usa,cir.quotation marks omitted.
prejudgment interest 
tydenbrooks appeals the district court denial of its motion to amend the judgment to include prejudgment interest pursuant to section a of the cplr.new york law does not permit the trial court to exercise any discretion where a party is entitled to such interest as a matter of right.new england ins.healthcare underwriters mut.ins,cir.quotation marks omitted.however,new york law also provides that where there is a possibility that the jury award already allowed interest,no further prejudgment interest can be recovered on the verdict.trademark research maxwell online,cir.
in response to tydenbrooks motion to amend the judgment,the district court concluded that prejudgment interest was not required because the jury award already compensated tydenbrooks for the entire period.to be sure,prejudgment interest was not specifically mentioned in the trial testimony,on the verdict form,or during the jury instructions.nor was there any other concrete basis in the record to suggest that the jury included such interest.bamira greenberg,dep t.nevertheless,the district court relied on its instruction that the jury should assess damages from the date of the misappropriation unfair use through the date on which the verdict is given.joint app x.according to the district court,that instruction told the jury to award damages accrued up through the date of the verdict,leaving no need for an additional award of prejudgment interest.
