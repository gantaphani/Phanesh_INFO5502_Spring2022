opinion of the court 
this is a trade secret misappropriation case arising under our diversity jurisdiction and governed by pennsylvania law.at trial,the defense to the misappropriation claim was the independent development of the allegedly misappropriated technique.this appeal by plaintiff appellant larry moore moore from a judgment entered on a jury verdict in favor of the defendant kulicke soffa industries,presents the vexing question whether,in pennsylvania trade secret law,independent development is an affirmative defense so that the proponent here bears not only the burden of production but also the risk of,or whether raising the defense only shifts onto the proponent the burden of going forward,with the risk of remaining with the plaintiff.although the question is close and difficult,we believe that pennsylvania would conclude that only the burden of production is shifted when the defendant raises independent development,and that the ultimate burden of persuasion remains on the plaintiff to prove that the defendant did not arrive at a technique similar to the trade secret through its own independent development.since moore appeal challenges the jury instruction,and this is what the district court charged,we will affirm the judgment.
is a manufacturer and marketer of wire bonding equipment to companies involved in making computer chips for use in connecting the extremely small wires from semiconductor terminals to other components of computer chips.in,moore,an engineer,submitted a technical paper to a consultant discussing a specific design approach and methodology for achieving greater speed and accuracy for the type of wire bonding machines that manufactured.after reviewing the paper,informed moore that it had no interest in the information contained in his proposal.however,some time later,moore learned that was using in its equipment a technique that he believed was similar to the technique and information contained in the paper he had submitted.moreover,moore asserted that had also obtained a patent using information similar to that contained in the proposal he had submitted to.
moore thereupon brought an action against in the district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania,setting forth a claim for trade secret misappropriation under pennsylvania state law and a federal claim for copyright infringement.at the conclusion of the trial,the district court instructed the jury 
if you find that the plaintiff has proven by a fair preponderance of the evidence that the defendant used the plaintiff trade secret,and that the defendant did not arrive at the relevant wire bonding technique through independent invention,then you should find in favor of the plaintiff.on the other hand,if you determine that the wire bonding technique used by the defendant was developed through defendant own independent efforts and invention,then you must find in favor of the defendant.
perhaps responding to the statement of counsel for that b urden of proof is a little slippery here,the district court had vocalized some concern about where to place the burden of proving independent development,representing that it had adopted the jury instruction proposed by but without the burden of proof on there.however,the language of the jury charge placed the burden of proving independent development on the plaintiff as noted above,the district court asked the jury,in the charge,to consider whether the plaintiff has proven by a fair preponderance of the evidence that the defendant used the plaintiff trade secret,and that the defendant did not arrive at the relevant wire bonding technique through independent invention.emphasis added.moreover,the court,in the generalized portion of the charge,placed the burden of proof on moore thus,under the court trial procedure,the burden of production shifted to to present some evidence of independent development,but moore,under the charge,retained the burden of proving independent development by a preponderance of the evidence.
ultimately,the jury answered no to the following interrogatory 
do you find that plaintiff has proven by a preponderance of the evidence that he owned a trade secret which was disclosed in confidence to defendant which defendant was not entitled to use or disclose without plaintiff permission 
although the interrogatory did not specifically mention independent development,the district court had instructed the jury in the charge,set forth supra,to consider whether independently developed the technique as part of its determination of whether the defendant used the plaintiff trade secret.by answering no to this interrogatory,the jury thus rendered a verdict for on the trade secret misappropriation claim.moore moved for a new trial under rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,which the district court denied.this appeal followed 
the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to and.we have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to.we exercise plenary review where the district court erred in formulating or applying the proper legal precept regarding the burden of proof in a jury instruction.see hook ernst young,cir where a jury charge is attacked for legal error we must determine whether the charge taken as a whole fairly and adequately submits the issues in the case to the jury.we will reverse only if the instruction was capable of confusing and thereby misleading the jury.quoting bennis gable,cir alteration in original citation omitted.
at the risk of carrying coals to newcastle,we discuss briefly the dual meaning of the term burden of proof.we note that t he two distinct concepts embodied in the term burden of proof may be referred to as the risk of nonpersuasion,sometimes called the burden of persuasion,and the duty of producing evidence or the burden of production,sometimes called the burden of going forward with the evidence.fleming james,geoffrey hazard,et,civil procedure ed.these two concepts can be distinguished by the fact that u nlike the burden of persuasion,the burden of production can shift back and forth between parties during the trial.larry teply ralph whitten,civil procedure ed.
at the outset of a trial,the plaintiff has both the burden of production and the burden of persuasion for each element of the prima facie case.once the plaintiff has met this burden,the defendant may proceed with an affirmative defense.at this point,the defendant has both the burden of production and the burden of persuasion for the affirmative defense.often,courts have confused the ideas of affirmative defense and negation by affirmative proof.fleming james,geoffrey hazard,et,civil procedure ed.a denial,as opposed to an affirmative defense,will simply shift the burden of production to the defendant to present evidence that would tend to rebut the plaintiff case,while the burden of persuasion remains with the plaintiff.if the defendant can not meet its burden of going forward by presenting some evidence,the plaintiff has met its burden of persuasion.but if the defendant presents some evidence to support the denial,the weighs the evidence,bearing in mind that the plaintiff retains the ultimate burden of persuasion.asserts that alleging independent development is a denial which shifts the burden of production but not the burden of persuasion to the defendant.in contrast,moore would have us conclude that independent development is an affirmative defense and has both the burden of production and persuasion.
under pennsylvania law,the prima facie elements of the tort of misappropriation of a trade secret are derived from the restatement first of torts.van products general welding fabricating,those elements are as follows the existence of a trade secret communication of the trade secret pursuant to a confidential relationship use of the trade secret,in violation of that confidence and harm to the plaintiff 
contends that evidence of independent development rebuts the third element of the prima facie case that the defendant used the plaintiff trade secret.it bases this contention on the meaning of use within the context of trade secret law.the tort of trade secret misappropriation provides inventors and owners with a state law based alternative to the patent system.see van products,at the inventor is put to his election he can keep his secret hidden and run the risk of independent discovery by others,or he can disclose his secret to the world and receive in return from the government a monopoly for years.thus,unlike the patent system,which provides a remedy for any use of a technique similar to the patented technique,trade secret misappropriation protects against the wrongful use of the trade secret itself it is the defendant theft of the plaintiff idea that this tort attempts to prevent.in other words,the element of use refers to improper use.
independent development thus appears to be strongly linked to the use element in trade secret misappropriation cases because if the defendant developed the idea without reference to the trade secret,it did not purloin the plaintiff idea.moreover,milgrim treatise on trade secrets includes a discussion of independent development under the broader heading of wrongful use or disclosure.milgrim on trade secrets d v.milgrim writes 
if defendant is not possessed of the training and skills necessary to develop a secret process independently,defendant use of the plaintiff process is likely to be presumed wrongful in the absence of convincing proof to the contrary.conversely,where defendant is possessed of substantial capacity to independently derive matter claimed secret by plaintiff,plaintiff may retain the burden of proving that defendant in fact misappropriated plaintiff matter.id.
in our view,it makes sense to tie independent development to the use element of trade secret misappropriation.if there is proof that the defendant independently developed a technique that resembles the trade secret,then the defendant did not use the trade secret.
because independent development is so closely linked to whether the defendant used the plaintiff trade secret,maintains that it is not an affirmative defense under pennsylvania law and that does not have the burden of persuasion.in support of this position,argues that affirmative defenses are generally distinguished from other denials primarily by the fact that affirmative defense s will require the averment of facts extrinsic to the plaintiff claim for relief.standard pennsylvania practice see also falcione cornell school.we understand argument to be that because independent development is simply a denial of the fact that it used moore technique,and not an argument extrinsic to the facts alleged by example the expiration of the statute of should conclude that independent development is not an affirmative defense.under this taxonomy,once the defendant has asserted independent development,the burden of production simply shifts to the defendant,but the defendant retains the burden of persuasion on the other hand,moore contends that the burden of proof of independent the burdens of production and be placed on the defendant and that independent development should be effectively considered an affirmative defense.he maintains that pennsylvania courts often place the burden of proof on the party that has the best access to information which could prove or disprove a fact,and here has better access to information which could prove it independently developed the technique.see human relations comm n,noting that pragmatic considerations dictate that party with access to facts should bear burden of proof.moreover,moore contends that independent development should be considered an affirmative defense because courts generally favor placing the burden of proof on the party who must prove a positive rather than the party who must prove a negative.standard pennsylvania practice noting that it is the general rule that the party having the negative of an issue will not have the burden of proof on such issue.
in predicting pennsylvania state law,we are guided by principles that are,though not always easy to apply.where the highest court has not ruled on the issue,we must consider relevant state precedents,analogous decisions,considered dicta,scholarly works,and any other reliable data tending convincingly to show how the highest court in the state would decide the issue at hand.nationwide mut.ins.buffetta,cir quoting mckenna ortho pharm,cir.since the pennsylvania supreme court has not addressed the independent use doctrine,and the superior court has not either,although falcione,see supra,does provide useful guidance we must look elsewhere.both parties cite to a number of cases in which pennsylvania law is arguably interpreted by courts they also cite cases interpreting the doctrine of independent development under other states laws.none of these cases is binding and there appears to be no consensus on the issue,although we cite a number of them in the margin we also note that the authors of the major treatises dealing with trade secret misappropriation come to different conclusions about which party has the ultimate burden of proving independent development we will therefore make our holding based on the general principles of what constitutes an affirmative defense under pennsylvania law.
we conclude that pennsylvania courts primarily distinguish affirmative defenses from other denials by the fact that affirmative defenses require the averment of facts extrinsic to the plaintiff claim for relief.for example,in falcione,the superior court of pennsylvania found that the avoidance of liability because of the rescission of a contract was an affirmative defense that must be pleaded as such under the heading of new matter because it is clearly extrinsic to the plaintiff claim for relief.at see also watson green,new matter properly contains averments of facts only if they are extrinsic to facts averred in the complaint.the superior court reasoned that affirmative defenses must be pled separately because they raise a new set of facts.by placing those facts under the separate heading new matter,the plaintiff will be on notice that it must address a new set of facts.
further support for this proposition can be found in the term new matter,which itself suggests that affirmative defenses require the establishment of a separate set of facts.see standard pennsylvania practice new matter is a matter which,taking all the allegations of the complaint to be true,is nevertheless a defense to the action,and includes affirmative defenses.citing pisiechko diaddorio.moreover,standard pennsylvania practice lists the following illustrations of a verments of a defendant which are intrinsic to the cause of action pleaded by the plaintiff that do not constitute a new matter 
a defense that the defendant city was operating a vehicle under an emergency was not an affirmative defense,but a denial of the plaintiff assertion of negligent operation and was not properly pleaded as a new matter.an allegation that the defendant was not in control of premises and that a third person was in control and an averment that an oral contract did not exist and that a written one with different terms did were denials and should not have been pleaded as new matter.in an action to recover a balance due from a former employer,deductions claimed in the answer for credits unauthorized by the defendant but allowed to a customer by the plaintiff,were not new matters.citations omitted.
from this we conclude that affirmative defenses in pennsylvania law require the establishment of facts extrinsic to the plaintiff complaint.considering the analysis above about the extrinsic nature of affirmative defenses and concluding that independent development is inextricably linked to whether the defendant used the plaintiff trade secret,we believe that pennsylvania would hold that independent development is not an affirmative defense,but that it only shifts the burden of going forward.
our analysis does not end here since the extrinsic fact requirement is not the only basis on which a countervailing argument is termed an affirmative defense.see fleming james,geoffrey hazard,et,civil procedure ed.these factors that determine whether an argument should be considered an affirmative defense include a formal test,the analytic distinction between negation of a fact and the avoidance of it by other facts,relative accessibility to the evidence,convenience,a desire to place handicaps against disfavored but permitted defenses,and the opposing party need for special notice.however,we conclude that the pennsylvania supreme court would not hold that independent development is an affirmative defense because of a desire to place handicaps against disfavored but permitted defenses.id.indeed pennsylvania law already makes it difficult for the plaintiff to recover under the tort of trade secret misappropriation,suggesting that pennsylvania would continue to favor the defendant in the trade secret context.
for example,in van products,the supreme court of pennsylvania limited the first element of trade secret misappropriation the requirement that the plaintiff possess a trade secret.the court held that under pennsylvania law,there is no trade secret if,at the time of disclosure or use by a misappropriator,the allegedly secret information could have been ascertained by inspection of sold articles or by reverse engineering.henry hope,at citing van products,at in which the pennsylvania supreme court concluded that the court of appeals for the seventh circuit was incorrect when it held that pennsylvania will not deny recovery merely because the design could have been obtained through inspection.quoting smith dravo,cir see also,siemens capital,calling into question the validity of smith after van products,which has been construed to have adopted the property view of trade secrets and to have shifted the emphasis from whether the conduct of the defendant conformed to its confidential relationship with the plaintiff to a close analysis of whether the information was truly a trade secret.
the fact that pennsylvania places the emphasis on whether the trade secret was truly a secret even when there is evidence that the defendant acted a way that other jurisdictions do that the supreme court would place the burden of proving independent development on the plaintiff for policy reasons.see new york spool industrial paper tube,citing cases in which it was no defense that the defendants could have arrived at similar processes through independent analysis that was theoretically possible but never actually undertaken smith petroleum iron works of ohio,cir the mere fact that the means by which a discovery is made are obvious can not advantage the competitor who by unfair means,or as the beneficiary of a broken faith,obtains the desired knowledge without himself paying the price in labor,money,or machines expended by the discoverer.
on the other hand,it is true that pennsylvania courts will often place the burden of proof on the party that has better access to facts that would prove or disprove the defense.see barrett otis elevator,if the existence or nonexistence of a fact can be demonstrated by one party to a controversy much more easily than by the other party,the burden of proof may be placed on that party who can discharge it most easily.admittedly,in the case at bar,has the best access to information which could prove or disprove that it independently development a technique similar to moore trade secret.however,pennsylvania courts have also held that t he mere fact that the employer is in possession of facts relating to employment decisions is not reason to discard the normal requirement that complainants prove their own cases.commonwealth of transp.pennsylvania human relations comm n.the fact that has better access to the information does not weigh heavily in our analysis because rule of the federal rules of civil procedure requires that the defendant,upon request,turn over relevant information to the plaintiff during the discovery process.moreover,by shifting the burden of going forward to,we are assured that must present some evidence of independent development to succeed.
additionally,pennsylvania courts are often reticent to place upon a party the burden of proving a negative.see barrett,at the burden of proof may be placed on the party who must prove the existence of a fact rather than on the party who must prove its nonexistence.however,we conclude that this policy is counterbalanced by the normal requirement that complainants prove their own cases.commonwealth of,at.see also gypsum birdsboro steel foundry mach,but where a negative is essential to the existence of a right,the party claiming the right generally has the burden of proving such negative.citation omitted standard pennsylvania practice where,however,proof of a negative is essential to show the existence of a right,the party claiming the right ordinarily has the burden of proving the negative.thus,where the plaintiff,in showing negligence in the operation of a railroad train,relies on the fact that the train whistle was not sounded,the plaintiff has the burden of proving the negative.citations omitted.
in other words,where proving a negative lie s at the foundation of plaintiff right of action,the burden of proof will remain with the plaintiff.carl grand union.since independent development is inextricably linked to use in trade secret misappropriation,we conclude that it is necessary to disprove independent order to meet the burden of proving the element of use.
in sum,while there are some indications that the pennsylvania supreme court would conclude that independent development is an affirmative defense,the more persuasive factors suggest that raising independent development simply shifts the burden of production to the defendant.in particular,pennsylvania courts seem to distinguish affirmative defenses from denials by the fact that affirmative defenses require the averment of facts extrinsic to the plaintiff complaint.however,independent development is intrinsic to whether the defendant used the plaintiff trade secret,supporting the conclusion that independent development is not an affirmative defense.
pennsylvania law also suggests that the courts would not place the burden of proving independent development on the defendant for policy reasons the pennsylvania supreme court has already made it difficult for plaintiffs to recover in a claim for trade secret misappropriation.although the defendant has better access to the facts to prove independent development,this is not a strong factor in favor of making independent development an affirmative defense here considering that the plaintiff can gain access to the defendant information through discovery.finally,while pennsylvania courts do not generally place the burden of proof on a party that must prove a negative,we note that this factor is counterbalanced by the requirement that a party must prove a negative where it is essential to establish the existence of a right.since independent development is essential to whether the defendant used the plaintiff trade secret,we conclude that the plaintiff must disprove independent development in order to make out the elements of the tort of trade secret misappropriation.
thus,when we consider the factors which aid in determining whether an argument must be pled as affirmative analytic distinction between negation of a fact and the avoidance of it by other facts,relative accessibility to the evidence,convenience a desire to place handicaps against disfavored but permitted defenses,and the opposing party need for special notice,see fleming james,geoffrey hazard,et,civil procedure ed it appears that independent development is not an affirmative defense under pennsylvania law.
our decision is buttressed by analogy to independent creation in copyright law where the ultimate burden of proving independent development by a preponderance of the evidence remains on the plaintiff.like the doctrine of independent development,under independent creation a defendant can show that it did not steal the plaintiff copyrighted material by presenting evidence that it developed the idea without reference to the copyrighted material.in keeler brass continental brass,the court of appeals for the fourth circuit,in concluding that the doctrine of independent creation in copyright law only shifts the burden of production to the defendant,explained the distinction between rebuttable inferences and sh
