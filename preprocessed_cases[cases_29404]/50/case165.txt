rules and of the california rules of court establish the standard and procedures for courts to employ when a request is made to seal a court record that would otherwise be public,or to unseal a record previously ordered sealed.this appeal presents the first opportunity for an examination of these rules and their operation.we conclude that these rules vest a trial court with a considerable amount of discretion in deciding whether to seal or unseal portions of a judicial record.we further conclude,in light of the strong presumption in favor of public access,that the trial court here did not abuse its discretion in deciding to unseal records over an objection that the materials constituted proprietary trade secrets.
background 
it appears from the record that in and a number of complaints framed as class actions were filed alleging that defendants providian financial corporation,providian national bank,providian bank,and providian bancorp services defendants had improperly assessed a number of fees and charges to holders of credit cards.the judicial council granted a petition to coordinate the actions and designated judge stuart pollak of the san francisco superior court the coordination trial judge see code civ,rules.thereafter,and in accordance with a stipulation of the parties,the trial court filed a protective order allowing any party producing discovery to designate material as confidential,subject to court order if disclosure would violate a personal,financial,or other interest protected by law,such as a trade secret or other confidential research,development,or commercial information,and that such disclosure threatens to cause serious harm that outweighs the public interest in disclosure of such information.the order further provided that any confidential material shall be filed under seal,but that it was without prejudice to the right of any party or to apply to the court for modification of this order or for any order permitting disclosure of confidential material beyond the terms of this order.
in connection with the plaintiffs motion to certify the class,defendants filed under seal a large number of documents designated as confidential.at about the same time believing that defendants had vastly documents as confidential,the plaintiffs moved that all documents filed with the court be immediately unsealed and the confidential designation on such documents be removed.at this point the hearst corporation hearst,describing itself as an intervenor,moved that the protective order be reconsidered in light of the strong public policy in favor of openness of judicial records.defendants opposed plaintiffs motion to unseal,claiming that it was overbroad and that granting it would compromise confidential and proprietary information protected by california uniform trade secrets act civ.code.the trial court denied hearst motion on october.plaintiffs motion was referred to a retired superior court judge acting as a referee.
near the end of december of,the referee submitted a report in which he recommended that plaintiffs motion be granted in part,and that exhibits submitted in connection with the class certification motion should be unsealed.on january,while the trial court was considering whether to adopt the referee recommendations,rules and became effective.based on this development,hearst renewed its request that the trial court examine the records and unseal those materials which did not meet the requirements of the new rules for remaining immune from public access specifically,hearst argued that if defendants wished to continue to prevent disclosure of material they claimed constituted trade secrets,the burden of proving so was now on defendants.defendants responded that of the exhibits contain core proprietary information and should remain confidential.to support that claim defendants submitted declarations by dawn greiner,a vice president with responsibility for marketing in providian credit card business and robert klein,a marketing consultant.the trial court returned the matter to the referee for reconsideration in light of rules and.the referee submitted a report in which he determined that defendants adequately identify an overriding interest in the whole of each of the following documents that overcomes the right of public access with respect to exhibits,but recommended that exhibits be unsealed.defendants objected to the latter advisory recommendation see code civ,subd.c,subd.b.
the trial court eventual order recites the procedural history of the dispute and the legal standards established by rule.after discussing the nature of the disputed documents,the court ruled after reviewing each document at issue with these standards in mind,and with providian supporting declarations as they pertain to each document,the court concludes that none of the documents at issue should remain under seal.defendants filed a notice of appeal the day the trial court order was filed 
the legal standards 
defendants are here to argue that of the documents ordered unsealed by the trial court contain trade secrets and proprietary information that is sufficiently sensitive and current that they should have been left protected against disclosure.among the arguments presented by defendants concerning the examination of an unsealing order made pursuant to rules and is the fundamental issue of the standard of review to be employed.
in nbc subsidiary,superior court cal th,d,nbc subsidiary,our supreme court undertook an exhaustive examination of the first amendment issues involved with restricting or closing public access to trials.in the course of doing so it noted that n umerous reviewing courts have found a first amendment right of access to civil litigation documents filed in court as a basis for adjudication.id.at,fn,d.having surveyed the relevant state and federal authorities,the court formulated this rule b efore substantive courtroom proceedings are closed or transcripts are ordered sealed,a trial court must hold a hearing and expressly find that i there exists an overriding interest supporting closure sealing ii there is a substantial probability that the interest will be prejudiced absent closure sealing iii the proposed closure sealing is narrowly tailored to serve the overriding interest and iv there is no less restrictive means of achieving the overriding interest.id.at,d,original italics fns.omitted.
rules and were adopted to comply with the supreme court decision rule requires the express findings enumerated in nbc subsidiary and also directs that they must be incorporated in the order sealing any part of a record.rule sets out the procedures to be followed in sealing or unsealing a record 
rules and do not apply to records that courts must keep confidential by law.judicial council of,advisory com,reprinted at pt.west ann.codes,rules,supra,foll.rule,quoted in fn,ante.the mere presence of claimed trade secrets does not carry a mandatory confidentiality requirement.such a requirement is imposed only in actions initiated pursuant to the uniform trade secrets act for misappropriation of trade secrets.see,in an action under this title,a court shall preserve the secrecy of an alleged trade secret.the actions commenced against defendants were not of this nature.accordingly,and notwithstanding defendants claim that trade secrets are involved,rules and state the governing principles.
one of the novel issues presented by this appeal is the appropriate standard of review for the trial court order.defendants submit that we must examine the issues de novo,paying no deference to any legal or factual determination made by the trial court.hearst submits that the factual determinations made by the trial court must be upheld if they have the support of substantial evidence,and his ultimate decision to unseal must be sustained unless we decide that the trial court abused the discretion granted it by rule d.hearst is correct.
rule d provides that a trial court may order that a record be filed under seal only if it makes the requisite findings.this is the traditional language of discretionary power,gyler mission ins.cal d,kemble mcphaill cal,santa cruz heaton cal,and courts throughout the country have treated the scope of public access as committed to a trial court discretion,national children center,brown williamson tobacco cir,wilson american motors cir,marriage of flynn,state lesinski ohio app ohio app d,general tire,kepple.if a decision involves the exercise of discretion by a trial court,a reviewing court will reverse that decision only if it concludes that the discretion was abused,mission imports,superior court cal d,witkin,cal.procedure ed.appeal.the appropriate test for abuse of discretion is whether the trial court exceeded the bounds of reason.shamblin brattain cal d.abuse of discretion was the standard used prior to adoption of rules and,gilbert national enquirer,th,d whitney whitney d,and there is nothing in the history of these rules to suggest that a different standard was intended.
it is also clear that if a trial court exercises its discretion and orders a record sealed,that decision is made after,and in light of,the factors enumerated in rule d.for example,in the context of this case it is clear that the defendants basis for overriding interest against unsealing is the protection of trade secrets,which may be a valid reason for restricting access.see nbc subsidiary,supra,cal th,fn,d,nixon warner communications,d.the legislature has defined trade secrets as information,including a formula,pattern,compilation,program,device,method,technique,or process that derives independent economic value,actual or potential,from not being generally known to the public or to other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use and is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy,subd.d.the courts of this state have traditionally treated the issue of whether information constitutes a trade secret as a question of fact,morlife,perry th,d moss,adams shilling d,wilson d.there may be a number of related factual determinations,such as whether the trade secret is in fact secret,ashland management janien,daktronics,mcafee,whether the information derive s independent economic value,bernier merrill air engineers me,weins sporleder,whether a party made reasonable efforts to maintain secrecy,paint brush neu,trandes guy atkinson cir,and whether disclosure will cause damage,in re iowa freedom of information council cir.a trial court express or implied resolution of purely factual issues will be upheld on appeal if supported by substantial evidence,people louis cal d,roemer pappas d.
these are the standards of review cited by hearst,but defendants argue that our review of the trial court order should be de novo.they reason that interpretation of a statute or rule is a question of law and is evaluated de novo by the appeals court and where the facts are undisputed,the ultimate conclusion to be drawn from such facts is a question of law.however,rules and are not vague or ambiguous and need no interpretation.defendants are mistaken,however,in assuming that the statements contained in the greiner and klein declarations settle the facts.
the trial court was entitled to consider the entire record before it,hill national collegiate athletic cal th,d,estate of beard th,d.it was not obliged to accept the greiner and klein declarations as dispositive.foreman clark fallon cal d,langley pacific gas cal d,rodney karen th,d.this is important because it was defendants burden to prove the existence of trade secrets see,american paper packaging products,kirgan d.cal.francisco inv.vrionis d,and to overcome the presumption in favor of public access.rule c nbc subsidiary,supra,cal th,d.if the trial court found the declarations conclusory or otherwise unpersuasive,it could conclude,as it did,that defendants had failed to demonstrate any overriding interest that overcomes the right of public access rule d.where different inferences may reasonably be drawn from undisputed evidence,the conclusion of the jury or trial judge must be accepted by the appellate court.witkin,cal.procedure,supra,appeal.
review of an order to unseal is unlike review of an order to seal records.were we reviewing an order to seal,we would proceed in two stages.first we would examine the express findings of fact required by rule d to determine if they are supported by substantial evidence.the examination for substantial evidence is made on the basis of the entire record,hill national collegiate athletic,supra,cal th,d,estate of beard,supra,th,d.next,we would decide whether,in light of and on the basis of these findings,the trial court abused its discretion in ordering a record sealed.
here,however,we review the decision to unseal parts of a record already filed under seal.motions to unseal records are governed by rule h,which does not impose a requirement of express findings.defendants ask us to impose such requirement.they maintain that unless express findings are required for decisions to unseal there will be no basis for a reviewing court to know what specific facts were found by the trial court in making its decision and therefore it would be difficult to defer to the court factual findings when they are nowhere in the written order.we disagree.there is nothing to suggest that the judicial council in framing rules and to require findings for sealing inadvertently omitted that requirement for unsealing.indeed,in light of the first amendment issues involved,that distinction is not at all surprising.moreover,it is not our function to rewrite the rules to impose a requirement of express findings for ruling on a motion to unseal,napa valley wine train,public utilities com.cal d,people woodhead cal d.in deciding to unseal records,which is the functional equivalent of denying a motion to seal them,a trial court is clearly,if impliedly,determining that there is no overriding interest that overcomes the right of public access to the record,that the other requirements of rule d have not been met.as shown above,the nature of the claimed overriding interest will also help define the scope of issues which may be germane to that interest.moreover,the papers submitted to the trial court may also identify subjects for implied findings.finally,there may be other sources in a given case,which furnish insight to implied findings.for example,in this case the discovery referee report included a number of what could be treated as proposed findings,which the trial court may be deemed to have impliedly adopted 
lacking any express written findings by the trial court,the scope of our review of the order begins by determining whether appropriate findings we may infer in support of the order that exhibits be unsealed have the support of substantial evidence.the examination for substantial evidence is made on the basis of the entire record,which in this case would include all of the exhibits,including those that the judge refused to unseal 
application of the standards 
the documents at issue fall into two general groupings.in light of the importance of secrecy claimed by defendants in the are still under the possibility that our supreme court might reach a different conclusion,our discussion of those documents must be circumspect.see champion superior court d.
the first group consists of nine documents that the trial court designated in its order as scripts.the description is accurate,for the in length from two to a series of questions and answers familiar to all who have had the peace of their evening meal disturbed by a call from a telemarketer.much of the scripts are obviously intended to be read verbatim over the telephone.for example,if the person called responds that she is not interested to a particular service offered by defendants,or i just want information,there is a specific response to be read.the scripts deal with a number of services and programs offered by defendants.
the second group of documents includes a number of what appear to be internally circulated memoranda dating from june to march,all written by andrew kahr.all save two of the remaining memoranda were generated during.like the scripts,the memoranda range over a number of the services and programs offered by defendants.
finally,there are two miscellaneous documents.one is titled block tackle consisting of two pages with a page of handwritten notes.next is a document titled credit protection sales training.couched in very general language,it appears to be the outline for acquainting marketers with purely positive features of the credit protection program.appended to it are copies of three letters from customers lauding the program 
with respect to the statutory definition of a trade secret,division two of this court has noted that a trade secret has an intrinsic value which is based upon,or at least preserved by,being safeguarded from disclosure.pillsbury,madison sutro schectman th,d.public disclosure,that is the absence of secrecy,is fatal to the existence of a trade secret.if an individual discloses his trade secret to others who are under no obligation to protect the confidentiality of the information,or otherwise publicly discloses the secret,his property right is extinguished.ruckelshaus monsanto,d see legis.com,west ann.ed.foll,the trade secret can be destroyed through public knowledge milgrim on trade secrets,unprotected disclosure will terminate and,at least prospectively,forfeit the trade secret status.a person or entity claiming a trade secret is also required to make efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy,subd.d.a leading treatise has collected the cases of successful and unsuccessful claims of secrecy protection among the factors repeatedly noted are restricting access and physical segregation of the information,confidentiality agreements with employees,and marking documents with warnings or reminders of confidentiality.trade secrets practice in cal.ed.
the scripts 
the discovery referee appears to have believed that the telemarketing scripts were not trade secrets because they had been disclosed to the public we may infer in support of its order that the trial court agreed.is such an implied finding supported by substantial evidence we conclude that it is.
both the greiner and the klein declarations have statements directed at satisfying the statutory definition of a trade secret as undisclosed information possessing economic value.see,subd.d.the statements are,however,conclusionary and lacking in helpful specifics.for example,greiner states in her declaration each of the documents at issue is considered proprietary and confidential by providian.providian has developed the information contained in the documents at issue over a number of a very significant cost and by taking very significant allow providian to compete effectively in the market place for credit cards and related products.klein states in his declaration that in my opinion,the documents would have significant value to providian competitors in general these documents represent information which is not known outside the business,which has value to both the business and competitors,which has required a substantial amount of effort and money to develop,and which could not otherwise be acquired or duplicated by competitors.the generality begins to diminish when attention is directed at the scripts.greiner states that providian has invested significant amounts of money and time in the development and refinement of it s scripts,which are not made available to the public.providian competitors could use the scripts to unfairly compete with providian.klein states when these scripts are actually put into the market,they are proven commodities that a competitor could benefit from by copying as closely as possible.the only germane point made by klein in the single paragraph of his declaration devoted to the scripts is that no customer on whom a given script was used would hear more than a fragment of the script based on that individual characteristics and responses.greiner made the same point.
but it is also reasonable to infer from the we do,in support of the trial court order see witkin,cal.procedure,supra,appeal,that the scripts,if not all at once,then at least in piecemeal fashion,were disclosed to defendants customers.they have no other purpose.the scripts are sales pitches,and once they have been used,sales pitches are not treated as trade secrets,eutectic welding alloys corporation west,allen hub cap heaven,health care management mccombes so d.
the kahr memoranda 
kahr apparent role was to review marketing strategies and proposals being developed.the memoranda at issue deal primarily with those subjects,but there are numerous points where blunt criticisms of personnel and management procedures are injected.the referee was understandably skeptical that such memoranda constituted trade secrets and we may infer that the trial court shared that view.
in addition to possessing actual or potential economic value,the other part of the definition of a trade secret is that the information must have been protected by efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy,subd.d.as previously mentioned,whether a party claiming a trade secret undertook reasonable efforts to maintain secrecy is a question of fact,trandes guy atkinson,supra,and it may be implicit in a determination that the information does not qualify as a trade secret,also a question of fact see citations at fn.and accompanying text,ante.
in her declaration greiner addressed the issue of defendants efforts to maintain secrecy 
providian takes a number of steps to keep confidential documents such as these.we have corporatewide policies,which are executed each year by all employees.attached hereto as exhibit is the portion of the corporatewide policies that addresses proprietary and confidential information.as reflected in exhibit,all employees have an obligation to secure,hold in strictest confidence,and to protect the company proprietary information from disclosure to the public or anyone not authorized to receive it.providian includes within the definition of proprietary information the company strategic plan,new product plans,consumer marketing research and information,business results and financial information,trade secrets data,programs,software,database developments and any other confidential knowledge,data,or proprietary whatever form or by for the company.in addition,employees are required to sign a proprietary information and confidentiality agreement,an example of which is attached as exhibit.through policies and agreements such as these,providian attempts to ensure that its proprietary information is kept confidential and not disclosed publicly.
these policies are implemented in various ways.access to providian business offices is strictly controlled.providian screens potential employees including conducting criminal background checks,credit bureau checks,and finger printing in an effort to identify those who might present a risk to the security of the business.the offices here in san francisco,where most of these types of documents are stored,are only accessible with magnetic key cards assigned to employees or through a receptionist.for many of these documents,we also have informal practices to limit the number of copies that are produced.for example,briefs although circulated to various persons for approval,are distributed to a limited group on a need to know basis only.additionally,we have encouraged employees to limit the copying of briefs only to the extent necessary for use with ongoing work or project.
kahr served as a consultant for providian for a number of years.his services were provided pursuant to contracts under which the confidentiality of providian proprietary information was protected.pursuant to those contracts,kahr was given access to extensive providian confidential information 
perhaps so,but in its capacity as the trier of fact,the trial court was not obliged to base his decision on those statements just because there were no counter declarations,foreman clark fallon,supra,cal d,rodney karen,supra,th,d.as previously noted,given the fact that only defendants knew the contents of the documents,hearst could not be expected to produce any such counter declarations.see fn,ante frye felder d.expressing reservation at accepting facts alleged in plaintiff uncontradicted declaration,which facts the defendant is in no position to deny.
moreover,the entire record discloses that defendants had an additional security measure,one that was not used for any of the documents defendants now wish to keep undisclosed.for example,one of the documents the trial court ordered should remain under seal is a report on the amount of suspected poaching of defendants clients by other credit card providers.each page of the report is stamped confidential,and the front page of the report is stamped do not copy or distribute.the law recognizes the truth of the adage that actions speak louder than words.see,in re menna cal th,d,claim that debts would be repaid belied by fact that debts had been discharged in bankruptcy crestview cemetery dieden cal d,contract construed in light of contracting parties acts under the contract legis.com,pt.west ann.ed.foll,nonassertive conduct is not regarded as hearsay because there is frequently a guarantee of the trustworthiness of the inference to be drawn from such nonassertive conduct because the actor has based his actions on the correctness of his belief.the failure of defendants to give the kahr any of the documents at issue on heightened treatment reasonably could be deemed by the trial court as circumstantial evidence that defendants had not previously treated them as trade secrets.
did the trial court abuse its discretion 
the preceding discussion establishes that there is substantial evidence to support findings that the documents the trial court ordered unsealed did not qualify as trade secrets either because of the subject matter,because they had already been disclosed,or because defendants had not taken reasonable efforts to protect them.in that defendants have failed to demonstrate that the court was misapplying the applicable legal standard,these findings are tantamount to a showing that the trial court did not abuse the discretion vested in it by rules and.see,hill national collegiate athletic,supra,cal th,d,conservatorship of scharles d.two additional considerations reinforce that conclusion.
first the leading treatise excludes as trade secrets what is called general business,which it defines as the informational and experiential expertise related to practical application of specifics,such as processes.milgrim on trade secrets,supra.much,if not most,of the documents ordered unsealed would appear to come within this definition.the treatise goes on to state if protection is sought for a very broad accumulation of knowledge and experience,a court might reject such claim as an attempt to simply cover knowledge and skill.accordingly,when asserting methods and techniques and to be trade secrets,a reasonable degree of precision and specificity is appropriate,fns.omitted.the material defendants sought to protect from disclosure does encompass a very broad accumulation of knowledge and experience.moreover,according to the greiner and klein declarations,defendants claimed trade secret status for virtually every section of every document.they did not propose that measures such as editing or redacting the documents rule d,e ii that might have reached a reasonable accommodation between their interests and the strong presumption in favor of public access.in fact they actually opposed redacting when the subject was raised by the referee.defendants argued,i f,instead of requesting that each entire document be sealed,providian had parsed each document line by line,it is certainly possible that some fragments could have been left without disclosing the proprietary content.but the remainder would have been so fragmented and,therefore,misleading and out of context,that it would not have informed the public about what was going on in this case.defendants were,in effect,framing and submitting the issue on an basis.even if it is possible that a fragment here or a paragraph there might qualify as a trade secret see fn,ante,defendants spurned such a approach.they can not now fault the trial court for following their lead.a trial court may not be held to have abused its discretion as to a particular issue which it was never asked to consider.martin of fresno d.
defendants renew their argument that redaction was not an option because what would be left would be misleading.although the documents are peppered with abbreviations and industry jargon that may not be familiar to lay people,defendants do not explain in what fashion redacted documents would deceive readers.in light of defendants history of defining confidential material as broadly as possible,it would not be improper for the trial court to view their latest effort with considerable skepticism and conclude that the scope of their proposed record sealing was neither narrowly tailored nor the least restrictive means to protect any interest against disclosure.rule d.
second,this was not a simple dispute with a limited cast,but a number of class actions to the plaintiffs involve a nationwide class of millions.defendants methods of soliciting its credit card customers were at the heart of that dispute.there is thus an undeniable force to hearst argument that there is great and legitimate public interest in precisely how providian went about trying to sell its various products and services to the public.when that interest is augmented by the strong presumption in favor of public access reflecting a first principle that the people have the right to know what is done in their courts in re shortridge cal,a decision by the trial court that defendants had not made out the case for an overriding interest that overcomes the right of public access rule d was no abuse of discretion.
the order is affirmed.the parties shall bear their respective costs of appeal.
rule.sealed records.a applicability 
rules apply to records sealed or proposed to be sealed by court order.
these rules do not apply to records that are required to be kept confidential by law.these rules also do not apply to discovery motions and records filed or lodged in connection with discovery motions or proceedings.the rules do apply to discovery materials that are used at trial or submitted as a basis for adjudication of matters other than discovery motions or proceedings.
b definitions 
record.unless the context indicates otherwise,record as used in this rule means all or a portion of any document,paper,exhibit,transcript,or other thing filed or lodged with the court.
sealed.a sealed record is a record that by court order is not open to inspection by the public.
lodged.a lodged record is a record that is temporarily placed or deposited with the court but not filed.
c court records presumed to be open unless confidentiality is required by law,court records are presumed to be open.
d express findings required to seal records the court may order that a record be filed under seal only if it expressly finds that 
there exists an overriding interest that overcomes the right of public access to the record 
the overriding interest supports sealing the record 
a substantial probability exists that the overriding interest will be prejudiced if the record is not sealed 
the proposed sealing is narrowly tailored and 
no less restrictive means exist to achieve the overriding interest.
