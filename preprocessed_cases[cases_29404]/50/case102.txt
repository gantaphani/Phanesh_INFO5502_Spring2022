leif hauge appeals the district court decision finding him in contempt of that court march,order the order,which adopted hauge and energy recovery,eri march,settlement agreement the agreement.for the reasons set forth below,this court reverses the contempt finding and vacates the injunction.
background 
the dispute between hauge and his former employer,eri,began more than thirteen years ago over ownership of intellectual property rights related to pressure exchangers,a type of energy recovery device used in reverse osmosis.on march,the parties entered into the agreement resolving the litigation.three days later,the district court adopted the agreement and issued the order,stating that eri was to be the sole owner of three patents and one pending patent application patent,and,and patent application,which later issued as patent 
the agreement and subsequent order obligated hauge to transfer ownership not only of the patents,but also all other intellectual property and other rights relating to pressure exchanger technology the agreement and order.the agreement states t his assignment and transfer of rights is not intended to extend to inventions by hauge made after the date of this agreement.the agreement also contains a clause,prohibiting hauge from making or selling energy recovery devices for use in reverse osmosis salt water desalination for two years from the date of the agreement.
after the expiration of the clause,on august,hauge filed a provisional patent application,titled pressure exchanger,and filed a utility application one year later.patent the patent issued on december.its abstract describes a pressure exchanger for transferring pressure energy from a fluid stream to fluid stream.patent,at 
in,hauge arranged a meeting with eri on behalf of his new company,isobaric strategies,isobarix.in subsequent correspondence,hauge wrote the main topic under consideration was the possibility of uniting all pressure exchanger technology and intellectual property rights under the umbrella of eri and the potential benefits to those concerned.eri ultimately declined to get involved in hauge project and wished him success with current and future endeavors.after eri rejection of hauge proposal,hauge,through isobarix,began selling a pressure exchanger based on the patent,called xpr.in,hauge created a consulting agreement for two eri employees,tristan nillo and james coyle,regarding services they could provide to isobarix they ultimately contracted with isobarix.
on september,eri filed a motion for order to show cause,alleging hauge was using eri proprietary technology in the manufacture of the xpr pressure exchanger,in violation of the district court order.eri submitted the declaration of an expert who testified that hauge and isobarix are using pressure exchanger technology from,in both the design and manufacture of the isobarix pressure exchanger,which the expert opined is virtually identical to the eri pressure exchanger in terms of operation.at the hearing,hauge counsel argued that eri had failed to show that the allegedly proprietary technology was protectable as a trade secret,and argued that hauge was not prohibited from using the technology because the agreement related only to transfer of ownership of the patents and proprietary technology the agreement.
after holding a show cause hearing on june,the court entered an order the contempt order finding that allowing hauge to develop new products using the very technology he assigned to eri solely because those new inventions the agreement would render the settlement agreement and its assignment of ownership rights useless.the court entered judgment that hauge was in violation of the order,found him in contempt,and further enjoined him and isobarix from manufacturing and selling pressure exchangers and replacement parts for eri pressure exchangers.the court also awarded eri attorneys fees and ordered it to file a request for damages and reasonable attorneys fees within thirty days.
in september,hauge filed a motion for order to stay the permanent injunction,which this court granted,stating t he district court june,o rder,including the provision enjoining hauge and isobarix from manufacturing and selling pressure exchangers and replacement parts for eri pressure exchangers,is stayed pending appeal.order at,energy recovery hauge,ecf order granting motion to stay.
discussion 
jurisdiction 
this court has jurisdiction over interlocutory orders modifying an injunction.see c.
even though no final disposition has been made regarding the amount of contempt damages and attorneys fees,the district court contempt order is appealable under c because it modified the scope of the order.in relevant part,the order declared eri the sole owner of all intellectual property and other rights relating to pressure exchanger technology predating this order.in contrast,the contempt order for the first time prohibits hauge from engaging in certain acts,and therefore modifies the order.specifically,the contempt order enjoins hauge from manufacturing and selling pressure exchangers and replacement parts for eri pressure exchangers.accordingly,because it modifies the substance of the order,the contempt order is appealable.
ii.standard of review 
regional circuit law governs contempt proceedings that do not raise issues unique to patent law.schaefer fan,j d.in the fourth circuit,a district court grant or denial of a civil contempt motion is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.ashcraft conoco,cir.when a district court decision is based on an interpretation of its own order,our review is even more deferential because district courts are in the best position to interpret their own orders.jth tax,h r block tax servs,cir citing vaughns bd.of,cir.however,c ontempt is a weighty penalty and should not be casually imposed.in re wilson,wl,at cir see also tivo echostar,en banc contempt is a severe remedy,and should not be resorted to where there is a fair ground of doubt as to the wrongfulness of the defendant conduct.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
an abuse of discretion may be found when the district court decision is guided by erroneous legal principles or rests upon a clearly erroneous factual finding.brown nucor,cir quoting westberry gislaved gummi ab,cir.
iii.the contempt finding 
to establish civil contempt,clear and convincing evidence must support each of the following elements 
the existence of a valid decree of which the alleged contemnor had actual or constructive knowledge that the decree was in the movant favor that the alleged contemnor by its conduct violated the terms of the decree,and had knowledge at least constructive knowledge of such violations and that the movant suffered harm as a result.
ashcraft,at citation omitted.at issue in this case is element whether hauge by his conduct violated any terms of the district court order.
hauge argues he did not violate any provision of the order.he contends that in reaching the agreement the parties were both aware of the possibility that he would eventually compete with eri by selling devices in the pressure exchanger industry.as support,he claims the agreement only required transfer of his ownership rights to the intellectual property the agreement the clause had a limited duration and the agreement explicitly provided that the transfer of ownership rights did not extend to inventions after the date of the agreement.eri responds that hauge is free to develop and commercialize new technology relating to the energy recovery field he is not,however,able to appropriate the very pressure exchanger technology that he explicitly transferred to eri in.appellee br.
eri further emphasizes the tremendous effort and money spent developing the allegedly proprietary technology the agreement.appellee br.to eri,hauge is necessarily employing the same proprietary technology he agreed to transfer.it relies on evidence that hauge hired two of eri employees who set up isobarix facility,similar to that of eri facility,and that the isobarix pressure exchanger is made out of essentially the same ceramic material as eri,the manipulation of which requires special techniques not
