we shall affirm the judgment for respondents.in the unpublished portion of the opinion,we reject appellant attack on the special verdicts,concluding that they are supported by the evidence and by the law.in the published portion of the opinion,we address and reject appellant procedural and substantive challenges to the trial court pretrial preemption ruling.
background 
the parties to this appeal are plaintiff and appellant multimedia,kcm,and defendants and respondents bank of america technology operations bato,bank of america national association bana,and bank of america corporation ba.this litigation arose out of a business relationship,in which appellant supplied technology services to respondents or related entities,including ba predecessor,bank of america national savings trust association ntsa.
the contracts 
the parties entered two written contracts,one in and another in.contract documentation included appendices and work orders.
the technology 
appellant developed prototypes for two banking applications palm vii,which allowed bank customers to use a handheld wireless device to access their account information and gating,which simplified customers access to online banking services following a merger between nations bank and ba predecessor,by allowing a single or sso.the software for both applications was derived from preexisting technology known as wirelessproxy,which had to be customized for respondents.appellant claimed the two applications derived from wirelessproxy source code core technology as a trade secret 
pleadings pretrial proceedings 
this action was filed in june.the sole named defendant in the original complaint was bato,but allegations also were asserted against appellant former employee,allen tam.the complaint asserted causes of action for misappropriation of trade secrets conversion breach of contract and unjust enrichment.the complaint alleged that bato misappropriated the technology used in the two banking applications.as characterized in appellant trial brief,tam took the trade secrets to the bank in exchange for its promise of employment.in its answer,bato disputed those allegations.
the litigation generated an extensive pretrial procedural history,including multiple demurrers and complaint amendments,as well as several unsuccessful motions for summary adjudication or summary judgment.
by the time the case went to trial in february,the operative pleading was appellant fifth amended complaint.the named defendants were respondents bato,ba,and bana,plus appellant former employee allen tam.the causes of action asserted in this pleading were trade secret misappropriation breach of confidence conversion breach of contract tortious interference with contract and unfair competition.the conversion claim involved a laptop computer it was asserted against tam alone.the other five causes of action were asserted against all defendants.appellant claims against tam were stayed prior to trial because of his bankruptcy.
in february,just prior to trial,the court heard a number of in limine motions.immediately thereafter,the court took up an issue raised in respondents trial brief,statutory preemption.after entertaining written and oral argument on the issue,the court dismissed three causes of action of appellant fifth amended complaint on the ground that they were preempted by california uniform trade secrets act,et this ruling eliminated appellant second cause of action for breach of confidence,its fifth cause of action for interference with contract,and its sixth cause of action for unfair competition.appellant confirmed that it would dismiss its fourth cause of action for breach of contract,if it had not done so already.thus,by the time of trial,appellant sole remaining cause of action against respondents was its first cause of action,for trade secret misappropriation.
jury trial 
the case was tried over the course of approximately eight weeks,from late february to late april.
the trial was aptly described as lengthy and complex by respondents in their opposition to appellant motion.as respondents further observed there more than exhibits were received in evidence.each side presented multiple experts.on some points,the evidence was sharply in conflict.as appellant observed in reply,thousands of pages of testimony were generated during trial.respondents witness list included more than three dozen names.appellant many witnesses included two of its principals,sing koo and connie chun,who each testified for several days.
among the issues that appellant pressed at trial was its claim that chun signature on the contract had been forged.both sides presented handwriting experts forensic document examiners to testify about this claim.
during trial,appellant sought leave to amend its complaint to change the identity of the contracting party to the december agreement from respondent ba to its predecessor ntsa,and to reflect appellant position that the november agreement was not valid.over respondents objection,the court allowed the amendment.the matter thus reached the jury on appellant sixth amended complaint,which was filed april.that pleading asserted a single cause of action against respondents for misappropriation of trade secrets.
on april and,the parties delivered lengthy closing arguments to the jury.
on april,the court instructed the jury and deliberations began.
verdict and judgment 
on april,the day after it began deliberating,the jury returned special verdicts for respondents.as reflected in the special verdicts,the jury found that appellant failed to prove that it is more likely than not that it is the owner of trade secrets contained in the palm vii wireless banking application or in the gating server application.the jury also found that appellant made its misappropriation claims in bad faith.
on may,the court entered judgment for respondents.
proceedings 
appellant moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict,or,in the alternative,for a new trial.respondents opposed the motion,and the court denied it in july.
in august,respondents moved for attorney fees.appellant opposed the motion.the motion was heard and granted on september.on october,the court entered its formal order awarding respondents more than million in fees and costs.
on august,appellant filed this appeal from the judgment.
on december,appellant filed its companion appeal,which challenges the order awarding attorney fees.
we denied appellant motion to consolidate the appeals,but on our own motion we decided to consider the two appeals together for purposes of briefing,oral argument,and decision.our decision in the companion appeal appears in a separate unpublished opinion,filed concurrently with this one.
contentions 
in this appeal,appellant presents a attack on the judgment,targeting both the jury verdict and the court preemption ruling as contrary to law.respondents dispute both points.
discussion 
we address appellant attack on the special verdicts in the unpublished portion of the opinion,before turning to its arguments concerning the preemption ruling.
i.the verdict 
ii.the preemption ruling 
in its second line of attack on the judgment,appellant asserts error in the pretrial dismissal of three causes of action of its fifth amended complaint the second cause of action,for breach of confidence the fifth cause of action,for interference with contract and the sixth cause of action,for unfair competition.as noted above,the trial court concluded that those three causes of action were preempted by california uniform trade secrets act,et appellant challenges the preemption ruling on both procedural and substantive grounds.
appellant procedural challenges 
the preemption issue was first raised below in respondents trial brief.after motions in limine and before the jury was impaneled,the court addressed the question on its own motion,first giving appellant a chance to respond orally and in writing.
appellant takes issue with the procedure employed,asserting two related claims of error.first,appellant challenges the pretrial procedure employed by the court as improper.according to appellant if the trial court was using the motion in limine procedure to rule on the preemption procedure,it was in error.a motion in limine can only ask a court to admit or bar the admission of evidence.second,appellant contends that the court ruled prematurely,having acted without first hearing its evidence.
in response to appellant procedural arguments,respondents assert forfeiture and lack of prejudice.
addressing each of appellant procedural claims in turn,we conclude appellant forfeited its challenge to the propriety of the pretrial procedure by failing to object below,and appellant failed to demonstrate that its related claim of prematurity constitutes prejudicial error.
the objection was forfeited 
in order to preserve an issue for appeal,a party ordinarily must raise the objection in the trial court.in re th,d.the party also must cite to the record showing exactly where the objection was made.ibid.as the california supreme court recently reaffirmed,a reviewing court ordinarily will not consider a challenge to a ruling if an objection could have been but was not made in the trial court.in re cal th,d.the purpose of this rule is to encourage parties to bring errors to the attention of the trial court,so that they may be corrected.ibid.
in its opening brief,appellant asserts that its trial counsel objected to the ad hoc procedure.he pointed out that the court could reach the merits of an issue only through a demurrer or motion for summary judgment.appellant offers no citation to the record to support that assertion,however,and our review of the record discloses no express objection.in its reply brief,appellant maintains that its trial counsel did not agree to the procedure he was forced into it.in support of that argument,appellant cites a portion of the transcript of the hearing held on friday,february.but the cited excerpt reflects only this comment by counsel first,because this is akin to a motion to dismiss or a nonsuit or a motion for summary judgment,it not properly briefed.we have not submitted any kind of a responsive brief.this did not come up in a motion in limine.it comes up as a sort of a musing in a trial brief.after hearing limited oral argument from appellant counsel on the merits of the issue,the court offered him an opportunity to brief.the court asked him to submit something in writing by the following monday.appellant counsel voiced no objection to that proposal.as requested by the court,he submitted written opposition to the preemption arguments that had been advanced by respondents in their trial brief.appellant written submission asserts that a finding of preemption at this stage of the case is premature.but it contains no objection to the hearing procedure itself.nor did counsel orally interpose any such objection at the hearing held on tuesday,february.
in sum,this record demonstrates that appellant accepted the procedure without objection.
appellant offers this further contention in its reply brief even if counsel did acquiesce to the process,it was only because it was clear the trial court would overrule any objection to the procedure.
we reject that contention.reviewing courts have traditionally excused parties for failing to raise an issue at trial where an objection would have been futile or wholly unsupported by substantive law then in existence.people welch cal th,d.but this is not such a case.having read the transcript of the two hearings,we can not agree that an objection would have been futile.
nor are we persuaded by appellant claim that it did not invite the error or somehow mislead the trial court into believing it accepted the court decision.in making that claim,appellant relies on mary city of los angeles cal d.that case does not assist appellant.as the court said there under the doctrine of invited error,when a party by its own conduct induces the commission of error,it may not claim on appeal that the judgment should be reversed because of that error.id.at.but the doctrine does not apply when a party,while making the appropriate objections,acquiesces in a judicial determination,italics added.here,as explained above,appellant did not interpose any objections.appellant also relies on norgart upjohn cal th,d.plainly,however,that case is inapposite.norgart involved the plaintiffs pro forma consent to judgment to expedite an appeal,given with the understanding that they retained their right to be heard.id.at,d.this case bears no procedural similarity to norgart.
ultimately,the question here is not whether appellant invited error,but whether it forfeited its claim by failing to object below.see generally eisenberg,et,cal.practice guide civil appeals and writs the rutter group,discussing invited error doctrine id,discussing waiver.as explained above,because appellant failed to object,it forfeited its procedural challenge.
finally,appellant argues against forfeiture on the ground that an intervening change in the law validated his argument.see,palmer shawback th,d.appellant asserts that just such a change resulted from a recent decision of this court,amtower photon dynamics,th,d.we do not share appellant view.in amtower,this court criticized the increasingly frequent use of in limine motions as substitutes for summary adjudication motions,motions for judgment on the pleadings,or other dispositive motions authorized by statute.id.at,d.this court published the amtower opinion to express our concerns surrounding the proliferation of such procedures.ibid.there,this court observed the better practice in nearly every case is to afford the litigant the protections provided by trial or by the statutory processes.see id.at,d.nevertheless,this court continued,although we would have preferred that the statute of limitations issue be decided by a proper summary adjudication motion or motion for nonsuit,the trial court unorthodox procedure does not warrant reversal because plaintiff could not have prevailed under any circumstances.id.at,d see id.at,d.given that holding,amtower can not be read as a blanket prohibition on the use of in limine proceedings to decide dispositive issues.moreover,while it represents an important statement of this court views,amtower did not break new ground.see,r b auto center,farmers group,th,d we caution against the wholesale disposition of a case through rulings on motions in limine.thus,contrary to appellant assertion,amtower does not constitute an intervening change in the law.
in sum,appellant procedural challenge is forfeited.none of appellant arguments persuades us to reach the merits of its claim that the trial court employed an improper procedure in ruling on the preemption question.in any event,as we next explain,the challenged procedure resulted in no reversible error.
any error was harmless 
in its second and related procedural challenge,appellant asserts that the trial court ruling on preemption was premature,since no evidence had been presented at that point.as noted above,in written opposition submitted to the trial court,appellant asserted that a finding of preemption at this stage of the case is premature.appellant then explained the parties dispute whether the confidential information constitutes trade secrets.until such time as that issue has been determined,the issue of preemption will not be ripe for determination.appellant renews that argument here.
respondents disagree,asserting the trial court had all the necessary information,and it gave kcm full opportunity to brief and argue.in defense of the procedure used,respondents also cite the trial court inherent authority.we start our analysis of this point there.
a court has inherent equity,supervisory and administrative powers,as well as inherent power to control litigation and conserve judicial resources.lucas county of los angeles th,d accord,amtower photon dynamics,supra,th at,d.use of a motion in limine to test whether a complaint states a cause of action falls within these powers lucas county of los angeles,at,d.
in limine motions are designed to facilitate the management of a case,generally by deciding difficult evidentiary issues in advance of trial.amtower photon dynamics,supra,th at,d.as case law recognizes,however,motions in limine also can function as an objection to any and all evidence on the grounds the pleadings are fatally defective for failure to state a cause of action.edwards centex real estate th,d.in such cases,the in limine motion operate s as a general demurrer to the complaints or a motion for judgment on the pleadings.see amtower photon dynamics,at,d.alternatively,where such motions are granted at the outset of trial with reference to evidence already produced in discovery,they may be viewed as the functional equivalent of an order sustaining a demurrer to the evidence,or nonsuit.edwards centex real estate at,d.a motion for nonsuit or demurrer to the evidence concedes the truth of the facts proved,but denies as a matter of law that they sustain the plaintiff case.id.at,d.
on appeal from the trial court determination that the allegations of a pleading do not support relief,review is de novo.linear technology applied materials,th,d demurrer.in such cases,all inferences and conflicts in the evidence must be viewed most favorably to the nonmoving party.amtower photon dynamics,supra,th at,d.but we can not reverse the judgment of dismissal based on alleged procedural error unless we are convinced that that ruling resulted in a miscarriage of justice people edward jones th,d see cal,art.vi.
in this case,appellant has not shown error,much less prejudice.
when the trial court made its ruling on february,it was armed with a great deal of information derived from the long history of the case,including appellant prior pleadings and other submissions.as respondents told the court at the hearing that day the plaintiff has consistently and vehemently contended in prior pleadings in this court that the second and fifth causes of action arise from the same facts as the first cause of action so the argument about prematurity might would have more force absent the representations previously made by appellant.to support that assertion,respondents presented the court with appellant opposition to respondents demurrer to the fourth amended complaint.respondents observed that the arguments raised by appellant there were persuasive in fending off the demurrer on statute of limitations grounds.respondents also presented the court with a copy of the may order overruling their demurrer.respondents counsel then stated so as to the notion that this is somehow premature,i think we have more than an ample record based on the express representations of the plaintiff that this tort claims arise from the same operative facts namely,misappropriation of trade secrets.respondents also directed the court attention to specific allegations in the fifth amended complaint,arguing that the gist of those allegations was trade secret misappropriation.
in making its ruling,the court said this as i consider this issue,i looking and considering the history of this case,as well.the court specifically mentioned appellant trial brief,its fifth amended complaint,and the memorandum prepared in connection with the demurrer to the fourth amended complaint.the court continued so the conclusion i come to after considering everything,not just the documents presented to me today,but the arguments of counsel,everything i heard is that causes of action,and are causes of action based on misappropriation of trade secrets.that is the gist of those causes of action 
considering the extensive record before the court,we are not convinced that the court acted prematurely in disposing of appellant tort claims in pretrial proceedings.to the contrary,it appears that the court acted within its inherent authority.lucas county of los angeles,supra,th at,d.
in any event,even assuming error,appellant has failed to demonstrate prejudice.in other words,even if appellant is right in its assertion of procedural error,we can not reverse the judgment unless appellant is also correct on the substantive issue of preemption.people edward jones,supra,th at,d discussing federal securities law preemption.and as we explain next,the court properly decided the preemption issue presented in this case.
appellant substantive claim 
in addressing appellant substantive challenge to the trial court preemption ruling,we begin by describing the general principles that underpin the statutory preemption doctrine.we then apply those principles to the case before us.
legal principles 
statutory preemption in general 
the general rule is that statutes do not supplant the common law unless it appears that the legislature intended to cover the entire subject or,in other words,to occupy the field.associates safeco title ins.cal d.g eneral and comprehensive legislation,where course of conduct,parties,things affected,limitations and exceptions are minutely described,indicates a legislative intent that the statute should totally supersede and replace the common law dealing with the subject matter.accord,pacific scene,penasquitos,cal d.
california uniform trade secrets act 
the california uniform trade secrets act cutsa is codified in sections through of the civil code see generally,dvd copy control,bunner cal th,d,witkin,summary of cal.law,equity.cutsa has been characterized as having a comprehensive structure and breadth accuimage diagnostics corp terarecon,d.here,the eleven provisions of the utsa set forth the definition of misappropriation and trade secret,injunctive relief for actual or threatened misappropriation,damages,attorney fees,methods for preserving the secrecy of trade secrets,the limitations period,the effect of the title on other statutes or remedies,statutory construction,severability,the application of title to acts occurring prior to the statutory date,and the application of official proceedings privilege to disclosure of trade secret information.ibid.that breadth suggests a legislative intent to preempt the common law.associates safeco title ins,supra,cal d at.at least as to common law trade secret misappropriation claims,utsa occupies the field in california.accuimage diagnostics corp terarecon,at.
cutsa includes a specific provision concerning preemption.that provision,section,reads in pertinent part as follows a except as otherwise expressly provided,this title does not supersede any statute relating to misappropriation of a trade secret,or any statute otherwise regulating trade secrets.b this title does not affect contractual remedies,whether or not based upon misappropriation of a trade secret,other civil remedies that are not based upon misappropriation of a trade secret,or criminal remedies,whether or not based upon misappropriation of a trade secret.section thus expressly allows contractual and criminal remedies,whether or not based on trade secret misappropriation.trade secrets practice in california ed.litigation issues,citing.at the same time,implicitly preempts alternative civil remedies based on trade secret misappropriation.ibid.
as reflected in case law decided under the california statute,the determination of whether a claim is based on trade secret misappropriation is largely factual.see,callaway golf dunlop slazenger group americas,d,applying california law digital envoy,google,d.
in callaway,for example,claims by the for conversion and unjust enrichment were preempted,where they were based entirely on the same factual allegations that form the basis of its trade secrets claim.callaway golf dunlop slazenger group americas,supra,d at.similarly,because the could not show that its negligence claim was supported by facts unrelated to the misappropriation of the trade secret,citation its negligence claim was also preempted.id.at.
in digital envoy,the court determined that california statute,as persuasively interpreted in callaway,preempts digital claims for unfair competition and unjust enrichment since those claims are based on the same nucleus of facts as the misappropriation of trade secrets claim for relief.digital envoy,google,supra,d at.
relevance of utsa authority from other jurisdictions 
section provides this title shall be applied and construed to effectuate its general purpose to make uniform the law with respect to the subject of this title among states enacting it.in light of this provision,case law from other jurisdictions interpreting uniform statutory provisions similar to california may be relevant.see,coulter leinert,smithfield ham and products,portion pac,but see,burbank grease services,llc sokolowski,cases from other jurisdictions can not substitute for our construction of the relevant wisconsin statute.in order to promote consistency in the uniform laws,california courts ordinarily adopt the construction given a uniform code section by other jurisdictions,unless the construction is manifestly erroneous.estate of reeves d.
notably,however,the specific provision of california law at issue here section differs from the corresponding provision in the uniform act section.the relevant differences appear in subdivision a of each provision 
for purposes of our analysis here,the key difference between the california statute and the uniform act provision is that the latter displaces conflicting law.west laws,trade secrets act,subd.a.among the states adopting the uniform version are colorado,minnesota,and wisconsin.see west laws,trade secrets act,action in adopting jurisdictions,powell products,marks,quoting colorado statute micro display systems,axtel,quoting minnesota statute burbank grease services,llc sokolowski,supra,at,quoting wisconsin statute.as adopted in minnesota,this provision means only that law which conflicts with the mutsa is displaced.micro display systems,axtel,at accord,cardiac pacemakers,aspen ii holding,d.under this displacement provision,courts will allow plaintiffs to maintain separate causes of action to the extent that causes of action have more to their factual allegations than the mere misuse or misappropriation of trade secrets.cardiac pacemakers,aspen ii holding,at,quoting micro display systems,axtel,at.the same is true under colorado law the utsa only preempts common law claims that conflict with its provisions.powell products,marks,at.
california has rejected that particular provision of the uniform act in favor of an entirely different one,subd.a.typically,when a legislature models a statute after a uniform act,but does not adopt the particular language of that act,courts conclude the deviation was deliberate and that the policy of the uniform act was rejected.hughes electronics citibank delaware th,d.thus,to the extent that other states statutes conform to the uniform version of section,subdivision a,which california has rejected,decisions interpreting that provision are not persuasive in construing california unique statute.
with those principles in mind,we turn to appellant substantive challenge to the preemption ruling.we resolve that challenge using a approach.first,we construe california statute.next,we apply it to the operative pleading here.
construction of section 
when charged with interpreting a statute,our task is to determine afresh the intent of the legislature by construing in context the language of the statute.in determining such intent,we begin with the language of the statute itself.that is,we look first to the words the legislature used,giving them their usual and ordinary meaning.if there is no ambiguity in the language of the statute,then the legislature is presumed to have meant what it said,and the plain meaning of the language governs.smith law group cal th,d,internal quotation marks and citations omitted see also,city of burbank state water resources control bd.cal th,d.statutory interpretation presents a question of law for our independent review.feitelberg credit suisse first boston,llc th,d.
based in part on statutory language,appellant argues for a narrow interpretation of preemption.in appellant view,the california version of the utsa does not contain language that suggests broad preemption.in support of that assertion,appellant first cites section,subdivision a,arguing that it does not spell out what is preempted,but sets out what is not.appellant makes a similar argument based on the language of subdivision b,asserting that it lists more exceptions to preemption but does not say what is preempted.
we reject that argument.
in the first place,we share the broad view that cutsa comprehensive structure and breadth suggests a legislative intent to occupy the field.accuimage diagnostics corp terarecon,supra,d at.among other things,cutsa defines key terms,provides various forms of relief,spells out methods for preserving the secrecy of trade secrets,and sets forth the limitations period.ibid.the stated purpose of the utsa is to provide unitary definitions of trade secret and trade secret misappropriation,and a single statute of limitations for the various property,and violation of fiduciary relationship theories of noncontractual liability utilized at common law.the uniform act also codifies the results of the better reasoned cases concerning the remedies for trade secret misappropriation.american credit indemnity sacks d,quoting comrs.prefatory note to uniform trade secrets act,west laws ann.trade secrets.
furthermore,and more narrowly,the proper focus in this case is on the language of subdivision b of section,which reads b this title does not affect other civil remedies that are not based upon misappropriation of a trade secret it is that specific language that requires analysis and application here.
as has been aptly observed of section,subdivision b this provision would appear to be rendered meaningless if,in fact,claims which are based on trade secret misappropriation are not preempted by the state statutory scheme.digital envoy,google,supra,d at.additionally,the pertinent statutory language based upon misappropriation strongly suggests a factual inquiry,one that examines the conduct alleged in the claim.see accuimage diagnostics corp terarecon,supra,d at,determining preemption by examining the conduct at issue accord,callaway golf dunlop slazenger group americas,supra,d at.
nor do appellant other arguments persuade us to a different conclusion.appellant asserts that california courts generally do not favor preemption.but its proffered case authority is inapposite.the smith case concerns federal preemption.smith wells fargo bank th,d.the linear case concerns federal jurisdiction over patent and copyright claims.linear technology applied materials,supra,th at,d see also,balboa ins.trans global equities d.court should analyze each theory to determine whether it contains the necessary qualitatively different extra element distinguishing it from copyright protection.these california cases thus do not address the specific preemption question presented preemption of common law.that being so,they offer no reasoned basis for allowing common law claims to go forward whenever they seek something more than trade secret relief.and as explained above,the utsa cases from other jurisdictions that employ a something more test are based on a displacement provision that california did not adopt.see,cardiac pacemakers,aspen ii holding,supra,d at minnesota law micro display systems,axtel,supra.at minnesota law powell products,marks,supra.at colorado law.
in sum,we agree with the federal cases applying california law,which hold that section,subdivision b,preempts common law claims that are based on the same nucleus of facts as the misappropriation of trade secrets claim for relief.digital envoy,google,supra,d at.depending on the particular facts pleaded,the statute can operate to preempt the specific common claims asserted here breach of confidence,interference with contract,and unfair competition.as we explain next,that is the case here.
application to appellant fifth amended complaint 
construction of a complaint presents a legal question for our independent review.balboa ins.trans global equities,supra,d at.see also,mccall pacificare of,cal th,d.in undertaking our review,we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation,reading it as a whole and its parts in their context,and ignoring erroneous or confusing
