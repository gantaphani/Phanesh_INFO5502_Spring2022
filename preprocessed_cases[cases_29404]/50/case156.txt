jasmine networks,jasmine appeals an order granting a preliminary injunction in favor of marvell semiconductor,marvell,restraining use or disclosure of a transcript of a conversation among marvell officers and lawyers that was inadvertently left on jasmine voicemail system.
both jasmine and marvel are in the semiconductor business,more specifically,the design and manufacture of telecommunications chips.marvell is a publicly held company,while jasmine is a smaller,closely held company.marvell offered to buy a portion of jasmine technology,along with some of its engineers.jasmine accepted the offer with many conditions,including the implementation of a nondisclosure agreement preventing marvell from obtaining jasmine trade secrets or employees without paying for them.
during the course of the parties negotiations,jasmine obtained evidence that marvell did not intend to abide by the terms of the contract,and had or was planning to steal jasmine trade secrets and hire away jasmine key employees.the evidence was contained in a transcript of a conversation among marvell lawyers and officers that was recorded on jasmine voicemail system.
the trial court granted marvell request for a preliminary injunction restraining the use or disclosure of the transcript of its employees conversation.in so doing,the court refused to review the contents of the transcript on the grounds that such conversation was privileged.
jasmine asserts numerous errors on appeal,including the fact that evidence code section did not preclude the trial court from reviewing the content of the voicemail.jasmine also asserts the conversation is not protected by the privilege,because marvell waived the privilege by disclosing the information on jasmine voicemail,and the conversation falls within the exception.additionally,jasmine argues the preliminary injunction is an illegal prior restraint in violation of the first amendment.
we believe the trial court erred in refusing to consider the contents of the voicemail,and in concluding jasmine failed to establish a prima facie case for the exception to the privilege,and for these reasons we reverse.because we reverse on the grounds stated above,we decline to reach the first amendment issue.
factual setting for the trade secret 
marvell sought to acquire a group of jasmine engineers,along with certain of jasmine intellectual property.during the course of negotiations,jasmine was careful about preventing the release of its trade secrets.for example,jasmine senior director of legal and business affairs told senior marvell officials,including matthew gloss gloss,jasmine general counsel and of business affairs,that they were not to make copies of employee information and indeed,went so far as to black out the names of the members of the employee group that marvell was interested in acquiring,as well their stock option grants.the record shows that jasmine did this to prevent marvell from bidding for these employees if the deal did not go through.
as negotiations progressed,the parties entered into a nondisclosure agreement that protected the secrecy of jasmine trade secrets and employee information.to that end,marvell was given an opportunity to look at the trade secret information,but not to remove it.patent disclosures,among the most important of jasmine intellectual property,could be reviewed but not copied.enough was to be shown marvell to demonstrate the value without disclosing the secret.
moreover,marvell was not to conduct meetings with the rank and file of the targeted jasmine engineering group without the presence of a jasmine human relations representative.
it was as to this latter requirement that the telephone call was made to jasmine senior director of legal and business affairs.
the three marvell employees who participated in the telephone call were gloss,marvell of business affairs,general counsel,and a marvell officer kaushik banerjee banerjee,of engineering,and a marvell officer and eric janofsky janofsky,marvell patent attorney.using a speakerphone,the three marvell executives called virginia wei wei,jasmine senior director of legal and business affairs,and left a message on her voicemail to return their call regarding the requirement that a jasmine human relations representative be present for meetings with jasmine engineers.however,after leaving the initial message,the three marvell executives failed to hang up the speakerphone,and proceeded to have a conversation that was recorded on wei voicemail.
we review the actual communication and set it out below 
janofsky i do does marvell ceo does go to jail,obviously.
gloss sehat does go to jail.manual alba marvell vice president of business development might go to jail manuel abel gets a black eye.
janofsky i do 
gloss sure,marvell vp out there promising big option grants in proposed pending acquisitions if technology is transferred in advance to speed development time so time to market goal can be reached.that what going on.
janofsky if we took that ip on the pretense of just evaluating it,and put it in our product 
banerjee but we do know that part.
janofsky but they gave it to us,you know.we do know,but it sounded italics added.
banerjee but it would be okay if we pay jasmine and we close the deal,right 
janofsky once the deal closes,it fine,but if they realize what they doing,they could hold out for more.use it as leverage,use it as blackmail.
banerjee right,but we do want to talk about it.
janofsky no,we do want to talk about it 
banerjee yeah,i mean,all i,if you look at it you begin to say hey look it was part of technical due diligence.
janofsky no that,that,that fine,i 
banerjee i mean that how 
gloss that,that that what it was.
banerjee that right.
gloss that what going on right now.
banerjee so that how our project leader can defend it,and that how we can defend it.
upon hearing the message of this conversation,wei investigated whether marvell had taken any action to obtain jasmine trade secrets,or its employees.jasmine located notes of a meeting between richard stowell stowell,a senior jasmine manager,and banerjee regarding proprietary patent disclosures that jasmine had earlier refused to provide to marvell.jasmine also discovered that stowell had secretly banerjee stock option and salary information for jasmine engineers,after jasmine refused to provide marvell this information.
jasmine filed suit against marvell and certain of jasmine former employees,including stowell,alleging trade secret misappropriation and related claims.marvell filed a motion for a preliminary injunction,enjoining jasmine from disclosing,disseminating or referring to the contents of the recorded voicemail conversation.marvell argued that because the conversation involved its attorneys,its contents were subject to the privilege.
the trial court granted marvell request for the preliminary injunction based on the conclusion that the contents of the voicemail were privileged 
jasmine filed a timely notice of appeal 
standard of review 
this case involves the trial court issuance of a preliminary injunction,which is reviewed for abuse of discretion.cohen board of supervisors cal d.however,our analysis of the case suggests that the trial court ruling was a classic example of a mixed question of fact and law,as that issue was exhaustively analyzed in people louis cal d.in louis,the court was faced with the same threshold issue we encounter w hat standard we should use in reviewing the trial court ruling.id.at.mixed questions were identified as those in which the historical facts are admitted or established,the rule of law is undisputed,and the issue is whether the facts satisfy the relevant legal standard,or to put it another way,whether the rule of law as applied to the established facts is or is not violated.citation.id.at,quoting swint,fn,d.
there are three distinct steps in deciding mixed questions of law and fact.the first step is the establishment of the basic,primary,or historical facts.people louis,supra,cal d at.the second step is the selection of the applicable rule of law.the third step,and the most troublesome for standard of review purposes,is the application of law to fact.ibid.the trial court resolution of questions of fact is reviewed under the deferential,clearly erroneous standard.however,questions of law are reviewed under the,de novo standard.ibid.
the trial court grant of the preliminary injunction in this case involved mixed questions of law and fact.the court resolution of the factual issues will be subject to an abuse of discretion review.however,the issues presented by this appeal are questions of law as they relate to undisputed facts whether a privilege holder may waive the privilege by inadvertent disclosure,regardless of the holder intent whether evidence code section precluded the trial court from reviewing the content of the voicemail to determine if the conversation was subject to the privilege,when the content of the voicemail had already been disclosed and whether the trial court applied the proper standard for a prima facie showing of the exception under evidence code section.we review de novo the legal questions presented in this case.see california correctional peace officers state of california th,d.
privilege and waiver,evidence code section,subdivision a 
in its ruling on the request for preliminary injunction,the trial court concluded,based on undisputed facts,that the privilege had not been waived,that the burden shifted to jasmine to show that the privilege had been expressly or impliedly waived,and that they failed to do so.the trial court also found that marvell did not intend to disclose the contents of the conversation.the trial court erred in its finding that the privilege had not been waived.
the parties agree that under evidence code section,subdivision a the privilege may be waived in one of two ways by the privilege holder making an uncoerced disclosure of the information or by the holder intentionally consenting to disclosure by a third party.the parties dispute the first method of waiver,the privilege holder uncoerced disclosure of the information.marvell asserts section,subdivision a requires intentional disclosure,and such intent did not exist in this case.however,on this point marvell is incorrect,because the weight of authority supports the conclusion that intent to disclose is not required in order for the holder to waive the privilege through uncoerced disclosure.
the cases marvell cites for its position that intent to disclose is required to waive the privilege are inapposite.in fidelity deposit of maryland,the court considered counsel inadvertent disclosure of information,not the holder disclosure,and concluded that the holder must intend that the information be disclosed in order for the privilege to be waived.
marvell argues that no waiver occurred in this case,because the inadvertent disclosure was by its counsel,gloss,and because marvell did not intend to disclose the information,gloss inadvertent disclosure was not sufficient to constitute waiver.marvell is correct that an attorney inadvertent disclosure does not waive the privilege absent the privilege holder intent to waive.see state comp.ins.fund wps,th,d state comp.court concluded,waiver does not include accidental,inadvertent disclosure of privilege information by the attorney.
however,marvell fails to note that its corporate officers,not just its general counsel,disclosed the information on the voicemail.as a result,the fact that marvell did not intend to waive the privilege through the inadvertent disclosure is immaterial.
unlike the cases marvell cites,in the present case,the privilege holder inadvertently disclosed the information.the language of section,subdivision a is clear that the holder of the privilege,in this case marvell,may waive it by disclosing the privileged information.moreover,in state,the court explicitly stated that waiver of the privilege may occur either by disclosing a significant part of the communication or by manifesting through words or conduct consent that the communication may be disclosed.state,supra,th at,d,italics added there is no requirement in the statute itself,nor in the cases interpreting the statute that the privilege holder intend to disclose the information when that the holder makes an uncoerced disclosure.
based on the undisputed facts of this case,it is clear marvell made an uncoerced disclosure of the information.although marvell makes much of the fact that gloss,its general counsel,was the speaker in the initial message to wei,and as a result,could not waive marvell privilege,this argument ignores the fact that in making the call to wei,gloss was acting not only as marvell general counsel,but also as the of business affairs and an officer of the corporation,with authority to speak to jasmine on issues related to the terms of the agreement additionally,through the actions and the words of all three marvell executives who placed the original call to wei,it is clear that gloss was not acting alone,and in fact banerjee,gloss and janofsky all made the call,and were acting on behalf of marvell finally,marvell ignores the fact that banerjee,the only one of the three marvell executives who participated in the conference call and who is not an attorney,did not object,and in fact,participated fully in the conversation with gloss and janofsky that was left on jasmine voicemail.
we conclude based on the context of the conference call,marvell,not just its counsel,disclosed the information to jasmine,and as such,waived its privilege.the fact that marvell did not intend to disclose the information to jasmine is of no import marvell placed the conference call and left the voicemail message for wei voluntarily.marvell was not coerced in any way to make the disclosure,and as such,its disclosure falls squarely within the meaning of section,subdivision a.indeed,it would be hard to see how the criteria for waiver could be satisfied if they are not satisfied here.
the trial court erred in issuing the injunction based on a finding that the contents of the voicemail were privileged.the undisputed facts of this case demonstrate the privilege was waived by marvell uncoerced disclosure of the information on jasmine voicemail.
crime fraud exception to the privilege evidence code section 
even if the privilege were not waived in this case,the voicemail is not protected,because it falls within the exception to the privilege stated in section 
in its ruling granting the preliminary injunction,the trial court not only concluded the privilege had not been waived,but it also held that jasmine failed to make a prima facie showing that the exception existed in this case.in reaching the conclusion that a prima facie case was not established,the court refused to consider the contents of the voicemail.the court refusal was based on an erroneous interpretation of section.
evidence code section 
section provides,in relevant part the presiding officer may not require disclosure of information claimed to be privileged under this division in order to rule on the claim of privilege.while section is particularly applicable to claims of privilege where the information has not been previously disclosed,it has no applicability where the communication has been disclosed.that is,in part,the ruling in roe superior court d,where the person claiming the privilege objected to the court reviewing information that was subject to the privilege.the court of appeal held that where the confidential material has already been disclosed t he superior court did nothing to force the disclosure of previously undisclosed communications.accordingly,the superior court did not violate evidence code section.id.at,fn.
to a similar effect,the court in klang shell oil d,rejected the privilege holder argument that the court could not review the information because the information has already been previously disclosed.
like the cases of klang and roe,because marvell disclosed the information to jasmine in the form of a voicemail message,and the court did not need to compel its disclosure,the prohibition set forth in section did on apply in this case.the trial court erred in refusing to review the contents of the voicemail pursuant to section.
the cases marvell cites for its position that section prevented the trial court from reviewin
