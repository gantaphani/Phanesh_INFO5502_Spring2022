background 
proposition 
proposition began with a declaration of findings that e normous increases in the cost of insurance have made it both unaffordable and unavailable to millions of californians,and that existing laws inadequately protect consumers and allow insurance companies to charge excessive,unjustified,and arbitrary rates.the initiative stated purpose included protecting consumers from arbitrary insurance rates and practices,encouraging a competitive insurance marketplace,and ensuring that insurance is fair,available,and affordable for all californians.the initiative also expressly directed that its terms are to be liberally construed and applied so as to fully promote its underlying purpose.stats,pp.
among its terms,proposition added article to chapter of part of division of the insurance code article.the article,consisting of insurance code sections through,required an immediate reduction of insurance rates and also instituted a prior approval system under which the commissioner must approve an insurer rate before its use.insurance code section articulated the substantive standard for prior approval,stating in subdivision a no rate shall be approved or remain in effect which is excessive,inadequate,unfairly discriminatory or otherwise in violation of this chapter.
the article requires auto rates to be based on an insured driving safety record,number of miles driven annually,years of driving experience,and other factors approved by the commissioner.it also prohibits certain unfair insurance practices and makes the insurance industry subject to the unruh civil rights act civil code,and the state antitrust and unfair business practices laws bus,et.in addition,the article contains several general provisions regarding public notice,including insurance code section,which declares all information provided to the commissioner pursuant to this article shall be available for public inspection,and the provisions of section d of the government code and section of the insurance code shall not apply thereto.
the details of implementing proposition by promulgating rules and regulations have been left to the commissioner.calfarm ins.deukmejian,supra,cal d at,century ins.garamendi,supra,cal th at,d.we are concerned in this appeal with a regulation promulgated in,which requires certain insurers to file annually with the department a community service statement,reporting specified information for each zip code in which the insurer sells insurance or maintains agents.that information includes the number of offices,agents,claims adjusters,direct mail or telephone solicitations for new insurance business,agents and claims adjusters conversant in a language other than english,applications for each line of insurance,and applications for which the insurer declined to provide coverage,as well as the race or national origin and gender of each applicant for insurance,subd.b.
the community service statement must also divulge for each zip code the total earned exposures and total earned premiums,and the total number of exposures new,exposures canceled and exposures,stated separately for various types of coverage.the parties refer to this information as record a data,subds.a,b.an earned exposure is the unit insured for example,under an automobile policy,each insured auto is an earned exposure.
the regulation requires the commissioner to issue an annual report on underserved communities,designating by zip code the communities that the commissioner finds underserved by the insurance industry based on criteria set forth in the regulation,subd.c.the report must also list certain information for each insurance company doing business in the state,including the number and percentage of total exposures the company has in force insuring risks in the underserved communities and in all other communities,subd.e.
in addition to mandating the annual report of aggregate data,subdivision c of section makes community service statements available for public inspection under insurance code section.
state farm lawsuit 
in december,state farm filed this action for declaratory and injunctive relief against david birny birnbaum,the commissioner,and the department of insurance.the complaint alleged that in response to a request under the public information act,the department had inadvertently disclosed to birnbaum information in state farm community service statement that constituted a privileged trade secret.state farm sought an injunction restraining birnbaum from using or disclosing that information,among other relief.
the southern christian leadership conference of greater los angeles,and consumers union of,interveners successfully requested leave to intervene in the action.their complaint in intervention sought a declaration that community service statements submitted by insurers under the regulation are subject to public inspection and not exempt from public disclosure.state farm subsequently amended its complaint,alleging more precisely that its record a data is trade secret information and seeking to restrain the commissioner from releasing any information submitted pursuant to section under a claim of confidentiality or trade secret privilege.
the trial court dismissed the action as against birnbaum and ordered entry of judgment in his favor after granting his special motion to strike under code of civil procedure section.state farm filed a notice of appeal from that judgment,but later abandoned the appeal.
the commissioner moved for summary judgment,arguing that section is a valid regulation implementing insurance code section,that state farm submission of its community service statement was voluntary because the regulations provide for alternatives to the filing of such statements,that state farm waived any trade secret protection by filing its community service statement,and that state farm had no standing to assert an exemption from disclosure under the public records act.
interveners also moved for summary judgment.they reiterated the commissioner standing argument,and they urged that section,insurance code section,and the public records act each require public disclosure of state farm record a data and that the data is not exempt from disclosure under the public records act.they argued in the alternative that state farm record a data is not a trade secret.
the trial court granted both motions,reasoning that the commissioner and the department did not exceed their powers in promulgating the regulation and that the community service statements are public records subject to public inspection.in its order granting summary judgment for interveners,the court also found that there was no triable issue of material fact,that state farm had made no showing of economic value of the record a data,and that the community service statements and record a data are not a trade secret.
state farm has appealed from the judgment entered in favor of the commissioner and interveners.pending our consideration of the appeal,this court has temporarily enjoined the commissioner,the department,and interveners from disclosing data,information,or potential trade secrets that state farm provided under section,the record a data

standard of review 
on appeal after the granting of summary judgment,this court independently reviews the record to determine whether there are triable issues of material fact.code civ,aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d,saelzler advanced group cal th,d.we also undertake de novo review of the trial court resolution of any underlying statutory construction issues.barner leeds cal th,d,regents of university of california superior court cal th,d.
statutory construction issues predominate in this appeal.our basic task in construing statutes is to ascertain the intent of the lawmakers in order to effectuate the purpose of the law.torres automobile club of california cal th,d.we begin that task by scrutinizing the statutory language.if that language is clear and unambiguous,there is no need for judicial construction.on the other hand,if a statute is capable of two reasonable constructions,it is ambiguous,and we may examine its history and background and apparent purpose in an attempt to ascertain the most reasonable interpretation.snukal flightways manufacturing,cal th,d.we must also examine the context in which the language appears,adopting the construction that best harmonizes the statute both internally and with related statutes.people superior court zamudio cal th,d,california teachers governing bd.of rialto unified school dist.cal th,d.our obligation is to consider the consequences that might flow from a particular construction and to construe the statute to promote rather than defeat its purpose and policy.escobedo estate of snider cal th,d.
these principles apply equally in construing statutes enacted through the initiative process.day city of fontana cal th,d.to ascertain the legislative intent underlying an initiative,a court may take into account statements to voters such as the analysis by the legislative analyst and the arguments in the ballot pamphlets.people anderson cal d,spanish speaking citizens foundation,low,supra,th at,d.
preliminarily,respondents assert that this court lacks jurisdiction to consider this appeal because state farm had no standing in the first place to bring an action under the public records act to prevent an agency from disclosing public records in the agency files.interveners make a related argument that the judgment is not appealable because orders regarding disclosure under that act are reviewable only by extraordinary writ proceedings.see,subd.c powers city of richmond cal th,d.
the standing argument was unsuccessful in the trial court,and it merits little discussion whether state farm would have had standing under the public records act,which authorizes an action to enforce a right to inspect or receive a copy of a public record see,is of no consequence in this appeal.state farm action was not a proceeding under that act,but was for declaratory and injunctive relief under code of civil procedure sections and,subdivision a.an action for declaratory relief lies when the parties are in fundamental disagreement over the construction of particular legislation,or when they dispute whether a public entity has engaged in conduct or established policies in violation of applicable law.alameda county land use city of hayward th,d.the determination of whether an action is justiciable for purposes of code of civil procedure section is a matter entrusted to the sound discretion of the trial court.application group,hunter group,th,d city of santa rosa press democrat d.
state farm complaint alleged a controversy among the parties over the meaning of insurance code section and sought a declaration of the validity of section,subdivision c.interveners attempt to characterize state farm action as an improper public records act proceeding is disingenuous.their own complaint alleged the existence of a controversy and sought a declaration under code of civil procedure section that the community service statements filed under the regulation are public records not exempt from disclosure.declaratory relief was unquestionably appropriate under the circumstances,and the standing argument has no merit.
section,subdivision c.
we begin our discussion by emphasizing that state farm attack on section has a very narrow focus,aimed only at one part of subdivision c.the regulation is complex.among its terms,it requires insurers to file community service statements,mandates the inclusion of record a and other data in those statements,defines underserved communities,directs the commissioner to issue an annual report on those communities,designated by zip code,and requires a written explanation by an insurer of any denial of coverage in an underserved community,subds.a d.state farm does not challenge the commissioner authority under proposition to promulgate any of those components or subparts of the regulation.state farm argues only that the commissioner exceeded his statutory authority by making community service statements subject to the public disclosure mandate of insurance code section,and that section,subdivision c,is invalid to the extent that it purports to do so.
state farm reasons as follows.insurance code section applies only to information provided to the commissioner pursuant to article.that article deals with rates and rate regulation,and its limited purpose is to ensure that the rate approval process is open and subject to public scrutiny.while many other regulations do implement that process,section is not a rate regulation and community service statements are not submitted with rate applications or for rate approval purposes.therefore those statements are not submitted pursuant to article,and subdivision c of section is a void attempt to expand the scope of insurance code section.
state farm constricted reading of article is inconsistent both with the provisions of the article and with the directive of proposition for liberal construction of its terms.while much of the article pertains directly to rates and rate regulation proceedings,it can not reasonably be read as limited to that subject matter.courts have recognized that insurance code section,which is part of article,significantly altered existing law by making the business of insurance subject to the state antitrust and unfair business practice laws and to the unruh civil rights act.see farmers ins.exchange superior court cal th,d,wilson fair employment housing com.th,d.the unruh civil rights act does not forbid distinctions based on economic as opposed to personal characteristics spanish speaking citizens foundation,low,supra,th at,d,but it does prohibit discrimination based on protected classifications such as race,color,sex,religion,ancestry,or national origin.harris capital growth investors xiv cal d,see beaty truck ins.exchange th,d unruh act does not create a right of insurance access so long as the insurer policy is applicable alike to all persons regardless of race,color,sex,religion.it is apparent that article encompasses more than rate matters and addresses other factors that may impermissibly affect the availability of insurance.
state farm argument also is inconsistent with settled principles governing judicial review of administrative regulations.courts generally give great weight to the interpretation of an enabling statute by officials charged with its administration,including their interpretation of the authority vested in them to implement and carry out its provisions.people ex rel.lungren superior court cal th,d.this principle applies to the rulemaking power of an administrative agency.our role in reviewing an administrative regulation is limited.we consider the legality of the regulation,not its wisdom.we determine only whether the regulation is within the scope o
