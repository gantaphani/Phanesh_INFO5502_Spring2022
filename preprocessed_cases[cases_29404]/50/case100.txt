this case stems from the theft and sale of blueprints relating to an aircraft engine manufactured by the pratt whitney division pratt of united technologies corporation utc.utc claimed that aircraft supplies,and aircraft power maintenance apm are legally responsible for the theft and sale,and it sued them in the united states district court for the southern district of florida.the district court,in separate orders,granted motion to dismiss utc complaint for failure to state a claim for and apm motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and it entered final judgments pursuant to those orders under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.utc now appeals.we reverse the judgment for,concluding that the complaint states a claim for relief.we affirm the judgment for apm,however,because the district court correctly found that the record provided an insufficient basis for exercising personal jurisdiction over apm.
pratt is a division of utc,a delaware corporation headquartered in hartford,connecticut,and is engaged in the business of manufacturing,repairing,maintaining,and providing related support and services for turbine engines.is a florida corporation,located in riviera beach,florida,in the business of buying and selling aircraft parts and related support materials.apm is a belgian company,located in wevelgem,belgium,engaged in the business of repairing and maintaining aircraft engines.russell mazer,a in this case,is president and part owner of and a director and owner of apm.had long been a customer of pratt,and apm had been a customer of both pratt and for years.
as part of its business,apm repaired and maintained pratt engines,including engine model.in order to work on a,as with any pratt engine,apm would need to purchase from pratt either precision tools or blueprints and licenses required to make such precision tooling for itself.for this reason,apm had an interest in acquiring a set of pratt blueprints for the tooling,and wanted to fulfill that need by acquiring a set of the blueprints to sell to apm.to this end,mazer had tried to locate and purchase a set of the blueprints from numerous sources,who quoted prices as high as.the reasonable commercial value of the blueprints,which pratt deemed to be protected and proprietary,was approximately.
in november,mazer met with pratt employees in connecticut about business unrelated to this case.among the pratt personnel with whom mazer met while in connecticut was anthony dilorenzo,a temporary contract worker.mazer mentioned to dilorenzo that he was interested in acquiring a set of the tooling blueprints.although dilorenzo employment contract with pratt prohibited him from accessing pratt proprietary or other protected information without authorization from a responsible authority,he apparently suggested to mazer that he could provide the blueprints 
between january and march,apm managing director,wilhelm loetschert,was visiting florida from belgium and staying at mazer home in order to attend helicopter pilot training.at some point during this period,mazer and loetschert discussed potential acquisition of the pratt blueprints from dilorenzo,including the price that would pay for the blueprints 
at some point in february or march,dilorenzo either accessed or caused someone else to access a protected pratt computer and,without authorization,obtained a printed copy of the tooling blueprints.thereafter,in march or april,and mazer purchased the blueprints from dilorenzo for approximately mazer provided dilorenzo with federal express account information to use in sending the blueprints to in florida,received the blueprints at office,and instructed employees to send dilorenzo payment for the blueprints using federal express account.apm loetschert provided a portion of the cash used to purchase the blueprints while he was staying in florida with mazer 
following mazer and receipt of the blueprints,mazer had employees make copies of the blueprints using equipment and store the original blueprints at florida office.in march or april,mazer also had employees ship a copy of the blueprints,using federal express account,to apm office in belgium.subsequently,issued one or more invoices to apm charging approximately for the blueprints,and apm paid.
on august,mazer pled guilty in florida state court to a criminal charge of dealing in stolen property,in violation of.stat,in connection with his purchase and sale of the stolen pratt blueprints.additionally,in or around february,in connection with the theft of the pratt blueprints,dilorenzo pled guilty in federal court in connecticut to a charge of accessing a protected computer without authorization to further an intended fraud,in violation of a.
utc brought this lawsuit against mazer,and apm on november,its complaint,as amended,contains eleven counts alleging torts under florida common and statutory law.all three defendants were charged with civil theft,pursuant to.stat.and,and conversion and apm were charged with unjust enrichment and mazer were charged with dealing in stolen property,pursuant to.stat.and and all three defendants were charged with conspiring to commit the above torts.
moved the court to dismiss the complaint under federal rule of civil procedure b for failure to state a claim for relief.apm moved the court to dismiss it from the case under federal rule of civil procedure b for lack of personal jurisdiction.apm accompanied its motion with the affidavit of its managing director,wilhelm loetschert,in which loetschert admitted his limited personal presence in florida,unrelated to apm business,in december and from january,to march,described apm lack of general contacts with the state of florida and specifically denied several factual allegations relating to him and apm appearing in utc complaint.in response to the loetschert affidavit,utc attempted to establish personal jurisdiction over apm by tendering a summary of an august,interview of russell mazer,prepared by special agent andrew dunphy of the office of the inspector general of the department of defense the dunphy report,in which mazer purportedly provided information corroborating utc allegations concerning loetschert and apm knowledge and the purchase of the stolen blueprints 
the district court granted both motions.addressing motion,the court found impossible utc allegation that mazer committed his wrongful acts both personally and in his capacity as president of simply put,if mazer personally committed the crimes,he could not also have committed them as a representative of.furthermore,the district court found that the complaint failed to establish that mazer conduct was within the scope of his employment because there is no allegation that makes the buying or selling of blueprints part of its business.instead,the court continued,mazer conduct could only be within the scope of his employment if was in the business of fencing stolen property.
turning to apm motion,the district court concluded that it lacked general jurisdiction over apm due to the absence of general,systematic business contacts by apm with florida.the court further found that the loetschert affidavit had specifically rebutted each of utc allegations of apm contacts with florida relating to the causes of action stated in the complaint.the court rejected utc argument that mazer statements in the dunphy report established jurisdiction on the ground that mazer statements constituted hearsay within hearsay and thus were inadmissible and incompetent.as a further basis for granting apm motion,the court pointed to cases interpreting the c ommitting a tortious act within this state provision of the florida statute.stat.b,as requiring a claim of injury in florida,something the complaint did not allege.finally,the court found utc conspiracy claim against apm insufficient to support personal jurisdiction due to the absence of a viable allegation that apm,and mazer had conspired to commit a tort in florida.
upon utc motion,the district court granted separate and final judgments,pursuant to rule b,in favor of and apm.this appeal followed.
we review de novo the dismissal of the claims against under rule b,accepting the allegations in the amended complaint as true and construing them in the light most favorable to utc.mills foremost ins,cir.while a complaint attacked by a rule b motion to dismiss does not need detailed factual allegations,a plaintiff obligation to provide the grounds of his entitle ment to relief requires more than labels and conclusions,and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.id.quoting bell atl.twombly,d citations omitted.furthermore,the plaintiff factual allegations,when assumed to be true,must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.id.same.
utc complaint asserted,in counts i,iv,vii,x,and xi,respectively,five claims against civil theft,conversion,unjust enrichment,dealing in stolen property,and conspiracy.we examine in turn the elements necessary to state each claim.
first,to state a claim for civil theft under florida law,utc must allege an injury resulting from a violation by of the criminal theft statute.stat.to do this,utc must allege that knowingly obtained or used,or endeavored to obtain or use,utc property with felonious intent either temporarily or permanently to a deprive utc of its right to or a benefit from the property or b appropriate the property to own use or to the use of any person not entitled to the property.stat.providing civil remedy for theft or exploitation,criminal theft statute see almeida,cir gersh cofman,so d,dca in order to establish an action for civil theft,the claimant must prove the statutory elements of theft,as well as criminal intent.
conversion is an act of dominion wrongfully asserted over another property inconsistent with his ownership therein.thomas hertz,so d,dca quotation omitted.the tort may occur where a person wrongfully refuses to relinquish property to which another has the right of possession,and it may be established despite evidence that the defendant took or retained property based upon the mistaken belief that he had a right to possession,since malice is not an essential element of the action.seymour adams,so d,dca citations omitted.
the essential elements of a claim for unjust enrichment are a benefit conferred upon a defendant by the plaintiff,the defendant appreciation of the benefit,and the defendant acceptance and retention of the benefit under circumstances that make it inequitable for him to retain it without paying the value thereof.rollins,butland,so d,dca.
like civil theft,a civil claim for dealing in stolen property requires an injury resulting from a violation of the criminal statute prohibiting dealing in stolen property.stat.accordingly,to state a claim for dealing in stolen property,utc must allege that,with felonious intent,trafficked in,or endeavored to traffic in,property that it knew or should have known was stolen,or initiated,organized,planned,financed,directed,managed,or supervised the theft of property and trafficked in such stolen property.stat.providing civil remedy for theft or exploitation,criminal dealing in stolen property statute in re standard jury instructions in criminal,so d.
finally,to state a claim for civil conspiracy,utc must allege a an agreement between two or more parties,b to do an unlawful act or to do a lawful act by unlawful means,c the doing of some overt act in pursuance of the conspiracy,and d damage to plaintiff as a result of the acts done under the conspiracy.charles.foreclosure placement,llc,so d,dca.
counts i,iv,vii,x,and xi appear to recite all of the required elements of these five claims against.the question,however,is whether those counts also allege facts sufficient to maintain the claims against,as opposed to only its president mazer individually.
it is axiomatic that a corporation like can not act other than through its officers,employees,and agents.palazzo gulf oil,cir the rule is well established that a corporation is an artificial entity that can act only through agents.but this truth does not necessarily impute to the corporation any and all conduct by one who at times also acts on a corporation behalf.indeed,the district court overriding objections to utc complaint addressed the extent to which the complaint unambiguously established that mazer acted in the scope of his employment,in pursuit of business interests,when he purchased and the stolen pratt blueprints and that mazer acted for the benefit of,as opposed to himself.the district court concluded on both scores that utc pleading failed to tie mazer actions to in a manner sufficient to state a claim for corporate liability.at this threshold pleading stage,we disagree.
under the doctrine of respondeat superior,an employer can not be held liable for the tortious or criminal acts of an employee,unless the acts were committed during the course of the employment and to further a purpose or interest,however excessive or misguided,of the employer.iglesia cristiana la casa del senor,so d,dca.under florida law,an action falls within the scope of employment if the conduct is of the kind the employee was employed to perform occurred within the time and space limits of the employee employment and was activated at least in part by a purpose to serve the employment.spencer assurance of,cir iglesia cristiana,so d at.the question is whether,under this legal standard and in view of the facts available to utc at the time of pleading,utc adequately alleged that mazer was acting within the scope of his employment.
in its recitation of the facts,utc had virtually no choice but to link the allegations against closely to those against the company president,mazer.for example,its complaint stated that mazer was acting as the president of west hem and within the scope of his employment when he committed the tortious and criminal acts described in this amended complaint and that a t all relevant times,mazer was president and a substantial owner of west hem and was entirely responsible for the daily operations of west hem.am.compl.at.moreover,utc alleged that as president of west hem traveled to connecticut in november for his initial meeting with dilorenzo gave dilorenzo federal express account information to use in shipping the blueprints to instructed employees to send dilorenzo payment,make copies of the blueprints,ship a copy of the blueprints to apm,and generate invoices from to apm for the blueprints and stored the original blueprints.id.at,
argues that utc failed to plead the three elements required for a finding that mazer conduct was within the scope of his employment and instead relied on conclusory statements of law or mixed law and fact.nevertheless,although utc,in its complaint,did not expressly allege these three elements,we conclude that the complaint allegations regarding mazer conduct within the scope of his employment either incorporate these elements or generate an inference of these elements sufficient for notice pleading and to withstand a rule b motion to dismiss.
utc has pled facts that,when read together,at least arguably allege that mazer conduct in purchasing the blueprints for,and selling them to,one of aviation customers whether or not the blueprints were stolen could reasonably have been the kind of task for which he was employed that mazer acted within the time and space constraints of his employment,he acted while on duty at and that mazer could reasonably have been acting to serve and benefit business.the allegations that mazer was top officer,with broad responsibilities for the company operations,and that he utilized resources and employees in obtaining,copying,storing,and shipping the blueprints further bolster utc good faith basis for alleging that these actions were taken within the scope of mazer employment at.discovery to be taken by utc may well reveal additional evidence to be used in carrying its burden,on summary judgment or at trial,of establishing that mazer acted within the scope of employment.
should come forward with evidence that mazer was in some way not acting within the scope of his employment,the jury will have the chance to resolve this question of fact.see canaveras continental group,so d,dca where there is conflicting evidence on the issue of whether an employee is acting within the scope of employment,a jury question is presented.indeed,it may well be the case that mazer was acting outside the scope of his employment.perhaps his job description,or even a resolution of the board of directors,expressly prohibited dealing in blueprints or proscribed any illegal conduct.alternatively,perhaps utc will be unable to muster evidence sufficient to establish that mazer conduct was within his scope of employment.however,at the pleading stage,utc could not possibly have had access to the inside information necessary to prove even plead with greater factual basis for holding liable for mazer conduct.that is why we have discovery.at the pleading stage,we assess only whether utc allegations are enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.mills,at quoting twombly,at.at.giving utc,which is at a clear informational disadvantage,some benefit of the doubt to go along with the specific facts it has pled,its allegation that mazer was acting on behalf of reaches at least above the speculative level.
the district court held otherwise in part because it found no allegation that makes the buying or selling of blueprints part of its business,and concluded that mazer conduct could only be within the scope of his employment if was in the business of fencing stolen property.this reading of utc complaint is far too cramped.utc clearly alleged that is in the business of buying and selling aircraft parts and related support materials.am.compl.at emphasis added.blueprints for tooling used in servicing aircraft engines reasonably fall within the ambit of related support materials.should later come forward with evidence that,within the industry,blueprints are considered an entirely separate line of business,that would create a question of fact for the jury,not a basis for dismissal for failure to state a claim.see canaveras,so d at.nor was utc required to go so far as to allege that was established as an explicitly criminal enterprise,or that mazer job description included criminal functions,in order to state a claim for corporate liability for an employee discharge of his duties in an illegal manner.if aviation blueprints could reasonably fall within stock in trade,and if part of mazer employment duties was to buy and sell the goods in which traded,then could reasonably be answerable for its employee illegal or tortious conduct in carrying out those tasks.
the district court was also disturbed by utc allegation that mazer acted both personally and on behalf of,which the court found to be irreconcilably inconsistent.it is true that the complaint contains a degree of ambiguity regarding whether mazer acted for himself,for,or for both,as well as whether it was mazer or that provided the funds to acquire the blueprints from dilorenzo and that received the proceeds from apm.at the initial pleading stage,however,we find utc allegations sufficient to state the claims asserted against.
first,we are not troubled by what the district court saw as inconsistent allegations.rule d of the federal rules of civil procedure expressly permits the pleading of both alternative and inconsistent claims thus,utc complaint is not subject to dismissal simply because it alleges that both mazer,individually,and committed the tortious conduct,even if it would be impossible for both to be simultaneously liable which question of impossibility we need not,and do not,resolve.
furthermore,it is hard to imagine how utc could have pled its case with greater specificity or accuracy at this stage.the intricacies of the scope of mazer employment authority,as well as the details regarding exactly who provided the funds for dilorenzo and received the benefit of the payments from apm,are peculiarly within the knowledge of mazer and.although utc has pled a reasonable good faith basis for its claims against both mazer and,it has not yet been in a position to know all of the particulars.should discovery reveal that mazer was undisputably outside the scope of his employment or that he,not,was the sole beneficiary of the sale of the blueprints,then may be entitled to summary judgment or judgment as a matter of law.at the initial pleading stage,however,utc allegations were sufficient to state a claim.
for the foregoing reasons,we conclude that the allegations of counts i,iv,vii,x,and xi,when read in the light most favorable to utc,are sufficient to state a claim for relief against.we reverse the district court holding to the contrary.
we review de novo the district court dismissal of the claims against apm for lack of personal jurisdiction.meier ex rel.meier sun int l hotels,cir.a plaintiff seeking the exercise of personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant bears the initial burden of alleging in the complaint sufficient facts to make out a prima facie case of jurisdiction.posner essex ins,cir per curiam see polskie linie oceaniczne seasafe transport,cir describing procedure for plaintiff to establish personal jurisdiction under florida statute.where,as here,the defendant challenges jurisdiction by submitting affidavit evidence in support of its position,the burden traditionally shifts back to the plaintiff to produce evidence supporting jurisdiction.meier,at posner,at see polskie linie oceaniczne,at noting that,if the defendant makes a showing of the inapplicability of the statute,the plaintiff is required to substantiate the jurisdictional allegations in the complaint by affidavits or other competent proof,and not merely reiterate the factual allegations in the complaint.

any person,whether or not a citizen or resident of this state,who personally or through an agent does any of the acts enumerated in this subsection thereby submits himself or herself and,if he or she is a natural person,his or her personal representative to the jurisdiction of the courts of this state for any cause of action arising from the doing of any of the following acts

stat.b.utc complaint asserted four claims against apm,in counts iii,vi,viii,and xi civil theft,conversion,unjust enrichment,and conspiracy.thus,utc had to establish by the allegations in its complaint and,if challenged by apm as it was,by its evidence that apm,with respect to at least one of these counts,engaged in tortious conduct in florida relating to the theft and sale of the pratt blueprints 
utc essentially makes the following explicit allegations regarding apm conduct in florida relating to the pratt blueprints 
loetschert lived in florida,at mazer house,from january through march.am.compl.at.
while living in florida,loetschert,as an agent of apm,told mazer that the price dilorenzo wanted for the blueprints was too high,decided with mazer the price would pay dilorenzo for the blueprints,and helped negotiate the price with dilorenzo.id.
loetschert,while in florida,provided a portion of the cash that mazer had sent to dilorenzo as payment for the blueprints.id.
while in florida,and in order to avoid taking a copy of the blueprints with him when he returned to belgium,loetschert arranged for mazer to ship the copy of the blueprints from florida office to apm office in belgium,via federal express account.id.
apm,through its agent loetschert,actively planned and participated in the theft of the blueprints while loetschert was living with mazer in florida.id.
all of the other allegations in the complaint relating to apm either involve conduct outside of florida or do not state where the conduct took place 
these allegations appear to be sufficient to establish a prima facie case for the exercise of personal jurisdiction over apm.however,apm,through its submission of loetschert affidavit,has specifically denied each allegation.utc,citing posner as an analogous case,contends that loetschert offered no more than conclusory denials that the court should disregard.in posner,we found the defendant affidavit,offered to challenge the plaintiffs jurisdictional allegations,to be of little significance.posner,at.specifically,we observed,
the affidavit primarily explains the defendant corporate structure and status summarily asserts that the defendant has never done business in or directed contacts into florida admits certain peripheral connections with the state and denies in a conclusory way any other actions that would bring the defendant within the ambit of florida statute.for example,paragraph five covers of a page and contends,by reciting the statute essentially verbatim,that the jurisdictional statute does not apply to the defendant.such statements,although presented in the form of factual declarations,are in substance legal conclusions that do not trigger a duty for plaintiffs to respond with evidence of their own supporting jurisdiction.
id.accordingly,we considered only those portions of the affidavit that set forth specific factual declarations within the affiant personal knowledge.id.
loetschert affidavit,in contrast,is not so conclusory and,as such,merits our consideration.the affidavit does start with a brief description of apm corporate structure,admit certain peripheral connections between loetschert and the state and between apm and the other parties,and include the conclusory assertion that n either i nor apm committed any tortious or criminal acts within the territorial jurisdiction of this court,loetschert affidavit at,but it does not end there.rather,loetschert goes on to,based on his personal knowledge,and under penalty of factual allegations lodged by utc these specific factual denials include 
at no time while i was in florida did i conduct business transactions on behalf of apm.id.
neither i nor apm actively planned and participated in the theft of the blueprints while i was living in florida.id.
apm,at no time including the time i was staying in florida ever assisted defendant in negotiating a price for the blueprints with anthony dilorenzo,and did not decide,alone or together with anyone,what defendant should pay dilorenzo for those blueprints.id.
i never provided a portion of the cash that mazer instructed west hem employees to send to dilorenzo as payment for the blueprints.id.
i never arranged with defendant mazer to ship the blueprints to apm in belgium to avoid taking the copy of the stolen blueprints on the plane with me when i returned to belgium.in fact,it is my understanding that the full set of blueprints in question were not received by defendants mazer or until after i had already left,in march,the united states for belgium.id.
these statements are not mere legal conclusions they are specific factual denials that challenge each and every factual allegation raised by utc regarding apm conduct in florida in connection with the pratt blueprints these specific factual declarations within the affiant personal knowledge,in contrast to those in the affidavit in posner,are sufficient to shift to the plaintiff the burden of producing evidence supporting jurisdiction.posner,at.
utc attempted to respond and establish jurisdiction by means of mazer purported statements about apm and loetschert contained in the dunphy report,but the district court found these statements to be inadmissable hearsay and declined to consider them.in so deciding,the district court did not abuse its discretion.see united states brown,cir we review a district court hearsay ruling for abuse of discretion.
utc argues that mazer statements in the dunphy report should have been considered under the exceptions to the rule against hearsay for records of regularly conducted business activity,and public records and reports.for the exceptions to apply,the report must contain factual findings that are based upon the knowledge or observations of the preparer of the report,as opposed to a mere collection of statements from a witness.miller field,cir.it is well established that entries in a police report which result from the officer own observations and knowledge may be admitted but that statements made by third persons under no business duty to report may not.united states pazsint,cir finding rule inapplicable see also miller,at finding rule inapplicable parsons honeywell,cir same.in other words,p lacing otherwise inadmissible hearsay statements by into a government report does not make the statements admissible.commodity futures trading comm wilshire inv.mgmt,d,aff in part,vacated in part on other grounds,cir.
here,while we need not decide whether the dunphy report itself is subject to the asserted exceptions,the pertinent point is that we can say with confidence that rules and can not render admissible mazer hearsay statements contained within the report.see.hearsay within hearsay subject to an exception is not admissible.joseph kimple,d.therefore,utc can not rely on mazer purported statements in the dunphy report to establish jurisdiction in opposition to the loetschert affidavit unless those statements themselves are subject to a hearsay exception.
utc suggests that mazer statements in the dunphy report could be viewed as admissions because mazer is a director and part owner of apm.federal rule of evidence d provides that a statement is not hearsay if 
the statement is offered against a party and is a the party own statement,in either an individual or a representative capacity or b a statement of which the party has manifested an adoption or belief in its truth,or c a statement by a person authorized by the party to make a statement concerning the subject,or d a statement by the party agent or servant concerning a matter within the scope of the agency or employment,made during the existence of the relationship,or e a statement by a coconspirator of a party during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy.the contents of the statement shall be considered but are not alone sufficient to establish the declarant authority under subdivision c,the agency or employment relationship and scope thereof under subdivision d,or the existence of the conspiracy and the participation therein of the declarant and the party against whom the statement is offered under subdivision e.
however,there is no no reason to mazer statements to government investigators,made while he himself was facing criminal charges,were made in a representative capacity on behalf of apm,that apm adopted those statements,or that mazer was authorized to make the statements on apm behalf.furthermore,because mazer statements relate to his sale of the blueprints to apm,they can not also concern a matter within the scope of his agency or employment,if any,for apm moreover,even assuming arguendo that mazer and apm were,mazer statements essentially confessing to the misconduct can not constitute statements by a during the course and in furtherance of that same conspiracy.thus,any admissions contained in the dunphy report are mazer alone they can not be attributed to apm.
mazer unsworn,unattested statements in the dunphy report also are not admissible under the residual exception to the hearsay rule.congress intended the residual hearsay exception to be used very rarely,and only in exceptional circumstances,united states ingram,cir,and it appl ies only when certain exceptional guarantees of trustworthiness exist and when high degrees of probativeness and necessity are present,united states wright,cir.notwithstanding the proffer agreement under which mazer submitted to the government interview,mazer position as a target in a criminal investigation provided him ample motivation to implicate others even falsely,including apm,in his misconduct in order to diffuse and mitigate his own culpability.thus,the statements lack the equivalent circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness that rule requires.moreover,mazer statements are not more probative on the point for which they are offered than any other evidence which the proponent can procure through reasonable efforts.as further explained below,utc could have taken reasonable steps to obtain admissible testimony directly from mazer prior to the district court ruling on apm motion to dismiss,but it failed to do so.as such,rule can not salvage the admissibility of mazer statements in the dunphy report.
at oral argument,utc further argued that mazer statements,because he had a financial stake in apm,constituted statements against interest subject to the exception to the hearsay rule set forth in rule b of the federal rules of evidence.because utc did not raise this argument in its opening brief or at all in the district court,it has likely been abandoned.davis bottling,cir millennium partners,colmar storage,llc,cir arguments raised for the first time on appeal are not properly before this court.even if we were to consider this argument,however,it lacks merit for two reasons.first,rule b only applies where the declarant is unavailable,and utc has made no showing that mazer was unavailable to give competent testimony.indeed,utc reasonably could have taken,but failed to take,reasonable steps to obtain mazer direct testimony.second,while it appears to be true that mazer had an ownership interest in apm and indirectly might have stood to lose money if apm were implicated in the theft and sale of the pratt blueprints and thereafter subjected to civil or criminal liability,the criminal charges pending against mazer would have been a substantially greater concern to a reasonable person in mazer position.therefore,it is reasonable to infer that spreading blame for the misconduct by implicating others,even falsely,could have been at least as big a priority for mazer at the time of his interview with government investigators as would have been protecting his financial stake in apm.accordingly,the facts do not compel a conclusion that mazer statements pertaining to apm were at the time of their making so far contrary to mazer pecuniary or proprietary interest that a reasonable person in mazer position would not have made the statement unless believing it to be true.b.
in sum,while the dunphy report itself might be hearsay subject to an exception,mazer statements contained within the report are themselves hearsay statements,and the rules of evidence require that,for hearsay within hearsay to be admissible,each part of the combined statements must conform with an exception to the hearsay rule.yet no exception applies to the mazer statements.accordingly,we find no abuse of discretion in the district court decision to disregard those statements.
utc,therefore,has proffered no competent evidence to establish jurisdiction in opposition to the denials of the jurisdictional allegations contained in loetschert affidavit.under such circumstances,the district court correctly found loetschert unrebutted denials sufficient to negate utc jurisdictional allegations tying apm to tortious conduct in florida.consequently,the district court properly concluded that it lacked personal jurisdiction over apm under florida statute.
before leaving this topic,we must briefly address utc argument that,rather than dismissing for lack of personal jurisdiction over apm,the district court should have deferred a ruling on apm motion and granted utc requests for jurisdictional discovery,including the taking of mazer and loetschert depositions initially,t he court denial,grant,or limitation of a motion for discovery is reviewed for abuse of discretion.lowery.power,cir.here,utc expressly recognized the potential utility of jurisdictional discovery at least by the time it filed its response to apm motion to dismiss on april.however,utc never formally moved the district court for jurisdictional discovery but,instead,buried such requests in its briefs as a proposed alternative to dismissing apm on the state of the current record.furthermore,utc does not appear to have served notices for mazer or loetschert notices manifested utc understanding of its ability to seek discovery during the pendency of apm motion to late july and early august.thereafter,though utc claims to have been informally working through scheduling issues with the witnesses and responding to apm objections to the sufficiency of utc deposition notice for loetschert,utc failed to take any formal action to compel discovery or properly issue an internationally effective subpoena for loetschert testimony.
all in all,utc should have taken every step possible to signal to the district court its immediate need for such discovery.but,despite the obvious urgency of the situation,it failed to take any of these reasonable steps to seek discovery,or a deferral of a ruling pending discovery,during the more than four months apm motion was pending.the district court,therefore,did not so much deny discovery as it dismissed the case before discovery was taken.we can not say that the district court erred,posner,at,much less abused its discretion.
finally,we address whether utc conspiracy claim is sufficient to justify the exercise of personal jurisdiction in florida over apm.the district court held that,because n one of the complaint allegations involve an actionable tort in florida,there is no underlying tort in florida to support a conspiracy claim.as a result,personal jurisdiction does not exist over apm,a foreign corporation,on the conspiracy claim under florida statute.
under florida law,a civil conspiracy must have as its object the commission of an underlying tort.whether the underlying tort must have been completed and thus be independently actionable,however,is open to question.the florida courts have been somewhat divided concerning the answer to this question.compare raimi furlong,so d,dca a n actionable conspiracy requires an actionable underlying tort or wrong.rushing bosse,so d,dca same florida fern growers ass n,concerned citizens of putnam county,so d,dca same,with wilcox stout,so d,dca florida recognizes that civil conspiracies may exist as an independent tort.see also walters blankenship,so d,dca as for the count of civil conspiracy,we conclude it is viable,based either on the underlying tortious interference count or as an independent tort generally an actionable conspiracy requires an actionable underlying tort or wrong however,an alternative basis for a civil conspiracy claim exists where the plaintiff can show some peculiar power of coercion possessed by the conspirators by virtue of their combination,which an individual acting alone does not possess.citations omitted.
in this appeal,however,we need not enter the morass of whether or when florida law requires an independent tort to support a civil conspiracy claim because,in any event,utc conspiracy allegations are insufficient to justify the exercise of personal jurisdiction over apm.florida courts have held that the state statute can support personal jurisdiction over any alleged conspirator where any other commits an act in florida in furtherance of the conspiracy,even if the defendant over whom personal jurisdiction is sought individually committed no act in,or had no relevant contact with,florida.see machtinger inertial airline,so d,dca finding personal jurisdiction existed in florida where conspiracy was made in ohio but acts in furtherance of the conspiracy were done in and directed toward florida wilcox,so d at if plaintiff has successfully alleged that any member of that conspiracy committed tortious acts in florida in furtherance of that conspiracy,then all of the conspirators are subject to the jurisdiction of the state of florida through its statute see also bus,new oji paper,so d,finding personal jurisdiction in florida over participant in a nationwide conspiracy in which some,but not the defendant at issue,made sales into florida.
here,in contrast,utc has alleged nothing that clearly connected apm to a conspiracy made or carried out in florida.at the threshold,as explain
