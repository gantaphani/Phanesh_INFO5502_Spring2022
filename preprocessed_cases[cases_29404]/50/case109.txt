accent packaging,accent appeals the district court grant of summary judgment to leggett platt,leggett of noninfringement of claims of patent patent and of claims,and of patent patent.as part of its appeal,accent challenges the district court construction of the terms each and a respective one in the claims of the patent.because the district court erred in its construction,we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment to leggett with respect to claims of the patent and remand to the district court to enter summary judgment in favor of accent on those claims.we affirm,however,the district court grant of summary judgment to leggett with respect to claim of the patent and all of the asserted claims of the patent.we also affirm the district court denial of accent motion for additional discovery pursuant to.d,as well as its dismissal of accent missouri uniform trade secrets act mutsa cause of action.
background 
a.the asserted patents 
the and the patents,assigned to accent,arose from the same patent application and share a nearly identical specification.the patents disclose a wire tier device that is used to bale recyclables or solid waste for easier handling.figures and of the patents,reproduced below,are representative of the disclosed device 
of particular relevance in this appeal,the described wire tier includes elongated operator bodies,and.these four elongated operator bodies are fixed to and project radially from a cross shaft.see patent ll patent ll.as the cross shaft rotates in a single direction,the elongated operator bodies perform several operations,including gripping the wire,twisting two ends of the wire together with a part known as the knotter,cutting the wire,and finally ejecting the wire from the knotter so that the trash or recyclables being bound can be moved away from the baler and a new bundle can be tied.id.
the patents also describe a knotter cover referred to in the asserted claims as simply the cover which normally is positioned beneath the knotter assembly and serves to retain the wires within the knotter assembly during the twisting and cutting operations.after the twisting and cutting is completed,the cover is moved upwardly so as to permit ejection of the knotted and tensioned wire.id.ll patent ll.the cover is shown in its elevated position in figure of the patents.
the patents further describe how two of the elongated operator bodies work together to perform two separate functions.specifically,the patents describe how the sector gear is pivoted by virtue of the roller attached to the operators,and riding within drive slot.patent ll patent ll.this rotation causes the twisting or knotting of the wire sections.patent patent.but that is not all.elongated operator bodies and also cause the cover to shift outward after the knotting process is complete.patent ll patent ll.that is,elongated operator bodies and together operate both the knotter and the cover.additionally,elongated operator body operates the gripper and elongated operator body operates the cutter.see patent ll patent ll.
asserted claims of the patent recite a knotting device that includes a pivotal shaft assembly and elongated operator bodies.claim of the patent is representative for purposes of this appeal and reads as follows 
in a knotting device including a knotting assembly having a gripper for selectively gripping one of two adjacent wire sections,a rotatable knotter operable to the two adjacent wire sections,a cutting element for cutting of the other of said adjacent wire sections after twistknotting of the sections and a shiftable cover located adjacent said knotter for maintaining the wire sections within the knotter during feeding said and thereafter movable to a position permitting passage of the wire sections from the knotter,the improvement which comprises an operator assembly for timed operation of said gripper,knotter,cutting element and cover,and a single drive assembly coupled with said operator assembly for effecting said timed operation,
said operator assembly including a pivotal shaft assembly and elongated operator bodies,with each of the operator bodies being operably coupled with a respective one of said gripper,knotter,cutting element and cover so as to supply driving power from the single drive assembly thereto,
each of said operator bodies projecting radially from and being fixed to the shaft assembly such that rotational movement of the shaft assembly causes the operator bodies to swing about a shaft axis,
said shaft assembly effecting said timed operation by rotating in a single direction about the shaft axis,
each of said operator bodies including an interacting element associated therewith,
each of said interacting elements being drivingly connected to a respective one of the gripper,knotter,cutting element,and cover wherein swinging of the operator bodies in the single direction effects said timed operation.
patent ll emphasis added.
asserted claim of the patent and asserted claims,and of the patent recite a mount for a cover that permits the cover to be pivoted away from the knotter through a pivot arc of at least about.claim of the patent is representative for purposes of this appeal and reads as follows 
in a knotting device including a rotatable knotter operable to a pair of adjacent wire sections,and a cover located adjacent said knotter in a position for maintaining the wire sections within the knotter during feeding and knotting operations,the improvement which comprises a mount for said cover permitting the cover to be pivoted away from said knotter to a knotter access position remote from said position and though a pivot arc of at least about,
said cover being pivotal relative to the knotter to open from the position to a position,with the cover permitting passage of the wire sections from the knotter when in the position,
said cover being further pivotal relative to the knotter to open beyond the position to the knotter access position.
patent ll emphasis added.
b.the accused product 
accent claims that its wire tire device device is the commercial embodiment of the and patents.according to accent,leggett obtained a device in early.accent alleges that leggett studied and eventually began selling its own copy of the device the leggett pinnacle wire tire device pinnacle.
accent acknowledges,however,at least two differences between the leggett pinnacle device and the accent device.first,the pinnacle device includes only two elongated operating bodies rather than the four elongated operator bodies found in accent device.in particular,the pinnacle operates the knotter,the cover,and the cutter with a single elongated operator body.second,the pinnacle features a removable core module that incorporates many of the internal,components of the pinnacle knotter assembly.the core is removed by pivoting the cover approximately degrees,securing the raised cover in place with the safelatch stop,and sliding the core out of the pinnacle knotter.
c.the district court proceedings 
accent filed suit against leggett on april,asserting claims for infringement of the and patents and a claim for violation of the mutsa,based on leggett alleged improper acquisition and copying of a device.on june,leggett answered and filed a motion to dismiss accent trade secret claim for failure to state a claim.after an initial status conference on june,the district court dismissed accent trade secret claim.
accent expert was allowed to inspect leggett pinnacle device on july.pursuant to an order of the district court,leggett subsequently produced a redacted copy of its own patent application,which purportedly covers its pinnacle device.leggett also produced engineering drawings of the pinnacle,marketing and promotional materials related to the pinnacle,and a pinnacle operating manual.the district court held another status conference on august,and accent asked for additional discovery.on august,the district court set a deadline of september,for the filing of motions for summary judgment,but denied accent request for additional discovery.
on september,accent filed a motion seeking additional discovery from leggett,including information regarding a pinnacle unit that leggett had allegedly sold to a customer,a.b deposition on issues related to infringement and claim construction,and production of the redacted portions of leggett patent application.the district denied each of these requests.
accent moved for summary judgment of infringement of claims of the patent and leggett moved for summary judgment of noninfringement of all the asserted claims of the and patents.in conjunction with its opposition to leggett motion for summary judgment,accent also filed a motion to continue summary judgment in order to conduct additional discovery pursuant to.f,now.d.
on june,the district court held a hearing on the parties motions for summary judgment.with respect to the asserted claims of the patent,leggett argued that its pinnacle device does not meet the following limitation 
said operator assembly including a pivotal shaft assembly and elongated operator bodies,with each of the operator bodies being operably coupled with a respective one of said gripper,knotter,cutting element and cover so as to supply driving power from the single drive assembly thereto.
specifically,leggett argued that the language each of the operator bodies being operably coupled with a respective one of said gripper,knotter,cutting element and cover requires four elongated operator bodies each operably coupled to one and only one of said gripper,knotter,cutting element,or cover.because leggett pinnacle device has only two elongated operator bodies,leggett asserted that it can not infringe these claims.accent,however,argued that these claims are not limited to a specific number of elongated operator bodies because they allow for a single elongated operator body to perform multiple functions.
with respect to claim of the patent and claims,and of the patent,leggett argued that its pinnacle device does not include a cover mount that permits the cover to pivot through an arc of at least about ninety degrees.accent,however,argued that the pinnacle cover mount does in fact allow its cover to pivot through an arc of ninety degrees and that only an easily removable mechanical stop prevents the cover mount from so rotating.
the district court did not grant accent request for additional discovery and instead granted leggett summary judgment of noninfringement of all the asserted claims.accent packaging,leggett platt,no.h,slip op.at.regarding the patent,the district court concluded that t he word each,in this patent,refers to one of four arms and that a n ordinary reading of the language,therefore,assigns the machine four arms a single function.id.at.the district court determined that because the claims require four arms,leggett pinnacle device does not infringe.with respect to the patent,the district court concluded that the pinnacle mount does not pivot greater than degrees and therefore does not infringe.id.at.according to the district court,the removability of the stop is of no consequence.in particular,the district court reasoned that t he removable stop is simply a stop the function of an arc in leggett machine is served by flipping less than degrees.

infringement 
a respective one 
on appeal,accent argues that the district court erred in construing each and a respective one to require four elongated operator bodies.according to accent,the claims are not limited to a device with four elongated operator bodies.while the claims require that each of the operator bodies are operably coupled with a respective one of said gripper,knotter,cutting element and cover,accent asserts that the claims do not require that each elongated operator body be coupled to one and only one of these operator elements.accent points to the preferred embodiment disclosed in the specification,which explicitly shows two elongated operator bodies that are operably coupled to both the knotter and the cover.patent,ll.
leggett responds that the district court correctly determined that because the asserted claims of the patent recite four separate and distinct operator elements,the claims require at least four elongated operator bodies so that each of the elongated operator bodies is coupled to a respective one of the four claimed operator elements.leggett notes that while the specification and prosecution history of the patent impart no special meaning to the phrases each and a respective one,the preferred,and only,embodiment in the specification has a total of four operating arms.patent.
claim terms are generally given their ordinary meaning as understood by persons skilled in the art in question at the time of the invention.see phillips awh,en banc.the claims,of course,do not stand alone.id.at.t he specification is always highly relevant to the claim construction analysis.usually it is dispositive it is the single best guide to the meaning of a disputed term.id.quoting vitronics conceptronic.
having considered all of the parties arguments,we agree with accent that the district court erred in construing the asserted claims of the patent.leggett can only arrive at its added limitation requiring four elongated operator bodies by construing each and a respective one to require that each of the elongated operator bodies correspond to one and only one of the gripper,knotter,cutter,and cover.but in the preferred embodiment of the invention,two elongated operator bodies are operably coupled to both the knotter and the cover.put differently,the preferred embodiment features an elongated operator body that is operably coupled to one or more operator elements.we have held that a claim interpretation that excludes a preferred embodiment from the scope of the claim is rarely,if ever,correct.on line,bodenseewerk perkin elmer gmbh.
nor are we persuaded that the asserted claim language explicitly requires that each elongated operator body be coupled to one and only one operator element.nothing in the claim language compels that result.it is true that each operator body must be coupled to a respective one of the gripper,knotter,cutter,and cover.but that does not necessarily prevent an elongated operator body from being coupled to a second or even a third operator element as well.see baldwin graphic,siebert,holding that an indefinite article a or an in patent parlance carries the meaning of one or more in openended claims containing the transitional phrase comprising unless a patentee has evidence d a clear intent to limit a or an to one quoting kcj kinetic concepts.at first glance,the term one appearing directly after the phrase a respective might be viewed as limiting.in this case,however,the specification substantiates a construction that allows for an elongated operator body to be operably coupled to one or more operator elements.again,the only embodiment described in accent patents features two elongated operator bodies that are each operably coupled to two distinct operator elements the knotter and the cover.and while the specification discloses a knotting device with four elongated operator bodies,the asserted claim language is not so limited.see phillips,at a lthough the specification often describes very specific embodiments of the invention,we have repeatedly warned against confining the claims to those embodiments.
