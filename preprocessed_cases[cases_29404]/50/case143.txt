introduction 
plaintiff and appellant raymond edwards ii edwards was hired by arthur andersen llp andersen in.at the time he was hired,edwards was required by andersen to execute a noncompetition agreement,which prohibited him from working for or soliciting certain categories of andersen clients for limited periods after his termination.andersen eventually went out of business and sold its practice to various entities.andersen los angeles tax practice,of which edwards was a part,was sold to hsbc,which hired andersen los angeles office personnel.as a condition of hire with hsbc,however,andersen allegedly required that edwards obtain a release of the noncompetition agreement.to do so,edwards was required to execute a termination of agreement tonc drafted by andersen.that document contained a broad release of claims against andersen,as well as other terms favorable to andersen.edwards refused to sign and his employment offer with hsbc was withdrawn.he sued andersen for,inter alia,intentional interference with prospective economic advantage and violation of the cartwright act.andersen demurrer to the cartwright act claim was sustained on the ground edwards lacked standing to sue.the intentional interference claim was dismissed as a matter of law before trial,based upon the trial court ruling that both the noncompetition agreement and the tonc were valid.
we conclude a noncompetition agreement between an employee and employer,prohibiting the employee from performing services for certain former clients,is invalid under business and professions code section unless it falls within the statutory or trade secret exceptions to the statute.such a noncompetition agreement is invalid even if the restraints imposed are narrow and leave a substantial portion of the market open to the employee.in so holding,we conclude the narrow restraint exception to section,articulated by the ninth circuit,is not a proper application of california law.because the noncompetition agreement was invalid and against public policy under section,requiring edwards to execute the tonc as consideration for release from the noncompetition agreement constituted an independently wrongful act for purposes of the elements of edwards intentional interference with prospective economic advantage claim.
we further hold that the tonc purported to waive edwards labor code section indemnity rights.because labor code section indemnity provisions implement public policy,requiring edwards to waive indemnity rights as a condition of continued employment violated public policy and constituted an independently wrongful act for purposes of the intentional interference with prospective economic advantage claim.
we reject edwards contention that a nondisparagement provision contained in the tonc violated labor code section.
in the unpublished portion of the opinion,we reject andersen argument that,as a matter of law edwards lacked a prospective economic relationship with hsbc,and hsbc,rather than andersen,insisted that edwards execute the tonc as a condition of employment.we further conclude andersen demurrer to edwards cartwright act cause of action was properly sustained.
factual and procedural background 
edwards employment with andersen and the noncompetition agreement.
in january,edwards,a certified public accountant,was hired as a tax manager by andersen los angeles office.in that position,edwards provided income,gift,and estate planning services to high net worth individuals and their enterprises.andersen was,at the time,one of the five major public accounting firms providing accounting services in california.as a condition of employment edwards signed andersen standard noncompetition agreement,which was required of all andersen managers.the relevant provisions of that agreement were as follows 
if you leave the firm,for eighteen months after release or resignation,you agree not to perform professional services of the type you provided for any client on which you worked during the eighteen months prior to release or resignation.this does not prohibit you from accepting employment with a client.
for twelve months after you leave the firm,you agree not to solicit to perform professional services of the type you provided any client of the office s to which you were assigned during the eighteen months preceding release or resignation.
you agree not to solicit away from the firm any of its professional personnel for eighteen months after release or resignation.
sale of andersen assets to hsbc,the tonc,and withdrawal of edwards employment offer with hsbc.
in march,andersen was indicted for obstruction of justice in connection with the investigation of enron corporation by the securities and exchange commission.see generally arthur andersen llp united states,d.in june,andersen was found guilty in august,andersen announced it would cease practicing public accounting in the united states.andersen california accounting license was revoked in september.
during this period,beginning in approximately april,andersen began selling portions of its practice to competitors.in may,andersen internally announced that hsbc,through a new subsidiary,wealth and tax advisory services wtas,would purchase a portion of andersen los angeles tax practice,including edwards group.as a condition of the hsbc transaction closing,andersen required that all andersen managers,including edwards,execute the tonc in order to obtain employment with hsbc.the tonc was crafted by andersen.
the tonc required employees to,inter alia,voluntarily resign from andersen release andersen from any and all claims,including claims that in any way arise from or out of,are based upon or relate to employee employment by,association with or compensation from andersen continue indefinitely to preserve confidential information and trade secrets except as otherwise required by a court or governmental agency refrain from disparaging andersen or its related entities or partners and cooperate with andersen in connection with any investigation of,or litigation against,andersen.in exchange,andersen would agree to accept edwards resignation,agree to edwards employment by or affiliation with hsbc,and release edwards from the foregoing provisions of the noncompetition agreement.
hsbc extended an employment offer to edwards.the offer was contingent upon edwards executing the tonc.edwards was informed by andersen that he had to sign the tonc in order for him to be employed by hsbc.edwards signed and returned hsbc written employment offer,but refused to sign the tonc.allegedly as a result,hsbc withdrew its employment offer.
edwards lawsuit and the trial court rulings.
on april,edwards filed a complaint against andersen,hsbc,and wtas.the complaint alleged,inter alia,causes of action for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage and anticompetitive business practices under the cartwright act et.
the trial court sustained defendants demurrers to the cartwright act claim without leave to amend on the ground edwards lacked standing to bring the claim.
the trial court denied andersen subsequent motion for summary adjudication on edwards intentional interference with prospective economic advantage claim,concluding triable issues of fact existed regarding the meaning of the agreements,and whether the noncompetition agreement protected trade secrets.all remaining claims against andersen were dismissed via summary adjudication and are not at issue here.edwards settled with the remaining defendants prior to trial.
shortly before trial,andersen moved pursuant to code of civil procedure sections and,subdivision b,to sever trial on the issue of the enforceability of the noncompetition agreement and the tonc andersen urged that the enforceability of the agreements presented pure questions of law for adjudication by the trial court,and contended that the provisions of both the tonc and the noncompetition agreement were lawful.
over edwards objection,the trial court granted the motion to sever and,at the same hearing,ruled in favor of andersen on the merits.the trial court heard arguments from the parties,but did not take evidence.it determined,based primarily upon its interpretation of the contractual provisions,that as a matter of law the noncompetition agreement fell within the narrow restraint exception to section the noncompetition agreement provision prohibiting edwards from soliciting andersen employees was lawful the nondisparagement clause was not illegal and the tonc did not specifically release edwards indemnity rights.accordingly,it granted judgment for andersen.this appeal followed.
discussion 
the intentional interference with prospective economic advantage.standard of review.
the parties agree that this court must independently review the trial court ruling on the prospective economic advantage claim,in that it was decided as a matter of law and turned on analysis of whether certain provisions of the noncompetition agreement and the tonc were valid and enforceable.see,application group,hunter group,th,fn,d it is essentially a pure question of law whether defendant covenant not to compete is enforceable parsons bristol development cal d,mccrary construction metal deck specialists,inc th,d it is solely a judicial function to interpret a written instrument unless the interpretation turns on the credibility of extrinsic evidence timney lin th,d whether a contract is illegal is generally a question of law.
b.the elements of intentional interference with prospective economic advantage and contentions of the parties.
the elements of a claim for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage are not in dispute.to establish such a claim,the plaintiff has the burden to prove the following elements an economic relationship between plaintiff and a third party,with the probability of future economic benefit to the plaintiff defendant knowledge of the relationship an intentional act by the defendant,designed to disrupt the relationship actual disruption of the relationship and economic harm to the plaintiff proximately caused by the defendant wrongful act.korea supply lockheed martin cal th,d,stevenson real estate services,cb richard ellis real estate services,th,d stevenson.the intentional act must be independently wrongful,wrongful by some measure beyond the fact of the interference itself.della penna toyota motor sales,cal th,d,stevenson,supra,at,d.in other words,the act must be proscribed by some constitutional,statutory,regulatory,common law,or other determinable standard,rather than merely be a product of an improper,but lawful,purpose or motive korea supply,supra,at fn,d,reeves hanlon cal th,d,stevenson,supra,at,d and must be independently actionable.stevenson,supra,at,d.the plaintiff need not prove that the defendant acted with the specific intent or purpose of disrupting the plaintiff prospective economic advantage,as long as the defendant knew the interference was certain or substantially certain to occur as a result of its action.korea supply,supra,at,d.
at issue here is the third element of the tort.edwards contends that the wrongful act requirement was met in three respects.first,he asserts that the noncompetition agreement was illegal under section.thus,he urges,andersen demand for consideration to release him from an illegal covenant not to compete violated public policy and satisfied the wrongful act requirement.
second,edwards asserts that two aspects of the tonc violated california law the tonc broad release of andersen amounted to a waiver of his indemnity rights in violation of california labor code sections,and and the tonc provision violated labor code section.
andersen,on the other hand,contends both the tonc and noncompetition agreements were lawful.further,andersen urges,one provision of the noncompetition provision prohibiting edwards from raiding andersen and is not challenged as unlawful.therefore,andersen argues,it could lawfully demand execution of the tonc as consideration for release from that single covenant,even if the remaining portions of the noncompetition agreement were void.we consider these contentions seriatim.
c.the noncompetition agreement was invalid under section and therefore requiring consideration to release edwards from it was an independently wrongful act.
i california policy against restraint on the practice of a profession,trade,or business.
in many states,restraints on the practice of a profession,trade,or business are valid if reasonable.see hill medical wycoff th,d bosley medical group abramson d.california,however,rejected this approach in,upon enactment of the civil code.hill medical wycoff,supra,at,d bosley medical group abramson,supra,at.california policy favoring open competition is embodied in section formerly,which provides that,subject to limited exceptions,every contract by which anyone is restrained from engaging in a lawful profession,trade,or business of any kind is to that extent void.
california courts have consistently declared section to be an expression of public policy which ensures that every citizen retains the right to pursue any lawful employment and enterprise of his or her choice.kelton stravinski th,d metro traffic control,shadow traffic network th,d playhut,th,d kgb,giannoulas d.application group,hunter group,supra,th at,d.thus,section sets forth the general rule in california covenants not to compete are void.kelton stravinski,supra,at,d hill medical wycoff,supra,at,d.
several statutory exceptions to section exist.sections and derived from,permit broad covenants not to compete in two narrow situations,where a person sells the goodwill of a business and where a partner agrees not to compete in anticipation of dissolution of a partnership.citation.kelton stravinski,supra,th at,d bosley medical group abramson,supra,d at.kolani gluska th,d hill medical wycoff,supra,th at,d.section protects the purchaser of a business from subsequent competition from the seller,which would reduce the value of the property right acquired.monogram industries,sar industries,d.section protects partners from,inter alia,the risk that a partnership goodwill will be diminished by competition from a withdrawing partner.south bay radiology medical associates asher d.section,enacted in,provides that a member of a limited liability company may,upon or in anticipation of dissolution of the company,agree not to carry on a similar business within a specified geographic area.
additionally,it has long been recognized that section does not invalidate covenants not to compete where necessary to protect the employer trade secrets.see muggill reuben donnelley cal d,section invalidates provisions in employment contracts prohibiting an employee from working for a competitor after completion of his employment or imposing a penalty if he does so citations,unless they are necessary to protect the employer trade secrets citation gordon landau cal d,empire steam laundry lozier cal,that equity will always protect against the unwarranted disclosure of trade secrets and confidential communications and the like is,of course,settled beyond peradventure.readylink healthcare cotton th,d california courts recognize a judicially created exception to section,and will enforce a restrictive covenant,when a former employee uses trade secrets or commits unfair competition whyte schlage lock th,d playhut,supra,th at,d loral moyes d.the misuse of trade secrets may include solicitation of an employer customers when confidential information is employed.see generally,et.uniform trade secrets act chin et,cal.practice guide employment litigation the rutter group.
andersen does not contend any of the statutory exceptions apply,nor did the trial court conclude the noncompetition agreement was necessary to protect andersen trade secrets.whether the trade secret exception applied was not resolved below and,on the facts presented here,could not properly have been resolved adversely to edwards without the evaluation of evidence.see generally thompson impaxx,th,d.therefore,we consider whether the noncompetition agreement violated section.
true to the statute mandate,california courts have held a variety of noncompetition agreements invalid under section.see,playhut,supra,th at,d agreement not to render services to any person or entity in connection with competing products for one year metro traffic control,shadow traffic network,supra,th at,d covenant by traffic reporters not to provide traffic reporting services or related activities kolani gluska,supra,th at,d prohibition on competing with employer for one year within a radius or soliciting former employer past,current,or potential customers bosley medical group abramson,supra,d at.agreement by physician not to open a competitive practice.
likewise,covenants that penalize employees for competing with a former employer are invalid under section.muggill reuben donnelley,supra,cal d at,forfeit of pension benefits if retiree worked for competitor gordon termite control terrones d.contract requiring a former employee to pay per account if he solicited former customers see also chin et,employment litigation,supra,at.
ii the noncompetition agreement was invalid under section.
applying these principles here,we conclude the noncompetition agreement was invalid.the first challenged clause prohibited edwards,for an period,from performing professional services of the type he had provided while at andersen,for any client on whose account he had worked during months prior to his termination.the second challenged clause prohibited edwards,for a year after termination,from soliciting,defined by the agreement as providing professional services to any client of andersen los angeles office.
similar clauses have been held invalid under section.in morris harris d,an employee agreed not to solicit,or accept business from,any of the employer clients for a period of years.the contract provided for liquidated damages of per month if the employee violated its terms.morris explained the contract was a partial restraint on the former employee right to engage in a lawful trade or business,and therefore was invalid under section.the court reasoned,the statute makes no exception in favor of contracts only in partial restraint of trade.id.at,quoting chamberlain augustine cal,see continental moseley cal d,a former employee has the right to engage in a competitive business for himself and to enter into competition with his former employer,even for the business of those who had formerly been the customers of his former employer,provided such competition is fairly and legally conducted.citation.reeves hanlon,supra,cal th at,d,same.
in thompson impaxx,supra,th,d,an employer terminated an employee who refused to sign a noncompetition covenant.the agreement would have prohibited the employee,for one year following termination,from calling on,soliciting,or taking away any of the employer customers or potential customers with whom the employee had had dealings.id.at,d.the employer argued that the agreement was not a true covenant not to compete,but a mere limited restrictive covenant not to solicit,which,the employer urged,did not run afoul of section.id.at,d.in the employer view,it did not prevent appellant from continuing in his profession or trade,or from working for a competitor or former customer,or from accepting the business of former customers if they solicited him,or from soliciting former customers with whom he had no dealings while he was respondents employee.ibid.thompson rejected these arguments,reasoning this clause is less restrictive,and less anticompetitive,than the broad,traditional anticompetitive clauses respondents compare it to.it is nevertheless else would they ask employees to sign it id.at,d.thompson distinguished cases involving trade secrets,finding them inapplicable.id.at,d distinguishing,inter alia,trade route cases and loral moyes,supra,d.the court reiterated the rule that nonsolicitation clauses are allowable only when they protect trade secrets or confidential proprietary information.thompson impaxx,supra,at,d.
the challenged clauses of andersen noncompetition agreement suffer from similar infirmities.the agreement prohibited edwards from performing work for clients of andersen los angeles office and clients of any andersen office for whom he had performed work,for specified periods.the prohibition applied even if the client approached edwards and requested his services.while the noncompetition clause was circumscribed in time and scope,it nonetheless restricted edwards ability to practice his profession.see thompson impaxx,supra,th at,d.the agreement did not fall within one of the statutory exceptions to section.absent a finding that the provisions fell within the trade secret exception,they were void.thompson impaxx,supra,at,d.
iii the narrow restraint exception.
in concluding the noncompetition agreement was valid,however,the trial court relied on a different theory,the narrow restraint exception to section developed primarily by the ninth circuit.that exception,in essence,provides that a noncompetition agreement does not violate section as long as the restriction imposed is limited and leaves a substantial portion of the market available to the employee.general commercial packaging tps package engineering,cir,general commercial.in the trial court view,andersen noncompetition agreement fell within this exception it placed only a narrow restriction on edwards ability to engage in his profession.the trial court pointed out that there were more than enough of these wealthy folks in for all cpa to do the kind of work edwards was doing.so there was any significant restriction on his ability to work.there was even perhaps any minimal restriction on his ability to work.andersen argues that the narrow restraint doctrine is viable,the noncompetition agreement was narrowly tailored,and the trial court ruling was correct.
to address andersen argument,we must briefly trace the genesis of the narrow restraint doctrine.the origin of the ninth circuit approach lies primarily in two california cases,king gerold d,and boughton socony mobil oil d.in king,the plaintiff invented a particular house trailer and licensed gerold to manufacture and sell such trailers for a six month period.the contract provided that if the license was not renewed,gerold was required to cease production.king,supra,at.the agreement expired,but gerold nonetheless continued producing trailers of a substantially similar design.king concluded the contract was not invalidated by section.gerold was not prohibited from carrying on his lawful business of manufacturing trailers,but was barred only from manufacturing and selling trailers of the particular design and style invented by king,who had granted the license in the first place.king,supra,at.
subsequently,boughton socony mobil oil,supra,d,addressed whether a restriction on the use of land violated section.the agreement there prohibited the plaintiff from using a parcel of land as a gasoline service station.boughton concluded the agreement was not void under section.boughton,supra,at.first,the single restriction was imposed,not personally on the plaintiffs restraining them from engaging or carrying on any profession,trade or business but,on the use of the land ibid.boughton went on to reason,while the cases are uniform in refusing to enforce a contract wherein one is restrained from pursuing an entire business,trade or profession,as falling within the ambit of section citations,where one is barred from pursuing only a small or limited part of a business,trade or profession,the contract has been upheld as valid.boughton,supra,at.the plaintiffs in boughton were not prohibited from carrying on the business of selling petroleum products or operating a service station,except on the single piece of property,and then only for a period of years.ibid.
in campbell trustees of leland stanford.cir,the plaintiff was a psychologist who had been employed by stanford to revise and develop a vocational interest test.he challenged a noncompetition clause that prohibited him from preparing or publishing any similar work that might injure sales of the test.id.at.relying on boughton,the ninth circuit reasoned,even though the california legislature rejected the rule that reasonable restraints of trade are generally enforceable,it did not make all restrictions unenforceable.section only makes illegal those restraints which preclude one from engaging in a lawful profession,trade,or business.id.at.it was a question of fact whether the clause completely precluded the plaintiff from preparing vocational interest exams.id.at.he was therefore entitled to a trial on that issue.id.at.
ten years later,in general commercial,supra,general commercial packaging gcp subcontracted with tps to work for gcp major customer,the walt disney companies.tps agreed that for one year after termination of the contract,it would not to work directly for,or solicit,disney or any other company which gcp had introduced and contracted to tps.the ninth circuit concluded the contract was valid unless it completely restrain s tps from plying its trade or business.citations.id.at.the court recognized that a contract does not have to impair a party access to every potential customer to contravene section.because most businesses can not succeed with only a handful of customers,a contract can effectively destroy a signatory ability to conduct a trade or business by placing a substantial segment of the market off limits.ibid.the agreement at issue in general commercial did not violate section because it allowed tps to work for any firm with which it had a preexisting relationship,and limited tps access to only a narrow segment of the market.ibid.
this line of reasoning was continued in international business machines bajorek cir bajorek and latona aetna healthcare d.in bajorek,the agreement at issue required that an employee forfeit his stock option profits if he worked for a competitor within six months after leaving ibm.bajorek,supra,at.bajorek concluded the provision excluded the employee from one small corner of the market because the restriction was limited only to competitors,for a six month period.therefore,it did not violate section.bajorek,supra,at.bajorek mentioned muggill reuben donnelley,supra,cal d,in which our supreme court held section invalidated a similar provision.bajorek nonetheless concluded the issue was controlled by its own decisions in,inter alia,general commercial and campbell.latona applied the narrow restraint standard,but concluded that the noncompetition agreement at issue was not narrowly drawn.latona aetna healthcare,supra,at.
we believe the ninth circuit narrow restraint gloss on section is a misapplication of california law when applied to an employee noncompetition agreement.in our view,section prohibits noncompetition agreements between employers and employees even where the restriction is narrowly drawn and leaves a substantial portion of the market available for the employee.
when interpreting a statute,we follow the legislature intent,as exhibited by the plain meaning of the actual words of the law stephens county of tulare cal th,d.we first examine the words themselves because the statutory language is generally the most reliable indicator of legislative intent.citation.the words of the statute should be given their ordinary and usual meaning and should be construed in their statutory context.citation.fitch select products cal th,d.here,the statutory language is unambiguous,stating except as provided in this chapter,every contract by which anyone is restrained from engaging in a lawful profession,trade,or business of any kind is to that extent void.if the legislature had intended section to apply only to restraints which were unreasonable or overbroad,it could certainly have included language to that effect.
nor do the analyses in king gerold,supra,d,and boughton socony mobil oil,supra,d,the cases upon which the narrow restraint doctrine was originally based,provide persuasive support for it.while not expressly based upon the trade secret exception,king gerold obviously falls within its reach the appellant transgression in that case was not simply manufacturing house trailers,but manufacturing trailers using a design substantially similar to the respondent inventor.king gerold,supra,at.
in boughton,the restriction was not upon the plaintiff practice of a profession or trade,but on the use of the land,a distinction which formed the crux of the court holding.boughton socony mobil oil,supra,d at.as support for its alternative holding that a covenant not to compete is not invalid if the prohibition is only upon a small or limited part of a business,trade or profession id.at,boughton relied upon king gerold.but,as noted,king does not stand for such a broad proposition.to the contrary,as applied to an employee noncompetition agreement boughton analysis contradicts chamberlain augustine,supra,cal.in chamberlain,a foundry employee sold stock and,as part of the sale agreement,covenanted not to become directly or indirectly interested in any similar foundry business,except as a molder or laborer.id.at.the appellants contended the contract was not void under former civil code section the predecessor to section because it permitted the defendant to work as a foundry laborer or molder.chamberlain reasoned,the obvious answer to this is the very language of section id.at.the statute makes no exception in favor of contracts only in partial restraint of trade.id.at.
further,the presence of express exceptions ordinarily implies that additional exceptions are not contemplated.w here exceptions to a general rule are specified by statute,other exceptions are not to be implied or presumed unless a contrary legislative intent is evident.citation.people standish cal th,d,rojas superior court cal th,d.the legislature has created three express statutory exceptions to section,suggesting it did not intend to create a fourth implied exception for reasonable,partial,or narrow restraints.kolani gluska,supra,th at,d the statutory exceptions contained in sections and reinforce the conclusion that covenants not to compete in contracts other than for sale of goodwill or dissolution of partnership are void thompson impaxx,supra,th at,d same.the sole nonstatutory exception,for trade secrets,was originally rooted in equity.empire steam laundry lozier,supra,cal.at,morris harris,supra,d at,equity recognizes a fiduciary duty of an employee after leaving an employer service not to take an unfair advantage of trade secrets and customers lists.no such considerations apply to allow an is generally in a far superior bargaining position than a prospective or terminated impose restrictions on the employee future livelihood.to the contrary,public policy and natural justice require that equity should also be solicitous for the right inherent in all people,not fettered by negative covenants upon their part to the contrary,to follow any of the common occupations of life.continental moseley,supra,cal d at.the interests of the employee in his own mobility and betterment are deemed paramount to the competitive business interests of the employers,where neither the employee nor his new employer has committed any illegal act accompanying the employment change.citation.reeves hanlon,supra,cal th at,d.
in fact,policy concerns strongly militate against adoption of the ninth circuit approach.under the narrow restraint doctrine,employers have an incentive to draft noncompetition agreements that push the envelope of the narrowness requirement.noncompetition agreements burden a terminated employee with the task of guessing,at his or her peril,whether a court might find particular restrictions sufficiently narrow or overly broad.the question of whether a limited restriction falls within the narrow restraint rule will often be highly fact specific,depending upon the economics of particular industries and markets.it is not difficult to imagine situations in which making only a few clients off limits would greatly limit competition,whereas under different circumstances a much broader restriction could leave a substantial portion of the market open.employees are likely to assume contractual terms proposed by their employer are legal and,in any event,will be reluctant to commit the energy and resources to challenging a noncompetition agreement in court.see latona aetna healthcare,supra,d at playhut,supra,th at,d we foresee situations where the uninformed employee will forego legitimate employment rather than assume the risk of expensive,litigation by the former employer.baker pacific suttles d.perhaps most troubling,prospective future employers may be reluctant to hire an employee who has signed a questionable noncompetition agreement,in order to avoid the expense and energy of defending a lawsuit in which they are likely to be joined.citations.latona aetna healthcare,supra,at.
finally,if further support for rejection of the narrow restraint doctrine was necessary,it is found in the historical context surrounding enactment of former civil code section,the precursor to current section.wright ryder cal,explained the common law rule as it stood a few years before enactment of former civil code section.wright explained that under the early english common law,as a matter of public policy,all contracts were void which in any degree tended to the restraint of trade,even in a particular,circumscribed locality,either for a definite or unlimited period.wright ryder,supra,at.later,after competition had become more robust,the stringent rule was relaxed i nstead of denouncing as void all contracts in restraint of trade,the rule,as relaxed,tolerated such as were restricted in their operations within reasonable limits.ibid.thus,prior to enactment of former civil code section,an agreement in partial restraint of trade,restricting it within certain reasonable limits or times,or confining it to particular persons,would,if founded upon a good and valuable consideration,be valid.wright ryder,supra,at.
four years later,the legislature enacted former civil code sections,and,the precursors to sections,and.the code commissioner comment to former civil code section observed,contracts in restraint of trade have been allowed by modern decisions to a very dangerous extent.italics added.as an example,the code commissioner cited dunlop gregory,a new york case which had held a contract not to exercise a trade or carry on a business in a particular place might be upheld if it was reasonable and useful,and the restraint was no larger than necessary for the protection of the covenantee.id.at.the code commissioner comments suggest the legislature,in enacting former civil code section,intended to apply a more stringent standard than that described by the wright ryder court the comments of the code commission are entitled to significant weight.dieckmann superior court d.
in sum,we conclude the narrow restraint doctrine is a misapplication of california law.noncompetition agreements are invalid under section even if narrowly drawn,unless they fall within the statutory or trade secret exceptions.thus,the noncompetition agreement at issue here was invalid and violated california public policy,unless,on remand,andersen proves the trade secret exception applies.
iv requiring execution of the tonc as consideration for release from the noncompetition agreement violated public policy and constituted an independently wrongful act for purposes of the third element of edwards intentional interference claim.
having concluded the noncompetition agreement was invalid,we further hold andersen action of demanding execution of the tonc as consideration for release of the noncompetition agreement was an independently wrongful act for purposes of the third element of edwards intentional interference with prospective economic advantage claim we have previously held that an employer can not lawfully make the signing of an employment agreement,which contains an unenforceable covenant not to compete,a condition of continued employment a n employer termination of an employee who refuses to sign such an agreement constitutes a wrongful termination in violation of public policy.playhut,supra,th at,d.in,the employer fired an employee because he refused to sign a confidentiality agreement that contained an illegal covenant not to compete.id.at,d.we reasoned,california law would protect plaintiff if defendants sought to overreach by trying to enforce the covenant not to compete,and california law will also protect him from a termination of his employment brought on by his refusal to sign an agreement containing the illegal covenant.id.at,d.
similarly,in baker pacific suttles,supra,d,asbestos removal workers were required,as a condition of employment,to sign a document releasing the building owner from liability.workers who refused to sign were denied employment.id.at.baker held the release violated public policy in that it purported to exempt the employer from responsibility for fraud and intentional acts in contravention of civil code section id.at.because the release violated civil code section and public policy,requiring prospective workers to sign it as a condition of employment was contrary to law.ibid.
here,of course,edwards was not terminated for refusing to sign a noncompetition agreement.instead,he allegedly was required by andersen,as a condition of his new employment with the purchaser of andersen los angeles tax practice,to execute a broad release of claims against andersen as consideration for andersen release of the invalid noncompetition agreement.in essence,andersen enforced the noncompetition agreement by demanding consideration for it.while the chain of events is more complicated and attenuated than in and baker pacific,this circumstance makes no difference to our analysis.those authorities stand for the proposition that conditioning employment on an employee execution of a contract that violates public policy is against public policy.using the invalid noncompetition agreement to coerce edwards into forfeiting rights was no less wrongful than terminating an employee who refuses to sign such an agreement.to hold otherwise would be to elevate form over substance and ignore the practical realities of the situation.
andersen argues that one clause of the noncompetition agreement was not and is not challenged,edwards agreement not to solicit away from the firm any of its professional personnel for eighteen months after release or resignation,the provision.see generally loral moyes,supra,d at.provision was not invalid under section.andersen theory is that it was entitled to consideration for releasing edwards from the provision,even if the noncompetition provisions were invalid therefore its insistence on the tonc was proper.andersen points out that the trial court concluded that while andersen was out there trying to sell a portion of its businesses to folks,the provision still had some value.not much,i do know,but some.andersen rhetorically asks,must andersen have relinquished concededly valid rights in exchange for nothing from edwards 
we are not entirely persuaded that the trial court assumption about the value of the provision,made in an evidentiary vacuum,was correct.a contract is valid even if supported by insignificant consideration,and the giving up of a legal right may constitute sufficient consideration.witkin,summary of cal.law ed.contracts.however,i t is well settled that something which is completely worthless can not constitute a valid consideration.citations.grant aerodraulics d,walters calderon d.witkin,supra.andersen was going out of business and selling off its practice groups.as it was ceasing operations,it is unclear whether the provision retained any value.see generally cubic marty d.the adequacy of consideration is to be determined in light of the conditions existing at the time a contract is made.
but assuming for purposes of argument that the provision retained some minimal value at the relevant time period,andersen argument is nonetheless unpersuasive.andersen argument implicitly rests on the assumption that the invalid noncompetition provisions can be severed from the provision.we and other courts have rejected this approach.as we have explained,an employer can not lawfully make an employee signing of an employment agreement containing an unenforceable covenant not to compete a condition of continued employment,even if such agreement contains choice of law or severability provisions which would enable the employer to enforce the other provisions of the employment agreement.playhut,supra,th at,d see also latona aetna healthcare,supra,d at.
andersen argues this principle should not apply under the facts presented here,where the employee had already signed the agreement.however,such an approach ignores the realities of the situation.as we have observed,the provision had minimal value,given andersen rapid demise.certainly hsbc,the purchaser of andersen los angeles tax practice,could have had no real interest in andersen employees being released from the provision.that clause applied only to prevent a former andersen employee from soliciting current andersen employees,not hsbc employees.yet,hsbc could,and allegedly did,have an interest in its prospective employees being released from the noncompetition provisions.by using the tonc as the instrument to release both the noncompetition and provisions,andersen could ensure it would be able to insist on the tonc as a condition of the sale.severing the noncompetition and provisions under these circumstances would not effectuate the public policy contained in section.
in any event,andersen never offered to release edwards from the invalid provisions of the noncompetition agreement without consideration.edwards was required to sign the tonc in order to free him from the noncompetition provisions,as well as the provision.andersen can not now be relieved of liability on the ground that if it had sought consideration for the provision only,edwards would have no grounds to object.latona aetna healthcare,supra,d at thompson impaxx,supra,th at,d.
validity of the tonc release and nondisparagement provisions.
edwards next contends that two provisions of the tonc violated california law,and requiring him to execute the tonc as a condition of his hire with hsbc was an independently wrongful act for purposes of the third element of his intentional interference with prospective economic advantage claim.
i the tonc wrongfully required release of edwards statutory right to indemnity,in violation of public policy.
as noted,the tonc contained a broad release in favor of andersen.subdivision d of the tonc provided that edwards released and discharged andersen from any and all actions,causes of action,claims,demands,debts,damages,costs,losses,penalties,attorneys fees,obligations,judgments,expenses,compensation or liabilities of any nature whatsoever,in law or equity,whether known or unknown,contingent or otherwise,that employee now has,may have ever had in the past or may have in the future against any of the released parties by reason of any act,omission,transaction,occurrence,conduct,circumstance,condition,harm,matter,cause or thing that has occurred from the beginning of time up to and including the date hereof,including,without limitation,claims that in any way arise from or out of,are based upon or relate to employee employment by,association with or compensation from andersen or any of its affiliated firms,except for claims i arising out of andersen obligations set forth in this agreement or ii for any accrued and unpaid salary or other employee benefit or compensation owing to employee as of the date hereof.
the trial court concluded,on the issue of the waiver of indemnity,the release is a typical broad release.it does specifically anywhere request that indemnity rights be waived.and the labor code pretty much tells us that right ca be waived.as a matter of law,any provision in the release that attempts to waive it would be void,but i do even think we have to reach it because i do interpret the release to be requiring edwards to give up his rights as a matter of law.andersen argues that the trial court was correct,and the tonc did not purport to waive edwards indemnity rights.
labor code section,subdivision a,provides for an employee right to indemnity.that subdivision reads an employer shall indemnify his or her employee for all necessary expenditures or losses incurred by the employee in direct consequence of the discharge of his or her duties,or of his or her obedience to the directions of the employer,even though unlawful,unless the employee,at the time of obeying the directions,believed them to be unlawful.labor code section requires an employer to indemnify an employee for all expenses and losses incurred in direct consequence of the discharge of his duties.jacobus krambo th,d see also devereaux latham watkins th,d plancarte guardsmark th,d grissom vons companies,th,d.
labor code section makes all contracts waiving the benefits of labor code section null and void.liberio vidal d,fn.chin et,employment litigation,supra,at.it provides any contract or agreement,express or implied,made by any employee to waive the benefits of this article or any part thereof,is null and void,and this article shall not deprive any employee or his personal representative of any right or remedy to which he is entitled under the laws of this state.
we respectfully disagree with the trial court conclusion that the tonc release did not waive andersen labor code section indemnity rights.the plain language of the tonc clearly purports to do so.it covers any and all actions,causes of action,claims,demands,debts,damages,costs,losses,penalties,attorneys fees,obligations,judgments,expenses,compensation or liabilities of any nature whatsoever,whether known or unknown,past,present,and future.it expressly applies to all claims that in any way arise from or out of,are based upon or relate to employee employment.the provision did not expressly reference indemnity rights,but it did not have to they were necessarily encompassed within the clear terms of the broad release.a broadly worded release covers all claims within the scope of the language,even if the particular claim is not expressly listed.see bardin lockheed aeronautical systems th,d.indeed,labor code section requires indemnification for all necessary expenditures or losses incurred by the employee in direct consequence of the discharge of his or her duties italics added.losses,costs,and expenses of any nature whatsoever are expressly listed in the release.it is difficult to imagine a theory under which indemnity rights would not be covered,given this broad language.
nor does the provision except indemnity rights,as suggested by andersen.the only items excepted were claims arising out of andersen obligations under the tonc,and for any accrued and unpaid salary or other employee benefit or compensation owing to employee as of the date hereof.an indemnity right simply can not be characterized as accrued and unpaid salary.indemnification does not fit neatly into the category of an employment benefit.see generally city and county of san francisco callanan d.a conventional definition of the colloquial phrase fringe benefit generally means an employment benefit as a pension,a paid holiday,or health insurance granted by an employer that involves a money cost without affecting basic wage rates.citation.assuming arguendo that indemnity was encompassed within compensation,the exception was limited to compensation owing as of the date the tonc was executed,improperly excluding any future indemnity claims.see county of riverside loma linda university d.a cause of action for indemnity does not accrue or come into existence until the indemnitee has suffered actual loss for which he is entitled to indemnity,either through payment of a court judgment or through settlement.lincoln narom development d.further,as noted,the release expressly exempted two types of claims but did not contain a similar exception for indemnification,suggesting no additional exceptions were intended.
it is axiomatic that labor code sections and articulate the fundamental public policy of california.the obvious purpose of labor code section is to protect employees from suffering expenses in direct consequence of doing their jobs.grissom vons companies,supra,th at,d.labor code section shows a legislative intent that losses ultimately fall on the business enterprise,not on the individual employee.janken gm hughes electronics th,fn,d.numerous provisions of the labor code were established to protect workers and hence have a public purpose.henry amrol,d supp,grier costa transit dist.d.full payment of wages is an important state policy enacted for the protection of employees generally.clearly,labor code section inures to the benefit of the public generally,not merely to a particular employer or employee.mannetter county of marin d.there is a strong public policy to indemnify employees for loss resulting from industrial injury drug stores,superior court cal th,d,labor code section,providing that an employee who agrees to work for less than the minimum wage may recover in a civil action,confirms a clear public policy for the benefit of workers fittante palm springs motors,th,d labor code section,prohibiting an employer from fraudulently inducing an employee to move to accept employment,was enacted to vindicate a public policy.likewise,labor code section indemnity requirement inures to the public benefit.
that labor code section implements public policy is further demonstrated by labor code section,which voids any agreement to waive the protections of labor code section.any one may waive the advantage of a law intended solely for his benefit.but a law established for a public reason can not be contravened by a private agreement.by declaring a contract to waive the rights given by labor code section void,the legislature adopted a rule of public policy.see generally south bay radiology medical associates asher,supra,d at.in short,labor code sections and embody california strong public policy favoring indemnification of employees for claims and liabilities arising from the employees acts within the course and scope of their employment.see chin et,employment litigation,supra,at.because employee indemnity rights under labor code section implement public policy and inure to the public benefit,forcing an employee to waive his or her statutory rights violates public policy.playhut,supra,th at,d baker pacific suttles,supra,d at.
according to edwards theory,he was prohibited by andersen from obtaining employment with hsbc because he refused to sign the tonc.andersen could not make edwards future employment contingent on his waiving his statutorily mandated indemnity rights.see playhut,supra,th at,d an employer can not lawfully make the signing of a contract that violates public policy a condition of continued employment baker pacific suttles,supra,d at.requiring prospective employees to sign an illegal agreement as a condition of employment is contrary to law.accordingly,edward insistence upon the indemnity waiver as a condition of edwards future employment violated public policy and was an independently wrongful act for purposes of the third prong of andersen intentional interference with prospective economic advantage claim 
andersen contends the release clause was not wrongful because any waiver of edwards right to indemnification would have been ineffective as a matter of law.while andersen is correct that a release of edwards indemnity rights would have been void,courts have rejected the view that requiring an employee to sign an ineffective agreement is not wrongful simply because the provision would not be enforced.baker pacific suttles,supra,d at.finding argument circular and unintelligible.as latona aetna healthcare,supra,d cogently explained in the context of noncompetition agreements,defendant argument,that the agreement can not violate public policy because it is simply a nullity,ignores the realities of the marketplace.as between the employer and an individual employee,the company is in an infinitely better position to acquaint itself with the applicable laws,and to know whether the clause violates section.employees,having no reason to familiarize themselves with the specifics of california employment law,will tend to assume that the contractual terms proposed by their employer especially one of aetna magnitude are legal,if draconian.furthermore,even if they strongly suspect that a clause is unenforceable,such employees will be reluctant to challenge the legality of the contractual terms and risk the deployment of aetna considerable legal resources against them.thus,the in terrorem effect of the agreement will tend to secure employee compliance with its illegal terms in the vast majority of cases.id.at see also baker pacific suttles,supra,at.we can not expect workers generally to be cognizant of judicial decisions concerning the interpretation of exculpatory provisions within releases.we reject the concept that a worker,compelled by economic necessity to secure employment,can be thus coerced into signing sweeping agreements exculpating various responsible entities in the uninformed hope the agreement will not be enforced by the courts.
ii the tonc nondisparagement provision did not violate labor code section.
edwards next contends that the tonc nondisparagement provision was likewise void as against public policy.paragraph c of the tonc provided employee shall not disparage andersen or any of its affiliated firms or any of their respective present or former partners,managers or employees aa party provided,however,that this section c shall not prevent employee from i responding to comments made by any aa party about employee if employee reasonably believes such comments were disparaging to employee or ii making statements about an aa party in connection with the defense of a claim made against employee by a third party.underscoring omitted.
edwards contends the nondisparagement clause violated labor code section.that section,a whistleblower protection provision,provides,in pertinent part,an employer may not make,adopt,or enforce any rule,regulation,or policy preventing an employee from disclosing information to a government or law enforcement agency,where the employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses a violation of state or federal statute,or a violation or noncompliance with a state or federal rule or regulation,subd.a.subdivision b of the statute prohibits retaliation against an employee for disclosing information to a government or law enforcement agency,where the employee has reasonable cause to believe the information discloses a violation of state or federal law.
the trial court concluded that the tonc nondisparagement clause was not unlawful,in that it did not require any illegal conduct on edwards part,did not preclude him from responding to governmental inquiries,and did not preclude him from reporting crimes to the government.
edwards contends the tonc nondisparagement provision violated labor code section because it would have chilled employee disclosures of wrongdoing by andersen and would have precluded employees from reporting illegal conduct to the government.therefore,he urges,andersen alleged conduct of requiring that he sign the tonc as a condition to his hire by hsbc amounted to an independently wrongful act for purposes of his intentional interference with prospective economic advantage claim.andersen counters that such clauses are commonplace and innocuous,and can not be construed to prevent an employee cooperation with the government.
as andersen suggests,nondisparagement clauses appear to have become fairly common,both to protect employers and employees when an employment relationship ends.see severn trent services,cir,cooper tire rubber farese cir.certainly,we discern nothing inherently unlawful about a party generally agreeing not to disparage another.
on the other hand,to the extent a nondisparagement clause can be understood to prohibit truthful comments,it can not hinder an employee cooperation with government officials.for example,such an agreement can not trump a subpoena.severn trent,supra,at suits attempting enforcement of nondisparagement clauses as against government subpoenas would be beyond frivolous they would be obstructions of justice.further,attempted enforcement of such an agreement to prevent employees from voluntarily approaching a government or law enforcement agency to report a violation of law as delineated in labor code section would be against public policy.see cooper tire rubber farese,supra,at arguably,it would be against public policy for an employer to sue a former employee for violating a nondisparagement clause by disclosing the employer illegal activities.labor code section reflects the broad public policy interest in encouraging workplace to report unlawful acts without fearing retaliation.green ralee engineering c
