plaintiff dvd copy control association,dvd cca sued defendant andrew bunner bunner and others under california uniform trade secrets act utsa,et seeking an injunction to prevent defendants from using or publishing decss,a computer program allegedly containing dvd cca trade secrets.
the trial court granted dvd cca request for a preliminary injunction and entered an order prohibiting defendants from posting,disclosing,or distributing decss or related proprietary material.bunner appealed.his primary argument on appeal was that the injunction infringed his free speech rights under the state and federal constitutions.this court concluded that the injunction was an unconstitutional prior restraint and reversed.

factual and procedural background 
introduction 
digital versatile disks dvd are disks used to store large amounts of data in digital form.a single dvd may contain a motion picture.unlike motion pictures on videocassettes,motion pictures contained on dvd may be copied without perceptible loss of video or audio quality.this aspect of the dvd format makes it particularly susceptible to piracy.for this reason,motion pictures stored on dvds have been protected from unauthorized use by a content scrambling system referred to as css.simply put,css scrambles the data on the disk and then unscrambles it when the disk is played on a compliant dvd player or computer.css does not allow the content on the dvd to be copied.dvd,supra,cal th at,d.
for obvious reasons,the motion picture industry desired to keep the css technology a secret.but to make dvd players and computer dvd drives that can unscramble and play a dvd,the manufacturers had to have the css master keys and an understanding of how the technology works.in an attempt to keep css from becoming generally known,the industries agreed upon a restrictive licensing scheme and formed dvd cca to be the sole licensing entity for css.under the css licensing scheme,each licensee receives a different master key to incorporate into its equipment and sufficient technical know how to permit the manufacture of a device.all licensees must agree to maintain the confidentiality of css.
in spite of these efforts to maintain the secrecy of css,decss appeared on the internet sometime in october and rapidly spread to other web sites,including those of the defendants.according to dvd cca,decss incorporates trade secret information that was obtained by reverse engineering css in breach of a license agreement.dvd cca alleges that decss allows users to illegally pirate the copyrighted motion pictures contained on dvds,activity which is fatal to the dvd video format and the hundreds of computer and consumer electronics companies whose businesses rely on the viability of this digital format.
dvd cca filed the instant complaint for injunctive relief on december,alleging that bunner and the other defendants had misappropriated trade secrets by posting decss or links to decss on their web sites,knowing that decss had been created by improper means.the requested injunctive relief sought to prevent defendants from using decss,from disclosing decss or other proprietary css technology on their web sites or elsewhere,and from linking their web sites to other web sites that disclosed decss or other css technology.
after first denying dvd cca request for a temporary restraining order,the trial court issued a preliminary injunction on january,enjoining defendants from p osting or otherwise disclosing or distributing,on their websites or elsewhere,the decss program,the master keys or algorithms of css,or any other information derived from this proprietary information.the injunction does not prohibit linking to other web sites and it does not expressly prohibit defendants from using decss.
b.the factual record 
the evidence before the trial court was submitted in the form of written declarations.john hoy,president of dvd cca explained that decss first appeared on the internet on october.that first posting was in form referred to as object code the decss source code was posted about three weeks later,on or around october.hoy declared that both postings contain css technology and the master key that had been assigned to dvd cca licensee,xing technology corporation xing,a manufacturer of computer dvd drives.the intended inference is that decss was created,at least in part,by reverse engineering the xing software.since xing licensed its software pursuant to an agreement that prohibits reverse engineering,hoy concludes that the css technology contained in decss was obtained in violation of the specific provision in the xing license click wrap agreement which prohibits reverse engineering.hoy stated on information and belief that jon johansen,a resident of norway,was the author of the program.
well before decss was released on the internet,a number of people had become interested in unraveling the css security system.users of the linux computer operating system had organized a forum dedicated to finding a way to override css.apparently dvd cca had not licensed css to anyone making dvd drives for the linux system,so that computers using linux were incapable of playing dvd.css was widely analyzed and discussed in the academic cryptography community.another exchange of information took place on slashdot,a news web site popular with computer programmers.as early as july comments on slashdot revealed a worldwide interest in cracking css.the gist of these communications is contained in the following excerpts of a discussion that took place on july,
yes,it is true,we have now all needed parts for software decoding of dvds,but any software doing so will be illegal.the information about css was obtained by reverse engineering some dvd software decoder.
this code was released before anyone checked into the legal end of things best idea now is to download the code.get it spread around as widely as possible.it may not be able to be used legally when all is said and done,but at least it will be out there for others to work with.
well,it might not be the most ethical thing on earth,but if the appropriate algorithms were to be found just lying on the web,once the coders have seen them,they do have a forget button for their brains 
bunner first became aware of decss on or about october,as a result of reading and participating in discussions on slashdot.bunner explained that he is a user of linux and supports its acceptance as a viable alternative to established computer operating systems such as microsoft windows.bunner thought decss would be useful to other linux users.he claimed that at the time he posted the information on his web site he had no information to suggest that the program contained any trade secrets or that it involved the misappropriation of trade secrets.there is no evidence as to the date bunner first posted the program on his web site.
counsel representing the motion picture industry had become aware of the decss posting on october.beginning november,counsel sent letters to web site operators and internet service providers hosting web pages that contained decss or links to decss and demanded the information be taken down.such letters were sent between november and november.none of the letters listed in counsel declaration were addressed to bunner or to his web site address.about of the sites were taken down.decss was also removed from johansen web site on or around november,but a link to decss reappeared on the same site on or around december.
meanwhile,the news that the css encryption system had been penetrated made headlines in internet news magazines.wired news ran several articles in the first days of november announcing the development of decss.an article on november,said it should be surprising that an awful lot of people are upset at this week wired news reports about a utility to remove dvd security.but it out there and people are using it.an article on emedia around the same time explained that decss was available for free download from several sites on the world wide web.
dvd cca filed suit on december,naming as defendants the operators of every infringing web site it could identify.a hearing for a temporary restraining order was to be held the following day.in support of that application,dvd cca informed the court that since october,decss had been displayed on or linked to at least web pages in states and countries throughout the world and that approximately web pages continued to publish infringing information.
the lawsuit outraged many people in the computer programming community.a campaign of civil disobedience arose by which its proponents tried to spread the decss code as widely as possible before trial.some of the defendants simply refused to take their postings down.some people appeared at the courthouse on december,to pass out diskettes and written fliers that supposedly contained the decss code.they made and distributed with parts of the code printed on the back.there were even contests encouraging people to submit ideas about how to disseminate the information as widely as possible.
c.the trial court findings 
the trial court issued the preliminary injunction based upon the following findings first,css is dvd cca trade secret and for nearly three years prior to the posting of decss on defendants web sites,dvd cca had exerted reasonable efforts to maintain the secrecy of css.the court stated that trade secret status should not be deemed destroyed merely because the information was posted on the internet,because,t o hold otherwise would do nothing less than encourage misappropriaters sic of trade secrets to post the fruits of their wrongdoing on the internet as quickly as possible and as widely as possible thereby destroying a trade secret forever.
second,the trial court found that the evidence was fairly clear that the trade secret had been obtained through a reverse engineering procedure that violated the terms of a license agreement and,based upon some defendants boasting about their disrespect for the law,it could be inferred that all defendants knew that the trade secret had been obtained through improper means.
third,the balancing of equities favored dvd cca.the court determined that while the harm to defendants in being compelled to remove trade secret information from their web sites was truly minimal,the current and prospective harm to dvd cca was irreparable in that dvd cca would lose the right to protect css as a trade secret and to control unauthorized copying of dvd content.the court pointed out once this information gets into the hands of an innocent party,the plaintiff loses their sic ability to enjoin the use of their sic trade secret.if the court does not immediately enjoin the posting of this proprietary information,the plaintiff right to protect this information as secret will surely be lost,given the current power of the internet to disseminate information and the defendants stated determination to do so.the trial court did not expressly consider the harm to defendants first amendment rights.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
a preliminary injunction is appropriate to maintain the status quo pending trial of the merits.paradise hills associates procel d,d.the utsa expressly provides for an injunction preventing the disclosure of a trade secret.injunctions in the area of trade secrets are governed by the principles applicable to injunctions in general.hilb,rogal hamilton ins.services robb th,fn.d.in deciding whether to issue a preliminary injunction,a trial court weighs two interrelated factors the likelihood the moving party ultimately will prevail on the merits,and the relative interim harm to the parties from the issuance or nonissuance of the injunction.hunt superior court cal th,d.whyte schlage lock th,d.
citing california of dispensing opticians pearle vision center,d.pearle vision,dvd cca argues that where,as here,injunctive relief is authorized by statute,the moving party need not show irreparable injury.pearle vision affirmed an injunction sought by the state board of optometry,among others,stating where an injunction is authorized by statute,a violation thereof is good and sufficient cause for its issuance.id.at.however,the same district court of appeal has since declared this assertion is,as a blanket statement of law,incorrect.leach city of san marcos d.when the plaintiff is not a governmental entity and the statute does not expressly provide otherwise,a finding of interim harm is necessary.id.at.thus,even if pearle vision were a correct statement of the law,it would not apply here.the utsa does not authorize an injunction in the absence of a showing of harm and dvd cca is not a public entity.dvd cca must have demonstrated both that it had a likelihood of success on the merits and that the balance of harms weighed in favor of granting the injunction.
the conclusions of the trial court on these points are typically subject to a deferential standard of review.whyte schlage lock,supra,th at,d.however,where a f ederal right has been denied as the result of a factual finding or where a conclusion of law as to a federal right and a finding of fact are so intermingled as to make it necessary,in order to pass upon the federal question,to analyze the facts,appellate review is not so deferential.fiske kansas.the reviewing court must independently review the record to determine whether it supports the requisite factual findings with convincing clarity.bose consumers union of,d.
this constitutional standard of review applies here.the supreme court conclusion that the preliminary injunction did not offend bunner constitutional rights was premised upon the assumption that the injunction was proper under the utsa.dvd,supra,cal th at,d.it follows that we must now exercise our independent judgment to determine whether the record is adequate to establish,with convincing clarity,that the assumption is correct.
b.the existence of a trade secret.
in order to obtain an injunction prohibiting disclosure of an alleged trade secret,the plaintiff first hurdle is to show that the information it seeks to protect is indeed a trade secret.the utsa defines a trade secret as information that derives independent economic value,actual or potential,from not being generally known and is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy,subd.d.in short,the test for a trade secret is whether the matter sought to be protected is information that is valuable because it is unknown to others and that the owner has attempted to keep secret.abba rubber seaquist d.the first element is the crucial one here in order to qualify as a trade secret,the information must be secret,and must not be of public knowledge or of a general knowledge in the trade or business.kewanee oil bicron,supra,at.
the secrecy requirement is generally treated as a relative concept and requires a analysis.milgrim on trade secrets.widespread,anonymous publication of the information over the internet may destroy its status as a trade secret.religious technology center netcom com,see also religious tech.center netcom comm.the concern is whether the information has retained its value to the creator in spite of the publication.see rest d unfair competition,com.f.publication on the internet does not necessarily destroy the secret if the publication is sufficiently obscure or transient or otherwise limited so that it does not become generally known to the relevant people,potential competitors or other persons to whom the information would have some economic value.
in the instant matter,the secrecy element becomes important at two points.first,if the allegedly proprietary information contained in decss was already public knowledge when bunner posted the program to his web site,bunner could not be liable for
