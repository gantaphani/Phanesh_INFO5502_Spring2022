this appeal arises from a series of claims and counterclaims between luzenac america,luzenac and two of its former employees,sanford lee hertz and lane lighthart.in response to hertz complaint,luzenac alleged that hertz and lighthart misappropriated the company trade secrets related to the production and marketing of vinyl talc.luzenac also brought related claims for breach of contract and conspiracy.hertz,in turn,filed claims against luzenac for tortious interference with contract and with prospective business advantage he also sought to amend his complaint to add a claim for abuse of process,but the district court denied this request.the district court found that the information that hertz and lighthart allegedly misappropriated was not a trade secret.it therefore granted hertz summary judgment on that claim as well as the breach of contract and conspiracy claims.additionally,the district court dismissed hertz claims for tortious interference.
exercising jurisdiction under,we affirm in part and reverse in part.we find that the question of whether luzenac manufacturing process is a trade secret is a question of fact that can not be resolved on the current record.similarly,we find that luzenac has raised genuine issues of material fact with respect to the secrecy of its customer information.accordingly,we reverse and remand for further proceedings on luzenac claims.we agree with the district court that hertz has failed to present adequate claims of tortious interference with contract and prospective business advantage.accordingly,we affirm the district court dismissal of these claims.we also affirm the district court denial of hertz motion to amend his complaint.
background 
luzenac is a leading producer and seller of talc.talc is a soft mineral in the magnesium silicate family and is used as an additive in many products,including rubber,paper,and ceramics.from until about,luzenac sold various formulations of vinyl talc,which is used as an additive in rubbers,paints,and coatings.beginning in,that product was known as mistron or simply.since,has been produced by one of luzenac distributors,van horn,metz,vhm,under license from luzenac,and luzenac has sold the raw talc used in the product to vhm.
in august,luzenac hired hertz to direct technical aspects of developing and marketing the product that later became.luzenac employed lighthart to market and sell to companies within the coatings industry.hertz was fired in january,but he successfully sued luzenac under title vii for discharging him in retaliation for his objections to luzenac religious discrimination.see hertz luzenac,cir.lighthart testified on hertz behalf in the title vii case and left luzenac in june.
a few years after luzenac fired hertz,hertz obtained other work in the industry.imi fabi,llc contracted with hertz consulting company to develop and market a vinyl talc called genera.hertz contracted with lighthart to help market genera and asked lighthart to provide a list of prospective customers.when luzenac learned of hertz contract with imi fabi,it sent hertz a letter through his counsel.upon hearing of luzenac concerns,imi fabi reduced its efforts to market genera.three days later,hertz commenced litigation against luzenac in colorado state court seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.in the hertz state court action,luzenac alleged counterclaims of interference with contract and with prospective business advantage,misappropriation of trade secrets,conversion,civil theft,and breach of contract.hertz in turn amended his complaint to include claims of unlawful retaliation under title vii,defamation,tortious interference with contract,and tortious interference with prospective business advantage.
luzenac then removed the case to federal district court.luzenac also joined lighthart as a counterclaim defendant and added counterclaims for unjust enrichment and conspiracy.the district court denied hertz motion to amend his complaint to add an abuse of process claim.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of hertz and lighthart on most of luzenac claims.relevant to this appeal,it ruled against luzenac on its claims of misappropriation of trade secrets,misappropriation of customer information,conspiracy,and breach of contract.it ruled in favor of luzenac on hertz claims for tortious interference with prospective business advantage and tortious interference with contract 
discussion 
luzenac appeals from the dismissal of its claims for misappropriation of trade secrets,breach of contract,and conspiracy.hertz appeals from the dismissal of his claims for tortious interference with contract and tortious interference with prospective business advantage.hertz additionally appeals from the denial of his motion to amend his complaint to include a claim for abuse of process.
we review the dismissal of these claims on a motion for summary judgment de novo.harvey barnett,shidler,cir.w e also review de novo the district court interpretation of the substantive state law.klein grynberg,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.in our review,we examine the evidence and draw reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the party.harvey barnett,at.although the movant must show the absence of a genuine issue of material fact,he or she need not negate the nonmovant claim.simms ex rel.dep t of mental health substance abuse,cir.once the movant carries this burden,the nonmoving party must bring forward specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial as to those dispositive matters for which it carries the burden of proof.jenkins wood,cir.an issue of material fact is genuine if the nonmovant presents facts that would allow a reasonable jury to find in favor of the nonmovant.id.
is the production process of a trade secret 
luzenac accuses hertz of misappropriating its trade secret in the production process of.luzenac asserts that hertz disclosed to imi fabi luzenac entire formula and process for producing,in violation of the colorado uniform trade secrets act utsa.luzenac br.at.the only question decided by the district court,and the only one we consider on appeal,is whether the production process qualifies as a trade secret.the utsa defines trade secret as any scientific or technical information,design,process,procedure,formula,or improvement which is secret and of value.ann.the essential test in colorado for determining whether something is capable of protection as a trade secret was established in colorado supply stewart,and was utilized by this court in harvey barnett.see harvey barnett,at.factors considered in determining whether a trade secret exists include 
the extent to which the information is known outside the business the extent to which it is known to those inside the business,by the employees the precautions taken by the holder of the trade secret to guard the secrecy of the information the savings effected and the value to the holder in having the information as against competitors the amount of effort or money expended in obtaining and developing the information and the amount of time and expense it would take for others to acquire and duplicate the information.
id.citing.supply,at.
the district court applied the colorado supply test in assessing luzenac trade secret claim.it acknowledged that the last three factors could weigh in luzenac favor.specifically relevant to the fourth factor the savings effected and the value to the holder in having the information as against competitors the district court noted,a reasonable jury might find that,despite the plurality of comparable products competitive to mistron,luzenac position was unique as a result of the information and expertise it developed.vol.ix,at.the district court also determined 
the fifth and sixth colorado supply factors arguably weigh in luzenac favor.luzenac expended considerable effort and time to develop its mistron line a reasonable jury might determine that hertz and imi fabi saved time and expense in developing genera by virtue of the expertise and information hertz obtained and discovered during his time at luzenac.
id.at.the district court granted hertz summary judgment on this claim,however,on the grounds that secrecy is the sine qua non of the claim and there can be no genuine dispute that the process for manufacturing was not a secret.id.at.
we agree with the district court that i ndispensable to an effective allegation of a trade secret is proof that the matter is,more or less,secret.roger milgrim eric benson,milgrim on trade secrets,at.the question of secrecy relates to the first three colorado supply factors.however,in evaluating the secrecy of the production process,the district court made three mistakes.first,it did not consider the manufacturing process in the aggregate.second,it failed to view the evidence in the light most favorable to luzenac,the party opposing summary judgment.third,in considering whether luzenac adequately protected the secrecy of,the district court focused on the evidence of the steps that luzenac did not take rather than the reasonableness of the measures it did take 
the production process as a whole 
when determining whether a manufacturing process is secret,we must be careful to apply the correct framework to our analysis.luzenac claims that its trade secret comprises nine distinct elements.the district court provides a detailed discussion of how information is publicly available about individual elements of the production process of.luzenac concedes that some of these elements may have been in the public domain,but it argues that the district court should have considered the production process as a whole,not each component separately.we agree with luzenac.
a trade secret can exist in a combination of characteristics and components each of which,by itself,is in the public domain,but the unified process,design and operation of which,in unique combination,affords a competitive advantage and is a protectable secret.harvey barnett,at alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.under colorado law,information can be a trade secret notwithstanding the fact that some of its components are.id.citing rivendell forest,cir.rivendell requirement of analysis in the aggregate is more than a formality.it is a substantive component of analysis integral to a court ultimate conclusion regarding the existence of material facts for trial.id.at.
in concluding that the production process of was in the public domain,the district court summarized its findings with respect to each of the elements of the process.after reviewing the evidence with respect to each of the nine elements,it determined that one of the elements was not part of the process at all,four were obtained from the public domain,two were disclosed publicly,and two were both obtained from and disclosed to individuals outside of luzenac.the district court concluded this summary with the statement nor does the process as a whole constitute a trade secret.each and all of the elements of the process for manufacturing are known outside luzenac.vol.ix,at.responding to luzenac contention that the process as a whole could not be found in one discrete,public repository,the district court stated that this assertion was both true and irrelevant.vol.x,at.
while purporting to acknowledge the requirement to consider the elements in combination,the district court did not engage in any substantive analysis of the production process as a whole.the presence of all of the elements of an idea in technical literature does not suffice,per se,to destroy trade secret status,since the secret might be in a combination of otherwise principles.milgrim benson,supra,at.in failing to follow the holding in,a trade secret can exist in a combination of characteristics,each of which,considered separately,is in the public domain,but,taken together,may yield a competitive advantage that results in a protectable trade secret the district court applied an inappropriate standard.see harvey barnett,at see also rivendell,at we hold that the doctrine has been established that a trade secret can include a system where the elements are in the public domain,but there has been accomplished an effective,successful and valuable integration of the public domain elements and the trade secret gave the claimant a competitive advantage which is protected from misappropriation.
the evidence relating to the elements of luzenac trade secret 
we next review the district court finding that each of the elements of the manufacturing process of has been publicly disclosed.while the finder of fact is required to consider the claimed trade secret as a whole,it may,in addition,consider whether the individual components are publicly known.a finding that some of the elements are secret may support a conclusion that the entire process is protected.based on our review of the record,we conclude that genuine issues of material fact exist with respect to several of the elements that compose the manufacturing process.the district court gave undue weight to some of hertz evidence and failed to view all of the evidence in the light most favorable to luzenac.
for example,the parties dispute whether the amount of vinyl silane in is public knowledge.the publicly available materials safety data sheet for lists the organosilane surface coating as constituting less than by weight of the product.luzenac argues,however,that there is a significant difference between knowing that it is less than and knowing the exact amount.hertz contends that the appropriate amount of silane was well known in the industry.however,hertz own evidence and arguments suggest that relatively minute differences in silane content have business significance in the industry and,more specifically,may be a significant variable in customers talc preferences.thus,hertz own presentation suggests that the precise amount of silane in within the to range had commercial value and the public would not necessarily have been able to discern that amount by simply knowing the range.for example,one of hertz sources states that one percent silane,based on filler weight,is a good starting point,but notes that ultimately the optimal level must be determined empirically since it depends on such factors as the surface area of the filler particle and the effects desired in the resulting composite.vol.iv,at emphasis added.and,significantly,in his arguments here,hertz appears to acknowledge that small differences in silane within the range at issue that is,the range from to are employed in the industry and are a significant variable in customers assessment of a talc value.while arguing that genera is different from,he notes that imi now sells four genera products with varying silane amounts,ranging from to,to suit the needs of various customers.hertz br.at emphasis added.
to be sure,hertz has produced a letter from luzenac to one of its customers in which it lists the amount of vinyl silane in.vol.viii,at.but without knowing more about the circumstances surrounding the letter and the relationship between luzenac and the customer,we can not conclude that this one letter proves,as a matter of law,that the precise amount of vinyl silane was public knowledge.viewing all of the evidence as a whole,there is significant support for luzenac position that it has kept the amount of vinyl silane a secret.the ultimate weighing of that evidence will have to be done by a jury.
a second element of the claimed trade secret is the type of silane used.the record indicates that luzenac had disclosed the fact that the coating is a vinyl silane.the type of vinyl silane,however,does not appear to have been disclosed.hertz maintains that one could determine the type of vinyl silane through logical deduction.luzenac vehemently disputes,however,whether such a deduction is as straightforward as hertz suggests.our review of the record does not reveal an answer.for example,hertz claims that t here are only two types of commercially available vinyl silane and that one of them could be eliminated from consideration because it may produce toxic byproducts.hertz br.at.however,luzenac evidence and arguments are to the contrary,indicating that there were in fact three such silanes.see luzenac reply br.at stating that hertz contention is untrue and noting the identification of three such silanes.vol.v,at discussing the abandonment of the one silane product because of potential health hazards and the choice between two others.we believe that the assessment of relevant documentation and witness testimony presents a genuine question of material fact 
a third element of the manufacturing process involves a quality control test that luzenac uses to check whether the talc is uniformly coated.luzenac claims that one of its employees discovered a novel,inexpensive technique that uses existing equipment originally designed for a completely different purpose.the senior technical manager in charge of developing,oscar noel,stated in his deposition that luzenac treated the test as highly confidential.vol.v,at.however,hertz submitted an affidavit of a technical manager at luzenac,todd yonker,who stated that he routinely demonstrated the test to potential customers.vol.iv,at.we can see no way to resolve this issue without weighing the credibility of the parties witnesses.the district court,therefore,erred in crediting the testimony of yonker over that of noel.see seamons snow,cir it is axiomatic that a judge may not evaluate the credibility of witnesses in deciding a motion for summary judgment.
our analysis of the individual elements of the manufacturing process bolsters our conclusion that when we apply the correct framework for evaluating a trade secret claim,hertz has not satisfied the standard for summary judgment.hertz counsel asserted at oral argument that the trade secret could be found in its combination in four documents.a discoverer of a trade secret may forfeit protection if the entire combination of its aspects is disclosed in several publications.milgrim benson,supra,at citing cases from various jurisdictions.we have considered all of these documents.we also have conducted our own comprehensive review of the record.as suggested by the discussion above,the production process of is not contained as a whole within the four documents to which hertz refers nor can it be indisputably discovered through the consideration of additional documents available to us.disputes exist over questions of material fact at both the individual element level as well as in the process of combining the various steps to create.hertz can not win on summary judgment simply by saying that a good mechanic could assemble various pieces of public information and,given enough time and resources,build a product like that of.the concept of a good mechanic should not be dispositive to prove lack of secrecy in a trade secret matter.id.at to.
the precautions taken by luzenac 
one factor to consider in determining whether a trade secret exists is the precautions taken by the holder of the trade secret to guard the secrecy of the information.supply,at.while the district court did consider evidence relating to these steps,it did not view the evidence in the light most favorable to luzenac.it focused on the steps that luzenac did not take,rather than evaluate whether the steps that luzenac did take were reasonable.
in order to claim protection of a trade secret,the owner thereof must have taken measures to prevent the secret from becoming available to persons other than those selected by the owner to have access thereto for limited purposes.harvey barnett,at quoting.ann.such measures must be reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy.supply,at citing network.however,e xtreme and unduly expensive procedures need not be taken.id.
luzenac took a series of steps to protect the secrecy of the manufacturing of.in particular,it posted signs warning employees to keep the production process of confidential required key employees,including hertz,to sign confidentiality agreements barred visitors to the plant from viewing the production process marked certain documents about the production process as confidential and subjected contractors like vhm to confidentiality agreements.
the district court simply dismissed luzenac actions as ceremonial in nature.vol.x,at.the district court noted that luzenac failed to have confidentiality agreements with all of its customers.it also faults luzenac for failing to control vhm disclosures of the process for.
however,there always are more security precautions that can be taken.just because there is something else that luzenac could have done does not mean that their efforts were unreasonable under the circumstances.in light of undisputed precautions that luzenac took,we do not think that the record demonstrates beyond dispute that luzenac measures to protect the secrecy of were merely superficial.vol.ix,at haggard spine,wl,at.june,applying utsa and holding that the previous employer had presented sufficient evidence that it had taken reasonable measures to protect the confidentiality of its trade secret when one such measure was requiring anyone involved with product development to sign a nondisclosure agreement.whether these precautions were,in fact,reasonable,will have to be decided by a jury.
we find multiple issues of material fact surrounding the secrecy of the production process of.the district court erred by making multiple determinations of fact on a motion for summary judgment.accordingly,we reverse and remand this claim.
is luzenac customer information a protectable secret 
luzenac accuses hertz and lighthart of taking confidential documents relating to luzenac actual and prospective customers when they left luzenac and supplying this information to imi fabi.specifically,luzenac alleges that hertz disclosed to imi fabi via detailed information about luzenac customers and prospective customers contained in documents that lighthart had taken from luzenac.one document contains information regarding customers and potential customers,including the names of the companies,their location,their applications for,projected annualized volume of purchases,and the status of customer testing and approval of the product.hertz concedes that he received this document from lighthart,who prepared it while employed with luzenac.lighthart also gave hertz a document he alleges he prepared specifically for imi fabi.this document lists information about potential genera customers,including company names,contact names,addresses,and applications.it is unclear from the record whether this information was misappropriated from luzenac customer information.
colorado recognizes that a customer list can be a trade secret under the utsa.network,at.trade secret is defined to include the listing of names,addresses,or telephone numbers,or other information relating to any business or profession which is secret and of value.ann.network,at.contrary to hertz contentions,we read the broad language of the utsa as including both actual and prospective customer lists,since both can be of value to the owner.ovation plumbing,furton,holding that the definition of trade secret in the utsa,together with evidence of value and of measures to protect disclosure,is broad enough to include a bid on a contract.
in analyzing whether a particular customer list is a trade secret,we must apply the colorado supply factors discussed above.supply,at see also network,at applying the same factors.the district court concluded that luzenac customer list was not a trade secret because it did not contain any confidential information.in reaching this conclusion,the district court considered the deposition testimony of several luzenac employees.the district court also noted that electronic customer information was only accessible by the customer service agent who worked with that customer.it acknowledged the testimony of barrett fisher,supervisor of sales and finance for vhm,and jerry gauntt,a luzenac salesperson,indicating how much time it took to develop the customer list.the district court ultimate determination relied,however,on the fact that the customer information was derived from public sources.it did not consider conflicting testimony that indicated that luzenac customer lists were only circulated to ten to twenty senior managers and salespeople within the company.with respect to luzenac instruction to its employees to keep all information confidential,the district court dismissed this measure by stating that this impracticable,blanket prohibition does not constitute a reasonable attempt at secrecy and the evidence is undisputed that luzenac employees ignored it of necessity.vol.ix,at.
we believe that the district court imposed its own determinations for those that should be made by a jury.what constitutes a trade secret is a question of fact.supply,at.whether luzenac customer list was easily ascertainable from public sources and whether luzenac took reasonable means to guard the secrecy of this list ordinarily would be questions for a jury.our review of the record indicates that the answers to these questions are disputed issues of fact and can not be easily determined from the record before us.
we note several examples of disputed facts relevant to the determination of the trade secret status of luzenac customer list.first,we have not found any evidence that a readily available public source would contain the identities of luzenac actual and prospective customers.the general information about each company in the customer list may be publicly available.but luzenac claims to have created a list of fewer than twenty customers from a universe of a thousand or more potential customers.luzenac spent anywhere from weeks to years developing those customer relationships a customer list can be a trade secret when it is the end result of a long process of culling the relevant information from lengthy and diverse sources,even if the original sources are publicly available.see conseco fin.servicing am.mortgage,cir holding that the company lead sheets are trade secrets,despite the fact that they are based largely on public records hickman taylor.holding that an attorney notes of an interview with a witness is work product,even though the opposing party is free to interview the same witness,because there is a difference between what the witness observed and what the attorney saw fit to write down haggard,wl,at holding that the previous employer had presented sufficient evidence that its customer information,which took years to develop and was organized in a unique manner,was entitled to trade secret protection under utsa despite the fact that many of the sources of the information were publicly available.
we also conclude that at least some of the information contained on luzenac customer list may not be publicly available.while the names,locations,and applications for any potential customers of vinyl talc could be available from a variety of,trade publications,the harris directory,and the thomas do not find evidence at a minimum that the status of testing and luzenac contact person at each company was public accordingly,we believe that a number of facts relevant to the trade secret status of luzenac customer list are disputed and should go to a jury.
on remand,a number of considerations may be put before the jury in assessing the trade secret status of luzenac customer list.the colorado supply court enumerated several distinct elements considered by other jurisdictions in making this determination.see.supply,at.these include whether proper and reasonable steps were taken by the owner to protect the secrecy of the information whether access to the information was restricted whether employees knew customers names from general experience whether customers commonly dealt with more than one supplier whether customer information could be readily obtained from public directories whether customer information is readily ascertainable from sources outside the owner business whether the owner of the customer list expended great cost and effort over a considerable period of time to develop the files and whether it would be difficult for a competitor to duplicate the information.see id.citing cases from various jurisdictions.we believe that such factors are material to the determination of whether a customer list is a trade secret and,therefore,must be considered by a jury.
we also note that t here is no requirement in colorado uniform trade secrets act that there be actual use or commercial implementation of the misappropriated trade secret for damages to accrue.misappropriation consists only of the improper disclosure or acquisition of the trade secret.sonoco prods.johnson,citing.ann.a,b.accordingly,we find hertz argument that there is no evidence that imi fabi benefitted from luzenac customer information to be irrelevant to the questions of whether hertz misappropriated luzenac customer list,and whether this customer list is a trade secret 
breach of contract and conspiracy claims 
colorado recognizes a claim for breach of contract regarding an employee who was bound to confidentiality.see mulei jet courier,only confidential information acquired during the course of employment may be protected,not the general knowledge of a business operation.information already known to competitors or readily ascertainable elsewhere can not be protected as confidential.citation omitted,rev in part.thus,even if luzenac fails to establish its claims under the utsa,it still may have a breach of contract claim.hertz signed a confidentiality agreement in which he agreed not to disclose confidential and proprietary information during or after termination of his employment with luzenac.the confidentiality agreement executed by hertz provided 
in consideration of employment with luzenac america,you agree that during and after your employment with luzenac america,you will not divulge or appropriate to your own use or to the use of others any secret or confidential information or knowledge obtained by you during employment with luzenac america.this restriction shall not apply to information which is or becomes part of the public domain through no breach of any obligation of confidentiality,or was known or possessed by you prior to beginning employment with luzenac america.
because the district court concluded that luzenac did not take steps to emphasize the confidentiality of and its customer information,the court did not conduct any factual analysis specifically regarding the breach of contract claim.while analysis of this claim would not take the same form as the analysis of the trade secret is,it would not apply the colorado supply would still look to whether the steps taken by luzenac to protect secrecy and confidentiality were sufficient to convey that the manufacturing process of was confidential information.since the agreement was not specific as to what information was confidential,the relevant factual questions include whether luzenac made it clear that the manufacturing process for and luzenac customer information were confidential,and whether the information used by hertz was exclusively in the public domain or known to him prior to his employment with luzenac.accordingly,we remand this claim for further proceedings.
similarly,luzenac conspiracy claim also depends on the factual findings already discussed in its misappropriation of trade secret claims.a civil conspiracy is a combination of two or more persons who,by some concerted action,seek either to accomplish an unlawful purpose or to accomplish some lawful purpose by criminal or unlawful means.mulei,at.powell products,marks,recognized that if a plaintiff alleges that particular defendants conspired to misappropriate trade secrets,this claim is not preempted by the utsa.id.at.if a jury were to decide that luzenac process for,customer information,or both,are trade secrets,then hertz and lighthart could be charged with conspiracy.accordingly,we remand this claim to the district court.
d.hertz claim for abuse of process 
hertz appeals from the denial by the district court of his motion to amend his complaint to add a claim for abuse of process.hertz alleged that luzenac abused the legal process by litigating against him in order to ruin his livelihood.specifically,hertz stated in his proposed amended complaint that 
the principal reason for filing the counterclaims was other than to recover amounts that
