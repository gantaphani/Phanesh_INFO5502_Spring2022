discussion 
we review the trial court order granting the motion de novo.flatley mauro cal th,d.we consider the pleadings,and supporting and opposing affidavits upon which the liability or defense is based.citation.however,we neither weigh credibility nor compare the weight of the evidence.rather,we accept as true the evidence favorable to the plaintiff citation and evaluate the defendant evidence only to determine if it has defeated that submitted by the plaintiff as a matter of law.citation.citation.id.at,d.
section,subdivision b requires the court to engage in a process.first,the court decides whether the defendant has made a threshold showing that the challenged cause of action is one arising from protected activity.the moving defendant burden is to demonstrate that the act or acts of which the plaintiff complains were taken in furtherance of the defendant right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue,as defined in the statute.citation.if the court finds such a showing has been made,it then determines whether the plaintiff has demonstrated a probability of prevailing on the claim.under section,subdivision b,the trial court in making these determinations considers the pleadings,and supporting and opposing affidavits stating the facts upon which the liability or defense is based.equilon enterprises consumer cause,cal th,d.
raining data met its burden of demonstrating the acts underlying the arose from protected activity.
the claims in the were based on raining data acts of filing the complaint,and communicating with adevnet customers and potential customers.raining data act of filing the complaint in the underlying action squarely falls within section,subdivision e.contemporary services staff pro th,d.to the extent raining data communications with adevnet customers constituted a litigation update,describing the parties contentions and court rulings,and were directed toward those persons with some involvement in the litigation,they would be protected activity under section,subdivision e.contemporary services staff pro,supra,th at,d.neither the nor the parties submissions in connection with the motion clearly define when the communications occurred,or what their nature was.
two of the causes of action in the malicious prosecution and abuse of definition arise from the protected activity of raining data filing of its complaint.the remaining causes of action present a classic case of mixed claims of protected and nonprotected activity.w here a cause of action alleges both protected and unprotected activity,the cause of action will be subject to section unless the protected conduct is merely incidental to the unprotected conduct citations.mann quality old time service,th,d.i t is the principal thrust or gravamen of the plaintiff cause of action that determines whether the p statute applies.scott metabolife,th,d.a plaintiff can not frustrate the purposes of the slapp statute through a pleading tactic of combining allegations of protected and nonprotected activity under the label of one cause of action.citation.conversely,a defendant in an ordinary private dispute can not take advantage of the statute simply because the complaint contains some references to speech or petitioning activity by the defendant.citation.we conclude it is the principal thrust or gravamen of the plaintiff cause of action that determines whether the statute applies citation,and when the allegations referring to arguably protected activity are only incidental to a cause of action based essentially on nonprotected activity,collateral allusions to protected activity should not subject the cause of action to the statute.martinez metabolife,th,d.
next,we examine what the alleged raining data actually did or failed to do in order to determine the gravamen of the.in each of the,defendants alleged that in doing the acts herein alleged,raining data caused damage and harm to them.defendants alleged raining data caused them damage and harm by making false statements,committing trade libel,engaging in predatory tactics,harassment,intimidation,interfering with prospective economic advantage,filing frivolous lawsuits,intercepting confidential communications,invading their privacy,attempting to discredit defendants reputations,committing business sabotage,and interfering with defendants rights of free speech and association.but the alleged very little in terms of specific acts on the part of raining data that could form a basis for any cause of action.we set forth here al
