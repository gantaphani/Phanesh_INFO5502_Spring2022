organik kimya san.ve,organik kimya netherlands,and organik kimya us,collectively,organik kimya appeal from the international trade commission the commission or itc decision imposing default judgment sanctions for spoliation of evidence and entering a limited exclusion order against organik kimya.see certain opaque polymers,inv,itc lexis,at,see also certain opaque polymers,inv,at,available at commission opinion certain opaque polymers,inv,usitc order,wl,alj order.because the commission did not abuse its discretion in entering default judgment as a sanction for organik kimya spoliation of evidence and further did not abuse its discretion in entering the limited exclusion order,we affirm.
background 
this case involves trade secrets relating to opaque polymers,which are hollow spheres used as paint additives for interior and exterior paints to increase the paint opacity.organik kimya and dow chemical company dow both manufacture opaque polymers.dow is the market leader in supplying opaque polymers to paint manufacturers,both in the united states and worldwide.dow has maintained this position through a combination of patent and protections.
in may,dow filed a complaint with the itc requesting an investigation into whether organik kimya opaque polymer products infringed four dow patents.the itc granted dow request,and the parties began discovery.during the proceedings,dow amended its complaint to add allegations of trade secret misappropriation when it discovered that organik kimya may have coordinated the production of its opaque polymers with the assistance of former dow employee dilip nene.dow discovered that other former dow employees,guillermo perez and leonard strozzi,also may have assisted organik kimya with its development of opaque polymers.as dow attempted to obtain discovery relating to the activities of perez,nene,and strozzi,however,dow discovered spoliation of evidence on a staggering scale.
administrative law judge findings 
findings relating to perez 
in response to a discovery order issued by the administrative law judge alj,dow forensic investigators traveled to turkey in february to inspect perez laptop computer.alj order,wl,at.four days before the forensic investigation took place,and three days after the alj issued the discovery order authorizing the examination of the computer,organik kimya began overwriting the laptop hard drive by copying the program files folder at least times.id.at.while performing this overwriting,organik kimya also backdated the computer internal clock so that the metadata on the copied files would hide the fact that the overwriting took place only days before the inspection.id.at.organik kimya even ran a program called ccleaner multiple times to delete a large percentage of the c drive and all of the d drive in perez laptop.id.to ensure that its efforts had been successful,organik kimya also used a program called winhex at least twelve times to see whether it could recover any of the deleted information before the forensic investigation took place.id.at.
after dow informed the alj of the forensic examiners findings,organik kimya submitted a letter to the alj explaining that the it work done on perez computer was simply maintenance undertaken because perez was encountering troubles with the computer.id.at.organik kimya also asserted that there was no or desire to destroy evidence.id.at.
the alj found organik kimya explanation to be a work of fiction.id.he found that organik kimya actions made it impossible to know the exact volume and content of any previously recoverable data,but noted it was at least clear that it involved potentially hundreds of thousands of files.id.at.the alj also found that there was no innocent explanation for organik kimya conduct relating to the use of the ccleaner program.id.at.
the alj concluded that this evidence leads me to the inescapable conclusion that organik kimya acted in bad faith when,in contravention of order,organik kimya undertook the massive spoliation of evidence on perez laptop in fact,were there such a thing,i would find organik kimya egregious behavior to be gross bad faith.id.at.the alj further stated that organik kimya actions,coupled with the multitude of lies organik kimya knowingly and deliberately presented to the undersigned to hide or explain away its wrongdoing,leave no doubt that organik kimya destroyed evidence on perez laptop with the intent to impair dow ability prove sic its allegations of trade secret misappropriation.id.the alj found the spoliated evidence relevant to dow allegation of trade secret misappropriation and its destruction prejudicial to dow ability to prosecute same.id.at.
findings relating to nene 
organik kimya failed to identify nene in response to an interrogatory seeking the identification of all former dow employees who had worked for organik kimya.when dow discovered nene involvement with organik kimya and served a subpoena upon him,nene asserted that his communications with organik kimya were never of a technical nature.alj order,wl,at.a forensic inspection conducted by dow,however,found that nene engaged in various technical discussions with organik kimya.id.at.dow also uncovered two emails relating to nene involvement with organik kimya and evidence of organik kimya attempt to purge those emails these emails read confidential information related to the consultant nene are still recorded here,they were supposed to be erased by the it department,id.at and basak,can you print them and give them to me please then we should erase them from the system please.
during discovery,dow uncovered a suspicious meeting between nene and organik kimya at a hotel in rotterdam.alj order,wl,at.after dow served organik kimya with the complaint in this matter,kaslowski,organik kimya,called nene directly and directed him to travel to rotterdam for a safety audit.id.when nene traveled to rotterdam about a month later,kaslowski was the first person to meet with nene.they met at nene hotel rather than at organik kimya offices.id.both nene and organik kimya denied having this meeting,but the forensic investigation confirmed that it occurred.id.
nene also admitted that,around the time he received the call from kaslowski asking nene to travel to rotterdam for the safety audit,nene removed the hard drive from his personal computer and smashed it with a hammer and threw it in the garbage.id.nene testified that he smashed the hard drive to make sure that the information on the drive could not be recovered.id.at.he also admitted to destroying a bag full of zip drives.id.the alj found this evidence very significant,as well as extremely troubling,as it shows not only joint purpose,but tends to establish nene and kaslowski recognized the obvious implication that such a meeting would have since it occurred shortly after this investigation commenced.id.at.the alj also determined that it seems unlikely the of organik kimya would participate in a routine safety audit and meet in a hotel to discuss it and then lie about the meeting afterwards.id.
the alj found sufficient evidence to conclude that organik kimya had the ability to control nene and had failed to act responsibly to preserve nene information,thereby rendering organik kimya in reckless disregard of its duty to preserve nene information.id.at.but the alj determined that there was insufficient evidence to link nene deletion of evidence to a design by organik kimya to destroy the data deliberately.id.the alj accordingly found no y spoliation relating to nene documents.id.at.
findings relating to strozzi 
on march,one day after the alj ordered strozzi files to be preserved and four days prior to the scheduled forensic examination of strozzi computer,someone logged into the computer and deleted files and folders,many of which were later recovered and found to be responsive to previously identified keyword search terms.id.at.the inspectors also found evidence of numerous undisclosed and unproduced usb storage devices used on strozzi work computer.id.at.but before dow learned about the existence of the external storage devices,strozzi took his computer bag,which had his computer and storage devices,into a bathroom of a highway rest stop,but accidentally left it there.id.
the alj found that organik kimya had control over strozzi laptop but not the external storage devices.id.at.the alj also found that organik kimya had never given its employees a litigation hold notice,instead leaving it up to each individual employee whether to save or delete electronic files.id.at.although the evidence from strozzi laptop was later recovered through forensic investigation,the alj determined that the deletion of the files evinces an attempt to wrong doing.what is even more shocking is that at the time i issued my preservation order,organik kimya was already on notice of the massive spoliation of evidence on perez laptop.id.at.the alj noted that t he matter is even worse when discussing the loss of the laptop itself,for organik kimya had the laptop in its possession for the forensic inspection and yet inexplicably returned it to strozzi,which allowed him to lose it.id.at.additionally,dow only received a small portion of the deleted documents because only a few were responsive to the search terms the parties identified prior to the forensic search.id.at.the alj noted,however,that many of the additional files for which dow received the file name but never saw the full document seemed plainly relevant to the case based on the file names,whether or not associated with the identified search terms.id.the alj determined that organik kimya failed to show that these documents were neither relevant nor prejudicial.id.
as to organik kimya conduct relating to strozzi laptop,the alj found the spoliation of evidence on the strozzi laptop and the spoliation of the strozzi laptop itself was done in an effort to prevent dow from access to evidence it might use to support its allegations in this investigation.id.at.the alj concluded that the spoliation of evidence on the strozzi laptop and the loss of the strozzi laptop itself was in bad faith.id.the alj also found at least some of the documents deleted from the strozzi laptop to be relevant and prejudicial to dow allegations in this investigation.id.at.
the alj conclusions 
on may,dow moved for sanctions,including a default judgment against organik kimya.id.at.two days later,organik kimya filed a motion to terminate the investigation by consent order.id.at.organik kimya agreed to completely and indefinitely withdraw the accused products from the market.organik kimya admitted that a portion of the hard drive of perez computer was overwritten in such a way that previously deleted files were potentially rendered unrecoverable through forensic means.alj order,wl,at.nevertheless,organik kimya urged the alj to enter its proposed consent order rather than a default judgment.
the alj conducted a hearing on dow sanction motion and organik kimya consent order motion.at the hearing,organik kimya also argued in the alternative that any sanction be limited to an adverse inference precluding perez from testifying about organik kimya alleged independent development of its opaque polymers.at.the alj granted dow motion for default judgment in a initial determination.see generally alj order,wl.the opinion recounted organik kimya destruction of evidence in detail.it included the following excerpt as part of its executive summary 
a s will be made clear in the pages that follow this is an extreme case,for organik kimya flouted its obligation to preserve evidence,deliberately destroyed evidence,and then actively attempted to deceive the undersigned as to what it had done.given the grave damage organik kimya deliberate conduct potentially could have on the administration of justice the need to deter such egregious conduct in the future and the certain prejudice to dow,only the strongest remedy available is sufficient.
when discussing a sanction,the alj stated that organik kimya willful,bad faith misconduct had deprived dow of its ability to pursue its trade secret misappropriation claim effectively and the alj of his ability to oversee a prehearing process that would facilitate a fair and timely resolution of this investigation on its merits.id.at.the alj therefore found that n o sanction short of default is available to return the parties to the position in which they would have been but for the deliberate destruction by organik kimya of evidence potentially favorable to dow.id.the alj then explained why shifting the burden of proof and using adverse inferences would not address adequately organik kimya conduct in this case.id.at.according to the alj,no lesser sanction will adequately deter the repetition of this kind of easily accomplished and highly prejudicial destruction of evidence.id.
the alj further clarified that he found organik kimya abhorrent conduct with regard to perez laptop and files to be more than sufficient to justify the default sanction against organik kimya.id.at.he found organik kimya contumacious and inexplicable conduct with regard to strozzi and his documents to independently justify the most severe sanction,even were i to heed organik kimya lack of prejudice argument.id.
b.the commission affirms the alj conclusions 
the commission determined that the initial determination recites in detail the misconduct in this investigation,and the commission affirmed and adopted all of the initial determination factual findings.commission opinion,at.the commission also affirm ed and adopt ed the alj determination of default.see also id.at we affirm all of the initial determination findings concerning the default sanction.the commission determined that the spoliation of evidence on perez computer alone is more than sufficient to justify the sanctions ordered by the alj.id.at.it went on to find that the intentional deletion of files by strozzi is at least circumstantial evidence relating to the culpable state of mind found by the alj.id.at.
organik kimya argued that the alj failed to consider its proposed lesser sanctions.see id.at.the commission rejected organik kimya argument as to the consent order,noting that t he commission has always reserved the right to deny termination by consent in appropriate circumstance.id.at.the commission also noted that allowing organik kimya to exit the investigation on consent without accepting the full measure of its responsibility for its egregious actions would not be a sufficient deterrent because,i f such termination were allowed here,future parties may decide to engage in discovery abuse with the understanding that if they are caught they can merely exit the investigation through the consent order procedures without being held accountable for their misconduct.id.at.as to an adverse inference or some lesser sanction,the commission stated that t he alj also explained why any sanction less than default would be insufficient and that the commission could discern no conflict between the alj determination and shepherd american broadcasting,cir,which organik kimya had cited in support for its argument.commission opinion,at.
the commission found that an exclusion order and a cease and desist order were appropriate remedies.id.at.based on the record evidence,the commission determined that the evidence demonstrated it would have taken organik kimya years to develop a commercial opaque polymer comparable to dow without using dow trade secrets.id.the commission therefore found that a period would be an appropriate length for the exclusion order.id.the exclusion order included a narrowing provision,however,that allows organik kimya to seek an opinion from the commission that would allow organik kimya to import products that it shows were developed without using dow misappropriated trade secrets.id.at.
ii.discussion 
default judgment sanction 
any sanctions imposed by the commission are reviewed for an abuse of discretion.genentech,int l trade comm n,fed.cir.an abuse of discretion occurs if the commission sanction decision is clearly unreasonable,arbitrary,or fanciful is based on an erroneous conclusion of law rests on clearly erroneous fact findings or follows from a record that contains no evidence on which the body could rationally base its decision.id.at.
the parties initially dispute the proper
