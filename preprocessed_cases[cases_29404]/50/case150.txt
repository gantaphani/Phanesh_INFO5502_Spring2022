appellants mui luu and cu tu nguyen challenge an order temporarily enjoining them from engaging in certain activities found by the trial court to constitute,among other things,tortious disloyalty to,and interference with the business of,plaintiffs huong que,and con tu.appellants contend that the trial court erred in finding that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits in several of their claims.we find no error,and affirm.
background 
plaintiff con is the president and sole owner of plaintiff huong que,a california corporation huong que according to the complaint huong que is a vietnamese calendar distribution corporation founded by appellants nguyen and luu,under whom it became,over years,the most well known,recognized and trusted brand name for traditional style vietnamese calendars known as bloc calendars.at the beginning of,are apparently husband and the corporation to plaintiff con under a written contract.in a portion of the contract entitled purchase and sale,plaintiffs agreed to pay appellants in three annual installments.in a section entitled compensation agreement,plaintiffs agreed to pay bonus and pension amount s of to appellant nguyen and to appellant luu.in a section entitled management agreement,appellants agreed to act as buyer managing agents for a minimum period of four years from january,during which time they would provide buyer with business dealings,bookkeeping activities,and design of publishing samples.plaintiffs undertook to pay appellants expenses in rendering these services,including air fares,transportation,lodging,and meal.they further agreed to pay monthly to luu,plus monthly to continue the current lease of nguyen mercedes benz.
the purchase and sale section of the agreement included a paragraph entitled covenant not to compete,which provided in its entirety,shareholders,appellants shall not directly or indirectly,carry on or engage in,as an owner,the business of publishing services except for publishing buddhist bible and book.the contract also included an integration clause,which stated,this agreement constitutes the entire agreement between buyer,shareholder sic,and the company concerning their rights and obligations with respect to the sale and purchase of the shares.any agreements or representations respecting the business or the sales of shares to buyer,that are not expressly set forth in this agreement shall have no effect,except for a subsequent written modification signed by the party to be charged.
it is asserted by plaintiffs,and not disputed by appellants,that on may,plaintiffs discovered an message entitled address list in the electronic mailbox of appellant luu the message constituted an apparent response by one huan nguyen to an earlier message from luu in which she had written,please remember to email address list to me.his reply stated,attached are customers addresses and meeting report on.please forward to other procalendar members.attached to the was a text file in vietnamese,which plaintiffs later translated into english.entitled minutes of meeting regard sic creation of procalendar,it called for the formation of a company using capitalization of in five equal shares,of which two would be distributed to one amy khuu nguyen tu cu,phan don.the minutes set forth,among other things,the responsibilities of each partner as relevant here,they stated,luu mui will be responsible for bookkeeping,tax,contact with taiwan for printing for customer,and distributing calendar for direct contact with customer,and no salary.cu will be responsible for direct sales with xanh,no salary.
also attached to the,according to a declaration by plaintiff cu,was a document entitled.xls.this consisted of a list,as he declared,of approximately names and addresses,of which he said approximately ninety percent are names and address on huong que customer list.
on july,plaintiffs con and huong que filed a complaint naming as defendants nguyen and luu,as well as one don phan,and two business entities pro enterprise,llc,described as a limited liability company,and pro calendar,a business entity,form unknown.in later filings,appellants stated that pro enterprise,llc,did business under the name of pro calendar.it appears that three additional individual defendants were later joined in the action thuy nguyen,huan nguyen,and hung chun tam.appellants described thuy nguyen as a former key employee of huong que who,along with hung chun tam,owned and operated pro calendar.these defendants,along with don phan and the two defendant business entities,appeared in the action separately from appellants.they referred to themselves below as the pro calendar defendants,and we shall do likewise.
in their complaint plaintiffs alleged,among other things,that in,appellants began to neglect their duties as managing agents that in march,they stopped performing those duties entirely and that they misappropriated huong que customer list and used it to solicit business for pro calendar.they asserted causes of action for breach of contract,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,breach of the duty of trust and loyalty arising from appellants positions as managing agents,misappropriation of a trade secret,huong que customer list,and tortious interference with huong que relations with its existing customers.plaintiffs prayed for compensatory and punitive damages,and temporary and permanent injunctive relief.
along with their complaint plaintiffs filed an ex parte application for an order temporarily restraining the named defendants,and requiring them to show why they should not be enjoined pending trial,from engaging as an owner in the business of publishing services other than as expressly permitted by the purchase agreement utilizing in any manner the huong que customer list distributing catalogs offering bloc calendars or photo calendars to customers on huong que customer list soliciting business from customers on the list selling or distributing calendars to persons on the list and distributing calendars or anything resembling certain exhibits to the complaint.
the trial court issued a temporary restraining order and the matter came on for hearing on the preliminary injunction.in their opposition,appellants conceded that pro calendar had undertaken to represent a taiwanese marketer of calendar products,and thus compete d in the calendar distribution business.they also conceded that they had hosted a lunch at their home in may at which the subject of pro calendar and its formation was discussed.but they den ied any substantive involvement in these purported discussions concerning pro calendar formation,and den ied agree ing to the proposed role for them as stated in the emailed minutes.they asserted that there was no evidence of an ownership interest by them in pro calendar as ultimately formed.they also conceded that pro calendar had mailed a catalog to prospective customers,but asserted,in arguably less than unequivocal language,that the list of recipients was derived independently of huong que customer list.they contended that plaintiffs were not entitled to injunctive relief because they would be unable to prevail on their claims at a trial on the merits.
the trial court issued an order analyzing the issues and evidence at some length.the court found that t he luu defendants do not have an ownership interest in the company,pro calendar.however,they did engage in substantive discussions concerning its formation at their home on may,in which a tentative agreement was reached in which most of the participants at this meeting would have ownership interests in pro calendar and would actively participate in the company in different roles.the court also found credible the averments in several declarations to the effect that appellant nguyen did in fact actively solicit huong que customers for pro calendar,a business entity that directly competed with plaintiffs.
the court noted that a central issue before it had been what the customer list attached to the intercepted email actually consist ed of.the court found that a specified deposition exhibit containing names and addresses was a true and correct copy of the customer list attached to this email the court found,the great majority of customer names on this list are customers of huong que.moreover,an extraordinary degree of customer information appearing on both the list and huong que customer list share the exact same mistakes and errors.the exhibit thus established,the court found,that appellants and three other individual defendants had appropriated huong que customer list.
the court determined that plaintiffs were likely to prevail on most of their causes of action,and that they would be irreparably injured,and defendants unjustly enriched,if the latter were not prevented from distributing calendars and catalogs to customers on huong que customer list accordingly the court enjoined appellants,and some other defendants,from using the huong que customer list distributing catalogs offering competing calendars to customers on the customer list soliciting business from customers on the list and selling competing calendars to customers on the list.
appellants filed this timely appeal.the pro calendar defendants also appealed,but this court dismissed that appeal under former california rules of court,rule a.
discussion 
rule of decision and standard of review 
the ultimate questions on a motion for a preliminary injunction are whether the plaintiff is likely to suffer greater injury from a denial of the injunction than the defendants are likely to suffer from its grant,and whether there is a reasonable probability that the plaintiffs will prevail on the merits.robbins superior court cal d.here appellants do not contend that the trial court erred in connection with the first factor.their challenge goes to the court determination that plaintiffs were likely to prevail on the merits.for this approach to succeed,appellants must show that plaintiffs were unlikely to succeed on any cause of action that would support injunctive relief.
such a challenge may trigger any or all of three standards of appellate review.insofar as the court ruling rests on evaluating and weighing the substantive factors noted preponderance of likely injury and the likelihood of is said to be vested in the discretion of the trial court,whose ruling will not be disturbed on appeal unless an abuse of discretion is made to appear.superior court th,d.insofar as the trial court ruling depends on determination of the applicable principles of law,however,it is subject to independent appellate review.strategix,infocrossing west,th,d people jackson th,d some cases define an error of law as an abuse of discretion.and insofar as the court resolved disputed issues of fact,its findings are reviewed under the substantial evidence standard,they will be sustained unless shown to lack substantial evidentiary support.people ex rel.gallo acuna cal th,d,howard wright construction superior court th,d.
appellants betray a misunderstanding of the standard and its application on appeal when they assert that the appellate court looks at the evidence that was presented to the trial court to determine if there was substantial evidence supporting the decision.citations.in such a review,the appellate court must ensure that the trial court express or implied factual determinations are supported by substantial evidence.shapiro at,d.if appellants mean to suggest that we must independently search the evidentiary record to determine its sufficiency,they are mistaken.an appellate court must presume that the record contains evidence to support every finding of fact in re marriage of fink cal d,italics added see brown world church d.a reviewing court starts with the presumption that the record contains evidence to sustain every finding of fact.it is the appellant burden,not the court,to identify and establish deficiencies in the evidence.brown world church,supra,d.this burden is a daunting one.in re marriage of higinbotham d.a party who challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support a particular finding must summarize the evidence on that point,favorable and unfavorable,and show how and why it is insufficient.citation.roemer pappas d,italics added.w hen an appellant urges the insufficiency of the evidence to support the findings it is his duty to set forth a fair and adequate statement of the evidence which is claimed to be insufficient.he can not shift this burden onto respondent,nor is a reviewing court required to undertake an independent examination of the record when appellant has shirked his responsibility in this respect.hickson thielman d.
appellants cite two cases on this point,but those decisions state only that a permanent injunction must be supported by substantial evidence in the record thompson rv sales,th,d,and that findings of fact are reviewed under a substantial evidence standard,quoting shapiro san diego city council th,d.they do not state,as appellants assert,that the reviewing court must ensure that the trial court findings are supported by substantial evidence.an appellate court will consider the sufficiency of the evidence to support a given finding only after a party tenders such an issue together with a fair summary of the evidence bearing on the challenged finding,particularly including evidence that arguably supports it.
as we have noted,the order before us must be affirmed if the trial court acted within its discretion,and properly applied the law,in assessing the likelihood of success on any cause of action.we find the court determination to be free of demonstrated error with respect to at least two causes of action.for that reason we find it unnecessary to,and do not,address appellants challenges to the remaining causes of action.
ii.breach of duty of loyalty 
introduction 
plaintiffs alleged in their complaint that defendants nguyen and luu,while employed by plaintiffs in a position of trust and confidence as managing agents,owed a duty of loyalty to plaintiffs,which they breached by,in essence,using their positions at huong que,and information acquired in those positions,to compete with it.the elements of a cause of action for breach of a duty of loyalty,by analogy to a claim for breach of fiduciary duty,are as follows the existence of a relationship giving rise to a duty of loyalty one or more breaches of that duty and damage proximately caused by that breach.see pierce lyman th,d.the trial court ruling necessarily implies that plaintiffs were likely to establish each of these elements to the satisfaction of a factfinder at trial.appellants raise a host of points in derogation of that finding,which we will analyze under the elements to which they relate.
duty of loyalty 
appellants main challenge appears to be that no duty of loyalty can be imposed upon them without running afoul of the rights the parties voluntarily created in their contract.the argument is rather nebulous,but centers on the propositions that appellants had limited duties under the contract,the terms of which should control the obligations between the parties.to fully evaluate this contention it is necessary to review the law of agency with respect to the duty of loyalty on which the present cause of action rests.
the duty of loyalty arises not from a contract but from a,the relationship of principal and agent.agency is the fiduciary relationship that arises when one person a principal manifests assent to another person an agent that the agent shall act on the principal behalf and subject to the principal control,and the agent manifests assent or otherwise consents so to act.rest d,agency.where such a relationship arises,the agent assumes a fiduciary duty to act loyally for the principal benefit in all matters connected with the agency relationship.
while the creation of an agency relationship requires the assent of both parties,it does not require or depend on the law of contracts.the consensual aspect of agency does not mean that an enforceable contract underlies or accompanies each relation of agency.many agents act or promise to act gratuitously.while either acting as an agent or promising to do so creates an agency relation,neither the promise to act gratuitously nor an act in response to the principal request for gratuitous service creates an enforceable contract.rest d,agency,com.d,italics added.
here there is ample evidence that appellants assented to act as agents for plaintiffs after all,their agreement explicitly characterized them as such.they seem to suggest,however,that notwithstanding this agreement,to find them bound by a duty of loyalty,and particularly a duty not to compete,would conflict with the purchase contract clause,which only prohibited appellants from competing with plaintiffs as an owner.there is no logical conflict between this prohibition and a recognition of a distinct,additional duty of loyalty arising from the parties relationship.see,superfluity does not vitiate.appellants imply,however,that the effect of the contractual provision was to limit any restriction on their right to compete,so that they were only forbidden to compete as an owner.they thus appear to invoke,albeit tacitly,the maxim expressio unius exclusio alterius est,mention of one matter implies the exclusion of all others.steven fidelity cas.of new york cal d.but that rule can only be invoked if a contract is ambiguous,in which case other legal techniques for the resolution of ambiguities also come into play,including the admission of extrinsic evidence to prove the intent of the parties.ibid.
we are directed to nothing on the face of the contract,and certainly to no extrinsic evidence,that would support the supposition that the parties intended to excuse appellants from the duty of loyalty otherwise flowing from their agency relationship.on the contrary,the clause appeared in a part of the contract concerning the provisions outlining the sale of the entity,under the heading purchase and sale.this was followed by a section entitled compensation agreement,reciting the sum due to each appellant as bonus and pension amount.appellants undertaking to act for four years as managing agents appeared under the separate heading management agreement.the clause could readily be understood as intended not to affect appellants duties as agents or employees,but only to obligate them as sellers.we can not say that the trial court erred in failing to find that appellants interpretation of the agreement was the one likely to prevail at trial.
similar reasoning applies to appellants oblique invocation of the parol evidence rule,which limits the ability of parties to an integrated written,one that appears intended to express the entire claim that the writing is incomplete.see code civ.appellants note that the contract here contained a clause declaring it the entire agreement between the parties concerning their rights and obligations with respect to the sale and purchase of the shares.but as the phrase seems to attest,this clause may itself be found ambiguous as it relates to the parties rights and obligations under the management agreement.moreover,as noted above,appellants own tacit reliance on the expressio unius maxim assumes the presence of contractual ambiguity.the parol evidence rule does not bar the admission of extrinsic evidence to resolve ambiguities in contract language.code civ,subds.b,g morey vannucci th,fn,d.
appellants suggest that subjecting them to a duty of loyalty would offend the rule of guz bechtel national cal th,d,which they cite for the proposition that th e law does not countenance implied obligations which are not part and parcel of the written agreement.a more accurate statement would be that the law does not recognize implied contract terms that are at variance with the terms of the contract as expressly agreed or as prescribed by statute.as we have already observed,however,an agent duty of loyalty arises not from any contract but from the parties relationship.many relationships give rise to duties that may be enforced even though the parties to the relationship have entered into a contract that makes no mention of those duties.landlord and tenant,trustee and beneficiary,bailor and and many other relationships generate rights and obligations quite independent of any contract the parties may sign.this does not make such duties inescapable.the parties may be able to modify or limit them by expressly agreeing to do so.but in the absence of such an agreement they are bound by them whether or not they allude to them in their contract.
the cited case is consistent with this deeply embedded tradition.appellants overlook the court ratification of the rule that all contracting parties,whether they agree to it or not,are bound by the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,which prevent s one contracting party from unfairly frustrating the other party right to receive the benefits of the agreement actually made.guz bechtel national,supra,cal th at,d.appellants refer instead to the court holding that discharging an employee without cause can not constitute a breach of the covenant.but that holding rests on the rationale that such a discharge can not frustrate any contractual expectation to which an employee is entitled.id.at,d,precisely because employment at will allows the employer freedom to terminate the relationship as it chooses,the employer does not frustrate the employee contractual rights merely by doing so.this reasoning depends on the statutory presumption of employment,which in the absence of an agreement to the contrary,entitled the employer there to engage in the conduct asserted as a breach of covenant.
here the presumption is reversed.in the absence of an agreement to the contrary,appellants,as agents,owed a duty of undivided loyalty,including a duty not to compete,to plaintiffs,their principals.see witkin,summary of cal.law ed.agency employment,an agent or employee is under a duty not to compete with his or her principal on matters connected with the agency,unless the principal and the agent otherwise agree.viewed through the lens of contract law,plaintiffs were entitled to consider this duty of loyalty an integral part of the relationship,just as a buyer expects an automobile to come with tires.if appellants wished to modify or delimit the duties imposed on them by deliver a car without was incumbent upon them to make that modification or delimitation an express subject of the contract.they could not rely on the contract silence to excuse them from the legal consequences of disloyalty to their principals.
appellants assert that their employment agreement was essentially a consulting contract and that they should not be burdened with a duty of loyalty merely because,in selling their business,they agreed to perform simple consulting duties.this claim obliquely invokes the conception of an agent as one who represents the principal in dealings with a true consultant,of course,does not.it is true that in a paradigmatic agency relationship,the agent undertakes or assents to act for the principal in relations with a third party.rest d,agency,com.c,italics added see,quoting mechem,a treatise on the law of agency ed,it has been said that a relationship of agency always contemplates three principal,the agent,and the third party with whom the agent is to deal.an agent may be distinguished in this respect from a service provider who simply furnishes advice and does not interact with third parties as the representative of the recipient of the advice rest d,agency,com.the absence of a representative capacity,however,does not necessarily excuse such a provider from any duty of loyalty an adviser may be subject to a fiduciary duty of loyalty even when the adviser is not acting as an agent.ibid.
moreover employees are deemed agents for present purposes even if they are employed in a wholly capacity.rest d,agency,com.c,pp.the common law of agency encompasses the employment relation,even as to employees whom an employer has not designated to contract on its behalf or otherwise to interact with parties external to the employer organization.thus an employee,while employed,owes undivided loyalty to his employer.fowler varian associates,d.while california law does permit an employee to seek other employment and even to make some preparations to compete before resigning citation,california law does not authorize an employee to transfer his loyalty to a competitor.ibid.the duty of loyalty is breached,and the breac
