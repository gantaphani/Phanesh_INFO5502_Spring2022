prior to trial,defendants served upon ua an offer of judgment pursuant to rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,which authorizes a defendant to make an offer of judgment for the money specified in the offer,with costs then accrued.defendants offer provided

ua appeals.the interpretation of rule is a legal question that we decide de novo.see jordan time,cir.
discussion 
the question presented in this appeal is simply whether,having accepted defendants rule offer,ua may recover its attorneys fees in addition to the judgment award.rule provides 
at any time more than days before the trial begins,a party defending against a claim may serve upon the adverse party an offer to allow judgment to be taken against the defending party for the money or property or to the effect specified in the offer,with costs then accrued.if within days after the service of the offer the adverse party serves written notice that the offer is accepted,either party may then file the offer and notice of acceptance together with proof of service thereof and thereupon the clerk shall enter judgment.an offer not accepted shall be deemed withdrawn and evidence thereof is not admissible except in a proceeding to determine costs.if the judgment finally obtained by the offeree is not more favorable than the offer,the offeree must pay the costs incurred after the making of the offer.
as the supreme court has explained,the plain purpose of rule is to encourage settlement and avoid litigation.marek estate of chesny,d.the rule accomplishes this objective with a approach.first,rule allows a defendant to make a firm,offer of judgment.unlike traditional settlement negotiations,in which a plaintiff may seek clarification or make a counteroffer,a plaintiff faced with a rule offer may only accept or refuse.if he accepts,the court automatically enters judgment in his favor if he refuses,the case proceeds.second,the rule encourages plaintiffs to accept reasonable offers through what is referred to as its provision,which forces a plaintiff who refuses an offer and then ultimately recovers less at trial than the offer amount to pay the costs incurred from the time of the offer.thereby,t he rule prompts both parties to a suit to evaluate the risks and costs of litigation,and to balance them against the likelihood of success upon trial on the merits.id.
the sole constraint rule places on offers of judgment is its mandate that an offer include costs then accrued.this does not mean that every offer must explicitly state that it includes costs if an offer recites that costs are included or specifies an amount for costs,and the plaintiff accepts the offer,the judgment will necessarily include costs if the offer does not state that costs are included and an amount for costs is not specified,the court will be obliged by the terms of the rule to include in its judgment an additional amount which is in its discretion.marek at.thus,as long as an offer does not explicitly exclude costs,it is proper under the rule.
rule does not define the meaning of the term costs,however,and consequently parties frequently dispute whether attorneys fees are included.in marek,the supreme court considered one such dispute,addressing when attorneys fees might be included as costs for the purposes of rule provision.marek held that the term costs 
was intended to refer to all costs properly awardable under the relevant substantive statute or other authority.in other words,all costs properly awardable in an action are to be considered within the scope of rule costs.thus,absent congressional expressions to the contrary,where the underlying statute defines costs to include attorney fees,we are satisfied such fees are to be included as costs for purposes of rule.
marek at.the marek plaintiff prevailed in a suit under,but recovered an amount less than the defendant prior rule offer.although attorneys fees are generally not recoverable as costs under what is known as the american rule,the supreme court held that,because the relevant authority included attorneys fees as part of the costs available to a prevailing plaintiff,those fees were subject to the provision of rule,and the defendant was therefore not responsible for them 
in arencibia miami shoes,cir,this court was asked whether the marek rationale also applies when a plaintiff has accepted a rule offer for a judgment sum,but where the offer does not mention costs or attorneys fees in deciding that question,this court first explained that under marek,when a rule offer is silent regarding the amount of costs,the district court must award an appropriate amount for costs in addition to the specified sum.this authority to award costs,we explained,arises from the phrase with costs then accrued in rule.arencibia at citing marek at.we then held that the marek rationale interpreting the provision of the rule applies equally to the phrase costs then accrued applicable to an accepted rule offer.we explained that although the district court had properly retained jurisdiction to award costs,it could not include an award of attorneys fees,because costs awarded by virtue of rule only include attorney fees if the underlying statute defines costs to include attorney fees.id.emphasis added 
the only issue before this court in arencibia was whether the district court could grant attorneys fees as costs by virtue of rule.as did arencibia,the present case deals with an accepted offer,and thus does not involve the provision of rule that was at issue in marek.but this case presents another variation on the rule theme.the question here is not only whether attorneys fees may be included as rule costs then accrued,but also whether a plaintiff may recover fees authorized by statute or contract when the offer of judgment is silent or ambiguous as to whether such fees have been included in the offer of judgment or whether the plaintiff has otherwise waived the right to seek them.this issue has been addressed by the seventh and the ninth circuits.
in webb james,cir,a plaintiff suing under the americans with disabilities act ada accepted a rule offer of judgment that stated only the defendants hereby make an offer of judgment in the matter in the amount of fifty thousand dollars pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure.id.at.the ada allows the prevailing party to recover attorneys fees,but does not define those attorneys fees as part of the costs.thus,as this court did in arencibia,the webb court explained that under marek,the plaintiffs could not recover fees as costs then accrued under rule because the underlying statute did not define attorneys fees as costs.the webb court,however,went on to address the issue not discussed in arencibia whether the plaintiff could recover attorneys fees directly under the statute,the ada.the seventh circuit answered in the affirmative,explaining that,because the ada provides for an award of attorney fees to a prevailing party,and because the court determined that the plaintiff had prevailed in his ada claim,therefore he could recover attorneys fees under the ada.
the ninth circuit addressed a similar question in nusom comh woodburn,cir.nusom concerned an accepted offer of,together with costs accrued to the date of this offer.thus,like the offer at issue here,the nusom offer included specific mention of costs but did not mention attorneys fees.both underlying statutes under which the plaintiff brought suit the truth in lending act tila and oregon civil racketeering statute provide for an award of attorneys fees to the prevailing party,separate from costs.nusom held that,as the prevailing party,the plaintiff was entitled to attorneys fees under the relevant statutes.
in both webb and nusom,the defendants claimed that attorneys fees were included in the judgment sums,and thus to award them pursuant to the statute would effectively be to grant the plaintiffs double recovery.in webb,the defendant dick james argued that webb attorneys fees had been included in the sum.the seventh circuit rejected this assertion,explaining that 
defendants should bear the burden of the ambiguity created by their silence on fees.the ada provides for attorneys fees for the prevailing party and the defendants said nothing in their offer to terminate that statutory liability the defendant is always free to offer a lump sum in settlement of liability,costs and fees,but that is not what dick james did here.dick james offer was silent as to fees and costs,and under these circumstances,the court may then award an additional amount to cover costs and fees.
id.at.the nusom court likewise addressed the assertion by examining the specific language in the offer of judgment,and reached a similar conclusion that the offer silence regarding attorneys fees created ambiguity with respect to whether the sum included attorneys fees.nusom held that such ambiguity in the terms of an offer must be resolved against the drafter,and therefore the accepting party was not barred from seeking attorneys fees.id.at.among other things,both webb and nusom therefore stand for the proposition that where an offer is ambiguous with respect to whether it includes fees,that ambiguity will be construed against the drafter.
an offer that does unambiguously include attorneys fees,on the other hand,will bar the plaintiff who accepts it from seeking additional attorneys fees under the relevant statute or as costs then accrued.for example,in nordby anchor hocking packaging,cir,the plaintiff sued under the illinois sales representative act,which expressly provides for an award of reasonable attorneys fees to a plaintiff whose rights under the act have been violated.id.at.accordingly,the plaintiff complaint requested attorneys fees in addition to damages.before going to trial,the plaintiff accepted a rule offer for judgment in the amount of plus in costs as one total sum as to all counts of the amended complaint emphasis supplied,and then moved the district court for an award of attorneys fees pursuant to the illinois act.id.nordby held that the plaintiff could not obtain fees because the accepted offer had unambiguously included attorneys fees.
these cases show that in the appropriate circumstances a plaintiff may be entitled to attorneys fees under the costs then accrued phrase from rule itself,and,independently,under the statute or other authority that gave rise to the suit.in this case,ua claims both of these bases for recovery.thus,the questions presented are first,whether the accepted sum unambiguously included attorneys fees or whether the offeree otherwise waived the right to seek them second,whether fees are available in this case as costs accrued under rule and third,whether fees are otherwise available pursuant to any other relevant authority.
were attorney fees included in the offer or otherwise waived by ua 
defendants contend that the judgment amount included ua attorneys fees.in assessing this claim,we first note that the offer says nothing one way or the other about fees attorneys fees are not mentioned at all.moreover,unlike the offer in nordby,the offer here does not contain any language suggesting the inclusiveness of all sums due.nor does the offer contain language excluding the payment for any claim.it simply offers an amount with costs.so as the left to speculate whether the offer was intended to include attorneys fees or not.
as discussed above,however,rule requires that the responsibility for clarity and precision in the offer must reside with the offeror.as nusom explained,any ambiguity in the terms of an offer must be resolved against its drafter,and therefore,absent a clear indication to the contrary the accepting party can not be deemed to have received its fees or waived the right to seek them.nusom at.there is good reason for this stricture 
because rule puts plaintiffs at their peril whether or not they accept the offer,the defendant must make clear whether or not the offer is inclusive of fees as with costs,the plaintiff should not be left in the position of guessing what a court will later hold the offer means.
webb at.indeed,rule places the offerree in a most unusual posture in the landscape of settlement contracts.while an offeree can respond to an ordinary settlement offer through a counteroffer or seek to clarify or modify its terms,a rule offeree is at the mercy of the offeror choice of language and willingness to conform it to the understanding of both parties.only the offeror can ensure that the offer clearly includes or excludes fees.
here,there is nothing in the language of defendants bare offer of with costs accrued to indicate that the sum includes fees or that accepting the offer otherwise waives ua ability to recover them under rule or any other authority.thus,this ambiguity must be construed against defendants,and we conclude that the offer they made to ua did not include attorneys fees.consequently,we next turn to the question of whether ua is entitled to fees either as costs pursuant to rule or as attorneys fees pursuant to any other relevant authority.
attorneys fees as costs pursuant to rule 
in arencibia,we explained that a plaintiff who accepts a rule offer may recover attorneys fees as costs then accrued if the relevant substantive statute or other authority defines costs to include attorneys fees.arencibia at.it is clear to us that the relevant statute in this case does not define attorneys fees as costs.the alabama trade secrets act authorizes the recovery of attorneys fees when a party bringing a claim under the act proves willful and malicious misappropriation of a trade secret.however,there is no language in the trade secrets act to indicate that attorneys fees should be considered part of costs.in contrast,where courts have found that attorneys fees were defined as costs,it was because the statute stated so clearly.for example,marek explained that attorneys fees are costs under section of the communications act of because under that act i f the petitioner shall finally prevail,he shall be allowed a reasonable attorney fee,to be taxed and collected as a part of the costs of the suit,and similarly under the railway labor act,because that statute allowed a court to award to the prevailing party a reasonable attorney fee as part of the costs.at.emphasis added.similarly,in jordan time,cir,we found that attorneys fees are costs under because that statute states that a court may award a reasonable attorney fee to the prevailing party as part of the costs.
unlike those examples,the trade secrets act does not award attorneys fees to the prevailing party as part of costs rather,it makes attorneys fees an additional penalty for willful misappropriation.thus,it does not satisfy the marek rule.see also oates oates,cir holding that attorneys fees are not costs where the statute speaks of costs in the context of damages,and explaining that i n the absence of unambiguous statutory language defining attorney fees as an additional component of costs,and a clear expression by congress of an intent to carve out an exception to the american rule attorney fees are not costs for purposes of rule.
alternatively,ua argues that it is entitled to fees as rule costs accrued if its contract with chelco defines fees as costs.in marek,the supreme court held that the term costs in rule was intended to refer to all costs properly awardable under the relevant substantive statute or other authority.marek at.emphasis supplied.we agree with ua that this reference to other authority means that rule costs can be awarded if a contract under which a plaintiff brings suit defines attorneys fees as costs.see also kessler superior care,suggesting that marek reference to other authority might refer to underlying contracts.in this case,however,we can not agree that the contract does in fact clearly and unambiguously define costs as fees.
the three relevant contract provisions are as follows 
it is further agreed that disclosure of such proprietary information,whether directly or indirectly,of ua,except with the express written consent of ua,would be deemed material and would result in material and irreparable injury to ua not properly or completely compensable by damages in an action at law and that the provisions of this agreement are necessary for the protection of ua and that any breach of this agreement by chelco services or any of chelco services representatives shall entitle ua,in addition to other legal remedies available to apply to a court of competent jurisdiction to enjoin any violation of this agreement to recover damages for any breach of this agreement,and to recover all costs of such action,including a reasonable attorneys fee.
it is hereby agreed by the parties hereto that any breach of this provision shall entitle the party,in addition to any other legal remedies available to apply to a court of competent jurisdiction to enjoin any violation of this agreement to recover damages for any breach of this agreement,and to recover all costs of such action,including a reasonable attorneys fee.
legal fees.in the event either party incurs legal expenses to enforce or interpret any provision of this agreement,the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover such legal expenses,including,without limitation,reasonable attorney fees,court costs and all related expenses,in addition to any additional and other relief to which such party shall be entitled.
emphasis supplied.
provisions and clearly define costs to include attorneys fees.provision enables ua to seek legal and equitable remedies for disclosure of its proprietary information,and to recover all costs of such action,including a reasonable attorneys fee.likewise,provision allows a party to sue a breaching party for legal and equitable relief,and also to recover all costs of such action,including a reasonable attorneys fee.the most straightforward interpretation of the phrase costs including a reasonable attorneys fee is that the contracting parties consider attorneys fees to be part of costs.see,marek at.explaining that section of the clayton act,makes attorneys fees part of costs because it provides for recovery of the cost of suit,including a reasonable attorney fee.
however,as defendants point out,provision of the contract appears to suggest that legal fees are distinct from costs by subsuming certain delineated costs under the rubric of legal fees,among which are attorneys fees the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover such legal expenses,including,without limitation,reasonable attorney fees,court costs and all related expenses,in addition to any additional and other relief to which such party shall be entitled.defendants argue that the ambiguity created by provision trumps whatever clear expression is found in provisions and,and that we must therefore conclude that the parties did not intend to treat attorneys fees as costs.
we think defendants have the better of this argument,primarily because the american rule establishes a strong presumption that fees are not to be awarded as costs.in light of that presumption,we interpret marek to require that the underlying authority unequivocally indicate that it is carving out an exception to the american rule.provision of the contract differentiates between fees and other costs thus we are unwilling to say that the contract as a whole makes fees part of costs.accordingly,ua is not entitled to fees as rule costs accrued.
attorneys fees pursuant to statute or other relevant authority 
we next consider whether ua is entitled to attorneys fees directly under the trade secrets act or the contract.as noted above,although not as part of costs,the alabama trade secrets act does authorize the recovery of attorneys fees upon proof of the willful and malicious misappropriation of a trade secret.ua asks us to construe the offer of judgment as an admission of willful and malicious misappropriation.we do not find this to be a tenable proposition.such a finding is vastly different from the simple conclusion that one party has prevailed against another,and we are unwilling to impute a specific admission to willful and malicious misappropriation on the basis that the defendants have had a judgment entered against them when there is nothing in defendants offer of judgment that would even suggest that admission.
we do,however,find that ua is entitled to attorneys fees under its contract with chelco.clause of the contract states 
legal fees.in the event either party incurs legal expenses to enforce or interpret any provision of this agreement,the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover such legal expenses,including,without limitation,reasonable attorney fees,court costs and all related expenses,in addition to any additional and other relief to which such party shall be entitled.
thus,the contract grants attorneys fees to the prevailing party in any action to enforce or interpret any provision of this agreement.ua brought this suit,at least in part,to enforce provisions of the contract,and we think the judgment in this case is sufficient to establish that ua has prevailed in its suit.our conclusion derives from the supreme court guidance in buckhannon bd.care home,virginia dep of health and human,d.
prior to buckhannon,courts attempted to determine whether a party was a prevailing party for the purpose of recovering attorneys fees primarily by weighing the relief obtained against the relief sought.see,fletcher city of fort wayne,cir a plaintiff who recovers only nominal damages technically prevails,but a judge has discretion to withhold fees when damages are tiny in relation to the claim in other words,for trivial recoveries the only reasonable award of fees is zero.in buckhannon,however,the supreme court defined a prevailing party as a party in whose favor a judgment is rendered,regardless of the amount of damages awarded.at.quoting black law dictionary ed.in holding that a plaintiff was not entitled to an award of attorneys fees when the lawsuit had been dismissed as moot,even though it appeared that the suit had induced the legislation that rendered the action moot,the court explained that a material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties is necessary to permit the award.id.at.quoting texas state teachers ass garland indep.sch,d.the court gave two examples of judicial outcomes that satisfy this requirement an enforceable judgment on the merits or a settlement agreement enforced through a consent decree.id.an enforceable judgment establishes a pla
