the trial court erred in awarding attorney fees under a provision of the uniform trade secrets act,which authorizes an award of fees if a claim of misappropriation of trade secrets is made in bad faith.the plaintiff complaint asserted a claim for unjust enrichment based on the alleged misappropriation of its patents and trademarks,and erroneously requested damages under the uniform trade secrets act.however,the complaint can not be read as alleging a claim for misappropriation of trade secrets.the court also erred in concluding that attorney fees were recoverable under the indemnification clause of a licensing agreement.accordingly,the order awarding attorney fees is reversed.
factual and procedural background 
on february,cytodyn of new mexico,cytodyn filed a lawsuit naming as defendants amerimmune pharmaceuticals,and several of its officers or directors,including pamela kapustay,kimberly cerrone,parrish,and michael davis officers and directors.amerimmune pharmaceuticals was dismissed from the case a few months later,after it filed a bankruptcy petition.in december,an amendment to the complaint was filed adding maya llc as a doe defendant.on march,cytodyn,filed a first amended complaint,alleging cytodyn of new mexico had assigned all of its assets and liabilities to cytodyn,so that the latter was the plaintiff in the lawsuit.
the operative first amended complaint complaint alleged as follows.allen allen,cytodyn president and chief executive officer,is the inventor of a class of monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of hiv disease,and is the owner of a portfolio of and foreign patents on his invention.in,cytodyn obtained a registered trademark on the brand name cytolin,referring to the antibodies used to improve immune function in persons infected with hiv,as reflected in allen patents.cytodyn spent two years and almost to develop and test materials and methods for manufacturing cytolin.in august,allen and cytodyn entered into an agreement with three r associates,termination,sale and shareholder agreement,under which allen transferred his rights and interest in the technology to three technology was the term used to refer collectively to allen patents patent rights products embodying or using any part of the patents,patent rights or and trade secrets.trade secrets was in turn defined as all documents and information that have been originated by,are peculiarly within the knowledge of or are proprietary to allen using a reverse triangular merger,three r formed amerimmune,a publicly traded company,and purchased the technology and patent licensing rights from cytodyn in return for stock in amerimmune.three r licensed the patents and technology to amerimmune under a patent and trademark license agreement,and amerimmune assumed the obligation to pay allen for the patent portfolio.disputes arose,which three r settled by assigning all of its rights back to cytodyn,so that cytodyn again became the licensor under the patent and trademark license agreement.cytodyn and allen entered into a conditional licensing agreement cla with amerimmune under which cytodyn licensed its trademarks marks and technology to amerimmune on substantially the same basis as the earlier patent and trademark license agreement 
disputes arose,the details of which are unnecessary to outline,with cytodyn claiming that amerimmune materially breached the cla,allegedly entitling cytodyn to terminate the agreement and requiring amerimmune to transfer to cytodyn and allen all rights to the technology and marks.cytodyn filed this lawsuit seeking an injunction and declaratory judgment requiring the technology to be returned to cytodyn and allen.shortly thereafter,defendant parrish signed,on behalf of amerimmune,a promissory note to defendant maya llc which the complaint alleged was an alter ego of the ceo of amerimmune,giving maya llc a security interest in all of amerimmune assets.amerimmune then filed bankruptcy its note to maya llc became due and payable and maya llc foreclosed its security interest and claimed ownership of all amerimmune assets,including cytodyn technology.amerimmune bankruptcy case was dismissed the defendant officers and directors resigned and amerimmune ceased operations.
cytodyn complaint asserted a cause of action for inducement of breach of contract against the officers and directors,and three other causes of business competition,fraud,and unjust maya llc and the officers and directors collectively,the defendants.in substance,cytodyn alleged the officers and directors induced amerimmune to materially breach the cla in numerous respects the defendants allowed the ceo alter ego,maya llc,to foreclose on its security interest,fraudulently claiming ownership in the patents and marks and the defendants engaged in fraud in numerous respects,including assigning maya llc ownership of amerimmune assets,including cytodyn technology which under the terms of the cla had already reverted to cytodyn 
in its cause of action for unjust enrichment,cytodyn alleged,in addition,that maya llc fraudulently misappropriated marks and patents and related technology without any consideration to cytodyn.cytodyn alleged that the fraudulent misconduct committed or ratified by the officers and directors rendered amerimmune stock worthless,depriving cytodyn of any consideration for the technology it had licensed to amerimmune and also result ing in a misappropriation of the technology.further,b ecause the misappropriation was willful and malicious,in accordance with civ.c,cytodyn seeks exemplary damages against defendants in an amount up to twice the amount of out of pocket losses of according to the discretion of the court.
in its prayer for relief,cytodyn sought a judgment declaring,among other things,that the officers and directors induced amerimmune to unjustly enrich itself in misappropriating cytodyn technology by failing to pay the fees and to do the other things necessary to maintain the patents and marks cytodyn sought an injunction ordering the defendants to return the license and related technology to cytodyn,and sought out of pocket damages of punitive damages on the fraud claim and,as to the unjust enrichment cause of action,p ursuant to civ.c,exemplary damages against defendants in an amount up to twice the amount of out of pocket losses of.cytodyn did not seek attorney fees in its prayer for relief.
the defendants filed a motion to strike cytodyn complaint,or alternatively enumerated paragraphs in it,on multiple grounds.while the motion to strike is for the most part irrelevant to this appeal,it included as its eighth point a claim that the facts alleged in cytodyn complaint did not support a claim of misappropriation of trade secrets,so that cytodyn claim for damages under civil code section should be stricken.the trial court granted that portion of defendants motion on june.
cytodyn causes of action for unfair business competition,inducement of breach of contract and fraud were disposed of in july,when the trial court sustained the defendants demurrers to those causes of action without leave to amend.the defendants sought summary judgment on the unjust enrichment claim,which the trial court granted on november.the court observed cytodyn submitted an opposition separate statement with no citations to any admissible evidence submitted an improper request for judicial notice and otherwise made no attempt to submit evidence to support its contentions.citing the defendants evidence,the court concluded none of the defendants received any benefit at the expense of cytodyn.
defendants then sought attorney fees of.they asserted a statutory right to recover attorney fees under the uniform trade secrets act,civil code section,which permits an award of reasonable attorney fees and costs if a claim of misappropriation of trade secrets is made in bad faith in the alternative,the defendants asserted they were entitled to recover attorney fees under the cla,as well as under the patent and trademark license agreement and several other agreements.
the trial court granted the motion for fees,finding fees were properly awarded to defendants under section.the court based its conclusion on t he numerous references to misappropriation of technology in the various complaints,which were supported by cytodyn discovery responses in the documents and deposition testimony.the claims were certainly asserted,and it is clear now that there was no evidence to support them.the court found that the allegations of misappropriation were brought in bad faith and that apportionment of the fees was unnecessary,since allegations relating to trade secret misappropriation were at the heart of most of cytodyn theories and allegations.the court stated that fees were also recoverable under the provisions of the cla,at the very least,and the court does not reach the applicability of the other contracts,but notes that cytodyn did allege that numerous other contracts were binding on these defendants,and many of the other contracts contained broad attorney fee provisions which would encompass all these fees.
an order was entered granting fees in the amount of,plus for disbursements not awarded as costs,for a total award of.cytodyn filed this timely appeal of the order.
after oral argument,this court on its own motion ordered the defendants to augment the appellate record with specified documents from the trial court record,as well as with any other document filed in the trial court proceeding reflecting the litigation of trade secrets issues before the trial court.the defendants submitted three volumes of documents,together with a memorandum.the court permitted cytodyn to file a letter brief addressing the defendants memorandum and the significance of the documents in the augmented record.cytodyn did so,and also moved to augment the appellate record with a copy of the trial court minute order of june.in the june minute order,the trial court,among many other things,granted the defendants motion to strike the paragraph of cytodyn complaint seeking exemplary damages under the uniform trade secrets act.the defendants filed an opposition to cytodyn motion to augment the record with the court minute order.we granted cytodyn motion.in addition,after notifying the parties and permitting letter briefs,we took judicial notice,on our own motion,of the defendants answer to cytodyn complaint 
discussion 
we conclude the trial court erred in awarding attorney fees under the uniform trade secrets act utsa,and likewise erred in concluding that defendants could recover fees under the cla or any other of the contracts mentioned in the complaint.we discuss first the statutory claim for fees and then turn to the contract claims.
we begin with a brief description of the statute.the utsa,codified in sections through,authorizes a court to enjoin the actual or threatened misappropriation of trade secrets.the statute allows a complainant to recover damages for the actual loss caused by a misappropriation,and to recover for the unjust enrichment caused by the misappropriation.if willful and malicious misappropriation of trade secrets exists,the court may award exemplary damages of double the amount of the damage award,subds.a c.the utsa also has provisions governing preservation of the secrecy of an alleged trade secret in the judicial proceeding,privileged communications,and other matters.it provides for an award of attorney fees i f a claim of misappropriation is made in bad faith,a motion to terminate an injunction is made or resisted in bad faith,or willful and malicious misappropriation exists.misappropriation is defined as either the acquisition of a trade secret of another by a person who has reason to know the trade secret was acquired by improper means,or the disclosure or use of a trade secret without consent by a person under various circumstances involving its acquisition by improper means or in some circumstances,accident or mistake,subd.b.improper means includes theft,bribery,misrepresentation,breach or inducement of a breach of a duty to maintain secrecy,or espionage through electronic or other means,subd.a.
as is obvious from the statute,the misappropriation for which a complainant may obtain relief is solely confined to the misappropriation of a trade secret,and likewise the attorney fees a prevailing party may obtain are for the malicious misappropriation of a trade secret,or for a claim of misappropriation of a trade secret made in bad faith.a trade secret is defined in the statute as information that d erives independent economic value from not being generally known to the public or to other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use and i s the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy,subds.d.
in this case,cytodyn complaint did not state a claim for misappropriation of a trade secret.this is so under the most liberal reading of the complaint.see duncan stuetzle cir,fn.california courts would liberally construe the allegations in a complaint and attempt to determine if the factual allegations were sufficient to state a claim under the utsa.under the utsa,a prima facie claim for misappropriation of trade secrets requires the plaintiff to demonstrate the plaintiff owned a trade secret,the defendant acquired,disclosed,or used the plaintiff trade secret through improper means,and the defendant actions damaged the plaintiff.sargent fletcher,able th,d.it is impossible to construe the factual allegations of cytodyn complaint as sufficiently stating,or even as attempting to state,a claim for misappropriation of a trade secret under the utsa.indeed,the phrase trade secrets does not appear anywhere in the body of cytodyn complaint,except in an allegation describing the assertion of a trade secret privilege by the defendants.
we recognize that cytodyn complaint requested,in its prayer for relief,double damages under the utsa section.we are likewise aware that,in various responsive pleadings filed by cytodyn in opposition to defendants motion to strike the complaint,and in opposition to summary judgment,cytodyn supported its assertion that it was entitled to double damages under section by pointing out that the technology was defined in various agreements to include trade secrets the fact remains,however,that cytodyn did not allege,or even try to allege,a prima facie case for misappropriation of a trade secret.it is impossible to read cytodyn complaint without concluding that the sum and substance of its lawsuit was the alleged misappropriation of its patents and trademarks indeed,in their memorandum in support of their motion for attorney fees,the defendants themselves expressly state that the core theme of all of the causes of actions sic contained in cytodyn complaint was that defendants misappropriated cytodyn patents and marks.but patents and marks are not trade secrets,and the misappropriation of patents and marks is not a subject with which the utsa is concerned.see motorola,fairchild camera instrument,plaintiff trade secret claims must fail because no real effort was made by plaintiff prior to trial to keep them secret and they were also either revealed in the marketed product or fully disclosed by issued patents.consequently,we can not conclude that,simply because cytodyn complaint in bad exemplary damages under the utsa,cytodyn lawsuit constituted a claim for misappropriation of trade secrets.see also leonardini shell oil d.factual allegations of the complaint are controlling over the title or label given the pleading and over the prayer or demand for relief.
one further point is worth noting.in addition to defendants express acknowledgment that the core theme of cytodyn complaint was the misappropriation of its patents and marks,their answer to cytodyn complaint likewise suggests they did not believe cytodyn had actually asserted a claim for misappropriation of trade secrets.defendants answer expressly prayed for attorney fees under code of civil procedure section allows the court to impose an appropriate sanction on attorneys or parties who sign pleadings that are presented for an improper purpose,or are unwarranted by law or without evidentiary support.thus,while defendants clearly maintained cytodyn was proceeding in bad faith,it made no attempt to plead entitlement to fees under section for a bad faith claim of misappropriation of trade secrets 
finally,we do not disagree with the trial court observation that the cause of action for unjust enrichment contained several references to misappropriation of technology,or that technology was defined in various agreements to include trade secrets.nor do we disagree with the court conclusions that no evidence was presented to support cytodyn misappropriation claims,and that cytodyn conduct of the lawsuit under the totality of circumstances evinced bad faith.however,where statutory attorney fees are concerned,the trial court is constrained by the statute,as we are.the trial court award of fees was premised on an erroneous application of the statute,as well as on its conclusion that allegations relating to trade secret misappropriation were at the heart of most of cytodyn theories and allegations.the last conclusion is clearly erroneous and finds no support in the record.it may certainly be said that misappropriation of its patents and marks was at the heart of cytodyn lawsuit,but,as we have observed,patents and marks are not trade secrets 
in short,the utsa does not authorize an award of attorney fees when a claim of misappropriation of a patent or a trademark is made in bad faith the act applies only to trade secrets.consequently,because cytodyn complaint can not be read to allege a cause of action for misappropriation of trade secrets,we are compelled to conclude the trial court erred in awarding attorney fees under section.
b.the cla indemnification clause.
the trial court ruled in the alternative that the defendants were entitled to attorney fees under the provisions of the cla.this was error.the agreement between cytodyn and allen,on the one hand,and amerimmune,on the no attorney fees clause.the defendants rely on an indemnification clause,but on its face the indemnification clause does not apply to this lawsuit.cytodyn agreed to indemnify amerimmune and its officers and directors from any claims or lawsuits,including attorney fees,resulting from or arising out of two circumstances and a third circumstance not claimed to be relevant here 
any breach of the cla by allen or cytodyn and 
a ny claim that amerimmune exploitation of any rights in the technology and the marks herein licensed infringes or violates any patent,copyright,trademark or other right of any third party.emphasis added.
defendants claim they are entitled to attorney fees under both clauses,but they are plainly mistaken.this lawsuit involved no finding and no assertion,so far as the record reveals of any breach of the cla by cytodyn.defendants claim they are entitled to indemnification under the second circumstance because cytodyn agreed to indemnify them from any claim of infringement of any patent or trademark.but in their brief defendants use an ellipsis,omitting the critical words of the indemnification clause,which on its face applies only to claims of infringement of the patents of third parties.the defendant officers and directors are not entitled to attorney fees under the cla.
c.the attorney fees clauses of other agreements.
the defendants assert they are entitled to attorney fees under the attorney fees clauses of several other agreements.they are mistaken in each case.none of the defendants is a party to those agreements,and in two cases neither is cytodyn.the mere mention of an agreement in a complaint does not mean,as defendants seem to believe,that the lawsuit has been brought to enforce those agreements.moreover,even if defendants were parties to the agreements,the attorney fees clauses in most instances do not cover this lawsuit.thus 
the patent and trademark license agreement.this was an agreement between three r associates,and british lion medical,the predecessor of amerimmune,under which three r associates licensed the technology to amerimmune.after various disputes,three r rights reverted to cytodyn.cytodyn complaint alleged the defendant officers and directors induced amerimmune to breach the agreement in various ways,such as refusing inspection rights to allen.the defendants rely on clause f of the agreement.clause is the binding arbitration clause of the agreement,and requires all disputes relating to the agreement,including all tort and contract actions,to be resolved by binding arbitration,subject to the following limitations.in subclause f,the parties agree that neither of them will commence litigation against the other arising out of the agreement with respect to any arbitration proceeding or award,except in a court located in the state of california.subclause f continues 
if either party now cytodyn and amerimmune brings any action for judicial relief with respect to any dispute which is required to be arbitrated hereunder,the party bringing such action will be liable for and shall immediately pay all of the other party costs and expenses including reasonable attorneys fees incurred to stay or dismiss such action and remove or refer such dispute to arbitration.
the defendants are not entitled to attorney fees under the patent and trademark license agreement because neither the officers and directors nor maya llc are parties,and the attorney fee clause expressly applies only to attorney fees incurred to stay or dismiss an action for judicial relief required to be arbitrated and remove or refer such dispute to arbitration.nothing of the sort happened in this case.
the termination,sale and shareholder agreement and the august,consulting agreement.in its complaint,cytodyn alleged that the defendant officers and directors also induced amerimmune to breach the spirit,intent,and letter of the consulting agreement into which allen and three r entered on august,and which was referenced and incorporated into the termination,sale,and shareholder agreement dated august,which agreement was referenced in the cla and binding on defendants.the consulting agreement,cytodyn alleged,stated that allen was the best judge of how to develop new technologies for the benefit of three based on this allegation,the defendants claim they are entitled to attorney fees under the attorney fee clauses of both agreements.however,neither cytodyn nor the defendants are parties to the consulting agreement,under which three r associates engaged allen as a consultant the attorney fee clause of the termination,sale and shareholder agreement the parties to which were three r associates,allen and cytodyn provided that the unsuccessful party i n any action at law or in equity and in any arbitration proceeding to enforce any of the provisions or rights under this agreement was to pay attorney fees incurred by the successful party or parties.the clause does not apply because defendants are not parties to the agreement,and cytodyn did not sue to enforce any of its rights under the agreement.
finally,the defendants claim that,even if the various agreements could not be enforced against them,they are entitled to attorney fees under the reciprocity provisions of section,because cytodyn would have been entitled to recover attorney fees if it had prevailed this too is mistaken.cytodyn did not seek to enforce any of the agreements,and would not have been entitled to fees under those agreements even if it had,because the defendants were not parties.the rule under section is that a prevailing party is entitled to attorney fees only if it can prove it would have been liable for attorney fees had the opponent prevailed.perez,base camp condominiums.no.one,supra,th at,d.the defendants have not and can not make such a showing.
disposition 
the order awarding attorney fees is reversed.cytodyn is entitled to recover its costs on appeal.
