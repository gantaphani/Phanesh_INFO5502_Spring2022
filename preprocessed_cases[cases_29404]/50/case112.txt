the patent issued on october,to robert hagemeister,steven ogle,and thomas wells.the inventors assigned the patent to l p.the patent claims a stackable bedding foundation,often known as a box spring assembly.the patent background of the invention explains that prior art box spring assemblies are bulky and costly to ship to the manufacturer for application of padding and covering.to reduce the shipping space requirements for bulky box spring assemblies,it is customary to compress the assemblies to reduce their individual thicknesses and,when compressed,to tie them in their compressed state.patent,ll.the invention addresses these problems.the patent claims a box spring that is nestably stackable.in other words,the claimed box springs stack within other box spring assemblies for transportation without having to compress and tie the assembly.id.at,ll.
hickory accused product is known as the powerstack.whether the accused product infringes the patent literally or under the doctrine of equivalents turns upon one limitation in the claims.claims and of the patent are at issue.claim reads 
a nestably stackable assembly for use in a bedding foundation comprising 
a rectangular border wire having two parallel sides and two parallel ends,
parallel,and support wires parallel to said border wire sides and having ends connected to said border wire ends,said support wires being formed so as to be generally corrugated along their lengths,said corrugatedly formed support wires having peaks and valleys,said peaks being flattened at their tops,said flattened peaks being generally coplanar with a plane defined by said border wire,said valleys being vertically displaced beneath and intermediate of said flattened peaks,and 
parallel,and upper connector wires parallel to said border wire ends and having ends connected to said border wire sides,said upper connector wires being connected intermediate of their ends along their lengths to said flattened peaks of said support wires.

on april,l p filed an action in the district court,alleging that hickory box spring assembly,powerstack,infringed l p patent.l p also charged hickory with patent infringement under b inducing third parties to infringe,tortious interference with contract,and misappropriation of trade secrets.on august and,the district court held a markman hearing to construe the meaning of the disputed claim term support wires.in its september,opinion,the court determined that support wires require that the wire be a continuous strand of wire which may be formed by,end to end,shorter segments of wire.leggett platt,hickory springs,wl,at.citations omitted.after granting l p motion to reconsider,the court decided to clarify the definition to include welds other than and explained that a support wire,regardless of how many original pieces it had prior to welding,if welded at all,must have only two ends.leggett platt,d at citations omitted.
the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment,with hickory asking for summary judgment on all four counts and l p seeking partial summary judgment only on the tortious interference and trade secret counts.the district court granted hickory motion for summary judgment,and denied l p motion for partial summary judgment.l p appeals the summary judgment of and no misappropriation of trade secrets.this court has jurisdiction under a.

an infringement analysis requires the trial court to determine the meaning and scope of the asserted patent claims.markman westview instruments,en banc,aff,d.as a general rule,terms in a patent claim receive their plain,ordinary,and accepted meaning within the community of those of ordinary skill in the relevant art.toro white consol.a heavy presumption favors this accepted meaning.johnson worldwide,zebco.to discern accepted meaning,however,the construing court consults the specification and relevant prosecution history to provide context for understanding the meaning of the terms to one of skill in the art at the time of invention.pitney bowes.in consulting the specification,however,the interpretative process may not import limitations from the specification into the defining language of the claims.intervet.
in the present case,l p contends that the term support wires includes an assembly of separate wires welded together.in sum,l p argues that support wires are merely the wires that absorb any vertical load on the bedding foundation.because the invention depicts welds joining the wires to support a vertical load,l p proposed claim construction would consider the entire assembly a single wire.
at the outset,the claim recites support wires in the plural,thus requiring more than one welded support wire.the specification does not set forth any definition of the term support wires.instead the specification describes support wires in language that tracks closely the claim language.patent,ll.the specification does,however,refer to a number of other example,a border wire and connector wires.thus,the specification distinguishes support wires from other types of wire.the specification identifies these separate wires as performing different functions,such as connecting or forming a border.when discussing welds to join separate wires,the specification retains the distinguishing name and identity of each joined wire.see,patent,ll.finally,the specification expressly refers to support wire ends,which attach to the border wire.patent,ll.because the figures depict the support wires stretching from one border to the other,the specification suggests that the support wire ends attach only to the borders.the specification does not mention any support wire ends other than those attached to the border wire.thus the specification does not discuss a support wire composed of multiple wires welded together and,consequently,having a number of ends.
turning to the prosecution history,the patent application issued without any amendments.stating the reasons for allowance,the examiner detected three main differences between the invention and the three prior art references.none of these differences addresses support wires made of two or more wires welded together.in sum,the district court correctly construed the term support wires to mean a continuous strand of wire with only two ends.
after claim construction,an infringement analysis compares the properly construed claim with the allegedly infringing devices.markman,at.to prove literal infringement,the patentee must show that the accused device contains every limitation in the asserted claims.group lagard.
in this case,the claims require the support wires to be,inter alia,generally corrugated along their
