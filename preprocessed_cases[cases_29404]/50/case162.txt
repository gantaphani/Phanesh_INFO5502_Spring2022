general principles governing personal jurisdiction 
pursuant to code of civil procedure section,california statute,a court of this state may exercise jurisdiction on any basis not inconsistent with the constitution of this state or of the united states.the statute manifests an intent to exercise the broadest possible jurisdiction,limited only by constitutional considerations of due process.sibley superior court cal d,vons companies,seabest foods,cal th,d.the general rule is that a state may exercise personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant if the defendant has such minimum contacts with the state that the assertion of jurisdiction does not violate traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.vons companies,seabest foods,supra,cal th at,d,quoting internat.shoe washington.stated another way,the forum state may not exercise jurisdiction over a nonresident unless his or her relationship to the state is such as to make the exercise of such jurisdiction reasonable.cornelison chaney cal d.as these tests suggest,the question of jurisdiction can not be answered by the application of precise formulas or mechanical rules.each case must be decided on its own facts.id.at.
personal jurisdiction may be either general or specific.helicopteros nacionales de columbia,hall,d vons companies,seabest foods,supra,cal th at,d.general jurisdiction may lie for all purposes if a defendant has established a presence in the forum state by virtue of activities in the state which are extensive or buckeye boiler superior court cal d,or substantial continuous and systematic.cornelison chaney,supra,cal d at.in such a case a defendant contacts take the place of physical presence in the forum as a basis for jurisdiction.vons companies,seabest foods,supra,cal th at,d.
if a nonresident defendant activities in the state are not sufficient to allow the forum state to exercise general jurisdiction for all purposes,the state may nonetheless exercise specific jurisdiction if the defendant has purposefully availed himself or herself of forum benefits burger king rudzewicz,d and the controversy is related to or arises out of a defendant contacts with the forum.helicopteros nacionales de columbia hall,supra,at.vons companies,seabest foods,supra,cal th at,d.once a court decides that a defendant has purposefully established contacts with the forum state and that plaintiff cause of action arose out of those contacts,the final step in the analysis involves balancing the convenience of the parties and the interests of the state in order to determine whether the exercise of personal jurisdiction is fair and reasonable under all of the circumstances.burger king rudzewicz,supra,at.vons companies,seabest foods,supra,cal th at,d.
standard of review 
even though a motion to quash service of summons is defendant motion,the initial burden of proof is on the plaintiff to show the minimum contacts justifying the imposition of personal jurisdiction.vons companies,seabest foods,supra,cal th at,d.once the facts showing minimum contacts with the forum state are established,however,it becomes the defendant burden to demonstrate that the exercise of personal jurisdiction would be unreasonable.vons companies,seabest foods,supra,cal th at,d,burger king rudzewicz,supra,at.
integral contends there is no dispute here regarding the facts material to the question of jurisdiction and therefore that this is a purely legal issue which we review de novo.walter superior court d.weissenbach argues,on the other hand,that we must apply the substantial evidence standard on review.under this standard we accept the trial court resolution of factual disputes and indulge in all reasonable inferences in support of the trial court order.gleaves waters d.our review of the record reveals that the facts were largely undisputed.however,the parties contested each other characterization of the facts and the legal conclusion to be drawn from those facts.see,life assurance guarantee of north america d.the existence of personal jurisdiction will often present a mixed question of law and fact.paccar,commercial bank of kuwait,fn.to the extent that there are factual conflicts,the trial court resolves those disputes and the substantial evidence standard governs our review.thomas palmer,turkiye is bankasi d.the ultimate question whether jurisdiction is fair and reasonable under all of the circumstances,based on the facts which are undisputed and those resolved by the court in favor of the prevailing party,is a legal determination warranting our independent review.vons companies,seabest foods,supra,cal th at,d,felix bomoro kommanditgesellschaft d.
minimum contacts 
the question whether there are minimum contacts necessary to support personal jurisdiction for purposes of a specific lawsuit involves an evaluation of the interrelationship of the defendant conduct,the forum and the claim.sahlein music nippon gakki,d.this inquiry lends itself to a analysis first,has defendant purposefully directed his or her activities at forum residents or purposefully derived benefit from forum activities and second,does the controversy arise from defendant contacts with the forum where there is such purposeful conduct by which defendant avails himself or herself of the privilege of conducting activities with the forum state,and such conduct results in a lawsuit,defendant must reasonably expect to submit to the burdens of litigation in the forum state.vons companies,seabest foods,supra,cal th at,d,burger king rudzewicz,supra,at.
as noted above,although the basic facts here are not in dispute,the parties differ in the emphasis they place on certain facts and in their interpretation of the undisputed facts.weissenbach emphasizes that he was employed by a german company,and that he was hired to manage business operations in germany.the general manager contract was signed in germany.he did not approach seeking employment.rather he was recruited in europe by officers of,who were also officers of the european company,the recruitment and initial interviews took place in europe.weissenbach came to california only twice,both times at the request of and for purposes relating to his position as manager of the german office.he had no job duties in california,conducted no business in california and had no customers in california.his job responsibilities related only to the performance of the company in germany.he was paid by in deutschmarks.was the entity that formally terminated his employment.and repudiated any employment relationship with weissenbach in patel letter to him of may,which informed him that no relationship exists between you and the company.weissenbach contends these facts do not support a finding that he purposefully established contacts with california or availed himself of the benefits and protections of california law.vons companies,seabest foods,supra,cal th at,d.
integral,on the other hand,stresses the following facts.was a subsidiary of,which in turn was owned entirely by.was the sole shareholder of.officers of were also officers of and.thus was a separate entity from in name only.as integral controller explained,was formed as a subsidiary of in order to permit the hiring of german nationals in compliance with german tax laws.at all times during his employment weissenbach reported to the vice president of sales at.the products offered through were designed and developed by.personnel decisions for employees at were approved by.marketing and sales were likewise overseen by.controlled contracting decisions relating to.weissenbach communicated regularly with integral employees in california by and telephone regarding sales and personnel matters.his compensation was set and authorized in california,and the funds for his paychecks originated from.he submitted expense reimbursement claims to for approval in california.he was given the opportunity to participate in integral employee stock option plan,which was administered in california.during the short time he was employed by integral,he traveled to the california headquarters twice,in order to finalize his employment relationship and later to attend business meetings and report on progress of the german subsidiary.based on these facts,integral contends that weissenbach employment relationship with the parent corporation in california to market and sell products designed and developed in california constituted the requisite minimal contacts to support the exercise of jurisdiction.
weissenbach argues that,unlike many cases upholding personal jurisdiction based on minimum contacts,he conducted no business in california and had no contact with any customers in california at any time during his employment or thereafter.see,magnecomp athene,d.multitech d.we must consider,however,the nature of the claims as alleged against him.the complaint alleges that weissenbach,during the course of his employment,acquired trade secrets and other confidential information regarding integral products,customers and employees,which he then used to cause harm to integral and thus to integral customers and to its business revenues in california.the claims raised are thus directly related to weissenbach contacts with this state in that they arise from the employment relationship.we believe,therefore,that the requisite substantial nexus exists between the controversy at issue and the defendant contacts with california.vons companies,seabest foods,supra,cal th at,d,lundgren superior court d.
furthermore,even without other contacts with the forum state,the commission of an intentional tort that is directed at a california resident may provide sufficient minimum contacts to support the exercise of personal jurisdiction over the defendant.calder jones,d data disc,systems tech,cir seagate technology kogyo,d.in calder jones,a california plaintiff brought a suit for defamation against a writer and the editor of the national enquirer,a national newspaper based in florida,but with a circulation of approximately in california.the allegedly libelous story concerned a california resident whose television career was centered in california.the writer lived in florida and did not personally visit california but relied on phone calls to sources in california for
