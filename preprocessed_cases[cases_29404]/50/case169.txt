the texas rules of evidence protect trade secrets from discovery if the allowance of the privilege will not tend to conceal fraud or otherwise work injustice.evid.we held in in re continental general tire,that a party asserting the trade secret privilege has the burden of proving that the discovery information sought qualifies as a trade secret.if met,the burden shifts to the party seeking trade secret discovery to establish that the information is necessary for a fair adjudication of its claim.
here,royalty interest owners are attempting discovery of the mineral estate owner geological seismic data to prove that the mineral estate owner breached an implied duty to develop its land.the mineral estate owner claims that the data are trade secrets.the trial court found that the royalty owners met their burden of establishing necessity and ordered the mineral estate owner to produce the data under a protective order.the court of appeals denied the mineral estate owner requested mandamus relief.the mineral estate owner now seeks mandamus relief from this court to prevent discovery of the claimed trade secrets.
the issues before us today are whether the mineral estate owner proved that the seismic data at issue are trade secrets and if the mineral estate owner proved the data are trade secrets,whether the royalty interest owners established that the discovery of the trade secret information was necessary to a fair adjudication of their breach of an implied duty claim.we hold that geological seismic data are trade secrets and that the royalty interest owners failed to establish the existence of a claim against the mineral estate owner justifying discovery of the trade secret data.we therefore conditionally grant mandamus relief and order the trial court to vacate its order compelling the seismic data production.
background 
real parties in interest,the royalty interest owners the mcgills,sued relator,the mineral estate owner bass,for multiple claims in the trial court.the relevant claim for the purpose of this mandamus is the mcgills assertion that bass breached an implied duty to the mcgills to develop his land.
bass owns the surface and mineral estate of la paloma large tract of land in kenedy and kleberg counties.the ranch is made up of multiple tracts of land,which bass purchased from the mcgills and their predecessors in interest.the disputed land tract here is the former erck acres within the la paloma ranch.the erck property was originally part of the mcgill family ranch.the mcgill family ranch was partitioned between three brothers,mcgill,mcgill,and scott mcgill in.although both surface and minerals were partitioned,each of the brothers retained a of royalty interest in the other two brothers partitioned land.
as sole daughter and heir of mcgill,anne mcgill erck inherited her father land.bass purchased the erck property from ann mcgill erck bankruptcy sale in.the erck property general warranty deed to bass clearly recognizes the encumbrance of the royalty interests that the other mcgill brothers own.here,relators are the heirs of scott mcgill,and their royalty interest in the erck property is less than.
in the,bass contracted with exxon to run a geological survey of seismic activity on the entire la paloma ranch.bass has never opted to lease the land for development.the mcgills claim that by refusing to lease and thus develop the land,bass has breached an implied duty to the royalty interest holders.to prove that bass breached this duty,the mcgills claim access to bass seismic data is necessary because the data will reveal whether development would be profitable.the trial court ordered production of the data subject to a protective order.
the trial court order did not expressly find that the seismic activity data are trade secrets.bass contends the data are trade secrets,and thus,bass sought mandamus relief from the court of appeals,which denied relief in a per curiam order.bass now seeks relief from this court,arguing that the data are trade secrets and that the mcgills have not shown entitlement to the seismic information.
ii.standard of review 
mandamus issues only to correct a clear abuse of discretion or the violation of a duty imposed by law when there is no other adequate remedy by law.walker packer,johnson fourth court of appeals.thus,evaluating whether mandamus relief should be granted requires that we determine whether there has been a clear abuse of discretion by the trial court and whether an adequate appellate remedy exists.walker,at.
iii.analysis 
abuse of discretion 
abuse of discretion occurs when the trial court reaches a decision so arbitrary and unreasonable as to amount to a clear and prejudicial error of law.walker,at.
in in re continental,we held that w hen trade secret privilege is asserted as the basis for resisting production,the trial court must determine whether the requested production constitutes a trade secret if so,the court must require the party seeking production to show reasonable necessity for the requested materials.at quoting rare,so d at.if a trial court orders production once trade secret status is proven,but the party seeking production has not shown a necessity for the requested materials,the trial court action is an abuse of discretion.id.
whether geological seismic data constitute trade secrets 
under the first prong of in re continental,we must determine whether the geological seismic data constitute trade secrets.
we have held that a trade secret is any formula,pattern,device or compilation of information which is used in one business and presents an opportunity to obtain an advantage over competitors who do not know or use it.computer assocs.intern.altai.however,we have never stated whether geological seismic data qualify as trade secrets.
to determine whether a trade secret exists,this court applies the restatement of torts test 
the extent to which the information is known outside of his business the extent to which it is known by employees and others involved in his business the extent of the measures taken by him to guard the secrecy of the information the value of the information to him and to his competitors the amount of effort or money expended by him in developing the information the ease or difficulty with which the information could be properly acquired or duplicated by others.
restatement of torts cmt.restatement third of unfair competition reporter cmt.see generally hyde huffines.the original restatement section has been omitted from the restatement second of torts and incorporated into the restatement third of unfair competition.likewise,the six factor test from section cmt,is discussed in the unfair competition restatement reporter notes.restatement third of unfair competition reporter cmt.d in determining the existence of a trade secret,many cases rely on the factors identified in restatement of torts cmt.b.the restatement of unfair competition treats the factors as relevant,but not dispositive,criteria 
it is not possible to state precise criteria for determining the existence of a trade secret.the status of information claimed as a trade secret must be ascertained through a comparative evaluation of all the relevant factors,including the value,secrecy,and definiteness of the information as well as the nature of the defendant misconduct.
restatement third of unfair competition cmt.d.
though we have never specifically addressed the restatement changes,many other jurisdictions continue to apply and treat the six factors as relevant criteria used to determine if something is a trade secret texas courts of appeals who continue to apply this test are split on whether the should be weighed as relevant criteria or whether a person claiming trade secret privilege must satisfy all six factors before trade secret status applies.see american derringer bond,no writ.the factors are to be considered in determining whether given information is a trade secret expo chem.brooks,dist,rev on other grounds,but see birnbaum alliance of am.insurers,pet.denied all six factors must be established by a claimant.not surprisingly,the mcgills argue that in order for the seismic data to qualify as a trade secret,bass must satisfy all six factors.conversely,bass argues that the constitute a balancing test.
in determining which position is correct,we begin by noting again that the restatement third of unfair competition regards the test as relevant but not dispositive,as it is not possible to state precise criteria for determining the existence of a trade secret.restatement third of unfair competition cmt.d.we agree with the restatement and the majority of jurisdictions that the party claiming a trade secret should not be required to satisfy all six factors because trade secrets do not fit neatly into each factor every time.see id.we additionally recognize that other circumstances could also be relevant to the trade secret analysis.thus,we will weigh the factors in the context of the surrounding circumstances to determine whether geological seismic data qualify as trade secrets.
it is undisputed that the oil and gas industry typically treats seismic data and other methods for obtaining subsurface geological information as trade secrets.other jurisdictions have recognized this industry wide practice of treating seismic data as trade secrets.see musser davis land union pac,cir tidelands royalty b gulf oil,cir phillips petroleum stryker,so d,amoco prod.laird.
the alabama supreme court,for example,mentioned seismic data and its status as a trade secret in stryker,so d at.stryker involved a parcel of property drilled for oil and gas by phillips petroleum company.see id.the owners of property outside this parcel of land brought an action against phillips,alleging that the company had improperly drained their land of gas and gas condensate,that phillips caused a waste of condensate,and that phillips had acted fraudulently in failing to disclose the extent to which their property was being drained.see id.at.in connection with phillips unwillingness to share its seismic research with a company to whom the plaintiffs had executed leases on their property,the court observed that seismic research is very expensive research usually treated as a trade secret.id.
the fifth circuit likewise recognized the confidential nature of seismic data in musser,at.in musser,the court addressed the rights of each party under an oil and gas lease with respect to seismic exploration.the assignee of a mineral lease,union pacific resources upr,sought to obtain from musser davis land company a seismic permit before conducting a seismology survey of the lands and offered to pay for anticipated incidental property damages.see id.musser davis refused,and negotiations ensued.when negotiations eventually failed,upr informed musser davis of its intention to conduct the survey under the lease without a special permit.musser obtained,in state court,a temporary restraining order preventing upr from conducting seismic exploration of the land or transferring seismic data to third parties.see id.upon removal,the federal district court granted declaratory relief to musser davis.the fifth circuit reversed on appeal,stating that a mineral lessee or permitee ordinarily acquires a valuable exclusive property right in data derived from its geophysical survey.id.at citing tidelands royalty,at exploration company that conducted geophysical survey on federal lands owned resulting confidential data and could sell it to lessee production company for fee and overriding royalties.
moreover,in laird,at,the indiana supreme court held that information regarding the potential location of oil fields is entitled to trade secret protection.in that case,amoco production company used microwave radar technology to obtain oil reserve data.see id.an amoco geologist consulted as an expert in this technology sent a competitor a facsimile transmission of a page from a road atlas upon which he had drawn circles indicating the location of potential reserve sites.see id.the competitor,laird,then used this information to obtain oil and gas exploration leases for a substantial portion of these reserve locations.amoco filed an action against laird,seeking,in part,a preliminary injunction prohibiting laird from pursuing or developing oil and gas leases defined by the road atlas and from using or disclosing any other information gained from the discovery or litigation of the case.see id.the court held that the information pertaining to the location of the oil reserve sites was entitled to trade secret protection.the court further observed that w ithout the availability of trade secret protection,particularly with respect to exploration of subterranean natural resources,corporations and individuals would not risk the large sums of money for geophysical exploration,an expensive but only infrequently rewarding adventure.id.at citing milgrim,on trade secrets.
having determined that seismic data are treated as trade secrets both in the industry and in the courts of several jurisdictions,we now apply the restatement test to determine whether bass geological seismic data constitute trade secrets under these circumstances.the first enumerated factor involves the extent to which the information is known outside the business.according to a bass employee affidavit,bass has at all times maintained the confidentiality of the data obtained from the seismic shoot.the affidavit states that it would be impossible for others to obtain this information without paying a substantial sum for a license or right to view the existing data or paying an even larger amount to conduct another seismic survey,which could only be done with bass consent.a bass geophysicist testimony likewise reveals that the data and data interpretations were never shown to anyone outside bass enterprise production company bepco and exxon.exxon access to the data stems from the option lease in which bepco paid exxon to obtain the data through the seismic shoot.thus,other than exxon,who actually conducted the geological survey,bass has not provided outside access to the data.
the second enumerated factor involves the extent to which the information is known by employees and others involved in bass business.the mcgills claim certain employees of bepco have access to the data.however,bepco is bass operating agent and responsible for maintaining,managing,and operating all bass oil and gas interests.expert testimony demonstrates that only four bepco employees have seen the the company geophysicist whose job includes analyzing such data for bass.we have held that a party may share trade secret information with its agents without endangering the trade secret protection.huffines,at.thus,because only four people have access to the data,all of whom are bass agents and employees,we believe that bass has satisfied the restatement second factor as well.
the third factor considers the extent of measures taken to guard the secrecy of the information.in this case,the seismic data were considered highly valuable.the data were kept in a secured,climate regulated vault that was accessible only to those who knew the combination.an expert witness testified that t o be able to even enter onto the work area,you have to have a security card to get in.this uncontested evidence suggests bass has met the restatement third factor by vigilantly guarding the data.
under the test fourth factor,the information value to bass and its competitors must be taken into account.bass expert testimony states the data are a vital commodity upon which all interpretation of the land value is based.the data provide the ability to construct a picture of the property underground structural geology,and,as bass claims,would be valuable to any oil and gas contractor interested in the area.the expert testimony puts the data monetary value between and.we believe these estimates,both high and low,are substantial figures highly favoring trade secret protection.thus,we believe bass has satisfied the restatement fourth factor.
the fifth factor considers the amount of money expended by bass in developing the data.bass claims that the shoot took several months to complete at considerable expense and inconvenience,but there is no evidence of a specific amount.industry information suggests that exploration through the seism
