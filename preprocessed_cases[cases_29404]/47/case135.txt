plaintiffs judi boisson and her company,american country quilts and linens,judi boisson american country,brought suit in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york platt,alleging that defendants vijay rao and his company banian,illegally copied two quilt designs for which plaintiffs had obtained copyright registrations.following a bench trial,the trial court,in denying the claims of copyright infringement,ruled that defendants quilts were not substantially similar to what it deemed were the protectible elements of plaintiffs works.plaintiffs have appealed this ruling.copying the creative works of others is an old story,one often accomplished by the copyist changing or disfiguring the copied work to pass it off as his own.stealing the particular expression of another ideas is rightly condemned in the law because pirating the expression of the author creative ideas risks diminishing the author exclusive rights to her work,or as a poet said,taking all that she may be or all that she has been.
in reviewing this decision,we find plaintiffs copyrights cover more elements than were recognized by the trial court,and that though the trial court articulated the proper test when comparing the contested works,its application of that test was too narrow.it failed not only to account for the protectible elements we identify,but also to consider the overall look and feel brought about by the creator arrangement of unprotectible elements.hence,we disagree with part of the district court ruling and find some instances of copyright infringement.the trial court disposition of those claims must therefore be reversed and remanded for a determination as to what remedies should be awarded.
background 
judi boisson has been in the quilt trade for over years,beginning her career by selling antique american particular,amish purchased in various states throughout the country.by the late,having difficulty finding antique quilts,she decided to design and manufacture her own and began selling them in through her company.boisson published catalogs in and to advertise and sell her quilts.her works are also sold to linen,gift,antique,and children stores and catalog companies.various home furnishing magazines have published articles featuring boisson and her quilts.
in plaintiff designed and produced two alphabet quilts entitled school days i and school days ii.although we later describe the quilts in greater detail,we note each consists of square blocks containing the capital letters of the alphabet,displayed in order.the blocks are set in horizontal rows and vertical columns,with the last row filled by blocks containing various pictures or icons.the letters and blocks are made up of different colors,set off by a white border and colored edging.
boisson testified at trial that she worked on these quilts at home where she drew the letters by hand,decided on their placement in the quilts,picked out the color combinations and chose the quilting patterns.she obtained certificates of copyright registration for each quilt on december.all of her quilts,as well as the catalogs advertising them,include a copyright notice.
defendant vijay rao is the president and sole shareholder of defendant banian,incorporated in november.rao is an electrical engineer in the telecommunications industry who became interested in selling quilts in february.to that end,he imported from india each of the three alphabet quilts at issue in this case.he sold them through boutique stores and catalog companies.the first quilt he ordered was abc green version i,which he had been shown by a third party.defendants have not sold this pattern since.abc green version ii was ordered in september,based upon modifications to abc green version i requested by rao.defendants reordered this quilt once in april,and then stopped selling it in march.regarding abc navy,rao testified that he designed the quilt himself based upon abc green version ii and imported finished copies in november.defendants voluntarily withdrew their abc navy quilts from the market in november following the initiation of this litigation.
plaintiffs filed their suit in march seeking relief from defendants for copyright infringement,false designation of origin and unfair competition.plaintiffs also alleged causes of action pertaining to a quilt involving a star design,but the parties agreed to dismiss those claims.defendants counterclaimed against american country quilts and linens for interference with commercial relations.
the district court held a bench trial in october at which documentary evidence was received and a number of witnesses testified.the witnesses were boisson her daughter,who related having seen and photographed one of defendants alphabet quilts at a trade show plaintiffs expert witness,who testified regarding the similarities between plaintiffs and defendants quilts defendant rao and defendants expert witness,who testified as to the history of alphabet quilts.at the conclusion of the trial,the district court dismissed all of plaintiffs claims,dismissed defendants counterclaim and denied defendants motion for attorney fees in a memorandum and order dated february.plaintiffs have appealed from the judgment entered february,challenging only that part of the order and judgment that dismissed their copyright infringement claims.
discussion 
copyright infringement is established by proving ownership of a valid copyright and copying of constituent elements of the work that are original.feist publ ns,rural.serv,d.throughout the following analysis the key consideration is the extent to which plaintiffs work is original.see id.at.
i ownership of a valid copyright 
the copyright act provides that a certificate of copyright registration made before or within five years after first publication of the work shall constitute prima facie evidence of the validity of the copyright.c.boisson secured certificates of registration for both school days quilts in,the same year in which she designed them,so that we must presume she holds valid copyrights.although such a presumption may be rebutted,folio impressions,byer,cir,the district court found there was insufficient proof to support defendants argument that plaintiffs deliberately misled the copyright office when submitting their applications.by not challenging that finding on appeal,defendants concede the validity of plaintiffs copyrights.
ii actual copying of plaintiffs work 
the element of copying breaks down into two parts.plaintiffs must first show that defendants actually copied their quilts.streetwise maps,vandam,cir.actual copying may be established by direct or indirect evidence.laureyssens idea group,cir.indirect evidence may include proof of access to the copyrighted work,similarities that are probative of copying between the works,and expert testimony.id.the district court made a finding that actual copying had occurred,and because defendants do not dispute that finding,actual copying is also established.but not all copying results in copyright infringement,even if the plaintiff has a valid copyright.feist publ ns,at.plaintiffs must also demonstrate substantial similarity between defendants quilts and the protectible elements of their own quilts.streetwise maps,at accord laureyssens,at.
iii originality 
plaintiffs certificates of registration constitute prima facie evidence of the validity not only of their copyrights,but also of the originality of their works.gaste kaiserman,cir we also note that on the issue of originality,as compared to the issue of compliance with statutory formalities,it is even clearer that copyright registration created a presumption of validity.yet copyright protection extends only to a particular expression of an idea,and not to the idea itself.folio impressions,at accord beaudin ben jerry homemade,cir reyher children television workshop,cir.simply because a work is copyrighted does not mean every element of that work is protected.
the threshold question is what characteristics of plaintiffs design have gained copyright protection.herbert rosenthal jewelry honora jewelry,cir per curiam see also folio impressions,at determining at the outset which elements of a fabric design were copyrightable.inasmuch as protection extends only to those components of a work that are original to the author,originality is the sine qua non of copyright.feist publ ns,at.we now review boisson works to determine the extent to which they are original.
copyright law does not define the term originality.rather,courts have derived its meaning from art.i,cl.of the united states constitution,which authorizes congress to promote the progress of science and useful arts,by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.see feist publ ns,at.originality does not mean that the work for which copyright protection is sought must be either novel or unique,in re cases,it simply means a work independently created by its author,one not copied from works,and a work that comes from the exercise of the creative powers of the author mind,in other words,the fruits of the author intellectual labor.id.the supreme court gave an example when it said,in upholding the validity of a copyright to a photo of oscar wilde,the photographer made a useful,new,harmonious,characteristic,and graceful picture entirely from his own mental conception,to which he gave visible form by posing the subject and arranging the costume,draperies,and other various accessories so as to present graceful outlines.lithographic sarony.
if a work is not original,then it is unprotectible.likewise an element within a work may be unprotectible even if other elements,or the work as a whole,warrant protection.some material is unprotectible because it is in the public domain,which means that it is free for the taking and can not be appropriated by a single author even though it is included in a copyrighted work.computer assocs.int l,altai,cir.
ruling of the trial court 
following the bench trial,the district court found some elements of plaintiffs quilts were unprotectible,not original because they were in the public domain the alphabet,formation of the alphabet using six rows of five blocks across and four icons in the last row,and color.although that court expressed doubt as to whether copyright protection would extend to the shapes of the letters used in the quilts,it did not rule on that issue.these determinations as to originality may be overturned only if clearly erroneous.see matthew bender west publ g,cir.a finding is clearly erroneous if,upon reviewing the entire record,we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake was made.anderson city of bessemer,d.
use of alphabet 
passing now to the court ruling,it correctly determined that the alphabet is in the public domain,a finding plaintiffs do not dispute.nor could they object,considering the applicable regulations provide no copyright protection for familiar symbols or designs or mere variations of lettering.a.
layouts of alphabet 
to support its finding that the layouts of plaintiffs quilts were not protected by copyright,the district court relied upon evidence submitted by defendants showing that alphabet quilts have been in existence for over a century,suggesting that such layouts were also in the public domain.one circa quilt displayed letters and icons in blocks arranged in the same format used in school days from this evidence the court reasoned that such formation belonged to the public domain.although it made specific findings only as to the block formation in school days i,we presume for purposes of our discussion that,in the absence of a specific finding as to the school days ii format,the trial court intended its findings on unprotectibility to extend to the layouts of both of plaintiffs quilts.
these findings are clearly erroneous.not only did plaintiffs obtain valid certificates of copyright registration,but also the alphabetical arrangement of the letters in the block format required some minimum degree of creativity,which is all that is required for copyrightability.moreover,unlike the use of letters,no federal regulation establishes that the use of this layout is unprotectible.these factors create a presumption that the layout is original and therefore a protectible element.therefore,if defendants want to contest this presumption,they bear the burden of proving that this particular layout is not original.gaste,at explaining that burden of proof is on defendant in infringement action who claims the plaintiff copyright registration is invalid.at trial,defendants asserted that the particular layout of plaintiffs quilts was copied from the public domain,but they presented insufficient proof to establish that proposition.
as noted earlier,a plaintiff attempting to prove actual copying on the part of a defendant is entitled to use direct or indirect evidence.indirect evidence of access and substantial similarity to the plaintiff work can support an inference that copying took place.streetwise maps,at.scholars disagree as to whether a defendant may also rely upon circumstantial evidence to show that a plaintiff copied from the public domain.compare jessica litman,the public domain,emory,explaining that a defendant is not entitled to any inference that a plaintiff copied from the public domain simply by showing access and substantial similarity to the public domain work,with russ versteeg,rethinking originality,mary,permitting a defendant to show copying on the part of the plaintiff through circumstantial evidence that the plaintiff had access and created a work substantially similar to a public domain work.assuming arguendo that an inference is allowable,defendants in the case at hand nevertheless fall short of proving boisson copied from the public domain.
access may be established directly or inferred from the fact that a work was widely disseminated or that a party had a reasonable possibility of viewing the prior work.see generally melville nimmer david nimmer,nimmer on copyright,a describing the ways in which access can be shown.defendants proffered no evidence that boisson owned an alphabet quilt prior to designing school days i or school days ii.instead they point to boisson affirmative answer when asked at her deposition whether she had seen an alphabet design in any other quilts.boisson was not asked what these quilts looked like or when she saw them relative to designing her own quilts,or whether they bore any resemblance to her own designs.
moreover,having seen an alphabet design would not conclusively establish that boisson saw one from which she copied the arrangement of letters for her school days quilts.as defendants own proof reveals,alphabet quilts are not limited to the formations found in either the quilt or plaintiffs quilts.some quilts display letters out of order some display three letters in the first and last rows with five letters in each of the middle rows one has six letters in rows with icons placed in the border another has varying numbers of letters in each row with icons or quilting designs in the remaining blocks while still others have five rows of five letters with the z by itself in a corner or followed by numbers representing the year the quilt was made.nor are all letters of the alphabet always displayed or even displayed with each letter in its own block.
defendants also failed to show that quilts with layouts similar to the school days quilts were so widely disseminated or known as to infer that boisson reasonably would have seen one before designing her own works.in particular,bearing in mind that boisson testified as to her specialty in amish quilts,among the books submitted by defendants into evidence for purposes of showing copying on the part of plaintiffs,only two pertained specifically to amish kenneth pellman,the world of amish quilts and rachel kenneth pellman,a treasury of amish quilts.neither book,however,contains an alphabet quilt,although they do contain photographs of other quilts owned by boisson.further,boisson testified at her deposition that she was unaware of any amish alphabet quilts and had never seen one.
absent evidence of copying,an author is entitled to copyright protection for an independently produced original work despite its identical nature to a prior work,because it is independent creation,and not novelty that is required.see nimmer nimmer,supra,a,at see also feist publ ns,at.explaining that a work is original for the purposes of copyright law so long as it was independently created.judge jerome frank said that an author is entitled to a copyright if he independently contrived a work completely identical with what went before.alfred bell catalda fine arts,cir.
shapes of letters 
the trial judge made no explicit finding with respect to the shapes of the letters of the alphabet.instead,the court stated it was questionable whether plaintiffs could copyright the shapes of the letters used,and it cited the regulation that provides mere variations of typographic ornamentation are not copyrightable.a.at this juncture,we hesitate to say that letter shapes are unprotectible in this context,but in the absence of a trial court finding,it is not necessary for us to reach this issue.
color by itself is not subject to copyright protection.see a.nevertheless,a n original combination or arrangement of colors should be regarded as an artistic creation capable of copyright protection.nimmer nimmer,supra,at.we have previously declined to single out color as an individual element when conducting a copyright infringement analysis.in streetwise maps,at,we determined that instead of examining the plaintiff and defendants maps,viewing the individual colors chosen by plaintiff as the protected elements upon which defendants encroached,we focus on the overall manner in which plaintiff selected,coordinated,and arranged the expressive elements in its map,including color,to depict the map factual content emphasis added.we reached this conclusion after considering the following two circuit precedents.
knitwaves,lollytogs,cir,involved the copyrightability of children sweater designs.in finding copyright violations,we considered the plaintiff original contributions to include selecting leaves and squirrels as its dominant design elements coordinating these design elements with a fall palette of colors and with a or a background and arranging all the design elements and colors into an original pattern for each sweater.id.at.similarly,in novelty textile mills,joan fabrics,cir,we viewed color in conjunction with the plaid fabric designs utilized by the parties.
taken together,these cases teach that even though a particular color is not copyrightable,the author choice in incorporating color with other elements may be copyrighted.this lesson is in accord with the holding of feist publications.see at.c hoices as to selection and arrangement,so long as they are made independently by the compiler and entail a minimal degree of creativity,are sufficiently original that congress may protect such compilations through the copyright laws.boisson testified that she selected on a basis what colors to use,without reference to any existing work.this approach,combined with boisson other creative choices,leads us to conclude it was clear error for the district court to find that plaintiffs choice of colors in the school days quilts was an unprotectible element.
iv substantial similarity ordinary observer v.more discerning observer 
having found that plaintiffs quilts are entitled to copyright protection and that defendants actually copied at least some elements of plaintiffs quilts,we turn our analysis to defendants contention that its quilts were not substantially similar to plaintiffs.we review de novo the district court determination with respect to substantial similarity because credibility is not at stake and all that is required is a visual comparison of the task we may perform as well as the district court.folio impressions,at accord nihon keizai shimbun,comline bus.data,cir.
generally,an allegedly infringing work is considered substantially similar to a copyrighted work if the ordinary observer,unless he set out to detect the disparities,would be disposed to overlook them,and regard their aesthetic appeal as the same.folio impressions,at.yet in folio impressions,the evidence at trial showed the plaintiff designer had copied the background for its fabric from a public domain document and contributed nothing,not even a trivial variation.at.thus,part of the plaintiff fabric was not original and therefore not protectible.we articulated the need for an ordinary observer to be more discerning in such circumstances.
t he ordinary observer would compare the finished product that the fabric designs were intended to grace women dresses,and would be inclined to view the entire of protectible and unprotectible one whole.here,since only some of the design enjoys copyright protection,the observer inspection must be more discerning.
id.at.shortly after folio impressions was decided,we reiterated that a more refined analysis is required where a plaintiff work is not wholly original,but rather incorporates elements from the public domain.key publ ns,chinatown today publ g,cir.in these instances,w hat must be shown is substantial similarity between those elements,and only those elements,that provide copyrightability to the allegedly infringed compilation.id.in contrast,where the plaintiff work contains no material imported from the public domain,the more discerning test is unnecessary.hamil,gfi,cir,cert.denied,d.in the case at hand,because the alphabet was taken from the public domain,we must apply the more discerning ordinary observer test.
in applying this test,a court is not to dissect the works at issue into separate components and compare only the copyrightable elements.knitwaves,at.to do so would be to take the more discerning test to an extreme,which would result in almost nothing being copyrightable because original works broken down into their composite parts would usually be little more than basic unprotectible elements like letters,colors and symbols.id.this no copyright protection to an original compilation of unprotectible be contrary to the supreme court holding in feist publications.
although the more discerning test has not always been identified by name in our case law,we have nevertheless always recognized that the test is guided by comparing the total concept and feel of the contested works.knitwaves,at.for example,in streetwise maps,at,we found no because the plaintiff map consisted of public domain facts such as street locations,landmasses,bodies of water and landmarks,as well as rather because the total concept and overall feel created by the two works may not be said to be substantially similar.in nihon keizai shimbun,at,we conducted a comparison of the articles and abstracts at issue to determine whether a copyright infringement had occurred.looking beyond the unprotected facts,we analyzed how alike or different the abstracts were in their structure and organization of the facts.id.at.
likewise,when evaluating claims of infringement involving literary works,we have noted that while liability would result only if the protectible elements were substantially similar,our examination would encompass the similarities in such aspects as the total concept and feel,theme,characters,plot,sequence,pace,and setting of the plaintiff books and the defendants works.williams,at see also id.at a scattershot approach can not support a finding of substantial similarity because it fails to address the underlying issue whether a lay observer would consider the works as a whole substantially similar to one another.but see,toy,cir knitwaves and comparing only the protectible elements of copyrighted dolls.
in the present case,while use of the alphabet may not provide a basis for infringement,we must compare defendants quilts and plaintiffs quilts on the basis of the arrangement and shapes of the letters,the colors chosen to represent the letters and other parts of the quilts,the quilting patterns,the particular icons chosen and their placement.our analysis of the total concept and feel of these works should be instructed by common sense.hamil,at noting that the ordinary observer test involves an examination of total concept and feel,which in turn can be guided by good eyes and common sense.it is at this juncture that we par
