harlan ellison appeals the district court summary judgment dismissal of his copyright infringement action against america online,aol.the copyright infringement action arose when,without ellison authorization,stephen robertson posted copies of some of ellison copyrighted short stories on a file sharing network,the usenet because aol provides its subscribers access to the usenet at issue,ellison brought claims for vicarious and contributory copyright infringement against aol.aol moved for summary judgment.it asserted defenses to ellison infringement claims and alternatively argued that it qualified for one of the four safe harbor limitations of liability under title ii of the digital millennium copyright act dmca the district court concluded that aol was not liable for vicarious infringement.although the court found there to be triable issues of material fact concerning ellison contributory infringement claim,it nonetheless granted summary judgment because it held that aol qualified for the dmca safe harbor limitation of liability under a.
we hold that the district court erred in granting aol motion for summary judgment.we affirm the district court holdings as to vicarious and contributory infringement,but we reverse the district court application of the safe harbor limitation from liability.there are triable issues of material fact concerning whether aol meets the threshold requirements,set forth in i,to assert the safe harbor limitations of liability of.if after remand a jury finds aol to be eligible under i to assert the safe harbor limitations of,the parties need not relitigate whether aol qualifies for the limitation of liability provided by a the district court resolution of that issue at the summary judgment stage is sound.we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand.
facts and procedural background 
harlan ellison is the author of numerous science fiction novels and short stories,and he owns valid copyrights to those works.in the spring of,stephen robertson electronically scanned and copied a number of ellison fictional works to convert them to digital files.robertson subsequently uploaded the files onto the usenet.robertson accessed the internet through his local internet service provider,tehama county online,and his usenet service was provided by remarq communities.the usenet at issue in this case was used primarily to exchange unauthorized digital copies of works by famous authors,including ellison.
after robertson made the infringing copies of ellison works accessible to the,the works were forwarded and copied throughout the usenet to servers all over the world,including those belonging to aol.as a result,aol subscribers had access to the containing the infringing copies of ellison works.at the time robertson posted the infringing copies of ellison works,aol policy was to store and retain files attached to usenet postings on the company servers for fourteen days.
on or about april,ellison learned of the infringing activity and contacted legal counsel.on april,in compliance with the notification procedures the dmca requires,ellison counsel sent an message to agents of tehama county online and aol to notify the service providers of the infringing activity.ellison received an acknowledgment of receipt from tehama county online but received nothing from aol,which claims never to have received the.
on april,ellison filed an action against aol and others in the united states district court for the central district of california.upon receipt of ellison complaint,aol blocked its subscribers access to the at issue.aol thereafter moved for summary judgment,arguing that the undisputed facts did not prove ellison copyright infringement claims.aol alternatively asserted the safe harbor limitations to liability under title ii of the dmca.on november,ellison moved for summary judgment of his contributory and vicarious copyright infringement claims against aol.on march,the district court granted aol summary judgment motion and denied ellison summary judgment motion.the court found that the evidence failed to establish ellison claims of direct and vicarious copyright infringement whether aol was liable for contributory copyright infringement presented a triable issue of fact the evidence showed that aol met the threshold eligibility requirements of i for the safe harbor limitations from liability under ocilla title ii of the dmca and aol qualified for the safe harbor limitation on liability under a.ellison now appeals.

ii.the law of copyright infringement and the dmca 
ellison alleges that aol infringed his copyrighted works.as a threshold question,a plaintiff who claims copyright infringement must show ownership of a valid copyright and that the defendant violated the copyright owner exclusive rights under the copyright act.a,at.we recognize three doctrines of copyright liability direct copyright infringement,contributory copyright infringement,and vicarious copyright infringement.to prove a claim of direct copyright infringement,a plaintiff must show that he owns the copyright and that the defendant himself violated one or more of the plaintiff exclusive rights under the copyright act a m records napster,cir napster ii.one who,with knowledge of the infringing activity,induces,causes or materially contributes to the infringing conduct of another may be liable as a contributory copyright infringer.gershwin publ g columbia artists,cir footnote omitted and emphasis added.we have interpreted the knowledge requirement for contributory copyright infringement to include both those with actual knowledge and those who have reason to know of direct infringement.napster ii,at.a defendant is vicariously liable for copyright infringement if he enjoys a direct financial benefit from another infringing activity and has the right and ability to supervise the infringing activity.napster ii,at quoting gershwin publ g,at fonovisa,cherry auction,cir melville nimmer david nimmer,nimmer on copyright a.
congress enacted the dmca in to comply with international copyright treaties and to update domestic copyright law for the online world.see digital millennium copyright act,stat.nimmer on copyright a david quinto,law of internet disputes.difficult and controversial questions of copyright liability in the online world prompted congress to enact title ii of the dmca,the online copyright infringement liability limitation act ocilla.ocilla endeavors to facilitate cooperation among internet service providers and copyright owners to detect and deal with copyright infringements that take place in the digital networked environment,at,pt,at.congress hoped to provide greater certainty to service providers concerning their legal exposure for infringements that may occur in the course of their activities.id.
but r ather than embarking on a wholesale clarification of the various doctrines of copyright liability,congress opted to leave current law in its evolving state and,instead,to create a series of safe harbors,for certain common activities of service providers,at.under ocilla four safe harbors,service providers may limit their liability for claims of copyright infringement.these safe harbors provide protection from liability for transitory digital network communications system caching information residing on systems or networks at the direction of users and information location tools far short of adopting enhanced or wholly new standards to evaluate claims of copyright infringement against online service providers,congress provided that ocilla limitations of liability apply if the provider is found to be liable under existing principles of law,at emphasis added.
we thus agree with the district court that t he dmca did not simply rewrite copyright law for the world.ellison,d at.congress would have done so if it so desired.claims against service providers for direct,contributory,or vicarious copyright infringement,therefore,are generally evaluated just as they would be in the world.
iii.ellison claims against aol 
contributory copyright infringement 
ellison alleged in his complaint that aol was contributorily liable for copyright infringement.to substantiate his claim,he must show that aol knew or had reason to know of the infringing activity taking place on its usenet servers and that aol materially contributed to the infringing activity.
we first consider whether aol knew or had reason to know of the infringing activity.the district court found that aol did not have actual knowledge of the infringement before ellison filed his copyright infringement action,but concluded that a reasonable trier of fact could certainly find that aol had reason to know that infringing copies of ellison works were stored on their usenet servers.ellison,d at.we agree.
aol changed its contact address from to in the fall of,but waited until april to register the change with the copyright office.moreover,aol failed to configure the old address so that it would either forward messages to the new address or return new messages to their senders.in the meantime,complaints such as ellison went unheeded,and complainants were not notified that their messages had not been delivered.furthermore,there is evidence in the record suggesting that a phone call from aol subscriber john miller to aol should have put aol on notice of the infringing activity on the particular usenet group at issue in this case.miller contacted aol to report the existence of unauthorized copies of works by various authors.because there is evidence indicating that aol changed its address in an unreasonable manner and that aol should have been on notice of infringing activity we conclude that a reasonable trier of fact could find that aol had reason to know of potentially infringing activity occurring within its usenet network.
material contribution 
the second element a plaintiff must prove to succeed on a claim of contributory copyright infringement is that the defendant materially contributed to another infringement.napster ii,at.the district court found that ellison demonstrated a triable issue regarding whether aol materially contributed to the copyright infringement 
the court agrees with the findings of the court in netcom that p roviding a service that allows for the automatic distribution of all usenet postings,infringing and noninfringing can constitute a material contribution when the internet service provider knows or should know of infringing activity on its system yet continues to aid in the accomplishment of the direct infringer purpose of publicly distributing the postings.
ellison,d at quoting religious tech.ctr.netcom online communication,see also nimmer on copyright a indicating that netcom inaction constituted material contribution.in netcom,the copyright holders of certain works of ron hubbard sued the operator of a and a large internet service provider,netcom,for copyright infringement.the netcom court held that the fact that the usenet service allowed netcom subscribers access to copyrighted works was sufficient to raise a triable issue regarding material contribution.netcom.at.we conclude that this reasoning applies to ellison claim of contributory copyright infringement.because a reasonable trier of fact could conclude that aol materially contributed to the copyright infringement by storing infringing copies of ellison works on its usenet groups and providing the groups users with access to those copies,we agree with the district court finding that this constituted a triable issue.
vicarious copyright infringement 
ellison alleges that aol is vicariously liable for copyright infringement.thus,ellison must show that aol derived a direct financial benefit from the infringement and had the right and ability to supervise the infringing activity.
financial benefit exists where the availability of infringing material acts as a draw for customers.napster ii,at quoting fonovisa,at.in napster ii,we found that napster increased its userbase by providing its customers with access to pirated copies of protected works and that a mple evidence support ed the district court finding that napster future revenue was directly dependent upon increases in userbase.id.quotations omitted.but in this case,the district court sought to distinguish napster ii.the district court emphasized that virtually all of napster draw of customers resulted from napster providing access to infringing material.because aol usenet group access constituted a relatively insignificant draw when cast against aol vast array of products and services,the district court reasoned,aol did not receive a direct financial benefit from the infringing activity 
the district court interprets fonovisa and direct financial benefit to require a substantial proportion of a defendant income to be directly linked to infringing activities for the purpose of vicarious liability analysis.ellison,d at.we disagree with the addition of this quantification requirement.we concluded in fonovisa that the sale of pirated recordings at the cherry auction swap meet is a draw for customers,which we held sufficient to state the financial benefit element of the claim for vicarious liability.fonovisa,at.there is no requirement that the draw be substantial.
aol offers access to usenet groups as part of its service for a reason it helps to encourage overall subscription to its services.here,aol future revenue is directly dependent upon increases in its userbase.certainly,the fact that aol provides its subscribers access to certain usenet groups constitutes a small draw in proportion to its overall profits,but aol status as a behemoth online service provider,by itself,does not insulate it categorically from vicarious liability.regardless of what fraction of aol earnings are considered a direct result of providing its subscribers access to the usenet groups that contained infringing,almost any aspect of aol services would appear relatively minuscule because of its sheer would be earnings nonetheless.the essential aspect of the direct financial benefit inquiry is whether there is a causal relationship between the infringing activity and any financial benefit a defendant reaps,regardless of how substantial the benefit is in proportion to a defendant overall profits.
given this framework,the question before us is whether there is a triable issue of a material fact regarding whether aol received a direct financial benefit from the copyright infringement.ellison proffers the following evidence to support his contention that aol received a direct financial benefit from the infringement an aol securities filing that reflects the central importance of attracting and retaining subscribers for its business and revenue generation and evidence indicating that many subscribers inquired about aol blocking access to the usenet group at issue.this evidence is hardly compelling.we note that there is no evidence that indicates that aol customers either subscribed because of the available infringing material or canceled subscriptions because it was no longer available.while a causal relationship might exist between aol profits from subscriptions and the infringing activity taking place on its usenet servers,ellison has not offered enough evidence for a reasonable juror so to conclude.
we recognize,of course,that there is usually substantial overlap between aspects of goods or services that customers value and aspects of goods or services that ultimately draw the customers.there are,however,cases in which customers value a service that does not act as a draw.accordingly,congress cautions courts that receiving a fee and flat periodic payments for service ordinarily would not constitute receiving a fina
