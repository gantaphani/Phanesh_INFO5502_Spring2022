in this case we decide whether federal or state law governs priority of security interests in unregistered copyrights.
basically,this is a bankruptcy contest over unregistered copyrights between a bank that got a security interest in the copyrights from the owners and perfected it under state law,and a company that bought the copyrights from the bankruptcy trustees after the copyright owners went bankrupt.these simple facts are all that matters to the outcome of this case,although the details are complex.
three affiliated california auxiliary power,world aerotechnology,and air refrigeration and sold products for modifying airplanes.the faa must approve modifications of civilian aircraft by issuing supplemental type certificates.the three companies owned copyrights in the drawings,technical manuals,and computer software used to make the modifications.some of these copyrighted materials were attached to the supplemental type certificates.the companies did not register their copyrights with the united states copyright office 
the companies got financing from silicon valley bank,one of the appellees in this case.two of the companies borrowed the money directly,the third guaranteed the loan.the security agreement,as is common,granted the bank a security interest in a broad array of presently owned and collateral.the security agreement covered all goods and equipment now owned or hereafter acquired,as well as inventory,contract rights,general intangibles,blueprints,drawings,computer programs,accounts receivable,patents,cash,bank deposits,and pretty much anything else the debtor owned or might be hereafter acquired.the security agreement and financing statement also covered a ll copyright rights,copyright applications,copyright registrations,and like protections in each work of authorship and derivative work thereof,whether published or unpublished,now owned or hereafter acquired.
the bank perfected its security interest in the collateral,including the copyrights,pursuant to california version of article of the uniform commercial code by filing financing statements with the california secretary of state the bank also took possession of the supplemental type certificates and the attached copyrighted materials.but the copyrights still were registered with the united states copyright office and the bank did not record any document showing the transfer of a security interest with the copyright office 
subsequently,the three debtor companies filed simultaneous but separate bankruptcy proceedings.their copyrights were among their major assets.aerocon engineering,one of their creditors and the appellant in this case,wanted the copyrights.aerocon was working on a venture with another company,advanced aerospace,and its president,michael gilsen,and an officer and director,merritt widen all appellees in this case,to engineer and sell aircraft modifications using the debtors designs.their prospective venture faced a problem silicon valley bank claimed a security interest in the copyrights.to solve this problem,aerocon worked out a deal with gilsen,widen,and a company named erose capital not a party in this case to buy the debtors assets,including their copyrights,from the bankruptcy trustees along with the trustees right to sue to avoid silicon valley bank security interest.once aerocon owned the copyrights,it planned to exercise the trustees power to avoid silicon valley bank security interest so that the venture would own the copyrights free and clear.
the transaction to purchase the copyrights and the trustees avoidance action worked as follows.first,aerocon paid the bankruptcy trustees,for each of the three bankruptcy estates.then,the trustees,with the bankruptcy court approval,sold the estates assets and avoidance action to erose capital,gilsen,and widen.gilsen and widen then sold their interest to their company,advanced aerospace.
after this transaction was completed,for reasons not relevant to this appeal,aerocon planned joint venture with advanced aerospace and gilsen and widen fell through.in the aftermath,erose capital sold its interest to aerocon and advanced aerospace sold its interest to airweld.these transactions meant that aerocon and airweld owned the debtors copyrights and the trustees avoidance action as tenants in common.
meanwhile,silicon valley bank won relief from the bankruptcy court automatic stay and,based on its security interest,foreclosed on the copyrights.then the bank sold the copyrights to advanced aerospace gilsen and widen company which then sold the copyrights to airweld.had aerocon joint venture with gilsen and widen gone through,buying off the trustees and the bank interests in the copyrights would have been a sensible,if expensive,way to ensure that the venture owned the copyrights free and clear.but,of course,the venture did not go through,and gilsen and widen affiliations had changed.thus gilsen and widen purchase from the bank and sale to airweld meant that aerocon,which had paid for the copyrights and had owned them as a tenant in common with airweld,now had a claim adverse to airweld,which purportedly owned the copyrights in fee simple.
aerocon brought an adversary proceeding in each of the three bankruptcy proceedings against silicon valley bank,advanced aerospace,gilsen,widen,and airweld.these adversary proceedings were later consolidated.aerocon sued to avoid silicon valley bank security interest and to recover the copyrights or their value from subsequent transferees advanced aerospace,gilsen,widen,and airweld the bankruptcy court granted the subsequent transferees motion to dismiss aerocon claims against them as the bankruptcy court then granted summary judgment to silicon valley bank on all of aerocon claims on the ground that the bank had perfected its security interest in the copyrights under california version of article of the uniform commercial code aerocon appealed to the ninth circuit bankruptcy appellate panel.silicon valley bank objected,and the appeal was transferred to the district court which affirmed the bankruptcy court.aerocon appeals from the district court order.
we have jurisdiction to review the judgment of the district court and we review de novo 
copyright and bankruptcy law set the context for this litigation,but the legal issue is priority of security interests.the bankruptcy trustees sold aerocon their power to avoid any security interest that is voidable by a creditor that extends credit to the debtor at the time of the commencement of the case,and that obtains,at such time and with respect to such credit,a judicial lien under this provision,aerocon has the status of an ideal creditor who perfected his lien at the last possible moment before the bankruptcy commenced and if this hypothetical creditor would take priority over silicon valley bank lien,then aerocon may avoid the bank security interest.
whether aerocon hypothetical lien creditor would take priority turns on whether federal or state law governs the perfection of security interests in unregistered copyrights.the bank did everything necessary to perfect its security interest under state law,so if state law governs,the bank has priority and wins.the bank did nothing,however,to perfect its interest under federal law,so if federal law governs,aerocon hypothetical lien creditor arguably has priority,although the parties dispute whether aerocon might face additional legal hurdles.
we are assisted in deciding this case by two opinions,neither of which controls,but both of which are thoughtful and scholarly.the first is the bankruptcy court published opinion in this case,aerocon engineering silicon valley bank in re world auxiliary power which we affirm largely for the reasons the bankruptcy judge gave.the second is a published district court opinion,national peregrine,capitol federal savings loan association in re peregrine entertainment,the holdings of which we adopt but,like the bankruptcy court,distinguish and limit.
our analysis begins with the copyright act of under the act,copyright protection subsists in original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression while an owner must register his copyright as a condition of seeking certain infringement remedies registration is permissive,not mandatory,and is not a condition for copyright protection likewise,the copyright act provision for recording transfers of copyright ownership the act term that includes security interests is permissive,not mandatory any transfer of copyright ownership or other document pertaining to copyright may be recorded in the copyright office the copyright act use of the word mortgage as one definition of a transfer is properly read to include security interests under article of the uniform commercial code 
under the copyright act,
a s between two conflicting transfers,the one executed first prevails if it is recorded,in the manner required to give constructive notice within one month after its execution or at any time before recordation of the later transfer.otherwise the later transfer prevails if recorded first in such manner,and if taken in good faith,for valuable consideration and without notice of the earlier transfer 
the phrase constructive notice refers to another subsection providing that recording gives constructive notice 
but only if 
the document,or material attached to it,specifically identifies the work to which it pertains so that,after the document is indexed by the register of copyrights,it would be revealed by a reasonable search under the title or registration number of the work and 
registration has been made for the work 
a copyrighted work only gets a title or registration number that would be revealed by a search if it registered since an unregistered work does have a title or registration number that would be revealed by a reasonable search,recording a security interest in an unregistered copyright in the copyright office would give constructive notice under the copyright act,and,because it would,it could preserve a creditor priority.there just is any way for a secured creditor to preserve a priority in an unregistered copyright by recording anything in the copyright office.and the secured party ca get around this problem by registering the copyright,because the secured party is the owner of the copyright,and the copyright act states that only the owner of copyright may obtain registration of the copyright claim 
aerocon argues that the copyright act recordation and priority scheme exclusively controls perfection and priority of security interests in copyrights.first,aerocon argues that state law,here the california,by its own terms steps back and defers to the federal scheme.second,whether or not the steps back,aerocon argues that congress has preempted the as it applies to copyrights.we address each argument in turn.
step back provisions 
article of the uniform commercial code,as adopted in california,provides that unperfected creditors are subordinate to perfected,and as between perfected security interests,the first perfected interest prevails the bank perfected first under state law by filing a financing statement with the california secretary of state on existing and copyrights.the treats copyrights as general intangibles.security interests in general intangibles are properly perfected under the by state filings such as the one made by the bank in this case 
to avoid conflict with the federal law,the has two provisions,by which state law steps back and out of the way of conflicting federal law.the first,more general provision says that article does not apply t o a security interest subject to any statute of the united states to the extent that such statute governs the rights of parties to and third parties affected by transactions in particular types of property as applied to copyrights,the relevant official comment makes it clear that this clause does not exclude all security interests in copyrights from coverage,just those for which the federal copyright act governs the rights of relevant parties 
although the federal copyright act contains provisions permitting the mortgage of a copyright and for the recording of an assignment of a copyright such a statute would not seem to contain sufficient provisions regulating the rights of the parties and third parties to exclude security interests in copyrights from the provisions of this article 
the second provision speaks directly to perfection of security interests.it exempts from filing requirements security interests in property subject to a statute of the united states which provides for a national registration or which specifies a place of filing different from that specified in this division for filing of the security interest.compliance with such a statute is equivalent to the filing of a financing statement and a security interest in property subject to the statute can be perfected only by compliance therewith 
under the two provisions,there can be no question that,when a copyright has been registered,a security interest can be perfected only by recording the transfer in the copyright office.as the district court held in peregrine the copyright act satisfies the broad provision by creating a priority scheme that governs the rights of parties to and third parties affected by transactions in registered copyrights and satisfies the narrow provision by creating a single national registration for security interests in registered copyrights.thus,under these provisions,if a borrower collateral is a registered copyright,the secured party can not perfect by filing a financing statement under the in the appropriate state office,or alternatively by recording a transfer in the copyright office.for registered copyrights,the only proper place to file is the copyright office.we adopt peregrine holding to this effect 
however,the question posed by this case is whether the steps back as to unregistered copyrights.we,like the bankruptcy court in this case conclude that it does not.as we explained,there no way for a secured creditor to perfect a security interest in unregistered copyrights by recording in the copyright office.the broader provision says that the does apply to a security interest to the extent that a federal statute governs the rights of the parties the does defer to the copyright act under this broad provision because the copyright act does provide for the rights of secured parties to unregistered copyrights it only covers the rights of secured parties in registered copyrights.the narrow provision says the does apply if a federal statute provides for a national registration or which specifies a place of filing different from that specified in this division for filing of the security interest.the does defer to the copyright act under this narrow provision because the copyright act does provide a national registration unregistered copyrights do have to be registered,and because unregistered copyrights do have a registered name and number,under the copyright act there is any place to file anything regarding unregistered copyrights that makes any legal difference.so,as a matter of state law,the does step back in deference to federal law,but governs perfection and priority of security interests in unregistered copyrights itself.
federal preemption 
it would matter that state law does step back,however,if congress chose to knock state law out of the way by preemption.federal law preempts state law under three circumstances.the first is express preemption,where congress explicitly preempts state law the second is field preemption,where congress implicitly preempts state law by occupy ing the entire field,leaving no room for the operation of state law the third is conflict preemption,where we infer preemption because compliance with both state and federal law would be impossible,or state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.we presume that federal law does not preempt state law in areas traditionally regulated by the states.
aerocon argues,relying on peregrine,that congress intended to occupy the field of security interests in copyrights.aerocon also argues that the actually conflicts with the copyright act text and purpose.
because aerocon relies so heavily on peregrine and its progeny,we will briefly review the facts and
