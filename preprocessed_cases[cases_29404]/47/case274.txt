plaintiff,susan wakeen doll company wakeen,sculpts,designs,and markets collectable dolls.wakeen sued galleries ashton for copyright infringement under for allegedly copying the head design used in one of wakeen most popular dolls,the love me tender.after a jury trial,the court entered judgment for wakeen in the stipulated amount of million and awarded wakeen in attorney fees.ashton appeals,alleging that the district court erred in denying its motion for judgment as a matter of law or,in the alternative,for a new trial,the district court submitted erroneous jury instructions to the jury,the district court erred in denying its motion for a mistrial,and the district court erred in awarding attorney fees.we affirm the district court denial of ashton motion for judgment as a matter of law or a new trial and find that the allegedly erroneous jury instructions did not prejudice ashton.we also affirm the district court denial of ashton mistrial motion.however,we vacate and remand the district court award of attorney fees.
a.the dolls 
a baby head doll sculptor sculpts in a pliable clay called plasticine.after sculpting the clay,the artist puts the clay into a plaster mold.the artist then makes a porcelain model of the baby head by pouring liquid porcelain into the plaster mold and firing the head in a kiln.the artist paints the hardened porcelain head and adds hair and a body.next,the artist does a wax casting of the plaster mold and sends it to a mold maker,who submerges it into a liquid of copper and nickel in order to create a metal mold.this metal mold is used to make a master skin,or vinyl head.the best master skins become the actual production heads that become the dolls.
susan wakeen,a reputed sculptor and designer of baby dolls,started the susan wakeen doll company in.that same year,she sculpted the original love me tender lmt doll head design and registered its copyright in.the design received a national award of excellence and was a commercial success.as a result,it has been used in approximately forty different dolls marketed by wakeen.
in,wakeen hired marlene sirko sirko to design a head for a relative of baby doll head that looked like it was in the same family as lmt.susan wakeen told sirko that she would supply her with a master skin of lmt to use as a reference.susan wakeen claimed that she sent sirko the lmt master skin via ups,though sirko denied that she ever received it.susan wakeen was not pleased with the sculpt that sirko produced,calling it cartoonish and oversized.in the fall of,wakeen and sirko relationship ended.
ashton also markets collectable dolls,though its dolls are created by independent artists.in,sirko supplied ashton with a clay sculpt that ashton later marketed as a doll entitled the little drummer boy drummer.sirko was unable to produce any other marketable sculpts for ashton,and,therefore,ashton terminated its relationship with sirko on october.despite this,ashton began marketing and selling drummer at the end of.
the similarities between drummer and lmt were brought to susan wakeen attention by several wakeen employees who had seen advertisements for drummer and by a professional doll buyer who stated that she had seen drummer and thought that it looked like lmt.as a result,susan wakeen attempted to create the drummer head using the lmt master skin.she made a mold from the master skin,poured porcelain into the mold,and shrank it two generations to match the size of the drummer head.she then modified the head by shaving off a small amount of porcelain in a few places.when she finished,she concluded that the shrunken and modified head was identical to the drummer head.
consequently,wakeen wrote to ashton on july,and informed it of the alleged copyright infringement.ashton wrote to sirko,asking her to explain the extreme similarities between the two sculpts.sirko responded that she had created the head that became drummer independently,using a photo that she had taken at her son nursery school as her reference.ashton then wrote to wakeen,assuring them that the trail of development of the little drummer boy is complete,from dated photo references of the child who was used as a model for the doll to pictures of the work in progress.ashton also informed wakeen that kathy schultz,the program manager in charge of drummer,worked with sirko in the development of the sculpt.
during the following two years,wakeen repeatedly asked ashton to send it the photos and the original clay that sirko submitted to ashton.in response,ashton told wakeen that it had concluded that the original sculpt of drummer and the final version of lmt were very different,and that the two works only appeared similar after the reduced lmt head had been modified.ashton did not make the original clay sculpt available to wakeen or produce any photographs of the until court proceedings commenced.throughout its dispute with wakeen,ashton continued to sell and profit from dolls using the drummer head.
b.the trial 
in october,wakeen filed suit under,claiming that ashton infringed its copyright by producing and marketing drummer.susan wakeen asserted that she had sent sirko an lmt master skin,thus giving sirko an opportunity to copy the doll head.susan wakeen produced a ups receipt that indicated that she had sent a package to sirko on the day that she claimed to have sent the master skin to sirko.wakeen also presented evidence that lmt and drummer were substantially similar.wakeen witness,jeanne singer,opined that the external structures of the doll heads were identical.susan wakeen and singer both testified that they had compared the sirko head to a master skin of lmt and concluded that the dimensions and placement of the dolls facial features were virtually identical.singer also testified that although some of the features were different between the two dolls,sirko had most likely made minor modifications to the lmt master skin in order to disguise her copying.susan wakeen demonstrated to the jury how quickly drummer could be created from a reduced lmt head.finally,wakeen claimed that sirko did not have the skill to independently create a doll head like drummer.
ashton challenged each aspect of wakeen case.initially,ashton attempted to show that sirko could not have copied lmt.sirko denied receiving a master skin from wakeen,and ashton argued that the evidence was insufficient to prove that wakeen had sent sirko the lmt master skin,or that sirko had received it.ashton highlighted that wakeen could not produce any records from its shipping department or a transmittal letter to support its claim that it sent the master skin to sirko.ashton also claimed that the ups receipt from the package that wakeen sent to sirko did not describe the package contents.
ashton next attempted to rebut wakeen contention that the dolls were substantially similar by calling a,erik blome,who claimed that there were overwhelming dissimilarities between the two dolls.blome testified that drummers,its nose,cheeks,and different than lmt.blome testified that he measured the distances between facial features on the lmt skin and on the drummer plaster,and that the distances were extremely different between the two.ashton also argued that susan wakeen modification demonstration was misleading because she was using a head made from porcelain,while sirko would have had to have modified an lmt head made out of vinyl.
finally,ashton claimed that drummer head was the independent creation of sirko.sirko explained,via deposition,that she began sculpting her doll head in early.she said that she sculpted freehand from a block of plasticine clay,using photographs of a toddler boy taken at her son nursery school in as her model.sirko testified that others witnessed her,although ashton was unable to produce any photographs of sirko.
ashton called several witnesses to support sirko assertions.tania honeck,who lived with sirko for several months,testified that she watched sirko create the drummer head.honeck saw sirko warm the clay and mount it to a sculpting pole.honeck also helped select reference photographs of the toddler claimed to have been the model for sirko head and said that the photos were constantly present in sirko studio during the sculpting process.further,she never saw an lmt master skin in sirko home or studio.ashton then called sandra gianini,an artist friend of sirko.gianini testified that she visited sirko studio in and that she helped paint eyes on and add hair to the drummer head.gianini stated that she was not present when sirko sculpted the drummer head,though she also said that if she saw the head prior to its completion,she probably would not have remembered it because of its unfinished state.she also testified that she did not see an lmt master skin in sirko studio.honeck and gianini both testified that sirko sculpted drummer in late or early,right after christmas.
sirko husband yuri testified via deposition.yuri stated that sirko started drummer head from a block of clay and that he saw sirko using the reference photographs of the toddler boy while she was sculpting.he also stated that he never saw an lmt doll,master skin,or photograph in sirko studio.both yuri and marlene sirko testified that sirko sculpted drummer head before she had any contact with ashton.they claimed that after completing drummer head in march,sirko sent ashton photographs of the finished sculpt,and that ashton suggested a few minor changes,such as making the mouth more pouty.they also claimed that after ashton approved sirko work,it made the plaster molds used in the production process.finally,ashton presented evidence showing that sirko had the talent and experience necessary to create drummer head.
c.the instruction conference 
both parties met with the district court judge before closing arguments in order to discuss the jury instructions each party had previously submitted to the court.rather than using the parties proposed instructions,the court tendered a instruction on copyright law at the start of the instruction conference and gave the parties a few minutes to look it over.the instruction informed the jury that wakeen should prevail if it proved that sirko had access to lmt and that drummer and lmt were substantially similar.ashton objected to this instruction because it did not address independent creation,which would rebut wakeen copyright infringement claim.ashton argued that even if wakeen proved access and substantial similarity,ashton should prevail if sirko independently created her work.ashton requested that another line be added to the jury instructions addressing independent creation.the district court judge did not consider such an instruction necessary and stated that once wakeen proved access and substantial similarity,then there could be no independent creation.the district court judge and ashton debated this area of copyright law for a few hours,but ashton failed to convince the judge that its position was correct.the district court judge submitted the original jury instructions to the jury,adding one line that stated that ashton claimed that sirko independently created her work.
at this conference,both parties also tendered interrogatories covering access,substantial similarity,and independent creation that they proposed should be used if the court chose to submit a special verdict form to the jury.wakeen also submitted a proposed general verdict form.the court opted for a special verdict,but prepared its own form that did not utilize the parties proposed questions.the court special verdict form asked the jury to answer two dealing with access and one dealing with substantial similarity.because the court verdict form did not include ashton proposed question dealing with independent creation,ashton asked for a general verdict form.when the court refused,ashton proffered a second question dealing with independent creation and suggested that the court include it on its special verdict form.the court refused this suggestion,and the conference ended.
closing arguments 
during closing arguments,ashton repeatedly told the jury that it should find that ashton did not infringe wakeen copyright because sirko had independently created her work.ashton explained to the jury that if sirko independently created her work,then that meant that she did not copy lmt and that there was no infringement.ashton also told the jury that if it found that sirko independently created her work,then it should mark no on the special verdict form asking whether the two heads were substantially similar.although wakeen did not object to this comment,the district court judge reprimanded ashton in front of the jury indicating that this comment improperly stated the law.
jury deliberations 
the original jury verdict form posed two questions to the jury do you find that marlene sirko had access to plaintiff copyrighted sculpture and do you find that there exists a substantial similarity between the sculpture that became ashton drake galleries little drummer boy and plaintiff susan wakeen doll company copyrighted sculpture the morning after the jurors began deliberating,the district court decided that it needed to ask a separate question dealing with independent creation.wakeen opposed submitting the supplemental verdict form without also submitting clarifying instructions to the jury.ashton agreed that the court needed to submit the supplemental verdict form,but argued against submitting clarifying instructions.neither party objected to the court decision to submit the supplemental verdict form after the jury returned its verdict with respect to the original two questions.therefore,after the jury answered yes to both of these questions,the district court judge gave the jury a supplemental verdict form containing the following question do you find that marlene sirko copied plaintiff copyrighted sculpture to create the sculpture that became defendant ashton drake galleries little drummer boy ashton moved for a mistrial after the supplemental verdict form was submitted to the jury on the grounds that the deliberative process had been impaired.the court denied ashton mistrial motion.
the jurors answered yes to this third question,and the court entered a verdict for wakeen.the court awarded wakeen million in damages,an amount to which both parties had stipulated before trial.ashton moved for judgment as a matter of law jmol or,alternatively,for a new trial under federal rules of civil procedure b and a.the district court denied ashton motion.the district court then awarded wakeen attorney fees in the amount of.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
we review a district court denial of a motion for jmol de novo.see palmquist selvik,cir.our inquiry,however,is limited to whether the evidence presented,combined with all reasonable inferences permissibly drawn therefrom,is sufficient to support the verdict when viewed in the light most favorable to the party against whom the motion is directed.goodwin mtd,cir.in other words,we reverse only if we find that no rational juror could have found for the prevailing party.see emmel bottling of chicago,cir.we review a district court denial of a motion for a new trial to see whether the district court judge abused her discretion in ruling that the jury verdict was not against the clear weight of the evidence.see robinson burlington,cir.this means that we will not overturn a jury verdict if there is a reasonable basis in the record to support it.see id.
sufficiency of the evidence 
ashton first argument is that the evidence at trial was insufficient for wakeen to establish a claim of copyright infringement against it,and therefore,that the district court erred in not granting its motion for jmol or a new trial.to establish copyright infringement,a plaintiff must prove two elements ownership of a valid copyright,and copying of constituent elements of the work that are original.feist publ ns,rural.serv,d.the parties do not dispute that wakeen owns a valid copyright in lmt,but disagree about whether sirko copied lmt to create the head that ashton marketed as drummer.given that direct evidence of copying is normally unavailable,copying may be inferred where the defendant had access to the copyrighted work and the accused work is substantially similar to the copyrighted work.atari,am.philips consumer elecs,cir.thus,wakeen could establish a prima facie case of copyright infringement by showing that ashton had access to its copyrighted lmt doll and that drummer was substantially similar to lmt.see,ty,gma accessories,cir.however,the inference of copying that is drawn from proof of access and substantial similarity can be rebutted by the defendant showing that it independently created the allegedly infringing work.see id.at.
as a practical matter,if two works are so similar as to make it highly probable that the later one is a copy of the earlier one,the issue of access need not be addressed separately,since if the later work was a copy its creator must have had access to the original.id.at.thus,if the works resemble each other so closely as to make it highly unlikely that the challenged work was an accident of independent creation,then the similarity is evidence of access.id.the more a work is both like an already copyrighted work this is equally anything that is in the public domain,the less likely it is to be an independent creation.id.at.thus,a strong showing of substantial similarity can operate to infer that the defendant had access to the plaintiff work and that the defendant copied the plaintiff work rather than independently created its own work.however,the presumption of copying that arises from a showing of substantial similarity can be rebutted by proof of independent creation.id.i f independent creation results in an identical work,the creator of that work is free to sell it.a defendant independently created a work if it created its own work without copying anything or if it copied something other than the plaintiff copyrighted work.see melville nimmer david nimmer,nimmer on copyright d,at.
we now turn to the evidence in this case to determine if it was sufficient to support the jury findings that ashton had access to lmt,there were substantial similarities between lmt and drummer,and ashton did not independently create drummer.viewing the facts in the light most favorable to wakeen,as we must,we find that there was sufficient evidence to support the jury findings.
wakeen could prove access by showing that the defendant had an opportunity to view the protected item.wildlife express carol wright sales,cir.susan wakeen testified that based on a previous working relationship,she sent a master skin of the lmt head to sirko via ups on july.wakeen also introduced a ups receipt into evidence to corroborate this testimony,which showed that ups picked up a package addressed to sirko from wakeen on that day.while sirko claimed that she never received the ups package,the jury rejected this testimony and determined that she did receive inferring that she saw the master skin.the jury was presented with conflicting sirko received the package containing the master skin or that she did not receive the package.because a rational juror could have believed susan wakeen testimony that she sent the lmt master skin to sirko via ups,as reflected by the ups receipt,the jury finding that sirko had access to lmt was not clearly erroneous.see bottling,at anderson city of bessemer city,d w here there are two permissible views of the evidence,the fact finder choice between them can not be clearly erroneous.
the jury access finding is further supported by the striking similarity between the lmt head and sirko doll head that provided the basis for drummer.see ty,at.this court applies the ordinary observer test to determine whether a substantial similarity existed between the two dolls heads.wildlife express,at.the inquiry under this test is whether the accused work is so similar to the plaintiff work that an ordinary reasonable person would conclude that the defendant unlawfully appropriated the plaintiff protectible expression by taking material of substance and value.id.at quoting atari,at.because the works at issue deal with the reproduction of a lifelike must prove that drummer is substantially similar to those few aspects of the work that are expression not required by the idea.wildlife express,at.
the idea in this case was a depiction of a toddler face.the artistic expression of lmt according to wakeen was an idealized child face that reflected the essence of a baby beauty and innocence.wakeen presented demonstrative exhibits and expert testimony at trial that supported the jury factual determination that lmt and drummer were substantially similar.the jury compared the two heads themselves,saw photographs of the two heads,examined porcelains of the heads,and looked at an lmt head with drummer hair in order to assess the similarities between the two works.in addition,the jury heard testimony from singer,wakeen expert,saying that the two heads facial features were virtually identical.for example,both heads portrayed a toddler with pouty lips that were lower on the right side of the mouth.
on appeal,ashton argues that to the extent there is a resemblance between lmt and drummer,this similarity is unavoidable.ashton argues that babies faces all have similar features such as large eyes,puffy cheeks,and doubled chins.ashton also claims that there are,in fact,marked differences between the two dolls.for example,it notes the small differences in size between the features of the two heads.even if we would have weighed the evidence differently than the jury,we can not reverse unless we find that there was no rational basis for the jury finding.see goodwin,at.here,there was testimony showing the similarities between the two heads,and these similarities related to features that were not necessary to capture the essence of a as a pouty expression rather than a smile and lips that were lower on the right side.thus,there was a rational basis for the jury conclusion that lmt and drummer were substantially similar.see bottling,at.
having found that wakeen successfully presented a prima facie case of copyright infringement,the jury next considered whether sirko copied lmt in designing the head that became ashton drummer,or whether sirko independently created her work.in support of its claim that sirko independently created drummer,ashton presented testimony from sirko friends.these friends claimed that they saw sirko referring to the photograph of the toddler while working on drummer.further,none of these witnesses saw the lmt master skin in sirko studio.wakeen countered that sirko had seen the master skin of the lmt,that this skin could easily be modified to produce drummer,and that sirko lacked the skill to independently create a head like drummer without copying.further,wakeen expert,singer,testified that drummer features indicated that sirko made slight modifications to the lmt master skin.on appeal,wakeen also identifies inconsistencies in the testimony of sirko friends.the jury evaluated all of this evidence and found that sirko copied lmt in producing the head that became drummer.because there were facts supporting the jury conclusion,this finding is not clearly erroneous.see wildlife express,at.
the record supports the jury findings that sirko had access to the lmt master skin,that lmt and drummer were substantially similar,and that sirko copied lmt in designing the head that became drummer.therefore,these findings were not clearly erroneous,and the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying ashton motion for jmol or for a new trial.
jury instructions 
ashton next contention is that the district court instructions to the jury were erroneous,and that these errors were prejudicial,requiring that ashton be granted a new trial.to win a new trial based on an erroneous jury instruction,ashton must show that the instructions did not adequately state seventh circuit law and it was prejudiced by the error because the jury was likely confused or misled.see gile united airlines,cir.an erroneous jury instruction could not prejudice ashton unless considering the instructions as a whole,along with all of the evidence and arguments,the jury was misinformed about the applicable law.see eeoc aic sec.investigations,cir.in other words,even if the jury instructions in this case were erroneous,if the applicable principles of law were communicated to the the arguments or evidence,for ashton does not deserve a new trial.see id.
the jury instructions in this case did not accurately present the relationship between access,substantial similarity,and independent creation as explained by this court in ty,at.specifically,the jury instruction on proving copyright infringement failed to convey to the jury that wakeen could not prevail if sirko independently created drummer in ty,at emphasis added,we held that 
access and copying may be inferred when two works are so similar to each other and not to anything in the public domain that it is likely that the creator of the second work copied the first,but the inference can be rebutted by disproving access or otherwise showing independent creation.
however,the jury instructions in this case omitted crucial information and stated access as well as copying may be inferred when a defendant sculpture is so similar to plaintiff sculpture that it is likely that the creator of defendant sculpture copied plaintiff sculpture.at oral argument,ashton conceded that it did not object to this clause during the instruction conference.therefore,ashton has waived any argument with respect to this clause.see deppe tripp,cir holding that federal rule of civil procedure means that in civil cases a plain error doctrine is not available to protect parties from erroneous jury instructions to which no objection was made at trial.
further,the district court instructed the jury that if you conclude that sirko had access to plaintiff copyrighted sculpture you should find in favor of plaintiff susan wakeen doll company if you find that defendant sculpture is substantially similar to plaintiff copyright.the problem with this jury instruction was that it suggested that wakeen could prevail on its copyright infringement claim if it proved access and substantial similarity regardless of whether sirko independently created her work.however,this suggestion was not true under seventh circuit precedent,as ashton could rebut the inference of copying stemming from a finding of access and substantial similarity by showing that sirko independently created her work.see ty,at.therefore,ashton has proved half of what it needs to prove in order to prevail on this the jury instructions did not adequately state the law of this circuit.
ashton must lose on this claim,however,because the erroneous jury instructions did not prejudice it.the fact that the district court recognized its error and eventually submitted the crucial third question to the jury meant that the jury was fully informed of the applicable legal principles,albeit in a less than ideal manner.after finding that ashton had access to lmt and that drummer was substantially similar to lmt,the jury was given a supplemental verdict form that asked it to answer a third question do you find that marlene sirko copied plaintiff copyrighted sculpture to create the sculpture that became defendant ashton drake galleries little drummer boy this question squarely addressed the independent creation defense because copying is the opposite of independent creation.see,eisenschiml fawcett publ ns,cir.if the jury answered no to this question,ashton would have prevailed.therefore,although the jury instructions did not address independent creation,this principle was communicated to the jury via the supplemental verdict form,and the jury specifically found that sirko did not independently create her work.
the evidence at trial and defense counsel closing arguments also notified the jury that ashton should prevail if sirko independently created drummer.see aic sec.investigations,at.the majority of ashton case focused on independent creation.for example,it presented evidence that sirko was an accomplished sculptor and that she used a photograph of a toddler as the model for her head that became drummer.further,three defense witnesses claimed that they saw sirko using the photograph as her model,that they never saw the master skin of lmt in sirko studio,that they conferred with sirko about certain features of her work,and that the likeness between sirko work and the photograph was obvious.this evidence helped notify the jury that ashton defense was that sirko did not copy lmt,but rather,that she independently created her work.
during closing arguments,defense counsel argued if the little drummer boy is an original creation of marlene sirko,the inquiry ends right there.if you find marlene sirko created,independently created the little drummer boy,you can go home,the case is over further,he stated was this copy is this copyright infringement the answer is no.marlene sirko created this doll.she created this with the inspiration of this child,a child she photographed in her son nursery school in germantown,pennsylvania.these two comments conveyed to the jury that ashton was relying,in part,on the independent creation defense and that if sirko independently created her work,then she did not copy lmt.
in sum,the jury instructions were erroneous in that they failed to explain that even if wakeen proved access and substantial similarity,ashton should prevail if sirko independently created her work.however,the error in the instructions was cured by the fact that the evidence and arguments conveyed the independent creation defense to the jury and by the fact that the jury specifically found that sirko did not independently create her work.therefore,ashton speculation that the jury might have decided the case differently if given the proper instruction is insufficient to establish prejudice.gile,at.
on appeal,ashton claims that the error in the jury instructions was compounded by events that occurred during closing arguments.during its closing argument,ashton counsel told the jury 
in fact,you are going to see a verdict form that says,do you find these heads substantially similar well,if you believe,if you find that there was no copying done by marlene sirko,you are going to answer that question no.i going to repeat that again to you before we are done,but if you should find that marlene sirko work is an original creation of marlene sirko,that she did not copy love me tender,that question in your jury form that says is there a substantial similarity,you have got to answer,you must answer that no.
at that point,the district court judge interrupted and commented in the jury presence counsel,that an incorrect statement,and i believe you know that,so i give them the law.
ashton claims that the district court judge comment was reversible error because it made its counsel seem deceitful and that its counsel was only trying to comply with the district court erroneous instructions.in order to obtain a reversal,ashton must show that the district court abused its discretion in supervising the closing arguments.see trytko hubbell,cir.whether lmt and drummer were substantially similar and whether sirko independently created her work were different propositions,see ty,at,and it was not true that the jury should mark no to the substantial similarity question if it found that sirko independently created her work.therefore,the district court did not abuse its discretion by interrupting counsel because of this incorrect statement.see united states briggs,cir stating that a federal judge has the right,and often the obligation,to interrupt the presentation of counsel in order to clarify misunderstandings.furthermore,the district court did not abuse its discretion by stating that ashton counsel knew it was misstating the law.see,piepenburg cutler,cir declining to reverse where district court interrupted counsel closing arguments and inferred that counsel intentionally misstated the law.
mistrial motion 
ashton also argues that the erroneous jury instructions infected the process by which the jury considered the supplemental verdict form.it complains that the district court erred by failing to declare a mistrial because of the wording of the question on the supplemental verdict form,because of the timing of when the court gave the supplemental verdict form to the jury,and because the supplemental verdict form was not accompanied by clarifying instructions.ashton bases its mistrial motion on the contention that the delibe
