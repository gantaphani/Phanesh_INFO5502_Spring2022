in this copyright infringement case,airframe systems,airframe appeals from a decision of the united states district court for the district of massachusetts.the district court granted l communications l motion for summary judgment.l,challenging the court denial of its motion for attorney fees.we affirm in both respects.
in,airframe began developing proprietary aircraft maintenance tracking software known as the airline resource management system arms.since that time,airframe has continually modified and expanded the source code of its arms software to create updated versions of the program.source code is the original version of a computer program that is written in words and symbols.source code must be compiled into object code before a computer can read and execute the software.a program in source code format can be modified by a computer programmer,whereas a program in object code format can not be easily modified.
in july,airframe registered and deposited with the united states copyright office copies of four versions of its arms source code an ibm version,created and published in reg.no.tx a pc version,created and published in reg.no.tx a unix version,created and published in reg.no.tx and a version,created and published in reg.no.tx.app.to br.of appellant,at.airframe copyright registrations became effective on april.
airframe began licensing its arms software to l in.l license was limited to the use of arms in compiled object code format.nonetheless,while performing system maintenance for l at some time in either or,airframe now former employee john stolarz stolarz allegedly acted without airframe authorization and copied some unspecified version of the arms source code files onto l computer system.solarz allegedly used the source code to modify the arms software so that it could run on l newer computers actions not authorized under l license.
in august,airframe president gordon rosen rosen discovered the unspecified version of the arms source code on l computer system while performing system maintenance.when rosen demanded an explanation for why l possessed the source code,l sent airframe a letter explaining that the code must have been installed by airframe employee stolarz.l contends that it then deleted the arms source code files from its system at rosen request.
following rosen discovery of the arms source code in l possession,airframe initiated a series of copyright infringement actions against l in the southern district of new york and the district of massachusetts this appeal arises from the third of these actions,which airframe filed in the district of massachusetts in november.
airframe alleged in the present case that l copied the arms source code to create a replacement aircraft maintenance program titled.airframe contended that l created the program by merely translating the arms source code from its original rpg programming language to the php language.airframe further alleged that l incorporated other copyrighted elements of the arms software into its program,including proprietary report formats,menu terms and headings,and the arms user interfaces 
l moved for summary judgment,contending that airframe had failed to produce sufficient evidence to support a prima facie case of copyright infringement.in opposing summary judgment,airframe relied on the undisputed fact that l had unauthorized access to some unspecified version of the arms source code on its computer system until at least august.airframe additionally offered a single declaration by rosen the principal designer of the arms software in support of its infringement allegations.rosen stated that he had examined the allegedly infringing source code and compared it to the most current version of airframe arms source code the version.after comparing about percent of the source code,rosen reported in his declaration that the programs shared almost complete identicality down to the use of improper hyphenation and misspelled words that appeared in the original arms program.app.to br.of appellant,at.rosen further reported finding programmers comments in the source code that evidenced copying,including statements such as i do not know what this code is used for so i will leave it here anyway.id.
l urged that the rosen declaration was insufficient because the arms source code version which rosen compared to the program and which was the only version that airframe produced during discovery was an updated version of the arms program created in.l contended that the updated version of the arms source code was not registered and was insufficient to establish the content of the prior source code versions covered by airframe copyright registrations including the ibm version,the pc version,the unix version,and the version.as such,l argued,airframe could not prove there was substantial similarity between the source code and the registered source code that was allegedly infringed.
the district court agreed,and it granted summary judgment for l.the court concluded that airframe ha d not produced the relevant source code and that it was airframe burden to prove the allegedly infringed source code in its original form.tr.of mot.hr g,airframe,l commc ns,cv,ecf,at.july,airframe iii.the court further stated that a comparison of updated arms source code to the allegedly infringing code simply as a matter of logic wo do.id.at.accordingly,the court concluded that airframe had failed to establish a prima facie case of copyright infringement 
airframe appealed.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.
we review the district court entry of summary judgment de novo.summary judgment is appropriate if the record reveals no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a.on appeal,airframe almost exclusively argues that the district court improperly held that its copyright registrations were invalid for failure to deposit copies of the allegedly infringed source code with the copyright office.but the district court did not find airframe copyright registrations invalid.the court focused solely on the issue of whether airframe had produced sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case of copyright infringement.see airframe,cv,ecf.while we might properly affirm the district court because of airframe failure to address the issue actually decided below,we think the best course is to address the merits of the district court summary judgment decision.in doing so,some understanding of the structure of the copyright act is necessary.
while registration is not a condition of copyright protection,a the copyright act makes registration a precondition to filing a valid copyright infringement claim under the federal statute,id.although the supreme court in reed elsevier,muchnick,recently held that the copyright act registration requirement does not implicate the jurisdiction of federal courts,id.at,proof of registration of the allegedly infringed work remains an element of a cause of action for copyright infringement,id.at.
in addition to the registration requirement,a plaintiff alleging copyright infringement has the burden of proving two elements ownership of a valid copyright,and copying of constituent elements of the work that are original.situation mgmt,asp.consulting llc,cir quoting feist publ ns,rural.serv.we focus solely on the element of copying.
the element of copying itself involves a bifurcated inquiry,because all copying does not invariably constitute copyright infringement.johnson gordon,cir see also coquico,rodriguez miranda,cir.to establish actionable copying for the purposes of copyright infringement,the plaintiff must prove both a that the defendant actually copied the work as a factual matter,and b that the defendant copying of the copyrighted material was so extensive that it rendered the infringing and copyrighted works substantially similar.situation,at quoting t peg.timber works,cir internal quotation marks omitted.proof of b oth species of copying is essential for the plaintiff to prevail.melville nimmer david nimmer,nimmer on copyright b,at.in other words,n ot all factual copying constitutes legally actionable copyright infringement the actual copying must be extensive enough to render the works substantially similar.creations unlimited,mccain,cir.conversely,even when two works are substantially similar with respect to protectable expression,if the defendant did not copy as a factual matter,but instead independently created the work at issue,then infringement liability must be denied.nimmer nimmer,nimmer on copyright b,at.
substantial similarity between the copyrighted work and the allegedly infringing work is assessed by comparing the protected elements of the plaintiff work as a whole against the defendant work.situation,at.the fact finder gauges this element by applying the ordinary observer test,under which substantial similarity is found if a reasonable,ordinary observer,upon examination of the two works,would conclude that the defendant unlawfully appropriated the plaintiff protectable expression.t peg,at quoting johnson,at however,before the foregoing comparison can take place,the plaintiff must necessarily establish the content of the copyrighted work that it contends was infringed.thus,to survive summary judgment in the present case,airframe was required to present sufficient evidence of copying including substantial similarity with respect to at least one of the arms source code versions covered by its copyright registrations.
here,the only evidence of copying airframe presented was rosen declaration.rosen made no direct comparison between the allegedly infringing program and the arms source code versions covered by airframe copyright registrations,as would normally be done.rather,he compared the program to the updated version of the arms source code.while this would support a finding of substantial similarity between the program and airframe current source code,the arms source code,there is no claim that the source code was itself registered or that the version is the same as one of airframe earlier registered versions the ibm version,pc version,or unix version.rosen declaration said nothing about similarities between the arms version and airframe earlier registered arms versions.indeed,airframe admits that they are in fact not the same,because the source code is a version that had been updated by airframe in the ordinary course of business.appellant br.having presented no evidence sufficient to prove the content of its registered source code versions,airframe can not show that any of its registered works is substantially similar to the allegedly infringing program,and airframe has failed to create a genuine issue of material fact as to its claim of copyright infringement.
this court previously addressed this precise issue in unistrut power,cir.in unistrut,the plaintiff sought to prove infringement of the version of its catalog that it had registered with the copyright office,but the only evidence the plaintiff produced was an unregistered edition of the catalog which admittedly contained some,unspecified,additions.id.at.though the edition was clearly shown to have been pirated,the court dismissed the plaintiff case for want of proof because the plaintiff had offered no proof that the infringed material was contained in the allegedly infringed edition.id.
the fifth circuit addressed a similar situation in bridgmon array,cir,which like the present case involved computer source code.because the plaintiff had offered no admissible evidence that could prove the content of his copyrighted source code,the district court found the evidence insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the copyrighted and accused programs are substantially similar.id.at.the fifth circuit affirmed,holding that the plaintiff failure to adduce evidence to allow a comparison between the copyrighted source code and the allegedly infringing program vitiates his claim.id.at.the plaintiff failure to produce sufficient evidence to prove the element of substantial similarity was fatal to his infringement claim,even though there may have been evidence of direct copying.id 
here,airframe has produced insufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact regarding the necessary element of substantial similarity.as such,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of l 
we turn next to l contending that the district court erred in denying its motion for attorney fees.we review a district court determination regarding attorney fees for abuse of discretion.spooner een,cir.apart from mistakes of law which always constitute abuses of a court discretion we will set aside a fee determination only if it clearly appears that the trial court ignored a factor deserving significant weight,relied upon an improper factor,or evaluated all the proper factors and no improper ones,but made a serious mistake in weighing them.gay officers action league puerto rico,cir internal citations omitted.
under the american rule,litigants customarily bear responsibility for their own legal fees.alyeska pipeline serv.wilderness soc y.the copyright act,however,creates an exception to this general rule by providing that a district court,in its discretion,may award a reasonable attorney fee to the prevailing party in a copyright infringement action.
in fogerty fantasy,the supreme court interpreted as requiring an evenhanded approach under which p revailing plaintiffs and prevailing defendants are to be treated alike.the court expressly rejected the practice of requiring a showing of frivolousness or bad faith before a prevailing defendant could be awarded attorney fees.id.at.the court however further noted that attorney fees are to be awarded to prevailing parties only as a matter of the court discretion.id.at.while the court found there was no precise rule or formula for exercising such discretion,the court suggested several nonexclusive factors that courts could consider,including 
frivolousness,motivation,objective unreasonableness both in the factual and in the legal components of the case and the need in particular circumstances to advance considerations of compensation and deterrence.
id.at internal citation omitted.
we have interpreted fogerty as allowing an award of attorney fees to a prevailing party if the opposing party claims are objectively quite weak.see garcia goyco law envtl.consultants,cir noting that this court has applied the fogerty factors in affirming awards of attorney fees where the plaintiff copyright claim was neither frivolous nor instituted in bad faith,but was objectively quite weak see also latin am.music ascap,cir invessys,mcgraw hill,cir holding that dishonesty is not required for an award of attorney fees even a case that is merely objectively quite weak can warrant such an award.
l contends that the district court applied an incorrect attorney fees standard.this is not a case like the supreme court decision in fogerty,at,or this court decision in edwards red farm studio,cir,where the district court denied fees solely on the basis that the claim was not frivolous or brought in bad faith.rather,the district court here quoted verbatim the factors that the supreme court suggested in fogerty,and,as the supreme court recommended,it considered other factors as well.see order,airframe,l commc ns,cv,ecf,at,quoting fogerty,at.l nonetheless argues that the court erred because it did not cite,discuss,or quote from any of the first circuit precedents which have interpreted fogerty as permitting a district court to award attorney fees when the opposing party claims are objectively quite weak.appellee br.we disagree.this court opinions in garcia goyco,at,invessys,at,and latin am.music,at,applied the fogerty standard.as such,the district court recitation of the standard as stated by the supreme court in fogerty was an accurate statement of the law,and the court was not required to elaborate by citing first circuit opinions that have applied the fogerty standard.we see no reason here to presume that the district court failed to understand the contours of the standard that it recited and applied.
l also contends that,even if the district court did apply the correct standard,the court abused its discretion in declining to award l attorney fees because airframe
