crying foul over the trademarking and continued sale of a chicken sandwich,norberto colón lorenzana and gladys goza gonzález filed suit in the united states district court for the district of puerto rico on appeal,colón challenges the district court order dismissing the federal claims brought under the lanham act and copyright act,and its declination of jurisdiction over the supplemental puerto rico law claims.see colón lorenzana am.rest,wl may.after careful review of the record,we affirm on all fronts.
we review the grant of a motion to dismiss pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b de novo,construing the facts in a light most favorable to the party.lister bank of,cir.our factual analysis is based upon the relevant allegations contained within the amended complaint.retirement cvs caremark,cir.
in,norberto colón lorenzana began working for south american restaurant corporation sarco,a franchisee and operator of church chicken locations in puerto rico.as pertinent to this action,he suggested to his superiors the concept for a new chicken sandwich that could be included on church menu.seizing upon colón idea,a series of taste tests were performed that eventually culminated with church offering the item for sale,beginning in december of.colón christened this creation the pechu sandwich.
in,wanting to protect its new item,the franchisor of church chicken applied for and received a certificate of registration from the puerto rico department of state trademarking the name pechu sandwich.the puerto rico registration,after a series of transfers,was eventually conferred on defendant sarco.in october of,and concurrent to the active puerto rico registration,sarco filed an application with the united states patent and trademark office uspto,and received a federal trademark registration for the name pechusandwich in september of.
believing that sarco misappropriated his intellectual property,colón now claims that he is entitled to a percentage of the profits derived from the pechu sandwich success.he brought suit primarily alleging a violation of section of the lanham act,see,asserting that sarco committed fraud upon the uspto in the procurement of the federal trademark for the pechu sandwich 
after both parties consented to the matter being heard before a magistrate judge,sarco promptly filed a motion to dismiss under.b.the district court,construing the pleadings generously to colón,also gleaned a claim for violations of the copyright and a second claim under the lanham act of trademark but nonetheless allowed the motion in full.this timely appeal followed.
we first determine whether any violation of the copyright act exists.for a claim alleging a violation of the copyright act to proceed past infancy,the complaint must contain sufficient factual matter,accepted as true,to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.ashcroft iqbal,d internal citation and quotation marks omitted.if the factual allegations in the complaint are too meager,vague,or conclusory to remove the possibility of relief from the realm of mere conjecture,the complaint is open to dismissal.tambone,cir en banc.
colón claims that sarco violated his intellectual property rights for both the recipe of the pechu sandwich and the name of the item itself.he asserts that the term pechu sandwich is a creative work,of which he is the author.
in assessing whether a work is suitable for copyright protection,we are mindful that t he immediate effect of our copyright law is to secure a fair return for an author creative labor and the ultimate aim is to stimulate artistic creativity for the general public good.twentieth century music aiken,d.against this rubric,congress has enumerated eight categories of works available for copyright protection 
literary works musical works,including any accompanying words dramatic works,including any accompanying music pantomimes and choreographic works pictorial,graphic,and sculptural works motion pictures and other audiovisual works sound recordings and architectural works.
contrary to colón protests on appeal,the district court properly determined that a chicken sandwich is not eligible for copyright protection.this makes good sense neither the recipe nor the name pechu sandwich fits any of the eligible categories and,therefore,protection under the copyright act is unwarranted.a recipe or any instructions listing the combination of chicken,lettuce,tomato,cheese,and mayonnaise on a bun to create a sandwich is quite plainly not a copyrightable work see a the mere listing of ingredients is not subject to copyright protection see also publ ns int l meredith,cir explaining that recipes are functional directions to achieve a result and therefore not copyrightable.as for the pechu sandwich moniker,we have previously held that copyright protection simply does not extend to words and short phrases,such as names,titles,and slogans.cmm cable rep,ocean coast,cir quoting a.colón has not articulated any reason for deviating from that sound guidance here.
thus,because neither the name pechu sandwich nor the recipe are eligible for copyright protection,no violation of the copyright act exists.
we next pivot to the meat of colón allegations and evaluate whether he has pled sufficient facts to state a claim for fraud in the procurement of a federal trademark.the district court determined that a claim under section of the lanham act must sufficiently plead that the registrant sarco made a false representation to the uspto regarding a material fact that the petitioner knew or should have known the representation was false that the petitioner intended to induce the uspto to act or refrain from acting based upon such representation that the uspto reasonably relied on the misrepresentation and that some damage was proximately caused by the uspto reliance on the false material fact.see thomas mccarthy,mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition ed.these criteria have been adopted in some form by other circuits and applied by district courts within our circuit.see,patsy italian,banas,cir robi five platters,cir san juan,san juan pools of kansas,cir bay state sav.bank bay state fin,d,linen,linen serv,d,clark cap.mgmt.navigator,llc,wl at.
in analyzing the amended complaint,the district court measured colón claim under against the heightened standards of.b.to the extent that colón presses any discernible argument against the application of rule b,he only refers in passing to a district court case stating that twombly does not require heightened fact pleading of specifics.torres bella vista,d,citing united states twombly,d.
we need not linger over the potential elements of a section claim or the application of rule b because the complaint fails for a more fundamental reason.it simply fails to sufficiently allege that any false statement exists.colón merely offers conjecture about sarco actions and intentions.he avers that sarco intentionally,willfully,fraudulently and maliciously procured the registration of plaintiff creation in the patent and trademark office without his consent and with the intent to injure the plaintiffs,but the complaint is silent as to any facts to support such conclusions.even applying the more lenient provisions of,courts do not unlock the doors of discovery for a plaintiff armed with nothing more than conclusions.iqbal at.instead,a claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual contact that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.id.citing twombly,at.colón complaint allows for no such inference.
thus,colón has failed to sufficiently plead that sarco committed fraud in the procurement of a federal trademark for the pechu sandwich 
the judgment of the district court is affirmed.
the complaint is captioned norberto colón lorenzana,gladys goza gonzález,and their conjugal partnership.for the sake of convenience,we will refer to both appellants generally as colón.
the sandwich consists of a fried chicken breast patty,lettuce,tomato,american cheese,and garlic mayonnaise on a bun.
