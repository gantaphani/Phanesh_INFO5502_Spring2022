a famous fairy tale,of ancient vintage,tells of an ugly frog who,when befriended by a beautiful damsel,turns into a handsome prince,marries his rescuer,and presumably lives happily ever after.see jacob grimm wilhelm grimm,the,reprinted in the harvard classics charles eliot,collier son.the coquí is a tree frog indigenous to puerto rico.coquico,has not yet managed to turn the coquí into an imperial presence.it has,however,fashioned a popular rendering of the coquí and,thus,turned the frog into dollars.
coquico secured a copyright on its stuffed animal to protect this amphibian revenue source.when the defendants,ángel edgardo rodríguez and identiko,began selling a competing coquí,coquico sued for,among other things,copyright infringement.the district court preliminarily enjoined the defendants from infringing coquico copyright.
the defendants appeal.concluding,as we do,that the district court did not abuse its discretion in granting the preliminary injunction,we affirm.
background 
we rehearse the factual and procedural antecedents of this appeal,credit ing the undisputed facts presented below and adopt ing the district court findings as to controverted matters to the extent they are supported by the record and not clearly erroneous.united,radio mach.workers pleasant,cir.
coquico manufactures and distributes depictions of animals.pertinently,it produces a line of plush toys portraying the coquí común,a small brown tree frog much beloved in puerto rico.this litigation concerns coquico standard coquí,registered as a work of visual art with the united states copyright office on june,under the appellation común by coquico.
in designing común,coquico hired a scientist,a photographer,and a recording engineer with an eye toward reproducing key features of the coquí appearance and avoiding zoological anomaly.this effort was successful to a degree and común displays notable features of the anuran on which it is modeled.but común nonetheless possesses several features that do not have their genesis in the frog physiognomy.these features include a brass button,a bonita bandera the puerto rican flag stitched onto the frog underbelly,and an informational hang tag 
rodríguez worked for coquico for four years,beginning in.sometime in coquico gave him access to sensitive information anent its design criteria,manufacturing processes,and profit margins.in return,rodríguez signed a agreement.
that same year,rodríguez founded identiko,with the evident purpose of designing products that would be identified with political candidates and campaigns,social movements,and the like.but in february of shortly after leaving coquico,rodríguez contacted a manufacturer in china to explore the feasibility of producing plush toys.within months,identiko began to distribute coquíes under the label wild encantos.its standard incarnation of the coquí strongly resembles común.
on may,coquico brought suit alleging,among other causes of action,that the defendants had infringed its copyright.following an evidentiary hearing,the district court entered an order preliminarily enjoining rodríguez and identiko from continuing to market the encantos coquí or otherwise infringing coquico copyright in coquíes see coquico,civ,wl,at.this interlocutory appeal ensued.we have jurisdiction under a.
ii.analysis 
on appeal,the defendants insist that the encantos coquí does not copy any original elements of común and,thus,that coquico is unlikely to succeed on its claim of copyright infringement.in the pages that follow,we lay the necessary legal foundation and then address the merits of this controversy.
the propriety of preliminary injunctive relief depends on an amalgam of four factors i the likelihood that the movant will succeed on the merits ii the possibility that,without an injunction,the movant will suffer irreparable harm iii the balance of relevant hardships as between the parties and iv the effect of the court ruling on the public interest.borinquen biscuit trading,cir.the first of these four factors normally weighs heaviest in the decisional scales.new comm wireless,sprintcom,cir.that is especially true in copyright cases because the resolution of the other three factors often turns on the plaintiff likelihood of success.see,concrete mach.classic lawn,cir.
when an appeal is taken from the grant or denial of a preliminary injunction,appellate review is for abuse of discretion.of warwick,baccarat,cir.within that rubric,we assay the district court findings of fact for clear error and its resolution of abstract legal questions de novo.air line pilots ass n,int l guilford transp,cir.in the expanse between those two poles,we afford substantial deference to the lower court j udgment calls and balancing of conflicting factors,wine spirits retailers,rhode island,cir we will disturb such determinations only if the trial court is shown to have ignored pertinent elements deserving significant weight,considered improper criteria,or,though assessing all appropriate and no inappropriate factors,plainly erred in balancing them,at.
this is a appeal.the defendants take dead aim at the district court handling of the first preliminary injunction factor likelihood of success.we cabin our discussion accordingly.
copyright protection can subsist in original designs.see a see also ty,publ ns int l,cir.the holder of a valid copyright possesses exclusive rights to reproduce and distribute not only exact copies of the toy but also derivative works based upon it.a person who trespasses upon any of these exclusive rights may be held liable for copyright infringement.id.
to prevail on a copyright infringement claim,a party must prove both control of a valid copyright and copying of original elements of the work by the putative infringer.feist publ ns,rural.serv,d.in this instance,the defendants concede that coquico obtained a valid copyright.thus,the ganglion of this appeal is the second requisite copying of original elements.
that requirement itself involves a bifurcated inquiry.first,the copyright holder must show that,as a factual matter,the putative infringer copied the protected work.segrets,gillman knitwear,cir.second,the holder must show that the copying was so egregious as to render the allegedly infringing and infringed works substantially similar.lotus dev.borland int l,cir.
of course,copyright law protects original expressions of ideas,not the ideas themselves.johnson gordon,cir.this originality requirement cuts across both the actual copying and substantial similarity branches of the analysis.thus,in conducting that analysis,an inquiring court must focus upon the constituent elements of the plaintiff work that are original.feist,at.accordingly,we turn to the binary appraisal that these principles require.
actual copying.a party may demonstrate actual copying through either direct or circumstantial evidence.yankee candle bridgewater candle,cir.coquico traversed the latter route,endeavoring to prove that the defendants enjoyed access to común and that their product the encantos coquí is sufficiently similar to común that a fair comparison of the two stuffed animals gives rise to an inference of actual copying.
rodríguez testified that he had designed the encantos coquí by making modifications to a prototype sent to him by a chinese manufacturer and that any similarities between his plush toy and coquico were the result of his desire to replicate the coquí as it exists in nature.but the district court did not credit this testimony and as the finder of fact,the court was not obliged to do so.in any event,the record offers ample circumstantial evidence to support the court finding that coquico was likely to succeed on the issue of actual copying.
it is undisputed that rodríguez,through his prolonged tenure with coquico,had access to proprietary design and manufacturing information concerning común well before identiko began fabricating the encantos coquí.what we have called probative similarity can,when accompanied by proof of access,serve as a harbinger of actual copying,see johnson,at,and the record in this case fully supports a finding of probative similarity between común and the encantos coquí.the plush toys are nearly identical in many material respects,including shape,features,stitching,shading,posture,adornment,and dimensions this combination of access to information concerning the design and production of común and the probative similarity between the two products adequately buttresses the district court determination that coquico had shown a likelihood of success on the issue of actual copying.
substantial similarity.we come now to the second step in the illicit copying pavane substantial similarity.works are substantially similar within the intendment of copyright law if they are so alike that the later unprotected work can fairly be regarded as appropriating the original expression of the earlier protected work.see yankee candle,at.to gauge substantial similarity in cases involving consumer products,courts often employ an ordinary observer test.under that metric,the allegedly infringing work will be deemed substantially similar to the allegedly infringed work if an ordinary observer would be disposed to overlook any disparities in the works.see concrete,at.
the district court found that an ordinary observer would be disposed to overlook any discrepancies between común and the encantos coquí and regard their origin as the same.coquico,wl,at.on that basis,the court found the works substantially similar.id.at.the defendants attack this finding on two fronts.we conduct the necessary triage.
the defendants first challenge accuses the lower court of relying on inapposite subject matter.that accusation starts with a correct premise that the substantial similarity inquiry must focus on those aspects of the copyrighted work that are original.see johnson,at matthews freedman,cir.from that starting point,the defendants posit that común only protected elements are its brass button and informational hang tag,which do not appear in the defendants rendering of the coquí.in their view,the remainder of común content is unprotected by operation of the merger and scènes à faire doctrines.
a court normally should commence its evaluation of this type of defense by dissecting the copyrighted work and separating its original expressive elements from its unprotected content.see,johnson,at concrete,at.in performing this dissection,the court should not lose sight of the forest for the trees that is,it should take pains not to focus too intently on particular unprotected elements at the expense of a work overall protected expression.see situation mgmt,asp.cons g llc,cir wl,at.
appellate review of the originality vel non of the constituent elements of the copyrighted work is de novo.see yankee candle,at.after careful consideration,we conclude that the defendants reasoning on this point is artificially narrow and,therefore,unconvincing.
we begin with the basics.the merger doctrine denies copyright protection when creativity merges with reality that is,when there is only one way to express a particular idea.concrete,at.the doctrine of scènes à faire denies copyright protection to elements of a work that are for all practical purposes indispensable,or at least customary,in the treatment of a given subject matter.jcw,novelty,cir.we agree that,in tandem,these doctrines foreclose copyright protection insofar as común characteristics are ineluctably and inextricably intertwined with the idea of producing a realistic depiction of a coquí.for example,coquico can not possess a monopoly on depictions of coquíes that have two eyes,two ear discs,four legs,and nine toes four front and five rear.see,satava lowry,cir aliotti dakin,cir.
by the same token,insofar as común qualities are necessary byproducts of the artistic medium,those qualities are not subject to copyright protection.thus,coquico can not use the copyright laws as a means of cornering the market for ersatz coquíes that have a soft and velutinous feel.see,country kids n city slicks,sheen,cir aliotti,at.
here,however,the defendants exaggerate the impact of the merger and scènes à faire doctrines.the attributes of común that are unprotectable by reason of these doctrines do not even come close to comparison between the two products.moreover,the district court finding of substantial similarity is grounded on a plethora of protectable attributes.
notwithstanding the defendants importunings,there is no singular manner of depicting the coquí común by way of the medium.indeed,any attempt to create a rendering of the coquí will involve countless artistic decisions,whether deliberately or intuitively made,concerning the precise size,shape,posture,color,juxtaposition of features,stitching,and adornment of the toy.the task doubtless will entail some measure of simplification certain elements of the subject will be omitted altogether while others will be stressed,perhaps to the point of exaggeration.
these considerations are borne out in the instant case.without attempting an exhaustive enumeration of común protected content,we hold that,at a minimum,the following original features are protectable 
común distinctive stitching pattern is protectable.see,segrets,at aliotti,at.
común idiosyncratic color combination is protectable.see,kay berry,taylor gifts,cir sturdza united arab emirates.
común pose is protectable.see,concrete,at.
the placement of the flag stitched onto común underbelly is protectable.see,boisson banian,cir.
común dimensions,when combined with the aforementioned elements,are protectable.see,kay berry,at.
these elements are neither inevitable concomitants of an effort to produce an anatomically correct portrayal of the coquí nor necessary byproducts of the medium.there is no evidence in the record demonstrating that común mirrors any particular coquí in nature what evidence there is about the coquí in nature suggests the contrary the coquí común exists in myriad shades of beige,brown,and tan coquíes can and do strike a wide variety of poses coquíes do not have embedded flags a rendering of a coquí need not have común precise dimensions which depart dramatically from those of coquíes in nature and,finally,the actual coquí has no stitching and,relatedly,many different stitching patterns can be used to construct stuffed animals.to cinch the matter,the record is replete with depictions of coquíes that bear little resemblance to común.
in finding substantial similarity,the district court relied on many of these protected elements,including stitching pattern,color combination,posture,and size.see coquico,wl,at.moreover,the court observed,in an earlier unpublished rescript on a different issue,that both común and the encantos coquí have puerto rican flags of the same size stitched onto the same portion of their anatomy.see coquico,civ,slip op.at.these features and observations demonstrate the defendants assertion that the district court focused too intently on unprotected content.
the defendants second challenge postulates that whatever shared qualities the two plush toys may have,those likenesses do not rise to the level of substantial similarity.this challenge lacks force.
in this regard,the defendants invoke a familiar construct that the level of resemblance required to establish substantial similarity may vary with the extent to which the copyrighted work is or is not a faithful reproduction of an object in the public domain.see,satava,at concrete,at.building on that foundation,the defendants contend that coquico copyright is not very robust because común purports to mimic a wild animal and,thus,an object in the public domain.this contention represents a triumph of hope over reason.
the simple truth is that even a realistic reproduction of a natural phenomenon may enjoy copyright protection.see,superior form builders,dan chase taxid.supply,cir kamar int l,russ berrie,cir.the determining factors are whether the work possesses original expressive elements and whether the alleged infringer has copied those elements,as opposed to gleaning them from the phenomenon in nature.the elements of original expression that we have catalogued above show beyond hope of contradiction that this is a case in which art imitates nature to a without f
