before us is an appeal from an order granting summary judgment in favor of the on a copyright infringement claim.appellant kay berry,kay berry claims that appellees taylor gifts,taylor and bandwagon,bandwagon infringed its copyright on its sculptural garden rock cast with a poem found in the public domain.the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania granted summary judgment after determining that kay berry copyright registration was invalid and that the sculptural work was not entitled to copyright protection.we will reverse.
factual background and procedural history 
kay berry designs,manufactures,markets and sells garden accent rocks,which it describes as decorative,outdoor sculptures typically resembling rocks or stones,inscribed with writings.on july,kay berry applied for a copyright registration for its entire line of garden accent rocks.it provided its garden accent rock catalog the catalog as the document specimen for the registration.the catalog identified each sculpture by number and featured a description and photograph of each individual work.the united states copyright office issued kay berry a copyright registration certificate the certificate with an effective date of july.the certificate identified the scope of the certificate subject matter as simply s culptural works with design and text.
one of kay berry garden accent rocks is sculpture,a rectangular object having a appearance and a verse inscribed on the face.the verse appears in five lines,inscribed in a font with the first letter of each word capitalized

appellant app.at.
during,bandwagon began supplying to taylor,and taylor began marketing and selling,a memory stone,which was similar to kay berry sculpture.like sculpture,the memory stone was a rectangular object with a appearance featuring the exact same verse that appears on sculpture.the memory stone verse was also laid out in the same format,each word also began with a capital letter,and the entire verse also appeared in a font.
kay berry sued taylor and bandwagon for copyright infringement and moved for a preliminary injunction prohibiting the appellees from selling the memory stone.on december,a united states magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation suggesting that the district court deny kay berry motion.the district court adopted the magistrate report and recommendation,without change,in an order dated february.
at about the same time,on february,appellees had filed an amended motion for summary judgment on the infringement claim.on august,the magistrate issued a report and recommendation suggesting that the district court grant the motion.on august,the district court adopted the magistrate judge report and recommendation as its own opinion and granted summary judgment in favor of appellees.this timely appeal followed.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to and a.this court has jurisdiction pursuant to.we exercise plenary review over the district court grant of summary judgment and employ the same analysis required of the district court to determine whether there are any issues of material fact that would enable the nonmoving party to prevail.hamilton leavy,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.at the summary judgment stage,we view all evidence and consider all reasonable inferences in a light most favorable to the party.anderson liberty lobby,d.
iii.analysis 
to establish a claim of copyright infringement,a plaintiff must establish ownership of a valid copyright and unauthorized copying of original elements of the plaintiff work.dun bradstreet software,grace consulting,cir.in granting summary judgment in favor of appellees,the district court relied on a report and recommendation which concluded that kay berry did not have a valid registration over its multiple works because they were not sufficiently related,sculpture contained no copyrightable subject matter,and sculpture embodied an expression that was inseparable from an underlying idea.for the reasons set forth below,we will reverse.
kay berry registration 
we begin by addressing the validity of kay berry copyright registration.according to a,no action for infringement of the copyright in any united states work shall be instituted until preregistration or registration of the copyright claim has been made in accordance with this title.see toy goffa int l,cir xoom,imageline,cir.kay berry claims that sculpture was properly registered under certificate of registration,which covers garden accent rocks,described as s culptural works with design and text.along with registration,kay berry deposited its garden accent rocks catalog,which featured pictures and descriptions of more than one hundred sculptures,including sculpture.kay berry claims that this registration covers sculpture along with all of the other works featured in the catalog.the district court disagreed,reasoning that the individual works featured in the catalog were not validly registered because they were not sufficiently related to each other to qualify for registration as a group of works as required by c.we believe that this reasoning improperly ignored the governing copyright registration regulations and caused the district court to evaluate kay berry registration under the incorrect statutory provision.
group registration 
initially,kay berry argued that its garden accent rocks were properly registered as a group of related works pursuant to c.the statute states in relevant part 
the register of copyrights is authorized to specify by regulation the administrative classes into which works are to be placed for purposes of deposit and registration,and the nature of the copies or phonorecords to be deposited in the various classes specified.the regulations may require or permit,for particular classes a single registration for a group of related works.
c.relying on benham jewelry aron basha,wl,kay berry claimed that when congress enacted c,it specifically attempted to liberalize the copyright laws so as to allow a group of works to be registered together,under a single registration,as long as they were minimally connected.kay berry argued that,under this permissive standard,its works were sufficiently related and therefore validly registered as a group of works under the applicable statutory provision.
although we agree that c represents a liberalization of the copyright laws,it does not define the requirements for a valid copyright registration.the applicable subsection states only that t he regulations may require or permit,for particular classes a single registration for a group of related works.c emphasis added.
it is elementary that the meaning of a statute must,in the first instance,be sought in the language in which the act is framed,and if that is plain,and if the law is within the constitutional authority of the body which passed it,the sole function of the courts is to enforce it according to its terms.caminetti united states.here,the language plainly does not grant to all copyright applicants a general right to register a group of works under a single registration.our conclusion that the plain language of c merely allows the register of copyrights to determine what types of works are eligible for group registration is confirmed by the more stringent language of c,which mandates that the register of copyrights establish regulations permitting group registration of works appearing in periodicals.see c without prejudice to the general authority provided under clause,the register of copyrights shall establish regulations emphasis added.
the register of copyrights has exercised the authority delegated by c by promulgating rules allowing for group registration for automated databases,related serials,daily newspapers,contributions to periodicals,daily newsletters,and published photographs.see b.kay berry,however,describes its garden accent rocks as sculptural works.since the register of copyrights has not promulgated regulations allowing for group registration of sculptural works,we conclude that kay berry registration is not valid under the current group registration provisions.
single work registration 
kay berry alternatively contends that its copyright registration is valid as a single work under b.this provision describes a single work,i n the case of published works,as all copyrightable elements that are otherwise recognizable as works,that are included in a single unit of publication,and in which the copyright claimant is the same.b i a.the classic example of a single work is a board game.the board,the playing pieces,and the instructions may all be individually entitled to copyright protection,but since they are packaged as a single unit the game itself,it is appropriate to allow the copyright owner to register the entire game,and protect the individual elements through that single registration.kay berry claims that its copyright registration covers its catalog deposit,and that sculpture,which was published in the catalog,is an individually recognizable element of that single work and is therefore entitled to the benefits of registration under the single work provision 
single work registration is separate and distinct from group registration.the group registration provisions were enacted pursuant to c,and were based on congress desire to liberalize the registration process.see,at,reprinted in.the single work registration provision,by contrast,was promulgated pursuant to the language of a,which states that the owner of copyright or of any exclusive right in the work may obtain registration of the copyright claim a emphasis added.this provision codified the copyright office practice of allowing copyright owners to register multiple works published together as a single work for a single fee.see registration of claims to copyright,codified at pt.at the time this provision was established,the copyright office had reserved for implementation in a separate proceeding,the possibility of providing for a single registration for a group of related works under paragraph c of section.id.
the single work registration regulation is distinct from the group registration regulation and has different qualifying requirements.the single work registration regulation is silent on whether the individual,elements of the single work be related in order to be registered.instead,single work registration requires,in the case of published works,that all of the works be included in a single unit of publication and share the same copyright claimant.b i a.
in benham jewelry,at,wl,the district court confused the requirements for single work registration and group registration.the court erroneously concluded that the single work regulation was promulgated pursuant to c not a and failed to note the distinct regulatory requirements for single work registration and group registration.id.although benham jewelry quoted the single work registration regulation,including its requirement of a single unit of publication,the court repeatedly mentioned and discussed the requirements for single registration for multiple related works or group registration.id.
in addition to confusing the regulatory provisions,benham jewelry conducted an analysis that combined the requirements of group registration and single work registration.the court concluded that the jewelry was sufficiently related both because it was marketed as a single line and shared the same basic design and had other visual elements in common.id.at.because it improperly melded the single unit of publication requirement of single work registration and the relatedness requirement of group registration,benham jewelry concluded that the single unit of publication requirement was superfluous where the works at issue were sufficiently related.id.this conclusion is incorrect because relatedness is not a requirement for single work registration.as we have shown,the single work registration regulation arises from a different statutory provision than the group work registration regulation and,as a result,we can not ignore the single unit of publication requirement as did benham jewelry.
in donald bruce multi com,the court made a similar analytical error.in that case,the court said that the group registration provision for single registration for a group of related works was at issue rather than the provision for a single work.id.at.however,during its discussion of the relatedness requirement of group registration,the court in donald bruce considered whether including otherwise unrelated works in a single unit of publication might satisfy the relatedness requirement for group registration.in other words,the court suggested that including items in a single unit of publication might serve as a proxy for relatedness.this would improperly meld the group registration and single work registration requirements.
both benham jewelry and donald bruce fail to account for the fundamental distinction between single work registration under b,and group registration under b.this distinction is significant.in this instance,kay berry garden accent rocks may not be sufficiently related but they were included in a single unit of publication and the copyright claimant is the same so,regardless of their relatedness,they may be registered pursuant to the single work registration regulation 
sculpture is entitled to copyright protection 
next,the district court concluded that sculpture lacked any protectible configuration or design.we disagree.
to qualify for copyright protection,a work must be original to the author mean ing only that the work was independently created by the author as opposed to copied from other works,and that it possesses at least some minimal degree of creativity.feist publ ns,rural.serv,d internal citations omitted.a sculptural work creativity derives from the combination of texture,color,size,and shape,as well as the particular verse inscribed and the way the verse is presented.it means nothing that these elements may not be individually entitled to protection all creative works draw on the common wellspring that is the public domain.in this pool are not only elemental raw materials,like colors,letters,descriptive facts,and the catalogue of standard geometric forms,but also earlier works of art that,due to the passage of time or for other reasons,are no longer copyright protected.tufenkian ventures,einstein moomjy,cir.when an author combines these elements and adds his or her own imaginative spark,creation occurs,and the author is entitled to protection for the result.feist publ ns,at.this is true even when the author contributes only a minimal amount of creativity.id.at.factual compilations may be copyrightable when the author chooses which facts to include,in what order to place them,and how to arrange the collected data so that they may be used effectively by readers.see also reader digest ass n,conservative digest,although no element of magazine lines,typefaces,and entitled to copyright protection,the distinctive arrangement is entitled to protection as a graphic work.
here,kay berry claims that it selected an inspirational poem from the public domain,adapted that poem to make it visually and rhythmically appealing,and then cast it on its own sculptural work.for these reasons,as well as those set forth above,we conclude that this quantum of creativity is sufficient to qualify for copyright protection.see feist publ,at.reader digest ass n,at.
kay berry copyright registration does not extend to an idea 
we next turn our attention to the second part of the infringement appellees improperly copied sculpture,and specifically,whether the expression kay berry seeks to protect has merged with an unprotectible idea.copying refers to the act of infringing any of the exclusive rights that accrue to the owner of a valid copyright,as set forth at,including the rights to distribute and reproduce copyrighted material.ford motor summit motor,cir.it may be demonstrated by showing that the defendant had access to the copyrighted work and that the original and allegedly infringing works share substantial similariti
