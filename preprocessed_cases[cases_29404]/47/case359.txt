blizzard entertainment,blizzard is the creator of world of warcraft wow,a popular multiplayer online game in which players interact in a virtual world while advancing through the game levels.mdy industries,llc and its sole member michael donnelly donnelly sometimes referred to collectively as mdy developed and sold glider,a software program that automatically plays the early levels of wow for players.
mdy brought this action for a declaratory judgment to establish that its glider sales do not infringe blizzard copyright or other rights,and blizzard asserted counterclaims under the digital millennium copyright act dmca,et,and for tortious interference with contract under arizona law.the district court found mdy and donnelly liable for secondary copyright infringement,violations of dmca a and b,and tortious interference with contract.we reverse the district court except as to mdy liability for violation of dmca a and remand for trial on blizzard claim for tortious interference with contract.
world of warcraft 
in november,blizzard created wow,a massively multiplayer online game in which players interact in a virtual world.wow has ten million subscribers,of which two and a half million are in north america.the wow software has two components the game client software that a player installs on the computer and the game server software,which the player accesses on a subscription basis by connecting to wow online servers.wow does not have or offline modes.
wow players roleplay different characters,such as humans,elves,and dwarves.a player central objective is to advance the character through the game levels by participating in quests and engaging in battles with monsters.as a player advances,the character collects rewards such as currency,weapons,and armor.wow virtual world has its own economy,in which characters use their virtual currency to buy and sell items directly from each other,through vendors,or using auction houses.some players also utilize wow chat capabilities to interact with others.
blizzard use agreements 
each wow player must read and accept blizzard end user license agreement eula and terms of use tou on multiple occasions.the eula pertains to the game client,so a player agrees to it both before installing the game client and upon first running it.the tou pertains to the online service,so a player agrees to it both when creating an account and upon first connecting to the online service.players who do not accept both the eula and the tou may return the game client for a refund.
development of glider and warden 
donnelly is a wow player and software programmer.in march,he developed glider,a software bot short for robot that automates play of wow early levels,for his personal use.a user need not be at the computer while glider is running.as explained in the frequently asked questions faq on mdy website for glider 
glider moves the mouse around and pushes keys on the keyboard.you tell it about your character,where you want to kill things,and when you want to kill.then it kills for you,automatically.you can do something else,like eat dinner or go to a movie,and when you return,you have a lot more experience and loot.
glider does not alter or copy wow game client software,does not allow a player to avoid paying monthly subscription dues to blizzard,and has no commercial use independent of wow.glider was not initially designed to avoid detection by blizzard.
the parties dispute glider impact on the wow experience.blizzard contends that glider disrupts wow environment for players by enabling glider users to advance quickly and unfairly through the game and to amass additional game assets.mdy contends that glider has a minimal effect on players,enhances the wow experience for glider users,and facilitates disabled players access to wow by the game for them.
in summer,donnelly began selling glider through mdy website for fifteen to dollars per license.prior to marketing glider,donnelly reviewed blizzard eula and manipulation policy.he reached the conclusion that blizzard had not prohibited bots in those documents.
in september,blizzard launched warden,a technology that it developed to prevent its players who use unauthorized software,including bots,from connecting to wow servers.warden was able to detect glider,and blizzard immediately used warden to ban most glider users.mdy responded by modifying glider to avoid detection and promoting its new features on its website faq.it added a subscription service,glider elite,which offered additional protection from game detection software for five dollars a month.
thus,by late,mdy was aware that blizzard was prohibiting bots.mdy modified its website to indicate that using glider violated blizzard tou.in november,donnelly wrote in an email interview,avoiding detection is rather exciting,to be sure.since blizzard does not want bots running at all,it a violation to use them.following mdy modifications,warden only occasionally detected glider.as of september,mdy had gross revenues of million based on glider license sales.
financial and practical impact of glider 
blizzard claims that from december to march,it received complaints about wow bots,several thousand of which named glider.blizzard spends annually to respond to these complaints,and the parties have stipulated that glider is the principal bot used by wow players.blizzard introduced evidence that it may have lost monthly subscription fees from glider users,who were able to reach wow highest levels in fewer weeks than players playing manually.donnelly acknowledged in a november email that mdy business strategy was to make blizzard detection attempts financially prohibitive 
the trick here is that blizzard has a finite amount of development and test resources,so we want to make it bad business to spend that much time altering their detection code to find glider,since glider negative effect on the game is debatable w e attack th is weakness and try to make it a bad idea or make their changes very risky,since they do want to risk banning or crashing innocent customers.
contact between mdy and blizzard 
in august,blizzard sent mdy a letter alleging that mdy website hosted wow screenshots and a glider install file,all of which infringed blizzard copyrights.donnelly removed the screenshots and requested blizzard to clarify why the install file was infringing,but blizzard did not respond.in october,blizzard counsel visited donnelly home,threatening suit unless mdy immediately ceased selling glider and remitted all profits to blizzard.mdy immediately commenced this action.
on december,mdy filed an amended complaint seeking a declaration that glider does not infringe blizzard copyright or other rights.in february,blizzard filed counterclaims and claims against mdy and donnelly for,inter alia,contributory and vicarious copyright infringement,violation of dmca a and b,and tortious interference with contract.
in july,the district court granted blizzard partial summary judgment,finding that mdy glider sales contributorily and vicariously infringed blizzard copyrights and tortiously interfered with blizzard contracts.the district court also granted mdy partial summary judgment,finding that mdy did not violate dmca a with respect to accessing the game software source code.
in september,the parties stipulated to entry of a million judgment against mdy for the copyright infringement and tortious interference with contract claims.they further stipulated that donnelly would be personally liable for the same amount if found personally liable at trial.after a january bench trial,the district court held mdy liable under dmca a and b.it also held donnelly personally liable for mdy copyright infringement,dmca violations,and tortious interference with contract.
on april,the district court entered judgment against mdy and donnelly for million,an adjusted figure to which the parties stipulated based on mdy dmca liability and judgment glider sales.the district court permanently enjoined mdy from distributing glider.mdy efforts to stay injunctive relief pending appeal were unsuccessful.on april,mdy timely filed this appeal.on may,blizzard timely the district court holding that mdy did not violate dmca a and b as to the game software source code.
we review de novo the district court orders granting or denying summary judgment conclusions of law after a bench trial and interpretations of state law.padfield aig life,cir twentieth century fox film entm t,cir laws sony music entm t,cir.we review the district court findings of fact for clear error.twentieth century fox,at.
we first consider whether mdy committed contributory or vicarious infringement collectively,secondary infringement of blizzard copyright by selling glider to wow players see procd,zeidenberg,cir a copyright is a right against the world.contracts,by contrast,generally affect only their parties.to establish secondary infringement,blizzard must first demonstrate direct infringement.see a m records,napster,cir.to establish direct infringement,blizzard must demonstrate copyright ownership and violation of one of its exclusive rights by glider users.id.at.mdy is liable for contributory infringement if it has intentionally induc ed or encourag ed direct infringement by glider users.mgm studios grokster.mdy is liable for vicarious infringement if it has the right and ability to control glider users putatively infringing activity and derives a direct financial benefit from their activity.id.if glider users directly infringe,mdy does not dispute that it satisfies the other elements of contributory and vicarious infringement.
as a copyright owner,blizzard possesses the exclusive right to reproduce its work.the parties agree that when playing wow,a player computer creates a copy of the game software in the computer random access memory ram,a form of temporary memory used by computers to run software programs.this copy potentially infringes unless the player is a licensee whose use of the software is within the scope of the license or owns the copy of the software.see sun microsystems,microsoft,cir sun i.a.as to the scope of the license,tou b,limitations on your use of the service,provides 
you agree that you will not ii create or use cheats,bots,mods,hacks,or any other software designed to modify the world of warcraft experience or iii use any software that intercepts,mines,or otherwise collects information from or through the program or service.
by contrast,if the player owns the copy of the software,the essential step defense provides that the player does not infringe by making a copy of the computer program where the copy is created and used solely as an essential step in the utilization of the computer program in conjunction with a machine.a.
essential step defense 
we consider whether wow players,including glider users,are owners or licensees of their copies of wow software.if wow players own their copies,as mdy contends,then glider users do not infringe by reproducing wow software in ram while playing,and mdy is not secondarily liable for copyright infringement.
in vernor autodesk,we recently distinguished between owners and licensees of copies for purposes of the essential step defense.vernor autodesk,cir see also mai.peak computer,cir triad.se.express,cir wall data,los angeles county sheriff dep t,cir.in vernor,we held that a software user is a licensee rather than an owner of a copy where the copyright owner specifies that the user is granted a license significantly restricts the user ability to transfer the software and imposes notable use restrictions.at internal footnote omitted.
applying vernor,we hold that wow players are licensees of wow game client software.blizzard reserves title in the software and grants players a,limited license.blizzard also imposes transfer restrictions if a player seeks to transfer the license the player must transfer all original packaging and documentation permanently delete all of the copies and installation of the game client and transfer only to a recipient who accepts the eula.a player may not sell or give away the account.
blizzard also imposes a variety of use restrictions.the game must be used only for entertainment purposes and may not be used in cyber cafes and computer gaming centers without blizzard permission.players may not concurrently use unauthorized programs.also,blizzard may alter the game client itself remotely without a player knowledge or permission,and may terminate the eula and tou if players violate their terms.termination ends a player license to access and play wow.following termination,players must immediately destroy their copies of the game and uninstall the game client from their computers,but need not return the software to blizzard.
since wow players,including glider users,do not own their copies of the software,glider users may not claim the essential step defense.a.thus,when their computers copy wow software into ram,the players may infringe unless their usage is within the scope of blizzard limited license.
contractual covenants license conditions 
a copyright owner who grants a nonexclusive,limited license ordinarily waives the right to sue licensees for copyright infringement,and it may sue only for breach of contract.sun i,at internal quotations omitted.however,if the licensee acts outside the scope of the license,the licensor may sue for copyright infringement.id.citing,payday,cir.enforcing a copyright license raises issues that lie at the intersection of copyright and contract law.id.at.
we refer to contractual terms that limit a license scope as conditions,the breach of which constitute copyright infringement.id.at.we refer to all other license terms as covenants,the breach of which is actionable only under contract law.id.we distinguish between conditions and covenants according to state contract law,to the extent consistent with federal copyright law and policy.foad consulting group musil govan azzalino,cir.
a glider user commits copyright infringement by playing wow while violating a tou term that is a license condition.to establish copyright infringement,then,blizzard must demonstrate that the violated b is a condition rather than a covenant.sun i,at.blizzard eulas and tous provide that they are to be interpreted according to delaware law.accordingly,we first construe them under delaware law,and then evaluate whether that construction is consistent with federal copyright law and policy.
a covenant is a contractual promise,a manifestation of intention to act or refrain from acting in a particular way,such that the promisee is justified in understanding that the promisor has made a commitment.see travel centers of am.llc brog.ch.lexis.ch,see also restatement second of contracts.a condition precedent is an act or event that must occur before a duty to perform a promise arises.aes,alstom power,d,citing delaware state law see also restatement second of contracts.conditions precedent are disfavored because they tend to work forfeitures.aes,d at internal citations omitted.wherever possible,equity construes ambiguous contract provisions as covenants rather than conditions.see wilmington tr.clark.ch.however,if the contract is unambiguous,the court construes it according to its terms.aes,d at citing d contracts.
applying these principles,tou b ii and iii prohibitions against bots and unauthorized software are covenants rather than conditions.see greenwood compucredit,cir h eadings and titles are not meant to take the place of the detailed provisions of the text,and the heading of a section can not limit the plain meaning of the text.quoting of trainmen balt.ohio.although tou is titled,limitations on your use of the service,nothing in that section conditions blizzard grant of a limited license on players compliance with tou restrictions.to the extent that the title introduces any ambiguity,under delaware law,tou b is not a condition,but is a contractual covenant.sun microsystems,microsoft,d,sun ii where sun licensed microsoft to create only derivative works compatible with other sun software,microsoft compatibility obligations were covenants because the license was not specifically conditioned on their fulfillment.
to recover for copyright infringement based on breach of a license agreement,the copying must exceed the scope of the defendant license and the copyright owner complaint must be grounded in an exclusive right of copyright,unlawful reproduction or distribution.see storage tech.custom hardware eng g consulting.contractual rights,however,can be much broader 
c onsider a license in which the copyright owner grants a person the right to make one and only one copy of a book with the caveat that the licensee may not read the last ten pages.obviously,a licensee who made a hundred copies of the book would be liable for copyright infringement because the copying would violate the copyright act prohibition on reproduction and would exceed the scope of the license.alternatively,if the licensee made a single copy of the book,but read the last ten pages,the only cause of action would be for breach of contract,because reading a book does not violate any right protected by copyright law.
id.at.consistent with this approach,we have held that the potential for infringement exists only where the licensee action exceeds the license scope in a manner that implicates one of the licensor exclusive statutory rights.see,sun i,at remanding for infringement determination where defendant allegedly violated a license term regulating the creation of derivative works 
here,tou contains certain restrictions that are grounded in blizzard exclusive rights of copyright and other restrictions that are not.for instance,tou d forbids creation of derivative works based on wow without blizzard consent.a player who violates this prohibition would exceed the scope of her license and violate one of blizzard exclusive rights under the copyright act.in contrast,tou c ii prohibits a player disruption of another player game experience.id.a player might violate this prohibition while playing the game by harassing another player with unsolicited instant messages.although this conduct may violate the contractual covenants with blizzard,it would not violate any of blizzard exclusive rights of copyright.the antibot provisions at issue in this case,tou b ii and iii,are similarly covenants rather than conditions.a glider user violates the covenants with blizzard,but does not thereby commit copyright infringement because glider does not infringe any of blizzard exclusive rights.for instance,the use does not alter or copy wow software.
were we to hold otherwise,any software copyright designate any disfavored conduct during software use as copyright infringement,by purporting to condition the license on the player abstention from the disfavored conduct.the rationale would be that because the conduct occurs while the player computer is copying the software code into ram in order for it to run,the violation is copyright infringement.this would allow software copyright owners far greater rights than congress has generally conferred on copyright owners 
we conclude that for a licensee violation of a contract to constitute copyright infringement,there must be a nexus between the condition and the licensor exclusive rights of copyright here,wow players do not commit copyright infringement by using glider in violation of the tou.mdy is thus not liable for secondary copyright infringement,which requires the existence of direct copyright infringement.grokster,at.
it follows that because mdy does not infringe blizzard copyrights,we need not resolve mdy contention that blizzard commits copyright misuse.copyright misuse is an equitable defense to copyright infringement,the contours of which are still being defined.see practice mgmt.info.am.med.ass n,cir.the remedy for copyright misuse is to deny the copyright holder the right to enforce its copyright during the period of misuse.since mdy does not infringe,we do not consider whether blizzard committed copyright misuse.
we thus reverse the district court grant of summary judgment to blizzard on its secondary copyright infringement claims.accordingly,we must also vacate the portion of the district court permanent injunction that barred mdy and donnelly from infringing,or contributing to the infringement of,blizzard copyrights in wow software.
after mdy began selling glider,blizzard launched warden,its technology designed to prevent players who used bots from connecting to the wow servers.blizzard used warden to ban most glider users in september.blizzard claims that mdy is liable under dmca a and b because it thereafter programmed glider to avoid detection by warden.
a.the warden technology 
warden has two components.the first is a software module called,which scans a computer ram prior to allowing the player to connect to wow servers.if detects that a bot is running,such as glider,it will not allow the player to connect and play.after blizzard launched warden,mdy reconfigured glider to circumvent by not loading itself until after completed its check.warden second component is a resident component that runs periodically in the background on a player computer when it is connected to wow servers.it asks the computer to report portions of the wow code running in ram,and it looks for patterns of code associated with known bots or cheats.if it detects a bot or cheat,it boots the player from the game,which halts the computer copying of copyrighted code into ram.
b.the digital millennium copyright act 
congress enacted the dmca in to conform united states copyright law to its obligations under two world intellectual property organization wipo treaties,which require contracting parties to provide effective legal remedies against the circumvention of protective technological measures used by copyright owners.see universal city studios,corley,cir.in enacting the dmca,congress sought to mitigate the problems presented by copyright enforcement in the digital age.id.the dmca contains three provisions directed at the circumvention of copyright owners technological measures.the supreme court has yet to construe these provisions,and they raise questions of first impression in this circuit.
the first provision,a a,is a general prohibition against circumventing a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under the copyright act.the second prohibits trafficking in technology that circumvents a technological measure that effectively controls access to a copyrighted work.a.the third prohibits trafficking in technology that circumvents a technological measure that effectively protects a copyright owner right.b.
c.the district court decision 
the district court assessed whether mdy violated dmca a and b with respect to three wow components.first,the district court considered the game client software literal elements the source code stored on players hard drives.second,the district court considered the game client software individual elements the discrete visual and audible components of the game,such as a visual image of a monster or its audible roar.finally,it considered the game dynamic elements that is,the experience of traveling through different worlds,hearing their sounds,viewing their structures,encountering their inhabitants and monsters,and encountering other players.
the district court granted mdy partial summary judgment as to blizzard a claim with respect to wow literal elements.the district court reasoned that warden does not effectively control access to the literal elements because wow players can access the literal elements without connecting to a game server and encountering warden they need only install the game client software on their computers.the district court also ruled for mdy following trial as to blizzard a claim with respect to wow individual elements,reasoning that these elements could also be accessed on a player hard drive without encountering warden.
the district court,however,ruled for blizzard following trial as to its a and b claims with respect to wow dynamic elements,or the experience of playing wow.it reasoned that warden effectively controlled access to these elements,which could not be accessed without connecting to blizzard servers.it also found that glider allowed its users to circumvent warden by avoiding or bypassing its detection features,and that mdy marketed glider for use in circumventing warden.
we turn to consider whether glider violates dmca a and b by allowing users to circumvent warden to access wow various elements.mdy contends that warden and resident components are separate,and only should be considered as a potential access control measure under a.however,in our view,an access control measure can both attempt to block initial access and revoke access if a secondary check determines that access was unauthorized.our analysis considers warden and resident components together because the two components have the same purpose to prevent players using detectable bots from continuing to access wow software.
construction of 
one of the issues raised by this appeal is whether certain provisions of prohibit circumvention of access controls when access does not constitute copyright infringement.to answer this question and others presented by this appeal,we address the nature and interrelationship of the various provisions of in the overall context of the copyright act.
we begin by considering the scope of dmca three operative provisions,a,a,and b.we consider them,because w e do not construe statutory phrases in isolation we read statutes as a whole.thus,the term to be construed must be read in light of the immediately following phrase united states morton,see also padash,cir we analyze the statutory provision to be construed in the context of the governing statute as a whole,presuming congressional intent to create a coherent regulatory scheme.
text of the operative provisions 
we begin,as always,with the text of the statute.hawaii office of hawaiian affairs,quoting permanent mission of india to united nations city of new york.section a a prohibits circumvent ing a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under this title.sections a and b provide that n o person shall manufacture,import,offer to the public,provide,or otherwise traffic in any technology,product,service,device,component,or part thereof,that 
emphasis added.
our harmonization of the dmca operative provisions 
for the reasons set forth below,we believe that is best understood to create two distinct types of claims.first,a prohibits the circumvention of any technological measure that effectively controls access to a protected work and grants copyright owners the right to enforce that prohibition.corley,f d at t he focus of subsection a is circumvention of technologies designed to prevent access to a work.second,and in contrast to a,b prohibits trafficking in technologies that circumvent technological measures that effectively protect a right of a copyright owner.section b prohibition is thus aimed at circumventions of measures that protect the copyright itself it entitles copyright owners to protect their existing exclusive rights under the copyright act.those exclusive rights are reproduction,distribution,public performance,public display,and creation of derivative works.historically speaking,preventing access to a protected work in itself has not been a right of a copyright owner arising from the copyright act 
our construction of is compelled by the four significant textual differences between a and b.first,a prohibits the circumvention of a measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under this title,whereas b concerns a measure that effectively protects a right of a copyright owner under this title in a work or portion thereof.emphasis added.we read b language right of a copyright owner under this title to reinforce copyright owners traditional exclusive rights under by granting them an additional cause of action against those who traffic in circumventing devices that facilitate infringement.sections a and a,however,use the term work protected under this title.neither of these two subsections explicitly refers to traditional copyright infringement under.accordingly,we read this term as extending a new form of protection,the right to prevent circumvention of access controls,broadly to works protected under title,copyrighted works.
second,as used in a,to circumvent a technological measure means to descramble a scrambled work,to decrypt an encrypted work,or otherwise to avoid,bypass,remove,deactivate,or impair a technological measure,without the authority of the copyright owner.a a.these two specific examples of unlawful circumvention under a descrambling a scrambled work and decrypting an encrypted acts that do not necessarily infringe or facilitate infringement of a copyright descrambling or decrypting only enables someone to watch or listen to a work without authorization,which is not necessarily an infringement of a copyright owner traditional exclusive rights under.put differently,descrambling and decrypting do not necessarily result in someone reproducing,distributing,publicly performing,or publicly displaying the copyrighted work,or creating derivative works based on the copyrighted work.
the third significant difference between the subsections is that a a prohibits circumventing an effective access control measure,whereas b prohibits trafficking in circumventing devices,but does not prohibit circumvention itself because such conduct was already outlawed as copyright infringement.the senate judiciary committee explained 
this is the reason there is no prohibition on conduct in b akin to the prohibition on circumvention conduct in a.the prohibition in a is necessary because prior to this act,the conduct of circumvention was never before made unlawful.the device limitation on a enforces this new prohibition on conduct.the copyright law has long forbidden copyright infringements,so no new prohibition was necessary.
at.this difference reinforces our reading of b as strengthening copyright owners traditional rights against copyright infringement and of a as granting copyright owners a new anticircumvention right.
fourth,in a b d,congress directs the library of congress library to identify classes of copyrighted works for which noninfringing uses by persons who are users of a copyrighted work are,or are likely to be,adversely affected,and the prohibition contained in a a shall not apply to such users with respect to such classes of works for the ensuing period.there is no analogous provision in b.we impute this lack of symmetry to congress need to balance copyright owners new right with the public right to access the work,pt,at specifying that the house commerce committee endeavored to specify,with as much clarity as possible,how the right against sic would be qualified to maintain balance between the interests of content creators and information users.sections a b d thus promote the public right to access by allowing the library to exempt circumvention of effective access control measures in particular situations where it concludes that the public right to access outweighs the owner interest in restricting access in limiting the owner right to control access,the library does not,and is not permitted to,authorize infringement of a copyright owner traditional exclusive rights under the copyright.rather,the library is only entitled to moderate the new right created by,and hence subject to the limitations in,dmca a 
our reading of a and b ensures that neither section is rendered superfluous.a violation of a a,which prohibits circumvention itself,will not be a violation of b,which does not contain an analogous prohibition on circumvention.a violation of a,which prohibits trafficking in devices that facilitate circumvention of access control measures,will not always be a violation of b,which prohibits trafficking in devices that facilitate circumvention of measures that protect against copyright infringement.of course,if a copyright owner puts in place an effective measure that both controls access and protects against copyright infringement,a defendant who traffics in a device that circumvents that measure could be liable under both a and b.nonetheless,we read the differences in structure between a and b as reflecting congress intent to address distinct concerns by creating different rights with different elements.
our construction of the dmca is consistent with the legislative history 
although the text suffices to resolve the issues before us,we also consider the legislative history in order to address the parties arguments concerning it.our review of that history supports the view that congress created a new anticircumvention right in a independent of traditional copyright infringement and granted copyright owners a new weapon against copyright infringement in b.for instance,the senate judiciary committee report explains that a and b are not interchangeable they were designed to protect two distinct rights and to target two distinct classes of devices,and many devices will be subject to challenge only under one of the subsections,at.that is,a is designed to protect access to a copyrighted work,while b is designed to protect the traditional copyright rights of the copyright owner.id.thus,the senate judiciary committee understood to create the following regime 
i f an effective technological protection measure does nothing to prevent access to the plain text of the work,but is designed to prevent that work from being copied,then a potential cause of action against the manufacturer of a device designed to circumvent the measure lies under b,but not under a.conversely,if an effective technological protection measure limits access to the plain text of a work only to those with authorized access,but provides no additional protection against copying,displaying,performing or distributing the work,then a potential cause of action against the manufacturer of a device designed to circumvent the measure lies under a,but not under b.
id.the senate judiciary committee proffered an example of a liability with no nexus to infringement,stating that if an owner effectively protected access to a copyrighted work by use of a password,it would violate a a 
t o defeat or bypass the password and to make the means to do so,as long as the primary purpose of the means was to perform this kind of act.this is roughly analogous to making it illegal to break into a house using a tool,the primary purpose of which is to break into houses.
id.at.the house judiciary committee similarly states of a,the act of circumventing a technological protection measure put in place by a copyright owner to control access to a copyrighted work is the electronic equivalent of breaking into a locked room in order to obtain a copy of a book.see,pt,at.we note that bypassing a password and breaking into a locked room in order to read or view a copyrighted work would not infringe on any of the copyright owner exclusive rights under.
we read this legislative history as confirming congress intent,in light of the current digital age,to grant copyright owners an independent right to enforce the prohibition against circumvention of effective technological access controls in a,congress was particularly concerned with encouraging copyright owners to make their works available in digital formats such as or,which allow consumers effectively to borrow a copy of the work for a limited time or a limited number of uses.as the house commerce committee explained 
a n increasing number of intellectual property works are being distributed using a model,where the work is effectively borrowed by the user,infrequent users of expensive software purchase a certain number of uses,or viewers watch a movie on a basis.to operate in this environment,content providers will need both the technology to make new uses possible and the legal framework to ensure they can protect their work from piracy.
our review of the legislative history supports our reading of that section a creates a new anticircumvention right distinct from copyright infringement,while section b strengthens the traditional prohibition against copyright infringement we now review the decisions of the federal circuit that have interpreted differently.
the federal circuit decisions 
the federal circuit has adopted a different approach to the dmca.in essence,it requires a plaintiffs to demonstrate that the circumventing technology infringes or facilitates infringement of the plaintiff copyright an infringement nexus requirement.see chamberlain group,skylink,storage tech.custom hardware eng g consulting,
the seminal decision is chamberlain.in chamberlain,the plaintiff sold garage door openers gdos with a rolling code security system that purportedly reduced the risk of crime by constantly changing the transmitter signal necessary to open the door.id.at.customers used the gdos transmitters to send the changing signal,which in turn opened or closed their garage doors.id.
plaintiff sued the defendant,who sold universal gdo transmitters for use with plaintiff gdos,under a.id.at.the plaintiff alleged that its gdos and transmitters both contained copyrighted computer programs and that its rolling code security system was a technological measure that controlled access to those programs.id.at.accordingly,plaintiff alleged that the selling gdo transmitters that were compatible with plaintiff trafficked in a technology that was primarily used for the circumvention of a technological measure the rolling code security system that effectively controlled access to plaintiff copyrighted works.id.
the federal circuit rejected the plaintiff claim,holding that the defendant did not violate a because,inter alia,the defendant universal gdo transmitters did not infringe or facilitate infringement of the plaintiff copyrighted computer programs.id.at.the linchpin of the chamberlain court analysis is its conclusion that dmca coverage is limited to a copyright owner rights under the copyright act as set forth in of the copyright act.id.at.thus,it held that a did not grant copyright owners a new right,but instead,established new causes of action for a defendant unauthorized access of copyrighted material when it infringes upon a copyright owner rights under.id.at.accordingly,a a plaintiff was required to demonstrate a nexus to,that the defendant trafficking in circumventing technology had a reasonable relationship to the protections that the copyright act affords copyright owners.id.at.the federal circuit explained 
defendants who traffic in devices that circumvent access controls in ways that facilitate infringement may be subject to liability under a.defendants who use such devices may be subject to liability under a whether they infringe or not.because all defendants who traffic in devices that circumvent rights controls necessarily facilitate infringement,they may be subject to liability under b.defendants who use such devices may be subject to liability for copyright infringement.and finally,defendants whose circumvention devices do not facilitate infringement are not subject to liability.
id.at emphasis added.chamberlain concluded that a created a new cause of action linked to copyright infringement,rather than a new right separate from copyright infringement,for six reasons.
first,chamberlain reasoned that congress enacted the dmca to balance the interests of copyright owners and information users,and an infringement nexus requirement was necessary to create an right that truly achieved that balance.id.at citing,at.second,chamberlain feared that copyright owners could use an access control right to prohibit exclusively fair uses of their material even absent feared foul use.id.at.third,chamberlain feared that a would allow companies to leverage their sales into aftermarket monopolies,in potential violation of antitrust law and the doctrine of copyright misuse.id.citing eastman kodak image tech,antitrust assessment techs.of wi,llc wiredata,cir copyright misuse.fourth,chamberlain viewed an infringement nexus requirement as necessary to prevent absurd and disastrous results,such as the existence of dmca liability for disabling a burglary alarm to gain access to a home containing copyrighted materials.id.fifth,chamberlain stated that an infringement nexus requirement might be necessary to render congress exercise of its copyright clause authority rational.id.at.the copyright clause gives congress the task of defining the scope of the limited monopoly that should be granted to authors in order to give the public appropriate access to their work product.id.citing eldred ashcroft,u,internal citation omitted.without an infringement nexus requirement,congress arguably would have allowed copyright owners in a to deny all access to the public by putting an effective access control measure in place that the public was not allowed to circumvent.
finally,the chamberlain court viewed an infringement nexus requirement as necessary for the copyright act to be internally consistent.it reasoned that c,enacted simultaneously,provides that nothing in this section shall affect rights,remedies,limitations,or defenses to copyright infringement,including fair use,under this title.the chamberlain court opined that if a creates liability for access without regard to the remainder of the copyright act,it would clearly affect rights and limitations,if not remedies and defenses.id.
accordingly,the federal circuit held that a dmca a action was foreclosed to the extent that the defendant trafficked in a device that did not facilitate copyright infringement.see also storage,same.
we decline to adopt an infringement nexus requirement 
while we appreciate the policy considerations expressed by the federal circuit in chamberlain,we are unable to follow its approach because it is contrary to the plain language of the statute.in addition,the federal circuit failed to recognize the rationale for the statutory construction that we have proffered.also,its approach is based on policy concerns that are best directed to congress in the first instance,or for which there appear to be other reasons that do not require such a convoluted construction of the statute language.
statutory inconsistencies 
were we to follow chamberlain in imposing an infringement nexus requirement,we would have to disregard the plain language of the statute.moreover,there is significant textual evidence showing congress intent to create a new anticircumvention right in a distinct from infringement.as set forth supra,this evidence includes congress choice to link only b explicitly to infringement congress provision in a a that descrambling and decrypting devices can lead to a liability,even though descrambling and decrypting devices may only enable access to a copyrighted work and congress creation of a mechanism in a b d to exempt certain behavior from a liability,a mechanism that would be unnecessary if an infringement nexus requirement existed.
though unnecessary to our conclusion because of the clarity of the statute text,see united states gallegos,cir,we also note that the legislative history supports the conclusion that congress intended to prohibit even circumvention and trafficking in circumventing devices.moreover,in mandating a a nexus to infringement,we would deprive copyright owners of the important enforcement tool that congress granted them to make sure that they are compensated for valuable noninfringing instance,copyright owners who make movies or music available online,protected by an access control measure,in exchange for direct or indirect payment.
the chamberlain court reasoned that if a creates liability for access without regard to the remainder of the copyright act,it would clearly affect rights and limitations,if not remedies and defenses.at.this perceived tension is relieved by our recognition that a creates a new right distinct from the traditional exclusive rights of a copyright owner.it follows that a does not limit the traditional framework of exclusive rights created by,or defenses to those rights such as fair use we are thus unpersuaded by chamberlain reading of the dmca text and structure.
ii.additional interpretive considerations 
though we need no further evidence of congress intent,the parties,citing chamberlain,proffer several other arguments,which we review briefly in order to address the parties contentions.chamberlain relied heavily on policy considerations to support its reading of a.as a threshold matter,we stress that such considerations can not trump the statute plain text and structure.gallegos,at.even were they permissible considerations in this case,however,they would not persuade us to adopt an infringement nexus requirement.chamberlain feared that a would allow companies to leverage their sales into aftermarket monopolies,in tension with antitrust law and the doctrine of copyright misuse id.citing eastman,at antitrust assessment,at copyright misuse.concerning antitrust law,we note that there is no clear issue of behavior in this case because blizzard does not seek to put a direct competitor who offers a competing game out of business and the parties have not argued this issue.if a a defendant in a future case claims that a plaintiff is attempting to enforce its dmca right in a manner that violates antitrust law,we will then consider the interplay between this new right and antitrust law.
chamberlain also viewed an infringement nexus requirement as necessary to prevent absurd and disastrous results,such as the existence of dmca liability for disabling a burglary alarm to gain access to a home containing copyrighted materials.at.in addition,the federal circuit was concerned that,without an infringement nexus requirement,a would allow copyright owners to deny all access to the public by putting an effective access control measure in place that the public is not allowed to circumvent.at.both concerns appear to be overstated but even accepting them,arguendo,as legitimate concerns,they do not permit reading the statute as requiring the imposition of an infringement nexus.as a creates a distinct right,it does not disturb the balance between public rights and the traditional rights of owners of copyright under the copyright act.moreover,a b d allows the library of congress to create exceptions to the a anticircumvention right in the public interest.if greater protection of the public ability to access copyrighted works is required,congress can provide such protection by amending the statute.
in sum,we conclude that a fair reading of the statute supported by legislative history indicates that congress created a distinct right under a without an infringement nexus requirement.thus,even accepting the validity of the concerns expressed in chamberlain,those concerns do not authorize us to override congressional intent and add a element to the statute.see in re dumont,cir w here the language of an enactment is clear or,in modern parlance,plain,and construction according to its terms does not lead to absurd or impracticable consequences,the words employed are to be taken as the final expression of the meaning intended.accordingly,we reject the imposition of an infringement nexus requirement.we now consider whether mdy has violated a and b.
blizzard a claim 
wow literal elements and individual elements 
we agree with the district court that mdy glider does not violate dmca a with respect to wow literal and individual elements,because warden does not effectively control access to these wow elements.first,warden does not control access to wow literal elements because these game client software available on a player hard drive once the game client software is installed.second,as the district court found 
wow individual nonliteral components may be accessed by a user without signing on to the server.as was demonstrated during trial,an owner of the game client software may use independently purchased computer programs to call up the visual images or the recorded sounds within the game client software.for instance,a user may call up and listen to the roar a particular monster makes within the game.or the user may call up a virtual image of that monster.
since a player need not encounter warden to access wow individual elements,warden does not effectively control access to those elements.
our conclusion is in accord with the sixth circuit decision in lexmark international static control components,cir.in lexmark,the plaintiff sold laser printers equipped with an authentication sequence,verified by the printer copyrighted software,that ensured that only plaintiff own toner cartridges could be inserted into the printers.id.at.the defendant sold microchips capable of generating an authentication sequence that rendered other manufacturers cartridges compatible with plaintiff printers.id.
the sixth circuit held that plaintiff a claim failed because its authentication sequence did not effectively control access to its copyrighted computer program.id.at.rather,the mere purchase of one of plaintiff printers allowed access to the copyrighted program.any purchaser could read the program code directly from the printer memory without encountering the authentication sequence.id.the authentication sequence thus blocked only one form of access the ability to make use of the printer.however,it left intact another form of access the review and use of the computer program literal code.id.the sixth circuit explained 
just as one would not say that a lock on the back door of a house controls access to a house whose front door does not contain a lock and just as one would not say that a lock on any door of a house controls access to the house after its purchaser receives the key to the lock,it does not make sense to say that this provision of the dmca applies to copyrighted works.add to this the fact that the dmca not only requires the technological measure to control access but requires the measure to control that access effectively,a,and it seems clear that this provision does not naturally extend to a technological measure that restricts one form of access but leaves another route wide open.
here,a player purchase of the wow game client allows access to the game literal elements and individual elements.warden blocks one form of access to these elements the ability to access them while connected to a wow server.however,analogously to the situation in lexmark,warden leaves open the ability to access these elements directly via the user computer.we conclude that warden is not an effective access control measure with respect to wow literal elements and individual elements,and therefore,that mdy does not violate a with respect to these elements.
wow dynamic elements 
we conclude that mdy meets each of the six textual elements for violating a with respect to wow dynamic elements.that is,mdy traffics in a technology or part thereof that is primarily designed,produced,or marketed for,or has limited commercially significant use other than circumventing a technological measure that effectively controls access to a copyrighted work.see.a.
the first two elements are met because mdy traffics in a technology or part thereof that is,it sells glider.the third and fourth elements are met because blizzard has established that mdy markets glider for use in circumventing warden,thus satisfying the requirement of a c indeed,glider has no function other than to facilitate the playing of wow.the sixth element is met because,as the district court held,wow dynamic elements constitute a copyrighted work.see,e,atari games oman,the audiovisual display of a computer game is copyrightable independently from the software program code,even though the audiovisual display generated is partially dependent on user input.
the fifth element is met because warden is an effective access control measure.to effectively control access to a work,a technological measure must in the ordinary course of its operation,require the application of information,or a process or a treatment,with the authority of the copyright owner,to gain access to the work.a b.both of warden two components require the application of information,or a process or a treatment to gain access to the work.for a player to connect to blizzard servers which provide access to wow dynamic elements,must scan the player computer ram and confirm the absence of any bots or cheats.the resident component also requires a process in order for the user to continue accessing the work the user computer must report portions of wow code running in ram to the server.moreover,warden provisions were put into place by blizzard,and thus,function with the authority of the copyright owner.accordingly,warden effectively controls access to wow dynamic elements we hold that mdy is liable under a with respect to wow dynamic elements accordingly,we affirm the district court entry of a permanent injunction against mdy to prevent future a violations.
blizzard b claim 
blizzard may prevail under b only if warden effectively protect s a right of blizzard under the copyright act.blizzard contends that warden protects its reproduction right against unauthorized copying.we disagree.
first,although wow players copy the software code into ram while playing the game,blizzard eula and tou authorize all licensed wow players to do so.we have explained that tou b bot prohibition is a license covenant rather than a condition.thus,a glider user who violates this covenant does not infringe by continuing to copy code into ram.accordingly,mdy does not violate b by enabling glider users to avoid warden interruption of their authorized copying into ram.
second,although wow players can theoretically record game play by taking screen shots,there is no evidence that warden detects or prevents such allegedly infringing copying this is logical,because warden was designed to reduce the presence of cheats and bots,not to protect wow dynamic elements against copying.we conclude that warden does not effectively protect any of blizzard rights under the copyright act,and mdy is not liable under b for glider circumvention of warden 
the district court granted blizzard summary judgment on its claim against mdy for tortious interference with contract tortious interference under arizona law and held that donnelly was personally liable for mdy tortious interference.we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.see canyon ferry.baptist church of east helena,unsworth,cir.we view the evidence in the light most favorable to mdy in determining whether there are any genuine issues of material fact.id.because we conclude that there are triable issues of material fact,we vacate and remand for trial.
elements of blizzard tortious interference claim 
to recover for tortious interference under arizona law,blizzard must prove the existence of a valid contractual relationship mdy knowledge of the relationship mdy intentional interference in inducing or causing the breach the impropriety of mdy interference and resulting damages.see safeway ins.guerrero,see also antwerp diamond exch.of,better bus.bur.of maricopa county.
blizzard satisfies four of these five elements based on undisputed facts.first,a valid contractual relationship exists between blizzard and its customers based on the operative eula and tou.second,mdy was aware of this relationship it does not contend that it was unaware of the operative eula and tou,or unaware that using glider breached their terms.in fact,after blizzard first attempted to ban glider users,mdy modified its website to notify customers that using glider violated the tou.third,mdy intentionally interfered with blizzard contracts.after blizzard used warden to ban a majority of glider users in september,mdy programmed glider to be undetectable by warden.finally,blizzard has proffered evidence that it was damaged by mdy conduct.
thus,blizzard is entitled to summary judgment if there are no triable issues of material fact as to the fourth element of its tortious interference claim whether mdy actions were improper.to determine whether a defendant conduct was improper,arizona employs the test of restatement second of torts.see safeway,at see also wagonseller scottsdale mem l,superseded in other respects by.the seven factors are the nature of mdy conduct,mdy motive,blizzard interests with which mdy interfered,the interests mdy sought to advance,the social interests in protecting mdy freedom of action and blizzard contractual interests,the proximity or remoteness of mdy conduct to the interference,and the relations between mdy and blizzard.id.a court should give greatest weight to the first two factors.id.we conclude that summary judgment was inappropriate here,because on the current record,taking the facts in the light most favorable to mdy,the first five factors do not clearly weigh in either side favor,thus creating a genuine issue of material fact.
nature of mdy conduct and mdy motive 
the parties have presented conflicting evidence with respect to these two most important factors.blizzard
