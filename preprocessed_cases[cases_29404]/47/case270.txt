ty is the manufacturer of beanie babies.these beanbag stuffed animals are copyrightable as sculptural works,a ty,gma accessories,cir,and are copyrighted by ty,which brought this suit for copyright and trademark infringement against publications international,pil,publisher of a series of books,with titles such as for the love of beanie babies and beanie babies collector guide,that contain photographs of beanie babies.pil concedes that photographs of beanie babies are derivative works,which,being copies of copyrighted works,can be produced only under license from pil has no license.pil defense to the charge of copyright infringement is the doctrine of fair use.on ty motion for summary judgment,the district court rejected the defense,granted the motion,and issued a permanent injunction against pil selling any of its beanie babies books.it also awarded ty pil profits from the sale of those books,million,plus more than in prejudgment interest.
the trademark claim remains in the district court,which denied summary judgment on that claim,but the court entered final judgment on the copyright claim under.b to permit an immediate appeal.however,rule b authorizes the district court to enter a final judgment on a single claim only if that claim is separate from the claim or claims remaining for decision in the district not in the sense of arising under a different statute or legal doctrine,such as the trademark statute versus the copyright statute,but in the sense of involving different facts.continental casualty anderson excavating wrecking,cir lawyers title ins.dearborn title,cir naacp american family mutual ins,cir see general electric,d advanced magnetics,bayfront partners,cir,cir.otherwise the appellate court would have to go over the same ground when the judgment terminating the entire case was appealed.
at first glance the factual overlap might seem complete in this case,since the identical images,pil photographs of beanie babies,are claimed to infringe both ty copyrights and its trademarks.but the only facts before us on this appeal,the facts bearing on pil defense of fair use,are unlikely to be at issue in the trademark phase of the case.moreover,although the district court issued a permanent rather than a preliminary injunction,that injunction is appealable immediately,irrespective of rule b,by virtue of the provision of the judicial code that permits interlocutory orders granting injunctions to be appealed.a.although this provision is ordinarily used to permit the immediate appeal of preliminary temporary injunctions,it is not so limited as a matter either of statutory language or statutory purpose.united states hansen,cir prohosky prudential ins,cir parks pavkovic,cir fielder credit acceptance,cir warren publishing,microdos data,and cir en banc charles alan wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice and procedure,ed.an order is interlocutory when it does not wind up the litigation in the court issuing the order,and that is the character of the permanent injunction that the district court issued in this case.and while one reason for permitting the immediate appeal of a preliminary injunction is that such an injunction is entered after a summary proceeding,increasing the risk of error,that turns out to be the character of the permanent injunction in this case as well it was issued in response to a motion for summary judgment,and not after a trial.
the main reason for allowing the interlocutory appeal of an injunction,moreover,is that an injunction is likely to inflict irreparable harm on the defendant,that is,harm that a reversal will not cure.the harm will be prolonged and thus increased if the defendant must await the completion of further proceedings in the district court before challenging the injunction in the court of appeals.this is true whether the injunction is permanent or fact it is truer for the former.the purpose of an injunction bond is to compensate the defendant,in the event he prevails on the merits,for the harm that an injunction entered before the final decision caused him,and so it is required only for a temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction.c,not for a permanent injunction.
so we have jurisdiction by virtue both of rule b and section a,and thus can proceed to the merits,where the only question is whether pil is entitled to a trial on its defense of fair use.fair use is a mixed question of law and fact,harper row publishers,nation enterprises,d,which means that it may be resolved on summary judgment if a reasonable trier of fact could reach only one conclusion but not otherwise.narell freeman,cir see also association of american medical colleges cuomo,cir.
the defense of fair use,originally,now codified,plays an essential role in copyright law.without it,any copying of copyrighted material would be a copyright infringement.a book reviewer could not quote from the book he was reviewing without a license from the publisher.quite apart from the impairment of freedom of expression that would result from giving a copyright holder control over public criticism of his work,to deem such quotation an infringement would greatly reduce the credibility of book reviews,to the detriment of copyright owners as a group,though not to the owners of copyright on the worst books.book reviews would no longer serve the reading public as a useful guide to which books to buy.book reviews that quote from copy the books being reviewed increase the demand for copyrighted works to deem such copying infringement would therefore be perverse,and so the doctrine permits such copying.desnick american broadcasting companies,cir dictum william landes,copyright,borrowed images,and appropriation art an economic approach,geo.mason,lawrence lessig,the law of the horse what cyberlaw might teach,harv.on the other hand,were a book reviewer to quote the entire book in his review,or so much of the book as to make the review a substitute for the book itself,he would be cutting into the publisher market,and the defense of fair use would fail.harper row,publishers,nation enterprises,cir dissenting opinion,rev,d see harper row,publishers,nation enterprises,d worldwide church of god philadelphia church of god,cir consumers union of united states,general signal,cir.
generalizing from this example in economic terminology that has become orthodox in case law,we may say that copying that is complementary to the copyrighted work in the sense that nails are complements of hammers is fair use,but copying that is a substitute for the copyrighted work in the sense that nails are substitutes for pegs or screws,or for derivative works from the copyrighted work,see melville nimmer david nimmer,nimmer on copyright b,is not fair use.on davis v.the gap,cir suntrust bank houghton mifflin,cir concurring opinion wendy gordon,fair use as market failure a structural and economic analysis of the betamax case and its predecessors,colum,see consumers union of united states,general signal,supra,at.if the price of nails fell,the demand for hammers would rise but the demand for pegs would fall.the hammer manufacturer wants there to be an abundant supply of cheap nails,and likewise publishers want their books reviewed and would want reviews inhibited and degraded by a rule requiring the reviewer to obtain a copyright license from the publisher if he wanted to quote from the book.so,in the absence of a doctrine,most publishers would disclaim control over the contents of reviews.the doctrine makes such disclaimers unnecessary.it thus economizes on transaction costs.
the distinction between complementary and substitutional copying as it seems to us,to be between transformative and superseding copies,see,campbell music,d is illustrated not only by the difference between quotations from a book in a book review and the book itself,marion stewart,calculating economic damages in intellectual property disputes the role of market definition,patent trademark office society,but also by the difference between parody fair use and burlesque often not fair use.a parody,which is a form of criticism or otherwise,is not intended as a substitute for the work parodied.but it must quote enough of that work to make the parody recognizable as such,and that amount of quotation is deemed fair use.campbell music,supra,at,and.suntrust bank houghton mifflin,supra,at leibovitz paramount pictures,cir seuss enterprises,penguin books usa,cir nimmer nimmer,supra,c,to.a burlesque,however,is often just a humorous substitute for the original and so cuts into the demand for it one might choose to see abbott and costello meet frankenstein or young frankenstein rather than frankenstein,or love at first bite rather than dracula,or even clueless rather than emma.burlesques of that character,catering to the segment of the original market,are not fair use.benny loew,cir,aff.by an equally divided court under the name columbia broadcasting system,loew,d per curiam see nimmer nimmer,supra,b,to,c campbell music,supra,at and.the distinction is implicit in the proposition,affirmed in all the cases we have cited,that the parodist must not take more from the original than is necessary to conjure it up and thus make clear to the audience that his work is indeed a parody.if he takes much more,he may begin to attract the audience away from the work parodied,not by convincing them that the work is no good for that is not a substitution effect but by providing a substitute for it.
book reviews and parodies are merely examples of types of work that quote or otherwise copy from copyrighted works yet constitute fair use because they are complements of though sometimes negative complements,as in the case of a devastating book review rather than substitutes for the copyrighted original.the commonest type is simply a quotation from a copyrighted work in a book or article on the same or a related subject.the complementary effect may be quite weak,but the quotation is unlikely to reduce the demand for the copyrighted work nor could the copyright owner command a license fee commensurate with the costs of transacting with the copier.such copying is therefore fair use.
were control of derivative works not part of a copyright owner bundle of rights,it would be clear that pil books fell on the complement side of the divide and so were sheltered by the defense.a photograph of a beanie baby is not a substitute for a beanie baby.no one who wants a beanie baby,whether a young child who wants to play with it or an adult or older child who wants to collect beanie babies,would be tempted to substitute a photograph.but remember that photographs of beanie babies are conceded to be derivative works,for which there may be a separate demand that ty may one day seek to exploit,and so someone who without a license from ty sold photographs of beanie babies would be an infringer of ty sculpture copyrights.the complication here is that the photographs are embedded in text,in much the same way that quotations from a book are embedded in a review of the book.ty regards the text that surrounds the photographs in pil beanie baby books as incidental implicitly it compares the case to one in which a book reviewer quotes the whole book in his review.or to a case in which a purveyor of pornographic pictures pastes a copy of the declaration of independence on the back of each picture and argues that judged as a whole his product has redeeming social value.united states v.a motion picture film entitled i am,cir friendly,concurring see valentine chrestensen.pil argues,to the contrary,that the photographs are indispensable to the creation of a collectors guide to beanie babies and,as we see shortly,collectors guides are not derivative works.
the proper characterization of pil beanie baby books is the kind of issue appropriate for summary judgment only in extreme cases,which this case is part because of differences among the books that the district court found infringed ty copyright.at one end of the spectrum is for the love of beanie babies.this book with hard shiny covers seems directed at a child audience.all the different beanie babies,more than of them,are pictured.each picture is accompanied by a brief commentary.some of the commentary seems aimed exclusively at a child or infantile adult audience,such as the commentary on snip the siamese cat that darn cat has nerve just like the real thing,ty siamese has plenty of attitude.the cat with black eyes and points is a beautiful specimen of the far eastern breed.and she knows it stretched out on all fours,this finicky feline is the only purebred in ty cathouse.this pretty kitty is definitely the cat meow.the commentary seems distinctly secondary to the photograph.an even clearer case is a spread in for the love of beanie babies entitled kitty corner,which we reproduce without ty permission a good example of the doctrine in action at the end of this opinion.the text is childish and pretty clearly secondary to the more than photograph of feline beanie babies.some of the commentary on photographs in for the love of beanie babies does contain information relevant to collectors,such as allys with older tags are very difficult to find.retired.retired means no longer being manufactured.but for the love of beanie babies might well be thought essentially just a collection of photographs of beanie babies,and photographs of beanie babies are derivative works from the copyrighted beanie babies themselves.
at the opposite extreme is pil beanie babies collector guide.this is a small paperback book with small print,clearly oriented toward adult,as the title indicates,toward collectors.each page contains,besides a photograph of a beanie baby,the release date,the retired date,the estimated value of the beanie baby,and other information relevant to a collector,such as that spooky is the only beanie ever to have carried his designer name,or that prance should be a member of the beanie line for some time,so do panic and pay high prices for her just because she fairly new.
some of the text is quite critical,for example accusing ty of frequent trademark infringements.ty does like criticism,and so the copyright licenses that it grants to those publishers whom it is willing to allow to publish beanie baby collectors guides reserve to it the right to veto any text in the publishers guides.it also forbids its licensees to reveal that they are licensees of ty.its standard licensing agreement requires the licensee to print on the title page and back cover of its publication the following misleading statement this publication is not sponsored or endorsed by,or otherwise affiliated with ty.all copyrights and trademarks of ty are used by permission.all rights reserved.notice the analogy to a publisher attempting to use licensing to prevent critical reviews of its attempt that the doctrine of fair use blocks.see suntrust bank houghton mifflin,supra,at concurring opinion.we need not consider whether such a misleading statement might constitute copyright misuse,endangering ty copyrights.see,a m records,napster,cir practice management information american medical association,amended,cir lasercomb america,reynolds,cir.
but we do need to explain the oddity of there being collectors guides for a line of children toys otherwise it might seem clear that the beanie babies collector guide was a device for circumventing ty lawful monopoly of derivative works.as a marketing gimmick,ty deliberately creates a shortage in each beanie baby by selling it at a very low price and not producing enough copies to clear the market at that price.as a result,a secondary market is created,just like the secondary market in works of art.the secondary market gives widespread publicity to beanie babies,and the shortage that creates the secondary market stampedes children into nagging their parents to buy them the latest beanie babies,lest they be humiliated by not possessing the beanie babies that their peers possess.ty,gma accessories,supra,at.the appeal is to the competitive conformity of also to the mentality of collectors.
when beanie babies collector guide was published in,some beanie babies were selling in the secondary market for thousands of dollars,while others were selling for little more than their original purchase price.the range was vast,creating a demand for collectors guides.ty acknowledges
