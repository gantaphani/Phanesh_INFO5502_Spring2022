background 
bmi is one of the largest performing rights organizations in the country.it grants licenses to music users,collects license fees from them,and distributes the royalties among its affiliated copyright holders affiliates.its affiliates comprise approximately songwriters,composers,and publishers,and its catalog includes about three million musical works.applicants muzak llc and aei music network,provide music environments,often referred to as background music services,to various commercial clients such as restaurants,retailers,department stores,offices,and supermarkets.the services are provided either by delivery of discs or tapes to the clients,or by satellite transmission.
in,the united states brought separate antitrust suits against bmi and its main competitor,the american society of composers,authors and publishers ascap,for unlawfully monopolizing the licensing of performing rights.both suits were settled by consent decree.united states broadcast music,trade cas.cch,united states am.soc y of composers,authors,and publ rs ascap,trade cas.cch,amended,trade cas.cch,ascap decree.in,the ascap consent decree was amended to establish a rate court mechanism,which enabled the court to set fees for licenses when license applicants and ascap could not come to agreement.united states ascap,trade cas.cch.the government brought the instant suit against bmi in,and the parties entered into a consent decree two years later.united states broadcast music,trade cas.cch,amended,wl,at,trade cas.cch,bmi decree or decree.
the bmi decree places a number of specific restrictions on bmi.among other things,the decree prohibits bmi from itself publishing,recording or distributing music commercially section iv b,from refusing to contract with a potential affiliate section v a,and from discriminating between licensees section viii.
the decree specifically requires that bmi grant certain types of licenses.section viii b requires that bmi license to any broadcaster the rights publicly to perform its repertory by broadcasting on either a per program or per programming period basis,at bmi option per program license.section ix c prohibits bmi from refusing to license to music users other than broadcasters,such as applicants,a license at a price or prices to be fixed by bmi with the consent of the copyright proprietor for the performance of such specific,per piece musical compositions,the use of which shall be requested by the prospective licensee per piece license.in addition,section iv a prohibits bmi from preventing writers or publishers of a composition from directly licensing their work to a music user.
traditionally,the bmi license of choice has been a blanket license,a license that grants the licensee access to bmi entire repertory in exchange for an annual fee.in applicants case,that fee has always been based on the number of licensee locations that use works,on a per premise basis.the bmi decree does not specifically mention the blanket license however,bmi has historically offered it and applicants have recently held blanket licenses.
in,bmi filed a motion in the district court for an amendment to the bmi decree adding a rate court provision similar to the provision added to the ascap decree in.in support of its motion,bmi argued that an orderly procedure would be a more efficient way to deal with negotiation breakdowns a rate court would balance competition between bmi and ascap more fairly the major users of bmi music,radio,television,and cable broadcasters and programmers had asked bmi to seek such a provision and an interim fee mechanism in the amendment would provide for a continuing relationship between bmi and music users when disputes arose.the government assented,concluding that a rate court provision would be in the public interest because it would foster competition,thereby furthering the antitrust goals behind the original suit.the user community also supported the motion,arguing that a rate court provision would establish a check on anticompetitive behavior such as demands for arbitrary,substantial,and unwarranted fee increases,threats of copyright infringement litigation,and use of litigation in order to force users to accede to bmi fee demands.bmi motion was granted.united states broadcast music,wl,at,trade cas.cch.the new provision was added as section xiv,and provides in pertinent part 
defendant,bmi shall,within ninety days of its receipt of a written application from an applicant for a license for the right of public performance of any,some or all of the compositions in defendant repertory,advise the applicant in writing of the fee which it deems reasonable for the license requested.if the parties are unable to agree upon a reasonable fee within sixty days,the applicant may forthwith apply to this court for the determination of a reasonable fee if the parties are unable to agree upon a reasonable fee within ninety days,then defendant may forthwith apply to this court for the determination of a reasonable fee 
id.section xiv b provides that the rate court shall set an interim fee to be paid while the section xiv a proceeding is pending,and that the permanent fee determined by the rate court will apply retroactively to the date the applicant requested a license.
the most recent license that applicants held was the traditional blanket license,which expired in.while the parties negotiated for a new license,the blanket license was extended on the same terms,and the parties agreed that any new license would be made retroactive to january.bmi terminated these agreements on july.in april,applicants,in anticipation of this termination,invoked section xiv rate court provision and requested quotations for blanket license,per program license,and per channel license fees such that muzak aei will be required to pay bmi solely with respect to such musical programming and individual channels delivered to their subscribers as actually contain bmi music.applicants later supplemented this request with a request for per piece license fees.in response,bmi provided a quote for a blanket license fee using its traditional per premises calculation,and asked for further information regarding the per program and per channel fees.when negotiations reached an impasse,bmi filed a motion in district court on december,pursuant to section xiv of the bmi consent decree,requesting that the court determine a reasonable fee for the period covering through.applicants then moved for a determination that certain license forms are within this court rate setting authority under section xiv of the bmi consent decree.in addition to seeking per program and per channel licenses which are not at issue in this appeal,applicants sought a rate determination for the blanket license subject to,a license that would enable a licensee to reduce its fee obligation to bmi to the extent it had licensed works represented by bmi directly with bmi composer and music publisher affiliates.according to applicants,bmi had flatly refused to entertain such a license fee structure.applicants also sought a declaration that per piece license fees set by bmi are subject to the court authority under section xiv.
the district court,inter alia,denied applicant motion with respect to their request for a blanket license subject to,granted it with respect to their request for a per piece license,and declined to determine whether or not,after a per piece license fee had been set by the court,the copyright holder of the licensed work could reject the fee.united states broadcast music,in re application of aei music network,wl,at,trade cas.cch in re appl.of aei.
with respect to applicants request for a rate determination on the blanket license subject to,the court concluded that to require bmi to offer such a license would stretch the concept of too far and denied their request.id.at.the court rejected applicants characterization of their motion as one for a rate determination on the blanket license,reasoning that 
the rate is not the only thing changed in such a license it would also alter the legal rights of the parties.in addition to access to all of bmi repertory of music regardless of which titles the licensee chooses to play for one flat fixed fee,the licensee would also gain the additional right to use some of the repertory for nothing,if he obtains a direct license for it elsewhere th is change is a change in the rights of the licensor and licensee,not merely a change in price.
the court also rejected the notion that the phrase any,some or all in section xiv a means that bmi must offer any type of license that is requested under the decree.the court concluded that the language of section xiv a serves only to establish the machinery for requesting and determining reasonable fees for those licenses which are mandated elsewhere in the decree.id.in reaching this conclusion,the court relied on this court opinion in united states ascap application of shenandoah valley broadcasting,cir friendly,shenandoah,in which we interpreted an identically worded provision in the ascap decree and concluded that in the context of the overall decree,the sentence relates to requests for licenses which some other portion of the judgment required ascap to grant.in re appl.of aei,wl,at quoting shenandoah,at.therefore,concluded the court,bmi can not be required to provide a form of license that is not specifically mandated under the decree.id.
with respect to per piece licenses,the district court concluded that since n othing in the decree suggests that per piece licensing is not subject to the provisions of section xiv,it possesses jurisdiction to determine a reasonable fee for a per piece license.id.at.the court declined,however,to determine whether the language in section ix c with the consent of the copyright proprietor means that,after the court has made such a determination,the copyright holder consent is still required.d etermination of that issue would be advisory only,the court reasoned,since the issue has been neither presented by a copyright holder refusal,nor adequately briefed by the parties.id.
ii.discussion 
the district court had jurisdiction over this antitrust action pursuant to,and it possessed jurisdiction over the enforcement and construction of the bmi decree pursuant to section xiii of the decree,united states broadcast music,trade cas.cch,at and it possessed jurisdiction over the rate determination proceeding pursuant to section xiv a of the bmi decree,united states broadcast music,wl,at.the district court has entered final judgment pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b with respect to the claims now on appeal,and we exercise jurisdiction pursuant to.
we review the district court interpretation of a consent decree de novo,and its factual findings for clear error.see eeoc times,cir berger heckler,cir the construction of a consent decree is an issue of law freely reviewable by this court.
because consent decrees embody a compromise between parties who have waived their rights to litigation,they should be construed basically as contracts.united states itt cont l baking,d.when the language of a consent decree is unambiguous,the scope of a consent decree must be discerned within its four corners,and not by reference to what might satisfy the purposes of one of the parties to it.united states armour,d see also united states am.cyanamid,cir applying the four corners rule when decree language was quite clear.thus,deference is to be paid to the plain meaning of the language of a decree and the normal usage of the terms selected.berger,at.however,w here a term of a consent decree is ambiguous,a court may consider extrinsic evidence to ascertain the parties intent,including the circumstances surrounding the formation of the decree.king allied vision,cir see also local,int l of bridge,structural and ornamental iron workers,cir.a court reviewing an ambiguous consent decree provision may also examine any technical meaning words used may have had to the parties,and any other documents expressly incorporated in the decree.itt cont l baking,at.see also reynolds roberts,cir approving for the interpretation of ambiguous consent decree provisions,evidence of party negotiations,prior course of performance,prior course of dealing,usage of trade,and traditional contract presumptions such as construing contracts against the drafting party.in addition,when faced with unclear language in a consent decree,a court of equity may,in construing the provision,consider the purpose of the provision in the overall context of the judgment at the time the judgment was entered.using its equitable power,a court may modify a decree in response to changed conditions.am.cyanamid,at citing united states swift.
applicants blanket license request 
applicants and both parties to the bmi decree agree that the district court has the authority under section xiv to set a reasonable fee for the traditional blanket license.we agree as well.
although the decree does not mention the blanket license by name,the plain language of section xiv requires that bmi quote a fee for the blanket license.the provision requires that bmi shall upon receipt of a written application for a license for the right of public performance of all of the compositions in defendant repertory,advise the applicant in writing of the fee it deems reasonable.since a request for a blanket license is simply a request for a license for performance rights to all of the compositions in defendant repertory,we read section xiv to require that bmi quote a fee for a blanket license and,if the parties can not agree,submit to the district court rate determination proceeding.
moreover,the overall context of the judgment at the time the judgment was entered and amended,am.cyanamid,at,makes clear that the parties contemplated both that bmi would always offer a blanket license and that section xiv would apply to requests for blanket licenses.bmi contends,for example,that by it was so well understood that bmi would always want to offer its blanket license that it would have been superfluous to enter an order requiring bmi to do so.similarly,the government stated in its memorandum in response to bmi motion to modify the decree that f or most bulk music users the convenience and efficiency of blanket licensing may make it the licensing method of choice.for these users,a rate court provision may provide additional protection against any attempt by bmi to exercise market power in the pricing of its blanket license.
we therefore have no trouble concluding that section xiv a requires bmi,upon request for a blanket license,to quote a fee it deems reasonable for that license,and that section xiv a empowers the district court to se
