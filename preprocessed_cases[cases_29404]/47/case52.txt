cambridge literary properties cambridge brought this suit against goebel porzellanfabrik.kg.goebel,a german limited partnership,and others associated with it the complaint sought a share in the profits gained by defendants from the use of images taken from the hummel book in which cambridge claims a copyright interest.the district court granted defendants rule b motion and dismissed the case for lack of personal jurisdiction.we describe the underlying events in the light most favorable to cambridge as the party.york,alioto,cir.
the hummel book contains images of children drawn by a german nun,sister berta maria innocentia hummel,accompanied by the verse of an austrian poet,margarete seemann.emil fink verlag,a german citizen,first published the book in german in under contract with hummel and seemann.fink registered the book as a foreign publication under copyright law in and later introduced an english language version of the book into the united states.
cambridge claims that for purposes of copyright law the hummel book is a work of joint authorship by hummel,seemann,and fink who apparently contributed some illustrations.see see generally goldstein,copyright ed.supp.thus,cambridge says,the original authors each held an ownership interest as a tenant in common in the original copyright.in,fink renewed the copyright.under the then applicable copyright act of,pub,stat.repealed,the renewal interests belonged to the original owners,or to their heirs,regardless of any intervening assignments under the original copyright.miller music charles daniels,d.
cambridge claims an ownership interest in the renewal copyright by purchase from the heirs of seemann,who died in austria in.cambridge says goebel and goebel art have at various times owned the other interests in the renewal copyright.goebel,according to cambridge,purchased fink interest in,before assigning it to a swiss company,ars ag,allegedly half owned and controlled by goebel art,in.goebel art allegedly acquired the other share,tracing back to sister hummel,from goebel former distributor,schmid brothers,in.
illustrations in the hummel book allegedly served as models for a continuing series of porcelain figurines,called hummels.these figurines have proved popular with collectors in america.goebel,or one or more related predecessor partnerships,have apparently been manufacturing the figurines since.individual hummel figurines sell for several hundred dollars apiece and the direct revenues from american sales are alleged to be in the millions.
cambridge asserts that the figurines comprise derivative works and their sale in the united states is governed by the renewal copyright in the hummel book.each of the renewal copyright,says cambridge,is free to exercise rights under the copyright but owes a share of the profits to each other.see goldstein,supra.on this basis,cambridge claims a share of the profits garnered by goebel from sales of the figurines and certain indirect profits reaped by goebel art allegedly,goebel art markets the figurines and operates a lucrative club for hummel collectors in the united states using images derived from the book.
in february,cambridge brought the present suit in federal district court in massachusetts,seeking an accounting and imposition of a constructive trust to recover its alleged share of the profits.the defendants responded by filing a motion to dismiss under rule b for lack of personal jurisdiction cambridge main response was that the district court had specific jurisdiction under the massachusetts statute,which provides most pertinently that 
a court in massachusetts may exercise personal jurisdiction over a person,who acts directly or by an agent,as to a cause of action in law or equity arising from the person a transacting any business in this commonwealth 
after the filing of memoranda,documents,and affidavits,the district court dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction.the district court assumed,at least for purposes of argument,that goebel had transacted business in massachusetts by shipping all of its hummel figurines from its factory in germany to its independent distributor,schmid brothers,in massachusetts,at least from to.at their peak,these shipments totaled over million annually.after,goebel shipped the hummels to a new jersey company that was a wholly owned subsidiary of goebel art.
however,the district court held that cambridge had not satisfied the further requirement of showing that its claims arose from these shipments.the court said that accounting and constructive trust are merely remedies and cambridge claim to a share of profits depended on its establishing a series of propositions,that seemann was a joint author and that cambridge held a valid ownership interest through her heirs.these in turn depended,said the court,on events in europe dating back many years and had no connection with sales or distribution in massachusetts.the district court then dismissed as to all defendants.cambridge now appeals.
the issues on appeal are largely legal ones subject to de novo review.boit,cir.because the court did not hold an evidentiary hearing,we must look to the pleadings and supplemental filings to determine whether cambridge has alleged facts sufficient to support the exercise of jurisdiction under both the statute and the constitution.lyle richards int l,ashworth,cir.
to begin with what is undisputed,cambridge does not rely on any special federal statute providing for nationwide or otherwise expanded service.see janmark,reidy,cir.indeed,it is unlikely that any federal cause of action is asserted,even though federal law is the source of the hummel book copyright itself.in all events,the district court properly considered whether a massachusetts state court could exercise personal jurisdiction over the defendants.see sawtelle farrell,cir.
however,the jurisdictional inquiry is largely a federal constitutional one.massachusetts courts construe section a transacting business requisite as extending jurisdiction as far as permitted by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.tatro manor care,see also automatic sprinkler of am.seneca foods.we have on occasion held jurisdiction to be barred on due process grounds where the literal terms of the statute might seem to permit it.bond leather,show,cir.so,in the ordinary case,we can proceed directly to the constitutional due process test.see sawtelle,at.
the due process cases impose three requirements on the exercise of specific personal jurisdiction over defendants.united,radio and mach.workers of am.pleasant,cir.by contrast,if a defendant has continuous and systematic contacts with the state,courts in the state may exercise general jurisdiction over any cause of action against the defendant.id.at.to begin,the defendant must have purposeful minimum contacts with the state.further,the exercise of jurisdiction must be reasonable under the circumstances.the third requirement,on which this case turns,is that the plaintiff claims be related to the defendant contacts.at.
section a expresses this relatedness requirement by addressing itself only to claims arising from the transaction of business in massachusetts.however,relatedness may be a broader concept,and we assume massachusetts courts would again construe the statute as extending to its constitutional limit.tatro,at.in sum,under section a and the constitution,specific jurisdiction requires a nexus between the claim and defendant activities thus the district court quite properly focused at the outset on the relationship between goebel massachusetts contacts and cambridge claims.
as previously noted,goebel direct sales to massachusetts were substantial for a period ending in the shipment of large quantities of goods into a state,even,can satisfy the minimum contacts prong of the due process inquiry.see vencedor,gougler,cir buckeye,fila sports,mark obear sons.but the district court ultimately concluded that there was an insufficient causal nexus between plaintiff claims and goebel massachusetts contacts.to test that conclusion,we must ask,what are those claims and what conduct do they subsume 
the current federal copyright statute,although recog
