the question presented,one of first impression in the courts of appeals,is whether an action for infringement by one of a song can be defeated by a retroactive transfer of copyright ownership from another to an alleged infringer.this action arises under the current statute governing copyright law,the copyright act of,et the copyright act,because the complaint is in part for a remedy expressly granted by the copyright act,a suit for infringement,and asserts a claim requiring construction of the copyright act,or,at the very least presents a case where a distinctive policy of the copyright act requires that federal principles control the disposition of the claim.harms eliscu,cir friendly.
plaintiff sharice davis plaintiff or davis appeals from an order of the united states district court for the southern district of new york charles haight,judge dismissing by summary judgment her claims under the copyright act,her claim for a declaratory judgment under,and her claims alleging unfair competition,unjust enrichment,and violations of new york consumer protection statutes.see davis blige,d.the district court concluded that a retroactive written agreement between bruce chambliss,davis alleged,and bruce miller,one of the defendants,purporting to assign chambliss rights in two disputed songs as of the time of their creation,was valid.reasoning that a has a legal right to grant a license without another permission or transfer his rights in the copyright freely,id.at,the district court held that the transfer of rights by chambliss to had licensed the copyright to third parties also named as defendants collectively the defendants before the written agreement was davis claims not only against miller but also against the defendants,who were in privity with miller.
we disagree,and therefore vacate the judgment and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
the facts of this case are laid out fully in judge haight opinion.we recount here only those facts relevant to the issues on appeal.unless otherwise noted,the facts are undisputed.
the dispute between the parties arises from the release in of an album entitled no more drama the album.defendant mary blige,the queen of soul,was the performer on the album,which achieved triple platinum status davis alleges that two of the songs contained on the album love and keep it moving collectively,the album compositions infringe her copyright in two compositions collectively,the disputed compositions.in particular,she claims that love is virtually identical to her composition,and that keep it moving bears substantial similarity to her composition do trade in my love.davis does not receive any credit on the album instead,the labels and packaging of the album identify blige,miller,and defendants kwame holland and ronald lawrence as the authors of love and blige,miller,holland,and defendant dana stinson as the authors of keep it moving.see id.at.
davis claims the disputed compositions were in by her and chambliss,miller father chambliss is not a party to this action.according to one witness,hunter college professor barbara ottaviani,the disputed composition was written in during jam sessions in the home of ottaviani attended by,among others,davis,chambliss,and miller.a tape recording of was made during one of these jam sessions,but the tape disappeared shortly thereafter.at about this time davis met blige,who is miller sister and the of chambliss.davis states that she had performed for blige and that miller subsequently approached davis on behalf of blige,seeking to buy several of davis songs,including davis alleges that she declined the offer.she also alleges that she wrote do trade in my love with chambliss in or around november at ruff riders studio.
in august,defendants ausar music,mary blige publishing,bruce miller publishing,and kwame holland publishing registered love and defendant universal music mca music publishing,and blige,miller,and stinson registered keep it moving with the united states copyright office copyright office.on february,miller contracted with universal tunes,a division of defendant universal,to provide an exclusive license to exploit his copyright interest in the album compositions as well as his copyright interests in any other compositions not previously assigned to other music publishing companies.on august,davis registered the disputed compositions with the copyright office,listing chambliss as a.in december,davis filed suit,alleging infringement of her copyright in the two disputed compositions and a variety of related state claims.
defendants april,and august,answers to davis complaint denied that anyone other than the defendants listed as authors on the album wrote the songs.but in depositions given in december and january miller,and june and august chambliss,both miller and chambliss testified that chambliss had initially written the disputed compositions and that they formed the basis for the album compositions chambliss denied ever collaborating on any songs with davis chambliss and miller also stated that they had orally agreed chambliss would grant miller certain rights in the compositions,although the existence and nature of the alleged oral agreement is in dispute see davis,d at noting that a genuine issue exists as to whether chambliss ever orally transferred his rights in the disputed compositions.on june,one day before chambliss initial deposition,chambliss and miller allegedly reduced to a writing the transfer of chambliss interest in the disputed compositions there were two written agreements collectively,the transfer agreements,one for each of the disputed compositions.each written agreement stated that chambliss does hereby sell,assign,transfer,and set over unto bruce miller an undivided one hundred percent share in and to all the undersigned right,title and interest in the respective disputed compositions and any and all copyrights and all renewals,extensions and reversions thereof and any and all causes of action for infringement of the same past,present,and future any and all proprietary rights and all the proceeds from the foregoing accrued and unpaid and hereafter accruing.emphasis added.according to the transfer agreements,the instrument of transfer is effective as of the date chambliss first create d the composition a date not otherwise specified.defendants claimed that these written agreements merely served to confirm or ratify the prior oral agreement.
procedural history 
davis complaint alleges that defendants infringed her copyright to the disputed compositions by recording and registering copyrights on love and keep it moving,which were substantially similar to her compositions,and falsely attributing authorship to a blige,miller,holland,and lawrence on love and b blige,miller,and stinson on keep it moving.davis also alleges that defendants falsely designated the origin of their goods in violation of the lanham act a,a engaged in unfair competition and were unjustly enriched.finally,she claims that defendants acts were intentionally designed to mislead the public in violation of bus.law and 
following the completion of discovery,defendants moved for summary judgment on the ground that chambliss had transferred his rights in the disputed compositions to miller through an oral agreement before the compositions were used by miller,or,alternatively,on the ground that the written transfer agreements conveyed the copyrights retroactively.see davis,d at.defendants argue that,as a result of the transfer agreements,miller became a of the disputed compositions as of the date of the creation of the compositions.accordingly,they contend that,because davis can not sue a of her copyright for infringement,davis suit is barred against miller and those to whom miller had licensed the disputed compositions including blige and the other defendants.
the district court agreed.in a memorandum and order filed november,it declined to determine whether the written ratification of a prior oral transfer could satisfy the copyright act requirement that transfers of copyright ownership be in writing,a,or whether the transfer agreements indeed ratified a prior oral agreement between chambliss and miller.instead,it held that chambliss could cure past infringement through the grant of a retroactive assignment of the copyright.davis,d at quoting silberstein fox entm t group,d.because there is no appellate case law on the issue of retroactive assignment of copyright,the district court relied on other district court opinions,among them silberstein,d at holding that a retroactive license,obtained after alleged infringement occurred and after institution of legal action,immunized defendant from infringement country road music,d,concluding that a settlement agreement between defendants and granting retroactive reproduction rights barred any infringement claim by remaining and cured past infringement and lone wolf mcquade assocs.cbs,stating that a retroactive license cures past infringement.see davis,d at.ultimately,the district court concluded that,as a result of the written retroactive assignment of rights by chambliss to miller,davis has no claim for copyright infringement against defendants.davis,d at.noting that one joint owner may always transfer his interest in the work to a third party,including the grant of licenses,id.at citing melvin and david nimmer,nimmer on copyright nimmer,the district court reasoned that davis alleged status as joint owner with chambliss,who in turn transferred his interests to miller,bars her from stating a claim for copyright infringement against miller,or any of the other defendants,who are his licensees.id.davis timely appeal followed.
discussion 
in reviewing a grant of summary judgment,we draw all factual inferences in favor of the nonmoving party and review the matter de novo.see,miller wolpoff abramson,cir.summary judgment is only appropriate where there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see,kapps wing,cir.because the district court grant of summary judgment was based on its conclusions about the legal effect of the transfer matter that our court has not yet of the matter before us will depend on our own analysis of the relevant copyright law.see larry spier,bourne,cir.
the question of whether one joint owner of a copyright can retroactively transfer his ownership by a written instrument,and thereby cut off the accrued rights of the other owner to sue for infringement,is an issue of first impression in the courts of appeals.although the copyright act itself is silent on the issue of retroactive transfer or license,we conclude that such retroactive transfers violate basic principles of tort and contract law,and undermine the policies embodied by the copyright act.
general principles of copyright law 
we revisit some general principles of copyright law in order to place the instant case in its legal context.
copyright,of course,is a federal grant of a property interest in the production,replication,publication,and distribution of certain classes of original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression,a,including musical compositions,id.a copyright in a work protected under the copyright act thus initially vests in the author or authors of the work.a.the authors of a joint work are co owners of copyright in the work,and,as described in the house report accompanying passage of the copyright act,are to be treated generally as tenants in common,with each co owner having an independent right to use or license the use of a work,subject to a duty of accounting to the other co owners for any profits,at see thomson larson,cir joint authorship entitles the coauthors to equal undivided interests in the whole other words,each joint author has the right to use or to license the work as he or she wishes,subject only to the obligation to account to the other joint owner for any profits that are made.we long ago observed that 
t he rights of property which the had were transferable by sale and delivery,and there is no distinction,independent of statute,between copyrighted property and property of any other description.the right to sell and transfer personal property is an inseparable incident of the property.an author or proprietor of a literary work or manuscript or other work protected by the copyright act possesses such a right of sale as fully and to the same extent as does the owner of any other piece of personal property.it is an incident of ownership.
maurel smith,cir.
like other forms of property ownership,copyright ownership is a bundle of discrete rights regarding the owner ability to use his property.see faulkner geographic,cir the supreme court stressed that in enacting the revision of the copyright act,congress rejected the doctrine of indivisibility,recasting the copyright as a bundle of discrete exclusive rights,ed.and supp.v,each of which may be transferred and owned separately,d.quoting new york times tasini,d internal quotation marks omitted.these rights include reproduc ing,prepar ing derivative works,distribut ing,perform ing,or display ing a creative work.owners may license others to exercise these rights or assign the rights to others.harms,at.in addition,an owner may sue for infringement those who exploit the creative work without permission or assignment.see b the legal or beneficial owner of an exclusive right under a copyright is entitled to institute an action for any infringement of that particular right committed while he or she is the owner of it.knickerbocker toy,int,cir stating that t o prevail on a claim of copyright infringement,a plaintiff must show both ownership of a valid copyright and copying.
the right to prosecute an accrued cause of action for infringement is also an incident of copyright ownership.abkco music,harrisongs music,cir.moreover,it is a right that may be exercised independently of a joint owner is not required to join his other in an action for infringement.see b noting that a court may require an owner of a copyright to serve notice on a person who is shown to have or claim an interest in the copyright and may require the joinder of any person having or claiming an interest in the copyright emphasis added edward marks music jerry vogel music,cir it was early decided that the holder of the legal title to a copyright might sue without joining others who had an equitable interest in the copyright.music publ g llc,d,holding that copyright infringement plaintiffs were not obligated to join alleged of compositions at issue.
early in the twentieth century,we stated in the copyright context the venerable principle of the law of property that,while an owner may convey any of his rights to others permanently or temporarily,he may not convey more than he owns.maurel,at w hen the granted rights to a music publisher,they could but transmit what they had to part with,and they could not transfer what interest the other had.see also filmvideo releasing hastings,cir t he proprietor of a derivative copyright can not convey away that which he does not own.accordingly,an owner may give a license to someone to exploit the work in some way,provided he owns that particular copyright interest.an owner may also convey his interest in prosecuting accrued causes of action for infringement.abkco music,at see also prather neva paperbacks,cir noting the effectiveness of an assignment of accrued causes of action for copyright infringement.
an owner may not,however,convey the interests of his fellow without their express written consent,even if the transferee has no notice of the owners interest.see crosney edward small productions,one of a copyright can not bind the interest of another,although he purports to do so,in the absence of assent or ratification upon her part.internal quotation marks omitted.a ability to grant licenses to third parties unilaterally will therefore depend on the type of licenses granted.there are two general categories of licenses licenses,which permit licensees to use the copyrighted material and may be granted to multiple licensees and exclusive licenses,which grant to the licensee the exclusive even to copyright owners use the copyrighted material in a manner as specified by the license agreement a valid license of either sort immunizes the licensee from a charge of copyright infringement,provided that the licensee uses the copyright as agreed with the licensor.see graham james,cir a copyright owner who grants a nonexclusive license to use his copyrighted material waives his right to sue the licensee for copyright infringement.united states naval institute charter commc ns,cir a n exclusive licensee of any of the rights comprised in the copyright,though it is capable of breaching the contractual obligations imposed on it by the license,can not be liable for infringing the copyright rights conveyed to it.see also mckay columbia broad,cir a license from a of a copyright immunizes the licensee from liability to the other for copyright infringement.
a may grant a license to use the work unilaterally,because his may also use the work or grant similar licenses to other users and because the license presumptively does not diminish the value of the copyright to the.see meredith smith,cir noting that a had the right to give permission for nonexclusive use of a copyrighted work nimmer a.in any event,a who grants a license is accountable to his for income gained by the grant of the license.shapiro,bernstein jerry vogel music,cir.however,a licensee is not liable to a for use authorized by the license,because the licensee rights rest on the license conveyed by the licensing.see mckay at.likewise,a licensee need not pay any royalties or other consideration to the who are not parties to the license agreement.see piantadosi loew,cir holding that a third party granted a copyright license by one had no duty to the other nimmer c.a license conveys no ownership interest,and the holder of a nonexclusive license may not sue others for infringement.see eden toys,at the copyright act authorizes only two types of claimants to sue for copyright infringement owners of copyrights,and persons who have been granted exclusive licenses by owners of copyrights.an exclusive license,on the other hand,conveys an ownership interest.see campbell trustees of stanford university,cir.accordingly an exclusive licensee may sue others for infringement,including the licensor if the licensor infringes on the exclusive right he granted the licensee.see naval institute,at citing nimmer.because no one other than the exclusive licensee may exercise the right specified by the exclusive license agreement,the interests of the other to use or grant licenses to the work are necessarily impaired.an exclusive license thus destroys the value of a copyright to the copyright owners,to the extent that the licensed rights can not be used or exploited by the copyright owners.unlike a transfer of one copyright interest to another person,which conveys only the share of that interest,an exclusive license grants all shares of a particular copyright interest to the exclusive licensee.accordingly,a can not unilaterally grant an exclusive license.see maurel,at where two or more persons have a common interest in a property,equity will not allow one to appropriate it exclusively to himself,or to impair its worth as to others.nimmer noting prohibition on one granting an exclusive license without consent of other.
retroactive licenses and transfers are invalid 
in this case,we deal with the question of whether a copyright,according to the legislative history of the copyright act,we are to treat as a tenant in common,see ante page can convey his copyright interest to a third party retroactively,thereby defeating a claim of infringement asserted against that third party by another.in eden toys,we held that a later writing could memorialize or confirm an earlier oral agreement.eden toys,at.the district court in the instant case concluded that a reasonable jury could find an oral agreement never existed between chambliss and miller.davis,d at.still,the district court agreed with defendants that the written agreements would nonetheless be valid to defeat davis claims.id.at.relying on several district court decisions holding that retroactive licenses are permissible and enforceable,see ante pages,it concluded that the written agreements between chambliss and miller were sufficient to defeat davis claims.
we conclude that the district court decisions relied upon by the district court are distinguishable from the instant case insofar as they involved retroactive licenses granted pursuant to negotiated settlements of accrued infringement claims.see,country road music,d at agreeing with defendant that a settlement agreement between defendant and granted defendant retroactive reproduction rights that bar any infringement claim by plaintiffs sbk catalogue orion pictures,the settlement agreement contemplated a retroactive written license for the use of the musical composition lone wolf mcquade.at in a settlement agreement dated december,granted defendant a retroactive license from january.indeed,to the extent that the district courts deciding these cases state the rationale of their legal conclusions,they uphold the agreements as private contracts between two parties without examining the implications for other holders of the copyright,other than to say in a conclusory fashion that these agreements will have the effect of barring infringement claims by,including.see,country road music,d at a license from a of a copyright immunizes the licencee from liability to the other for copyright infringement.quoting mckay,at.
we believe that reliance on cases involving settlements is misplaced.licenses and assignments function differently from settlements and releases,and the use of the term retroactive license for settlement or release by the parties causes unnecessary confusion and potentially creates legal mischief.settlements are generally retrospective and exclusively between the parties to the unauthorized user and the owner and,absent clear language to the contrary,they are not licenses for future use.the seventh circuit has aptly observed that a settlement agreement is nothing more than a promise by one party to pay liquidated damages for past infringements in return for a dismissal of the infringement suit.the party erroneously equates a settlement for past infringement with a license for prospective use ransburg spiller spiller,cir see also birdsell shaliol.a n infringer does not,by paying damages for making and using a machine in infringement of a patent,acquire any right himself to the future use of the machine.on the contrary,he may,in addition to the payment of damages for past infringement,be restrained from further use united states youngstown sheet tube,cir a release for wrongs done in the past is not the equivalent of a license to do rightfully the same thing in the future.quoting raytheon radio of america.a settlement agreement between an injured owner and an injuring recognizes the unauthorized use while providing a remedy to the injured owner that is acceptable to all parties to the agreement.
a settlement agreement can only waive or extinguish claims held by a settling owner it can have no effect on who are not parties to the settlement agreement.it is a venerable principle of new york law,for example,that o ne tenant in common can settle for or release his interest in personal property,but he can not settle for or release the interest of his.if one tenant in common should settle for his portion of the damages before action,the other may sue without joining him.jackson moore,see also wagman carmel,ordinarily,although a tenant in common may freely sell or otherwise dispose of his own interest in jointly held property,he may not act so as to prejudice the rights of his.for example,a tenant in common may not unilaterally bind his to an agreement concerning the use,control,or title to the joint property.s ettlement agreements are not to be used as a device by which a and b,the parties to the decree,can just because a judge is willing to give the parties deal a judicial imprimatur take away the legal rights of c,a nonparty.bacon city of richmond,cir quoting united states bd.of educ.of chicago,cir.
licenses and assignments,however,are prospective they permit use by a who would not otherwise have a right to use the property.in its simplest form,a license means only leave to do a thing which the licensor would otherwise have a right to prevent.western pacent reproducer,cir.a retroactive license or assignment purports to authorize a past use that was originally unauthorized.unlike a settlement,which recognizes an unauthorized use but waives a settling owner accrued claims of liability,a retroactive license or assignment given legal the unauthorized use from history with the result that the nonparty right to sue for infringement,which accrues when the infringement first occurs,is extinguished.this is the effect of the district court decision in this case.
the right that would be extinguished by a rule permitting retroactive licenses or right to sue for a valuable one indeed,it is one of the most valuable sticks of the bundle of rights of copyright.see silvers sony pictures entm t,cir t o receive maximum value for the impaired copyright,one must also convey the right to recover the value of the impairment by instituting a copyright action.accordingly,we must examine carefully whether retroactive licenses and assignments that extinguish a accrued right to sue are consistent with the general principles of tort and contract law that underlie the accrual and settlement of infringement claims.
as we have observed,u nder general principles of tort law,a cause of action accrues when conduct that invades the rights of another has caused injury.when the injury occurs,the injured party has the right to bring suit for all of the damages,past,present and future,caused by the defendant acts.leonhard united states,cir citing restatement second of torts.a retroactive assignment or license that extinguishes the accrued infringement claims of a by traveling back in time to undo an unlawful infringement destroys the valuable and vested right to enforce her claim.
a retroactive license or assignment that purports to eliminate the accrued causes of action for infringement held by a who is not party to the license or agreement also violates the fundamental principle of contract law prohibiting the parties to a contract from binding nonparties.see,eeoc waffle house,d it goes without saying that a contract can not bind a nonparty.moreover,a who purports to convey not only his right to prosecute past infringements but also his right to prosecute past infringements violates the basic rule that an owner can not convey more than he owns.see roy export.establishment columbia broad,i t is axiomatic that no one can convey more than his own interest in a work.we have no doubt that chambliss can release his own accrued claims of copyright infringement against miller and his fellow defendants,either orally or in writing.but we know of no authority to sanction his attempt to release any rights davis has against miller,for they are not chambliss to release.
none of what we say above should be read as preventing an owner and an infringer from settling infringement claims among themselves.see abkco music,harrisongs music,cir noting in a copyright infringement case,that courts favor the policy of encouraging voluntary settlement of disputes see also in re tamoxifen citrate antitrust,cir the general policy of the law is to favor the settlement of litigation,and the policy extends to the settlement of patent infringement suits.quoting asahi glass pentech,d,posner,sitting by designation.an owner who wishes to release unilaterally his own accrued claims may do so using whatever language he by calling the negotiated settlement the proverbial banana but such an agreement can not have the effect of eviscerating a claims based on past copyright infringement,nor can it settle accrued claims held by who are not themselves parties to the agreement.accordingly,we hold that a license or assignment in copyright can only act prospectively.
we find support for this holding in the law of patents.although patent and copyright law function somewhat differently,courts considering one have historically looked to the other for guidance where precedent is lacking.see sony of am.universal city studios,d referring to the historic kinship between patent law and copyright law when looking at patent law to understand vicarious liability in copyright.our holding in this case is consistent with the law of patents.see schering sa,t he grant of a license by one can not deprive the other of the right to sue for accrued damages for past infringement.that would require a release,not a license,and the rights of a patent,absent agreement to the contrary,do not extend to granting a release that would defeat an action by other to recover damages for past infringement.the prospective nature of licenses has long been recognized in the law of patents.see,waterloo furniture components,haworth,cir courts have recognized the prospective quality of a patent license,which allows another party to use the patentee property in the future without fear of suit.see also wang,oki indus,d,noting that there is authority to the effect that the concepts of both royalty and license are necessarily prospective,rendering a retroactive royalty agreement a legal nullity.licenses in patent and copyright function similarly,see harris emus records,cir,and thus it is appropriate to consider copyright licensing,like patent licensing,prospective in nature.we see no reason why this principle should not also apply to the assignments of the type at issue here.
there is little from a policy perspective to recommend a rule that allows retroactive licenses or assignments,and there are two strong reasons disfavoring them the need for predictability and certainty and discouragement of infringement.a rule permitting retroactive assignments and transfers would inject uncertainty and unpredictability into copyright ownership,contrary to the intent of congress in enacting the copyright act of.see,cmty.for creative reid,d declaring that congress paramount goal in revising the act was enhancing predictability and certainty of copyright ownership in re cybernetic servs,cir f ederal copyright laws ensure predictability and certainty of copyright ownership quoting in re peregrine entm t.it would also damage,if not extinguish,the principal purpose of the copyright act,which is to encourage the origination of creative works by attaching enforceable property rights to them.diamond publ g,cir see also veeck.code congress int l,cir the core purpose of copyright law is to secure a fair return for an author creative labor and thereby to stimulate artistic creativity for the general public good.quoting twentieth century music aiken,d.if retroactive transfers and licenses were permissible,one could never reliably and definitively determine if and when an infringement occurred,because an infringement could be undone by the very sort of maneuver attempted by defendants in this case.see asociación de compositores y editores de música latinoamericana,cir fitting agency concepts like retroactive authorization into copyright law provides plenty of room for debate obviously a license in did not cause a infringement.similarly,one could never know who the pool of authorized users or licensors of a copyright would be at any given time,because a retroactive transfer could always turn an infringer into a potential user or licensor,who would then have the ability to grant his own retroactive licenses or retransfer his new retroactive interest retroactively.
this case demonstrates why permitting such an indeterminate legal regime could create substantial mischief.construing the facts in a light most favorable to davis,as we are required to do in the case of a summary judgment,miller had no right to use or license the disputed compositions at the time they were used on the album or at the time he licensed them to the defendants.the defendants are,in turn,potentially liable for infringement to davis because they never obtained a legitimate right to use the disputed compositions if chambliss were permitted to assign his interest in the disputed compositions retroactively,davis infringement claims would fail not only against miller because miller would be retroactively authorized to use the compositions as a,but also against the defendants,whose illegitimate licenses would retroactively become legitimate because miller by operation of the legal fiction of retroactivity would now have been authorized as a to grant third parties the right to use the disputed compositions.thus,chambliss alleged retroactive assignment to miller of the disputed compositions,for consideration of one dollar each,would have the effect of unraveling valuable accrued infringement claims against not only the retroactive assignee miller but also his licensees 
the second policy reason disfavoring retroactive copyright transfers and licenses that extinguish the right of other is that such retroactive activity lowers the cost of infringement to infringers,thus making infringement more attractive.an infringer could buy his way out of an infringement suit,in which an injured owner may seek enhanced statutory damages and costs,see,by paying a single for a license or assigned copyright interest.a retroactive license or assignment that can be obtained from a not bringing suit,or one willing to settle for a lower price than the bringing the action,is likely to cost much less than the value of the copyright interest including the cost of litigation.the result is that infringement is encouraged and rewarded.this economic incentive to infringe runs directly counter to the intent of congress in passing to compensate the copyright owner for losses from the infringement,and to prevent the infringer from unfairly benefitting from a wrongful act.abeshouse ultragraphics,cir quoting,at 
for the reasons stated above,we conclude that the written transfer agreements,through which chambliss allegedly transferred his interests in the disputed compositions to miller,can not extinguish davis accrued infringement claims against any of the defendants.on remand,the district court shall adjudicate davis infringement claims without giving effect to the purported retroactive assignment of chambliss interest in the disputed compositions 
we now turn to address defendants alternative argument regarding ratification.miller argued before the district court that chambliss transferred his interests in the disputed compositions and potentially other compositions to miller in or early,in an alleged oral agreement,before the alleged infringement occurred.miller and his acknowledged that the copyright act requires all transfer be in writing,see a,but argued that the transfer agreements ratified the earlier oral agreement.see davis,d at.because the district court found that a genuine issue exists as to whether chambliss ever orally transferred his rights in the disputed c ompositions to miller,the district court did not consider whether the transfer a greements were sufficient to satisfy the writing requirement of the copyright act as a written ratification of a prior oral transfer.id.at.
we conclude that,even if an oral agreement assigning chambliss copyright in the disputed compositions to miller was reached in or,the oral agreement can not be ratified retroactively by the transfer agreements to defeat davis accrued infringement claims.this is so for the same reasons we can not give the transfer agreements themselves retroactive effect.if there was no written agreement between miller and chambliss documenting the alleged assignment at the time the disputed compositions were used by defendants,defendants had no legal right to use the disputed compositions and davis right to sue for infringement accrued.chambliss and miller could not extinguish davis accrued infringement claims by ratifying an earlier oral agreement that had no legal effect at the time it was made,because doing so would require us to employ a legal the transfer agreements as if they were written in or,rather than obtain a counterintuitive and inequitable result.
our opinion in eden toys is readily distinguishable from the facts of the instant case.in eden toys,we held that a infringer could not assert the invalidity of an alleged oral agreement for an exclusive license,which was allegedly memorialized in a writing,to defeat an infringement claim brought by the exclusive licensee.see eden toys,at.we first noted that the alleged oral agreement was valid at the time it was made,see id.at noting that u nder the copyright law,exclusive licenses could be granted orally or by conduct.we then held that,because the purpose of the writing requirement in the copyright act of was to protect copyright holders from persons mistakenly or fraudulently claiming oral licenses where the copyright holder appears to have no dispute with its licensee on this matter,it would be anomalous to permit a third party infringer to invoke this provision against the licensee.id.
in this case,however,the third party is a copyright holder who does have a dispute with the alleged licensee or transferee and who would stand to lose her accrued rights to sue for infringement if an allegedly fraudulent oral agreement were given legal effect.thus it would be anomalous not to let davis invoke a in support of her infringement claims.even if a infringer can not,under eden toys,contest the validity of an oral transfer agreement under copyright law that is later confirmed in writing,see magnuson video yesteryear,cir stating that t he logic of eden toys is particularly compelling in this case and holding that a infringer could not assert as a defense to an infringement claim the alleged invalidity of an oral transfer agreement that was later confirmed in writing teeth,novelty,cir holding that a infringer lacked standing to contest the validity of an oral assignment that was later confirmed in writing,we do not read eden toys to foreclose a presumed copyright holder davis from using the invalidity of an alleged oral transfer agreement to defeat an infringer effort to avoid liability for accrued infringement claims 
conclusion 
inasmuch as the alleged retroactive written agreements purporting to transfer chambliss copyright interests to miller could not also transfer davis copyright interests,davis accrued causes of action for infringement were not affected by the agreement between chambliss and miller.accordingly,the district court erred in granting summary judgment to defendants.the district court order of november,is hereby vacated and the cause is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.

miller testified that he and blige contributed to the revised version of love.
chambliss deposition testimony is somewhat confused on this point.although during his deposition he categorically denied ever having written songs with davis,chambliss identified several instances in which davis handwriting or name appeared in his papers documenting several songs.chambliss explained this documentation as either identifying songs meant for her as a performer,or areas where she added unauthorized verses.
miller and chambliss deposition testimony contain inconsistent descriptions of the nature and timing of the alleged oral agreement.miller stated during his deposition that he and chambliss had a conversation p robably like the end of,somewhere in there,during which chambliss told him,basically,any song that i have written,if it needs to be used at any point in time,use it.it is yours.miller said that this agreement was never written down,and that he never compensated chambliss for any songs that chambliss had given to to chambliss,he sign ed all of his songs over to miller because he knew chambliss was going to be in prison,and he knew miller could handle everything.chambliss also described the alleged oral agreement alternatively as an agreement that miller can use all of the songs.as the district court noted,however,chambliss was incarcerated sometime in,and again from to thus,it appears that chambliss could not have known he was going to be in prison during late or early,when miller says that the oral agreement was reached.see davis,d at.it is also worth noting that it is unclear whether the oral agreement assuming arguendo that it existed transferred all of chambliss interests in his compositions to miller,or whether chambliss merely intended to grant miller only the right to use chambliss compositions.finally,it is unclear whether the alleged agreement related only to the disputed compositions,or whether the agreement related to all of the compositions that chambliss claimed to have created.
when asked during his first deposition on june,if there was any written agreement memorializing the transfer of his interest to miller,chambliss first said no,he my son,i do need a written agreement.but when questioned further,he changed his answer and stated,yeah,there is a signed document.when asked about the details of that signed document,chambliss responded q do you recall what songs were listed on that.not.do you remember if there any other songs besides that were.i not.do you know if there were more than five songs.i not positive.do you know why miller was asking you to sign that.because he was trying to sell them the songs.do you know who he was going to try to sell them.not right offhand.there was a lot of alleged agreement was not made available to davis,however,until august,day before chambliss second two written agreements transferring chambliss rights in the disputed compositions but no others to miller were shown to davis.the district court took note that chambliss vague testimony during his june,deposition appeared to be inconsistent with the written agreements that he allegedly signed the day before,see davis,d at chambliss was unable to recall the day,or even the month,in which he executed the written agreement s,despite the fact that they are dated june,the day before the chambliss deposition was taken,but nonetheless gave legal effect to the written agreements,see id.at.

under current copyright law,exclusive licenses are recognized as a type of an ownership interest,conveying a particular exclusive right of copyright.see copyright owner,with respect to any one of the exclusive rights comprised in a copyright,refers to the owner of that particular right.exclusive licensees may sue without joining the copyright owners,and exclusive license agreements must be in writing,a see also eden toys,florelee undergarment,cir.the differences between an exclusive license and an assignment or transfer of copyright ownership interest have diminished to the point that the terms are nearly synonymous.see a transfer of copyright ownership is an assignment,mortgage,exclusive license,or any other conveyance of a copyright or any of the exclusive rights comprised in a copyright,whether or not it is limited in time or place of effect,but not including a nonexclusive license.however,although it is possible to share ownership of a copyright interest as,an exclusive licensee of an interest is the only one who may exercise that right.each author rights in a joint work are,whereas a sole author retains exclusive rights in his or her own work.thomson,at internal citations omitted.therefore,in order to convey exclusive rights,all must agree to convey their shares of the same the earlier version of the copyright statute,the copyright act of,copyright ownership was generally considered indivisible thus,the individual rights comprising the bundle of copyright property rights could not be separately assigned,and exclusive licenses granted more limited example,exclusive licensees had to join copyright owners in suits for infringement.apparently,because exclusive licenses were not transfers of ownership,oral agreements granting exclusive licenses were permissible.see nimmer c.

miller could be exposed to liability under a theory of contributory infringement or for unauthorized licensing of the disputed compositions even if he himself had not used the disputed compositions without authorization.while an owner of a copyright may assign an expectancy of a renewal interest in that copyright validly,see fred fisher music witmark sons.holding that an assignment of renewal rights in advance of the owner securing the right to renew was valid,one who grants a license without holding any interest in the copyright at the time the license is granted is differently situated because he purports to exercise a right he does without the consent of the copyright owner.thus,the unauthorized licensor may be liable for infringement committed by his unauthorized licencees under a theory of contributory infringement as one who,with knowledge of the infringing activity,induces,causes or materially contributes to the infringing conduct of another.gershwin publ g columbia artists,cir footnote omitted see also sony,at.recognizing theory of contributory infringement costar group,loopnet,cir discussing theory of contributory infringement.the unauthorized licensor also arguably violates the exclusive rights of the copyright owner,a,to authorize who may use the copyright.but,at holding that an unauthorized licensor is not liable for copyright infringement absent evidence that the unauthorized licensees actually infringed the copyright.in any event,miller would have exceeded his authority as a to the extent he granted a an exclusive license to the disputed compositions,because he did not join davis to the licensing agreement.see d nimmer noting prohibition on one granting an exclusive license without consent of.
we note that were we to permit retroactive transfers of copyright interests in these circumstances,infringers who obtained a retroactive transfer of a copyright interest could not only grant retroactive licenses but also sue other past infringers of the copyright.these retroactive could then issue retroactive licenses to these other past infringers,thwarting yet other potential infringement suits by a.
if the retroactive agreement were given effect,the possibility that davis could seek an accounting from miller,see shapiro,bernstein jerry vogel music,cir shapiro i,modified,cir shapiro ii e ach holder of the copyright should account to the other for his exploitation thereof not as an infringer but as a trustee,would be an inadequate substitute for davis accrued infringement claims.if davis retained her accrued infringement claims,in order to obtain damages and profits from defendants she would only need to prove defendants gross revenues from the disputed compositions the burden would then shift to defendants to prove that their profits were less than their gross revenues.see b t he copyright owner is required to present proof only of the infringer gross revenue,and the infringer is required to prove his or her deductible expenses and the elements of profit attributable to factors other than the co
