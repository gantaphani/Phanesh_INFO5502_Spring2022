this is the latest in a series of appeals in copyright infringement cases arising out of the design and use of the logo for the baltimore ravens football team.in the first case,which concluded in,frederick bouchat sued the baltimore ravens,the ravens and national football league properties,nflp,alleging that these defendants had copied one of his drawings in choosing a logo for the ravens.a jury considering liability found that the ravens and nflp had infringed bouchat copyright in the drawing,but a second jury considering damages awarded none.we affirmed in each of two appeals.in the four cases before us today,bouchat sues several hundred companies licensees that used the infringing logo in various endeavors,including the production and marketing of official ravens merchandise.in summary judgment proceedings in these cases,the district court held that the licensees had infringed bouchat copyright,but denied his requests for actual or statutory damages.bouchat appeals the judgments,and we affirm.we conclude that the doctrine of claim preclusion prevents bouchat from obtaining actual damages from the licensees and that his failure to register his copyright before infringement began renders him ineligible for statutory damages.
in november the national football league announced that the cleveland browns team was moving to baltimore.the browns name,however,was to be left in cleveland,which required the relocated team to select a new name.bouchat,an amateur artist who worked as a security guard in baltimore,sketched several logos illustrating names including the ravens being considered by the newly arrived team.on december,bouchat drew a logo with a shield bearing the letter b and held by a raven the shield drawing.in march the ravens name was officially chosen,and the nfl marketing arm,nflp,hired artists to begin logo design.on april or,bouchat faxed his shield drawing to the maryland stadium authority with a note asking the authority chairman to send the drawing to the ravens owner.the note said that if the ravens used his logo,bouchat wanted a letter of recognition and an autographed helmet.after the ravens had access to bouchat drawing,nflp artists created a logo called the flying b.the flying b depicted a winged shield bearing the letter b,and this logo bore a remarkable resemblance to bouchat shield drawing.the ravens team presented the flying b to the public for the first time in june,and the team used this logo until the end of the season.during the time the flying b was the team logo,the nflp licensed it as part of a package of all nfl team logos to hundreds of manufacturers and retailers for use on ravens merchandise.the team never gave bouchat the recognition letter or autographed helmet he had requested.on july,bouchat registered the shield drawing with the copyright office.
in may bouchat filed a copyright infringement action against the ravens and nflp in the district court for the district of maryland,bouchat baltimore ravens,bouchat i,no.he alleged that the flying b infringed his copyright in the shield drawing and that the defendants had earned profits from licensing the infringing work.the district court bifurcated the case into liability and damages phases.the jury in the liability phase found that the ravens and nflp had infringed bouchat copyright,and we affirmed in an interlocutory appeal.bouchat baltimore ravens,cir,amended by and reh g en banc denied by cir,cert.denied,d.
in bouchat i damages phase bouchat sought recovery under a,which allows a copyright owner to obtain actual damages plus any additional profits of the infringer.bouchat claimed no actual damages but did seek infringer profits.before the damages issue was submitted to the jury,the district court decided that the only component of the defendants profits that could be attributed to the infringement for b purposes was revenue from the sale of products bearing the flying b.the jury then found that the defendants income from such products was attributable completely to factors other than the artwork of the flying.the district court entered judgment for the defendants on the jury finding that bouchat was entitled to no damages,and we affirmed,bouchat baltimore ravens football club,cir,cert.denied,d.
in the meantime,bouchat brought four additional actions,which are the subject of this appeal,against several hundred downstream defendants for copyright infringement bouchat champion,no.bouchat ii bouchat baltimore ravens,no.bouchat iii bouchat,no.bouchat iv and bouchat,no.bouchat v.bouchat describes these downstream defendants as entities who utilized the infringing work in advertisements,publishers of game day magazines,broadcast and media entities which licensed the use of the infringing logo,and makers of video games,trading cards,and other products that displayed the ravens flying appellant br.at.all of the downstream defendants used the logo with permission from nflp,and nflp required all of its licensees to submit proposed logo use to nflp for approval.because every downstream defendant used the logo with either direct or indirect authorization from nflp,we will refer to all of the downstream defendants as licensees.the district court held these four related cases in abeyance while it dealt with bouchat 
when bouchat i concluded in the district court,litigation resumed in bouchat ii through v with bouchat and the licensees for summary judgment.the district court decided the summary judgment motions in a published opinion,bouchat champion products,d.first,the court held that nflp virtually represented the licensees in bouchat i.the licensees were accordingly bound by the bouchat i finding that their use of the flying b infringed bouchat copyright,and the district court granted partial summary judgment in favor of bouchat on the issue of liability.id.at.second,the district court held that bouchat was precluded from relitigating the issue of whether any of the licensees merchandising profits were attributable to the infringement of bouchat copyrighted work because the bouchat i jury conclusively resolved that claim against him.id.at.third,the district court rejected bouchat argument that he is entitled to an award of statutory damages from each of the licensees who used the infringing flying specifically,the court ruled that the judgment in bouchat i precluded bouchat from obtaining any statutory damages in the later litigation.id.at.the court reasoned in the alternative that even if preclusion doctrines did not prohibit statutory damages,bouchat did not qualify for such damages because he did not register his copyright before the infringing conduct began.id.at.based on these determinations,the district court entered judgment in favor of bouchat on liability,but denied him monetary recovery in each of the four related cases,bouchat ii,iii,iv,and bouchat now appeals the judgments insofar as they deny damages.we review grants of summary judgment de novo.murrell ocean mecca motel,cir 
a copyright owner in a civil infringement action may elect one of two types of damages actual damages and any additional profits of the infringer or statutory damages.a.the election is made at any time before final judgment is rendered.id.c.bouchat concedes that the jury verdict in bouchat i damages phase precludes him from seeking infringement profits from the licensees in bouchat ii,iv,and his appeal therefore challenges the district court determination that he is not entitled to either actual or statutory damages against the licensees.
the copyright owner is entitled to recover the actual damages suffered by him or her as a result of the infringement,and any profits of the infringer that are attributable to the infringement and are not taken into account in computing the actual damages.b.the district court,after concluding that bouchat did not seek actual damages,granted the licensees summary judgment foreclosing this category of recovery in the cases before us today.champion,d at.the complaint in each case,however,includes a prayer for actual damages,and at oral argument on the summary judgment motion bouchat contended that he is entitled to actual damages in the form of a reasonable royalty from each licensee.the district court therefore erred when it concluded that bouchat had forfeited his claim for actual damages.as a result,we may determine whether the claim is viable.the licensees invoke the doctrine of claim preclusion,arguing that the bouchat i judgment that awarded no bouchat from seeking actual damages in bouchat ii,iv,and v.we agree.
the related doctrines of claim preclusion and issue preclusion relieve parties of the cost and vexation of multiple lawsuits,conserve judicial resources,and,by preventing inconsistent decisions,encourage reliance on adjudication.allen mccurry,d.a subsequent claim is precluded when the judgment in the prior action was final and on the merits the parties in the two actions are identical or in privity and the claims in the two actions are identical.grausz englander,cir.
the first element a prior final judgment on the merits is not disputed.the final judgment in bouchat i,which we affirmed on appeal,was on the merits,and the district court was empowered to render that judgment.the second element identical parties or privies is also not disputed.bouchat does not appeal the district court determination that the ravens and nflp virtually represented the licensees in bouchat i.this determination is important to bouchat because it prompted the district court conclusion that the licensees were bound by bouchat i finding that the ravens and nflp infringed the copyright,which means that nflp licensees were also infringers.champion,d at.in embracing this much of the district court decision,bouchat effectively concedes that the licensees were in privity with the ravens and nflp for claim preclusion purposes,since virtual representation is a recognized category of privity.see martin am.bancorporation ret.plan,cir.
evaluation of the third element identical claims,which is contested,calls for more extended discussion.the requirement that the claims in the first and subsequent actions be identical is met if the new claim arises out of the same transaction or series of transactions as the claim resolved by the prior judgment.meekins united transp.union,cir.we have recognized that the word transaction 
in the claim preclusion context connotes a natural grouping or common nucleus of operative facts.among the factors to be considered in deciding whether the facts of the current and prior claims are so woven together that they constitute a single claim are their relatedness in time,space,origin,or motivation,and whether,taken together,they form a convenient unit for trial purposes.

there are several actions i on the one hand and bouchat ii,iv,and v on the there is only a single nucleus of operative facts,satisfying the third element of claim preclusion.in the latter actions,bouchat ii,iv,and v,bouchat asserts claims against the commercial users of the ravens logo,whether they displayed the logo in broadcast coverage of ravens games,produced ravens merchandise,or sold that merchandise to ordinary consumers.in bouchat i bouchat sought to hold nflp and the ravens accountable for these very same acts that infringed his copyright.the complaint in bouchat i is clear on this point.it alleged that nflp licensed third parties to use the logos and marks of the baltimore ravens in connection with a variety of merchandise and promotional activities directly associated with the ravens.complaint at,bouchat i,no.filed may.the bouchat i complaint further alleged 
since june,if not before,defendants the ravens and nflp have been reproducing,distributing,promoting and offering for sale illegal and unauthorized copies of the subject works in the form of baltimore ravens logos marks to promote their business enterprises defendants have licensed the use of the subject works to third parties for the sale and merchandising of products and thereby have derived profits from the use of the subject works.
id.at.while bouchat i focused on the licensor conduct,and bouchat ii,iv,and v shift the focus to the licensees conduct,the same violations of bouchat copyright are described throughout all of the complaints.though the several cases before us today are sequels in which the licensees who had only a bit part in the first installment now take center stage,there is still only one interwoven story.
that bouchat did not seek actual damages in bouchat i but now seeks such damages from the licensees does not alter our conclusion that the claims in bouchat cases are identical.the relief bouchat seeks for the licensees commercial use of the infringing logo is woven together,pittston,at,with the relief he sought against the bouchat i defendants.while bouchat reasons for not presenting any evidence of actual damages and focusing on infringement profits in bouchat i may have been perfectly sound,that is of no moment here.bouchat i,at widener,dissenting explaining why it is likely that bouchat actual damages,if any,were nominal.in seeking infringement profits against the ravens and nflp,bouchat asserted a right to recovery under a,which makes the copyright infringer liable for the copyright owner actual damages and any additional profits of the infringer.a emphasis added.bouchat had his day in court on his a claim against the ravens and nflp in bouchat i,so he could not seek actual damages against them in some later action.in bouchat ii,iv,and v he chose a new road and elected actual damages against nflp licensees.but a links actual damages which bouchat never sought before to infringement profits which he did seek before.section b further suggests that actual damages and infringer profits are related although distinct measures of recovery.by the statute plain terms,recoverable infringement profits are any profits of the infringer that are attributable to the infringement and are not taken into account in computing the actual damages.id.b emphasis added.in deciding what profits the infringer must disgorge,a court must exclude certain amounts calculated as actual damages to avoid double counting.robert jones assocs.nino homes,cir melville nimmer david nimmer,nimmer on copyright a.thus,evaluation of infringement profits must take into account the nature of any actual damages.this link between the remedies bouchat has sought reinforces our identification of a common nucleus of operative facts in these cases.
as we have explained,bouchat i and bouchat ii,iv,and v all arise from a common series of transactions,so the claims are identical.the three requirements of claim preclusion are therefore satisfied.accordingly,the district court correctly granted judgment in favor of the licensees because bouchat is precluded from obtaining actual damages against them.
we do not suggest that bouchat was legally obligated to join the licensees as defendants in the first action.in other words,we do not create a rule of mandatory joinder,for it remains settled that a copyright holder may exercise discretion in suing as many as he chooses.salton,philips domestic appliances pers.care,cir robbins music alamo music.it is equally well established,however,that when an injured person sues joint tortfeasors in successive actions,preclusion principles determine the effect of the first judgment on the later actions.restatement second of torts.this rule invites the application of conventional preclusion doctrines in bouchat ii,iv,and v because of the relationship between nflp and the licensees,who used the logo with nflp authorization.each time a licensee copied the flying b,bouchat copyright was infringed,and two parties were responsible the licensee who made the copy and nflp who authorized the licensee to copy the logo.because nflp and the licensee were at fault together for the licensee violation,they are liable jointly and severally for any damages the violation caused.see salton,at t he principle of joint and several liability governs the federal statutory tort of copyright infringement citations omitted.any plaintiff who sues joint tortfeasors separately bears the risk that an adverse determination in the first action will trigger preclusion doctrines in a later action.bouchat bore this risk f
