oracle corporation and sap ag are competitors in the enterprise software market.in,oracle et collectively,oracle brought suit against sap et collectively,sap alleging that tomorrownow,an enterprise software company recently acquired by sap,was engaging in systematic and pervasive illegal downloading of oracle software.sap eventually stipulated to liability,and the parties went to trial solely on damages.
the jury awarded oracle billion as the fair market value of a hypothetical license from oracle encompassing sap infringement of oracle copyrights.sap moved for judgment as a matter of law jmol on two grounds that oracle failed to show that it actually would have granted a license and that oracle failed to provide enough evidence to permit the jury to establish an objective,price.the district court granted jmol,making clear in a later order that it agreed with only the second of the two grounds.
the district court ordered a new trial,conditioned on oracle rejection of a million remittitur measured by the copyright holder lost profits plus infringer profits,rather than by damages.oracle rejected the remittitur.the district court ruled that,if a second trial were conducted,oracle would not be able to argue for,or present evidence of,damages.oracle and sap stipulated to a million judgment.
oracle appeals from several rulings by the district court a grant of jmol to sap a grant of sap motion for a new trial conditioned on oracle rejection of a remittitur a ruling that oracle could not pursue damages at a second trial a ruling selecting million as the remittitur amount and four rulings on issues relevant to a second trial.
we affirm the first three rulings.we vacate the fourth ruling and remand to the district court.we conclude that the district court erred in setting the remittitur at million.that amount was below the maximum amount sustainable by the proof,d s redi mix sierra redi mix contracting,cir.we therefore vacate and remand with instructions to condition any new trial on oracle rejection of a million remittitur.we affirm one of the four rulings relating to the second trial we do not reach the questions presented by the other three rulings.
background 
oracle and sap are fierce competitors in the enterprise software industry.in,when oracle acquired peoplesoft,another enterprise software company,for billion.peoplesoft had itself recently acquired edwards,another enterprise software company.in acquiring peoplesoft,oracle hoped to gain peoplesoft nearly customers.in reaction to oracle acquisition,sap initiated a marketing program called safe harbor and later,in a modified form,safe passage.for convenience,we will refer to this program as safe passage.
as a key component of safe passage,sap acquired tomorrownow tomorrownow in for million.founded by former employees of peoplesoft,tomorrownow provided software maintenance services to peoplesoft customers,including edwards customers,at half the price charged by oracle.after oracle acquired siebel systems,another enterprise software company,for billion in,tomorrownow expanded its maintenance services to include siebel software.sap hoped to leverage tomorrownow relationship with its maintenance service customers to persuade some of those customers to switch over to sap software.
in,an oracle employee noticed thousands of suspicious downloads of oracle software.after an investigation,oracle concluded that tomorrownow had illegally downloaded millions of peoplesoft,edwards,siebel,and oracle database files.tomorrownow continued to provide maintenance services to oracle customers using these downloads until sometime in.
oracle brought suit in federal district court in,alleging copyright infringement and other federal and state claims.shortly before trial,sap stipulated to liability on oracle copyright claims,and oracle dismissed with prejudice all of its claims.
the district court conducted a jury trial limited to damages for copyright infringement.the district judge instructed the jury that it could award either damages or plaintiff lost profits and infringer profits.oracle expert testified,based on a hypothesized negotiation that would have taken place before the infringement began,that the fair market value of a license allowing use of the downloaded software for the period of infringement would have been billion.in november,the jury returned a verdict for oracle for billion,based on what it found was the fair market value of a hypothetical license granted by oracle.
sap objected to the amount of the damage award and moved for jmol.the district court granted jmol,making clear in a later order that its sole ground for denying the motion was that the evidence oracle presented was insufficient to establish an objective license price.
sap also moved for a new trial.the district court granted the motion conditioned on oracle rejection of a million remittitur.the district court determined that million was the maximum amount sustainable by the proof.in granting sap motion,the district court made clear that in a new trial,if one were conducted,oracle would not be allowed to argue for,or present evidence of,damages.
oracle rejected the million remittitur.in advance of a second trial,the district court denied a number of oracle evidentiary motions.in order to expedite an appeal,the parties stipulated to a million judgment in oracle favor.oracle timely appealed.

iii.discussion 
grant of jmol 
sap makes two arguments in support of the district court grant of jmol.first,sap argues that,in order to recover damages,oracle had to show that it actually would have granted a license to tomorrownow.second,sap argues that the jury damage award was based on undue speculation.the district court disagreed with the first argument but agreed with the second.we agree with the district court.
no grant of license 
sap argues that damages can not be awarded because oracle was unwilling to grant a license to tomorrownow for the use of its peoplesoft,edwards,siebel,and oracle database copyrights.as a factual matter,we agree that oracle never would have granted such a license to tomorrownow.oracle executives testified generally that oracle never licenses its software to competitors,and specifically that oracle never would have granted a license to tomorrownow.
however,we disagree with sap legal argument.under b,a copyright owner is entitled to recover the actual damages suffered by him or her as a result of the infringement,and any profits of the infringer that are attributable to the infringement and are not taken into account in computing the actual damages.a plaintiff in a b action must establish a causal connection between the infringement and the monetary remedy sought.polar bear,timex,cir.actual damages are the extent to which the market value of a copyrighted work has been injured or destroyed by an infringement.frank music metro goldwyn mayer,cir.although actual damages can be awarded in the form of lost profits,damages also constitute an acceptable form of actual damages recoverable under section b.see polar bear,at.to calculate the market value of the injury to the plaintiff based on a theory,we look to the amount a willing buyer would have been reasonably required to pay a willing seller at the time of the infringement for the actual use made by the infringer of the plaintiff work.wall data cnty.sheriff dep t,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
we have never required a plaintiff in a copyright infringement case to show that it would have licensed the infringed material.we decline to impose such a requirement now.a copyright holder has the right to refuse to license its work and should not be penalized for exercising that right.see stewart abend.if we were to require a copyright holder to demonstrate that it would have been willing to grant a license as a condition for recovering damages based on the fair market value of the license,the perverse result would be that some of the most assiduously protective copyright holders would be unable to recover the fair market value of their wrongfully appropriated copyrighted property.for example,posit a songwriter who has consistently refused to license her work for use in advertising.a chain nonetheless uses one of her songs in a nationwide television campaign.if the rule were as sap proposes,the songwriter could not recover damages for the infringement even if she could demonstrate that other songwriters charge to license comparable songs for such use.this rule could operate unfairly,given the difficulty the songwriter might face in meeting the burden of proof for lost profits and infringer profits.see on davis v.the gap,cir in our view,as between leaving the victim of the illegal taking with nothing,and charging the illegal taker with the reasonable cost of what he took,the latter,at least in some circumstances,is the preferable solution.
sap argues that a plaintiff must show that a license would have been granted because,if the copyright holder would never have agreed to license her work,she could not,by definition,have lost any licensing fees as a result of the infringement within the meaning of b.we disagree.
the second circuit has explained 
if a copier of protected work,instead of obtaining permission and paying the fee,proceeds without permission and without compensating the owner,it seems entirely reasonable to conclude that the owner has suffered damages to the extent of the infringer taking without paying what the owner was legally entitled to exact a fee for.we can see no reason why,as an abstract matter,the statutory term actual damages should not cover the owner failure to obtain the market value of the fee the owner was entitled to charge for such use.
on davis,at.the court explained further that whether the infringer might in fact have negotiated with the owner or purchased at the owner price is irrelevant to whether damages are available.id.at.
damages assume rather than require the existence of a willing seller and buyer.the very word hypothetical indicates that damages may be awarded in the absence of an actual license.oracle was thus not required,as a categorical prerequisite to recovery of damages,to show that it would ever have granted a license.consistent with our cases upholding a damages award,and following the second circuit decision in on davis,we hold that a copyright plaintiff unwillingness to grant a license to use its copyrighted work does not defeat its ability to recover damages.
undue speculation 
an award of damages is appropriate provided the amount is not based on undue speculation.polar bear,at quoting mcroberts software,media,cir.the touchstone for damages is the range of the license reasonable market value.id.the question,therefore,is not what the owner would have charged,but rather what is the fair market value.jarvis,cir quoting on davis,at.thus,we do not ask what the owner would like to have charged if unconstrained by reality,but what a willing owner actually would have charged after negotiation with the buyer.that is,fair market value is based on an objective,not a subjective,analysis.jarvis,at quoting mackie rieser,cir.
fair market value in a voluntary licensing transaction between parties ordinarily lies somewhere between the two poles of cost to the seller and benefit to the buyer.that is,the seller will not ordinarily charge less for a license than its anticipated cost,and the buyer will not ordinarily pay more for a license than its anticipated benefit.in the case of a hypothetical license,it is often difficult to determine what,at the time of the infringement,the seller and buyer thought would be their respective cost and benefit.further,even if the cost and benefit can be determined with some degree of certainty,it is often difficult to determine the range between the two poles of cost and benefit within which the parties would likely have settled.
oracle argues that the jury billion verdict was reasonably supported,pointing to evidence of,among other things,the enormous amount of data surreptitiously downloaded by tomorrownow,the amount that oracle paid to acquire peoplesoft and siebel,and estimates of how much money oracle stood to lose and sap stood to gain from tomorrownow infringement.the district court concluded that the evidence oracle presented was insufficient to establish an objective license price.we agree.given that the evidence presented at trial failed to provide the range of the reasonable market value for the hypothetical license in question,we hold that the jury awarded damages using an undue amount of speculation.see polar bear,at.
benefit to sap 
in its opening brief,oracle points to two types of evidence showing sap expected benefit.first,oracle states that tomorrownow infringement occurred on a massive scale.oracle explains that tomorrownow illegal downloads of oracle software totaled over five terabytes of infringing data,which would encircle the globe nine times if printed out on paper laid.this is a dramatic image,emphasizing that there was a great deal of downloaded data.but the quantity of the data,by itself,tells us very little about its value to sap.
second,oracle presented evidence of sap own projected benefits from its use of stolen materials.oracle relies heavily on two pieces of evidence as to peoplesoft sap internal financial estimates,relating to the conversion of peoplesoft customers to sap,which projected nearly million in revenue over three years,and testimony from an sap executive that tomorrownow maintenance and support offerings were an important part of this conversion plan.as to siebel,oracle expert testified that sap improper use of siebel copyrights would have yielded million to million in financial gains to sap.as to oracle database software,oracle does not identify specific evidence as to the benefit that sap stood to gain from tomorrownow infringement.
although these figures are relevant to the question of the benefit that sap hoped to derive from tomorrownow infringing activity,they leave important gaps.as to peoplesoft and edwards,we know that sap hoped to gain million in revenues by siphoning off business from oracle.we also know that tomorrownow infringement of oracle copyrights was important to the success of this effort.but oracle points to no evidence indicating what portion of the million in projected revenue sap hoped to obtain from tomorrownow infringing activity,as distinct from the lawful portion of the safe passage program.
moreover,the million figure was only what sap hoped it could achieve over three years.the presentation slide prepared for sap internal use,upon which oracle bases its argument,characterized the calculations underlying this figure as merely assumptions.an sap executive who provided the numbers for the slide testified that he attempted to make reasonable assumptions,but the slide tells us little about what probability sap actually assigned to such assumptions.although we look to the expectations of the parties at the time of the hypothetical negotiation in determining the value,see,wall data,at,it is telling that,in the end,tomorrownow had a total of only customers by the time it closed its doors in,a small fraction of the customers sap had hoped to attract.
oracle strenuously argues that sap considered its projections reliable enough to serve as the basis for its acquisition of tomorrownow,but it fails to mention that sap acquired tomorrownow for only million.if sap truly anticipated that tomorrownow would produce a billion benefit to sap,as oracle contends,a million acquisition price is strikingly low.this low acquisition price does not in itself necessarily preclude oracle recovery of a billion verdict.but it casts substantial doubt on oracle argument that sap stated assumptions on the slide were realistic,and that sap officials believed these assumptions when they negotiated their purchase price for tomorrownow.even discounting the value to sap of tomorrownow based on the possibility of discovery of the illegal downloads and resulting litigation,million is a great deal less than the billion oracle says sap would have paid to oracle for a license to do what tomorrownow was doing.
cost to oracle 
to show its expected cost,oracle presented evidence of projected lost revenue resulting from tomorrownow use of the downloaded software.oracle expert testified that if sap had reasonably convinced customers to switch to sap software,as projected,oracle stood to suffer over billion in loss es.as to siebel,oracle argues that sap infringement of siebel copyrights would have resulted in million in negative financial impacts for oracle.as to oracle database software,oracle expert testified that the licensing fees for the illicit copies of oracle database software would total million,based on what an oracle executive claimed that oracle would charge.
we accord limited weight to oracle expert conclusion that oracle stood to lose more than billion from tomorrownow infringement of peoplesoft and edwards copyrights.oracle expert generated this estimate by assuming that oracle would lose the customers that sap hoped would switch from oracle software to sap software,as outlined in sap assumptions presentation slide.for the reasons discussed above,the assumptions are not a particularly reliable source of objective evidence.further,as we describe below in our discussion of remittitur,oracle presented evidence of its actual lost profits,which were at most million far less than billion.like the evidence of the low acquisition price of tomorrownow,this lost profits number casts substantial doubt on sap internal assumptions.
oracle also presented evidence of the acquisition cost of peoplesoft and siebel.oracle emphasized that it had just paid billion,in an transaction,to acquire peoplesoft and the accompanying intellectual property that sap and tomorrownow admittedly stole.it had also paid more than half that billion to acquire siebel systems.an oracle executive testified that the billion damages estimate provided by oracle trial expert was conservative because it was around percent of what we actually paid for the intellectual property.she further testified that oracle expected that peoplesoft,edwards,and siebel would generate billion annually in maintenance revenue alone.
oracle failed,however,to present evidence of the relationship between the value of owning peoplesoft,edwards and siebel,on the one hand,and the cost of granting a license to use its copyrights in a limited way for a limited period,on the other.see wall data,at discussing actual use of copyrighted works.in short,while oracle acquisition price of peoplesoft and siebel is evidence of the immense value that oracle saw in those companies,it told the jury little of what a hypothetical license for a specific use of their copyrights for a brief period would have cost oracle.
value of hypothetical license 
evidence of sap projected benefits and oracle projected costs is relevant to the fair market value of a license for the use of oracle copyrights during the period of tomorrownow infringement.but given the type of objective evidence on which our caselaw has relied in affirming past damage awards,we hold that the district court correctly concluded that oracle failed to present sufficient evidence to support the jury award.
our caselaw provides guidance as to a copyright plaintiff burden in proving damages.in one case discussed in particular detail by the parties,we upheld a award as where timex corporation used polar bear productions copyrighted film footage without the latter authorization.polar bear,at.timex had sponsored the production of the film footage at issue i n return for an exclusive license to use the film in its promotional materials.id.at.under the parties agreement,beyond the period timex had the option of retaining polar bear to produce an additional promotional video at a price to be determined by the parties,but timex decided to produce the tape separately.id.despite polar bear warnings that timex had no right to use images from the original film,timex did so anyway.id.timex infringement did not stop there it used polar bear copyrighted images on two other occasions in a promotional campaign associated with the soft drink mountain dew and in videos used to train salespeople at a large national retailer.id.
at trial,polar bear presented evidence that before timex infringed its copyright it had quoted timex a price of for preparing a video.id.at.polar bear also presented expert testimony as to the value of a fee covering timex infringing activity that was predicated on this price.id.the jury awarded polar bear in lost license fees.id.at.
we upheld the damage award despite timex arguments that the award was speculative.id.at.we observed that there was little danger that the fee,on which the calculation of the price of the hypothetical license was based,was contrived or artificially inflated because t he proposed license fee was proffered before timex infringement.id.we explained having taken the copyrighted material,timex is in no better position to haggle over the license fee than an ordinary thief and must accept the jury valuation unless it exceeds the range of the reasonable market value.id.
two years later,we upheld another damage award in wall data.see at.in that case,t he los angeles county sheriff department purchased licenses to wall data computer software,but installed the software onto computers.id.at footnote omitted.after concluding that the department activity constituted copyright infringement,id.at,we affirmed the jury damages award of somewhere between and per infringed copy as where the average price wall data charged the vendor that sold software to the sheriff department was,government entities were charged per copy,and the sheriff department had originally paid per copy.id.at.in upholding the award,we observed that the jury award was within the range sustainable by the proof.id.
one year after wall data,we upheld another damage award in a case involving the unauthorized use of images.see jarvis,at.the plaintiff in jarvis was a professional photographer who created several thousand photographic slides for,a maker of outdoor sporting goods.id.at.in that case,was found to have infringed the photographer copyrights,and we upheld the district court damages calculation where it had employed reasonable estimates of the market value of the infringed images.id.in so holding,we outlined the numerous pieces of evidence on which the district court had relied in determining the final award 
the court findings show that it examined at least six estimates of the fair market value of jarvis infringed images the testimony of jarvis expert witness richard weisgrau that jarvis images were worth to each the testimony of a senior executive that he would pay for an image to be used online and for a glossy image for a print advertisement or magazine cover jarvis compensation of for the images he delivered to under the agreement jarvis compensation of for the images he delivered to under the agreement jarvis compensation of for seven images he delivered to in and jarvis settlement offer of for all images infringed by.although these estimates informed the district court calculations,it ultimately cited jarvis own damages figures for images used in print and then halved the average of these figures to determine the damages per online use.the court based its halving on its finding that the fair market value of an online use is less than the average fair market value of a print use.this methodology produced a damages figure of per online use,a figure below weisgrau estimate but well within the range of the other five estimates.
