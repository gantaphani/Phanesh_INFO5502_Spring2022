background 
psihoyos,a professional photographer,created eight photographs that wiley published in various textbooks from to.in november wiley sought a retroactive licensing arrangement with psihoyos after discovering that it had published in several textbooks and without a license a pair of psihoyos photographs of a stanford university professor holding a narcoleptic dog the narcoleptic dog photos.after being notified of the unlicensed publication of the photographs,psihoyos requested full disclosure of any other unauthorized use of psihoyos photographs by wiley.after examining its records,wiley responded that it had published without permission one photograph of a triceratops skeleton triceratops photo and one of an oviraptor skeleton oviraptor photo in addition to the two narcoleptic dog photos.
in march psihoyos filed a complaint alleging that wiley had infringed his copyright in eight photographs,including the triceratops and oviraptor photos,along with two photographs of a narcoleptic dog that,psihoyos would later realize,were similar to but not the same as the narcoleptic dog photos wiley had admitted to using without authorization.we refer to the four remaining photographs referenced in psihoyos complaint as the dinamation,gastroliths,fossilized dinosaur tracks,and televisions photos.
during discovery,psihoyos acknowledged that his initial complaint failed to refer to the copyrights in the two narcoleptic dog photos that wiley had actually infringed and mistakenly referred instead to the copyrights in two other,similar photographs.however,he did not then move for leave to amend the complaint to correct the error.
in august,after discovery was complete,wiley moved for summary judgment on two grounds.first,wiley argued that the copyright act statute of limitations barred many of psihoyos infringement claims,which arose from infringements that occurred over three years prior to suit.see b.second,as relevant here,wiley argued that psihoyos had failed to register the two narcoleptic dog photos and the dinamation photo with the copyright office prior to filing suit.see a.
two days after wiley filed its summary judgment brief,psihoyos finally moved for leave to amend his complaint to allege infringement of the copyright in the correct two narcoleptic dog photos.ten days later,psihoyos submitted applications for copyright registration of the narcoleptic dog photos,as well as the dinamation photo.
the district court granted psihoyos motion for leave to amend the complaint only for the purpose of correcting scrivener errors,not for the purpose of specifying the correct narcoleptic dog photos or adding information about the newly filed applications for the narcoleptic dog photos and the dinamation photo.in explaining its partial denial of psihoyos motion for leave to amend,the district court emphasized psihoyos significant delay in requesting leave to amend and in submitting applications for registration of the relevant photographs,as well as the prejudice to wiley if the motion were granted at such a late stage in the litigation.
the district court then turned to wiley arguments for summary judgment.first,it held that copyright infringement claims accrue upon actual or constructive discovery of infringement and that psihoyos did not discover the infringements until,well within three years of filing suit.second,the district court concluded that psihoyos pending copyright registration applications for the narcoleptic dog and dinamation photos failed to satisfy the act registration requirement under a.accordingly,the court granted partial summary judgment in wiley favor as to the infringement claims relating to the narcoleptic dog,televisions and dinamation photos,leaving four infringement claims for trial 
after trial on psihoyos remaining four claims,the jury found no infringement of the gastroliths photo,infringement of the fossilized dinosaur tracks photo,resulting in an award of in damages,and willful infringement of the oviraptor and triceratops photos,resulting in an award of and in damages,respectively.arguing primarily that the jury award was excessive,wiley moved for remittitur or,in the alternative,a new trial.the district court denied the motion.
wiley appealed the district court partial denial of summary judgment as well as the denial of its motion for remittitur or a new trial.psihoyos the district court partial grant of summary judgment in wiley favor in connection with the narcoleptic dog and dinamation photos.
discussion 
we address first the issues relating to the district court partial denial and partial grant of summary judgment and second wiley appeal relating to damages.
summary judgment 
we review de novo the district court partial grant and partial denial of summary judgment.doninger niehoff,cir.summary judgment is proper only when,construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the,there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a.
accrual of copyright infringement claims 
civil actions for copyright infringement must be commenced within three years after the claim accrued.b.the district court held that an infringement claim does not accrue until the copyright holder discovers,or with due diligence should have discovered,the infringement the discovery rule.there is no dispute that under the discovery rule none of psihoyos claims are.
this circuit has previously employed a discovery rule for copyright claims under b.see merchant levy,cir stone williams,cir.wiley strives to distinguish the cases in which we have done so on the ground that they involved claims.we reject wiley suggestion that we apply different accrual rules for ownership and infringement claims,both of which are governed by b.in doing so,we join every circuit to have considered the issue of claim accrual in the context of infringement claims 
in urging us to adopt an injury rule instead,wiley relies on trw andrews,in trw,the supreme court held that the text and structure of the fair credit reporting act fcra evince congress intent to preclude judicial implication of a discovery rule for fcra claims.id.at.observing that the fcra provides that the statute of limitations runs from the date on which the liability arises,subject to a single statutory exception,the court concluded that the most natural reading of the fcra is that congress implicitly excluded a general discovery rule by explicitly including a more limited one.id.quoting.the court therefore reversed a decision of the ninth circuit,which had employed the discovery rule as a default unless congress has expressly legislated otherwise.id.at quoting andrews trw,cir.
we agree with our sister circuits that the text and structure of the copyright act,unlike the fcra,evince congress intent to employ the discovery rule,not the injury rule policy considerations also counsel in favor of the discovery rule in this context.see william graham haughey,cir u se of the discovery rule comports with the text,structure,legislative history and underlying policies of the copyright act.for substantially the reasons articulated by other circuits that have grappled with this issue after trw was decided,see supra note,we conclude that copyright infringement claims do not accrue until actual or constructive discovery of the relevant infringement and that
