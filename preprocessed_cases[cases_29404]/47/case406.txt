the plaintiffs,seth swirsky and warryn campbell,brought this action in district court,alleging that a song produced by the defendants infringed the plaintiffs copyright in the song,one of those love songs.the defendants moved for summary judgment,contending that the plaintiffs evidence failed to meet this circuit threshold extrinsic test for substantial similarity of works.the district court granted the motion,holding that the plaintiffs expert had failed to show by external,objective criteria that the two songs shared a similarity of ideas and expression.plaintiffs appeal.we conclude that the plaintiffs expert evidence was sufficient to present a triable issue of the extrinsic similarity of the two songs,and that the district court ruling to the contrary was based on too mechanical an application of the extrinsic test to these musical compositions.we also conclude that the district court erred in ruling portions of plaintiffs song to be unprotectable by copyright as a matter of law.we accordingly reverse the summary judgment.
factual background 
this case concerns the alleged similarity between the choruses of two popular and contemporary rhythm and blues r b songs plaintiffs one of those love songs one and mariah carey thank god i found you thank god.one was jointly composed by plaintiffs seth swirsky and warryn campbell collectively swirsky in.pursuant to a licensing agreement,one was recorded by the musical group xscape and released in may on xscape album traces of my lipstick.thank god was composed by defendants carey,james harris iii,and terry lewis in and was released on carey album rainbow in november.
one and thank god have generally dissimilar lyrics and verse melodies,but they share an allegedly similar chorus that swirsky claims as an infringement of one copyright swirsky filed this action in district court against carey,harris,lewis,and a number of music companies that had financial interests in thank god collectively carey for copyright infringement and related claims the defendants moved for summary judgment,contending that swirsky had failed to present a triable issue on the required first,or extrinsic,part of our circuit test for the establishment of substantial similarity necessary to sustain a claim of copyright infringement.the defendants also contended that portions of one were not protectable by copyright.the district court agreed with both contentions and granted summary judgment to carey.swirsky moved for reconsideration,which the district court denied.this appeal followed.
substantial similarity 
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment.see smith jackson,cir.we may uphold the summary judgment only if we find that no reasonable juror could find substantial similarity of ideas and expression between one and thank god,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.id.quoting kouf walt disney pictures television,cir narell freeman,cir.if swirsky presented indicia of a sufficient disagreement concerning the substantial similarity of the two works,then the case must be submitted to a trier of fact.brown bag software symantec,cir internal quotations and citation omitted.
to establish a successful copyright infringement claim,swirsky must show that he owns the copyright in one and carey copied protected elements of one.see rice fox broad,cir rice i smith,at.for purposes of summary judgment,carey conceded that swirsky owns a valid copyright in one.the element of copying is rarely the subject of direct evidence swirsky may establish copying by showing that carey had access to one and that thank god was substantially similar to one in one protected elements.see smith,at metcalf bochco,cir.where a high degree of access is shown,we require a lower standard of proof of substantial similarity.see three boys music bolton,cir smith,at.for the purposes of summary judgment,carey conceded that she had a high degree of access to one swirsky burden of proof of substantial similarity is thus commensurately lowered.
in determining whether two works are substantially similar,we employ a analysis an objective extrinsic test and a subjective intrinsic test.for the purposes of summary judgment,only the extrinsic test is important because the subjective question whether works are intrinsically similar must be left to the jury.see rice i,at smith,at.if swirsky can not present evidence that would permit a trier of fact to find that he satisfied the extrinsic test,he necessarily loses on summary judgment because a jury may not find substantial similarity without evidence on both the extrinsic and intrinsic tests.rice i,at quoting kouf,at.
the extrinsic test considers whether two works share a similarity of ideas and expression as measured by external,objective criteria see smith,at.the extrinsic test requires analytical dissection of a work and expert testimony.three boys,at.analytical dissection requires breaking the works down into their constituent elements,and comparing those elements for proof of copying as measured by substantial similarity.rice fox broad,d,reversed on other grounds,cir rice ii.because the requirement is one of substantial similarity to protected elements of the copyrighted work,it is essential to distinguish between the protected and unprotected material in a plaintiff work.see rice i,at apple computer,microsoft,cir brown bag,at.
the expert testimony on which swirsky relied was that of robert walser,chair of the musicology department at the university of california at los angeles.on the basis of his aural assessment of one and thank god,walser opined that the two songs had substantially similar choruses.
walser admitted that the lyrics and verse melodies of the two songs differed clearly and significantly,but stated that the two songs choruses shared a basic shape and pitch emphasis in their melodies,which were played over highly similar basslines and chord changes,at very nearly the same tempo and in the same generic style.walser also noted that it was a suspicious coincidence that the two songs choruses were both sung in.walser further testified that the choruses in both one and thank god shared a similar structure in that measures five through seven of each chorus were almost exactly the same as the first three measures of each chorus.
walser also noted a number of differences between the two songs choruses.walser found that the fourth measures of the choruses were dramatically different from each other and noted that while the basic,emphasized pitches and rhythms of the basslines were alike,the basslines to both choruses were ornamented and played slightly differently from chorus to chorus.walser also found that certain choices created differences between the two songs choruses.for example,he noted that in thank god,carey sings d,scale degree three,for a full beat on the first beat of the first measure while xscape in one sings the same pitch divided into two pulses.walser ultimately concluded,however,that these differences were not enough to differentiate the songs because the overall emphasis on musical notes was the same,which contribute d to the impression of similarity one hears when comparing the two songs.
walser transcribed his aural impressions into a series of visual transcriptions.walser created a transcription of each chorus pitch sequence,melody and bassline.walser labeled his transcription of the basslines a reduction because he transcribed only the basic,emphasized pitches and rhythms.walser thus did not include any bassline notes or pitches he found to be ornamented in his transcriptions 
the district court found this evidence insufficient to survive a motion for summary judgment for four reasons.first,the district court found that walser expert methodology was flawed.second,the district court,using its own analysis,found that no triable issue was raised as to the substantial similarity of measures two,three,six,seven,and eight of the two choruses.third,the district court held that measures one and five of one were scenes a faire and thus incapable of supporting a finding of infringement.finally,the district court discounted any similarity between the two choruses based on key,harmony,tempo,or genre because it found no precedent for substantial similarity to be founded solely on similarities in key,harmony,tempo or genre,either alone or in combination.we disagree with much of the district court reasoning on all four points and conclude that swirsky has satisfied the extrinsic test because he has provided indicia of a sufficient disagreement concerning the substantial similarity of the two works.brown bag,at internal quotations and citation omitted.
walser methodology 
there is nothing inherently unsound about walser musicological methodology in this case.the district court is correct that walser methodology is selective,in as much as it discounts notes that he characterizes as ornamental.walser,however,explained that the melody pitch and rhythm and bassline of a song can not be divorced from the harmonic rhythm of a song.according to walser,notes falling on the beat will be more prominent to the ear than notes falling off the beat.thus,walser opined that,even though measure three of both choruses were not identical in numerical pitch sequence or note selection,they both emphasize d the second scale degree,c,over an a in the bass,resolving to the third scale degree,d,over a d in the bass in the last half of the measure.walser provided a comparable analysis for measures one,three,and eight.
similarly,walser explained that some artists will ornament their notes in ways that others do not.walser testified at deposition that both carey and xscape ornament their notes with melismas and appoggiaturas,both of which are technical terms for moving up to the next note and then back again.walser testified that he did not notate these ornaments in his transcriptions,or take them into account in his opinion,because he took that to be a matter of the singer customizing the song and regarded those notes as not structural they are ornamental.as we said in newton diamond,we can consider only the defendant appropriation of the song compositional elements and must remove from consideration all the elements unique to plaintiff performance.id.at.walser methodology sought to remove notes he perceived as.
to a certain extent,walser methodology does concentrate on how the two choruses sound to his expert ears,which led the district court to conclude that his testimony related to intrinsic and not extrinsic similarity.we do not agree,however,that walser testimony was an intrinsic rather than extrinsic analysis.he was not testifying,as the intrinsic test would require,as to whether subjectively the ordinary,reasonable person would find the total concept and feel of the two choruses to be substantially similar.three boys,at quoting pasillas mcdonald,cir.instead,he was stating that,although the two choruses are not exactly identical on paper,when examined in the structural context of harmony,rhythm,and meter,they are remarkably similar.we,therefore,can not accept the district court conclusion that walser did not adequately explain,based on objective criteria,why his particular subset of notes is more important,or more appropriately analyzed,than the other notes present in the songs.the district court erred in completely discounting walser expert opinion.
b.the district court analysis 
the district court also erred by basing its comparison of the two choruses almost entirely on a comparison of melodic note sequences from the full transcriptions of the choruses objective analysis of music under the extrinsic test can not mean that a court may simply compare the numerical representations of pitch sequences and the visual representations of notes to determine that two choruses are not substantially similar,without regard to other elements of the compositions.under that approach,expert testimony would not be required at all,for any person untrained in music could conclude that did not match or that a is not identical to an.certainly,musicological experts can disagree as to whether an approach that highlights stressed notes,as walser does,is the most appropriate way to break down music for comparison,but no approach can completely divorce pitch sequence and rhythm from harmonic chord progression,tempo,and key,and thereby support a conclusion that compositions are dissimilar as a matter of law.it is these elements that determine what notes and pitches are heard in a song and at what point in the song they are found.to pull these elements out of a song individually,without also looking at them in combination,is to perform an incomplete and distorted musicological analysis 
furthermore,to disregard chord progression,key,tempo,rhythm,and genre is to ignore the fact that a substantial similarity can be found in a combination of elements,even if those elements are individually unprotected.see satava lowry,cir apple computer,at.thus,although chord progressions may not be individually protected,if in combination with rhythm and pitch sequence,they show the chorus of thank god to be substantially similar to the chorus of one,infringement can be found.see three boys,at satava,at 
we recognize the difficulties faced by the district court in this case.we have referred to the turbid waters of the extrinsic test for substantial similarity under the copyright act.metcalf,at.the application of the extrinsic test,which assesses substantial similarity of ideas and expression,to musical compositions is a somewhat unnatural task,guided by relatively little precedent.music is an art form that produces sounds and expresses moods,debra presti brent,the successful musical copyright infringement suit the impossible dream,miami ent.sports,but it does not necessarily communicate separately identifiable ideas.the extrinsic test provides an awkward framework to apply to copyrighted works like music or art objects,which lack distinct elements of idea and expression.nevertheless,the test is our law and we must apply it.see smith,at.the extrinsic test does serve the purpose of permitting summary judgment in clear cases of,and it informs the of some of the complexities of the medium in issue while guiding attention toward protected elements and away from unprotected elements of a composition.
in analyzing musical compositions under the extrinsic test,we have never announced a uniform set of factors to be used.we will not do so now.music,like software programs and art objects,is not capable of ready classification into only five or six constituent elements music is comprised of a large array of elements,some combination of which is protectable by copyright for example,in three boys we upheld a jury finding of substantial similarity based on the combination of five otherwise unprotectable elements the title hook phrase including the lyric,rhythm,and pitch the shifted cadence the instrumental figures the relationship and the fade ending.three boys,at.other courts have taken account of additional components of musical compositions,including melody,harmony,rhythm,pitch,tempo,phrasing,structure,chord progressions,and lyrics.see ellis diffie,cir noting that the district court had compared idea,phraseology,lyrics,rhythms,chord progressions,melodic contours,structures,and melodies under ordinary observer test cottrill spears,wl,at.may,unpublished disposition comparing pitch,chord progression,meter,and lyrics under extrinsic test tisi patrick,d,analyzing structure,melody,harmony,and rhythm under striking similarity test mckinley raye,wl,at.march,mem.analyzing lyrics,melodies,and song structure damiano sony music entm t,analyzing instrumentation and melody under the extrinsic test sylvestre oswald,wl,at may,analyzing melody and lyrics under striking similarity test cbs,analyzing chord progression,structure,pitch,and harmony under substantial similarity test.in addition,commentators have opined that timbre,tone,spatial organization,consonance,dissonance,accents,note choice,combinations,interplay of instruments,basslines,and new technological sounds can all be elements of a musical composition.see brent,supra,at stephanie jones,music copyright in theory and practice an improved approach for determining substantial similarity,duq.
