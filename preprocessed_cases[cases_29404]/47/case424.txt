wanda and christopher cavalier the cavaliers appeal the district court summary judgment and dismissal in favor of defendants random house,random house,the children television workshop,and ctw publishing collectively,ctw.in an action for copyright and trademark infringement,false designation of origin,and unfair competition,the cavaliers alleged that defendants published books containing art work,text,and characters virtually identical to materials previously submitted to random house and ctw by the cavaliers.we find that the moon night light cover and the the illustration of stars relaxing on clouds illustration raise triable issues of fact as to substantial similarity.we therefore reverse in part the grant of summary judgment,limited to the cavaliers copyright infringement claim as to the cover and illustration.we otherwise affirm.
background 
the cavaliers created copyrighted works involving several characters who are featured in children stories.their main character,nicky moonbeam,an anthropomorphic moon,teaches children to overcome their fears including fear of the dark and encourages children to follow their dreams.the cavaliers copyrighted these works in the period from to.
from through,the cavaliers submitted more than pages of material,including their copyrighted works,to random house and ctw.the first submission consisted of two moonbeam the man in the moon and nicky moonbeam saves the design for a moon night light to be built directly into the back cover of a board book.a board book is a book with sturdy,thick pages,designed for use by young children.later submissions in and consisted of pitch materials,which included detailed illustrations,ideas for general story lines and television programs,specific traits of the nicky moonbeam characters,and goals for the nicky moonbeam stories.
after meetings with the cavaliers regarding their submissions,random house and ctw rejected their works.soon thereafter,in february,random house and ctw jointly published the books good night,ernie and good night,elmo,and,in september,ctw aired the animated television series dragon tales.
description of the works 
the cavaliers works 
nicky moonbeam the man in the moon is an approximately story.its main characters are nicky moonbeam and daisy,a child.nicky is a figure drawn with a full moon head,sometimes with and sometimes without a full body.he has eyes,a nose,and a mouth,with moon rocks or craters on his face.nicky has star friends who have faces drawn in the upper point of the stars,with small,lidded eyes and no nose.in the latest version of the story,nicky is sad and lonely because he can not stop dreaming about meeting a child.nicky sails the dream weaver,a sailboat propelled by moonbeams,to earth where he meets daisy.after explaining what it is like to be the and all the jobs he has,nicky takes daisy for a ride in the night sky on his boat.they play in the clouds.daisy floats on a cloud that looks like a dragon while nicky balances on an cloud.after playing all night in the clouds,nicky and daisy return to earth where they play at the beach,building sand castles,playing with crabs,and listening to the waves.because he is having so much fun,nicky does not want to return to the sky.but after daisy explains that disaster would befall the earth if nicky did not go back,nicky returns to the sky and continues to do his man in the moon job,comforting and encouraging children.nicky is happier than he has ever been.he resolves to continue to surround the children with his moonbeam love,stretching his moonbeam arms to hug the world.
the cavaliers second story,nicky moonbeam saves christmas,is told in words depending on the version.in this story,the reindeer rudolph is sick and can not guide santa on his rounds.nicky is summoned to the north pole by the chief elf,where he learns about santa dilemma.daisy,who has traveled with nicky to the north pole on the dream weaver boat,suggests that nicky lead santa sleigh using his moonbeams to light the way.nicky is unsure whether he can do it,but daisy convinces him he must try.nicky saves the day,using his moonbeams to lead the sleigh while rudolph,who has been bolstered with cough syrup and claus chicken soup,guides them with a map.they complete santa rounds just as nicky moonbeams are exhausted.a celebration occurs at the north pole.nicky is proud because he believed in himself and completed the job.
the cavaliers night light in the sky idea was that the back cover of a board book featuring nicky moonbeam would extend some distance beyond the front cover and the pages,so that a portion of the inside of the back cover would be visible on the side,both when the book was closed and when it was being read.on the extended visible portion of the inside back cover would be a night light in the shape of a pearly white moon with black eyes and pink cheeks.stars would surround the moon night light.the on button for the moon night light would be a small circle with a star on it,positioned below and to the right of the night light.see appendix.a.as the cavaliers described it in their submission materials,the moon night light would be positioned to the right free of the pages an interactive button in the shape of a circle,star placed inside.as a child pushes the button in the circle the light shines and stays on for a full minute.
the cavaliers proposed art work includes the following illustrations,related to the stories stars wearing woolen and top hats while relaxing and playing on clouds,see appendix.a a star being polished with cloths by other stars,see appendix.a a smiling moon sending light blue moonbeams down to earth,with star dust trail and suggested text,nicky shines his long beams to earth for a child to walk up,hop on and nicky,as the moon,hanging just outside of a child bedroom window and sending stars to float around a child room and glow while the child falls asleep.
the cavaliers also suggested a just imagine book series featuring nicky moonbeam proposed the use of nicky badges and glow stars described and illustrated the concept of a star tree,from which characters could pluck a star illustrated a small girl floating on a cloud introduced nicky school in the sky and created a fear of the dark checklist to be packaged with its first story or television episode on that theme.
random house and ctw works 
good night,ernie and good night,elmo are both board books featuring sesame street muppet characters.in good night,ernie,told in words,ernie wonders about the stars and takes an imaginary journey in the night sky.he wonders how many stars there are,and counts them as he sits on a crescent moon.he wonders where the stars go during the day and he visits them.he wonders how the stars stay bright,and he thinks about helping them shine.all of this wondering makes ernie tired.ernie returns to his bed which is floating in the sky surrounded by stars.he and the stars wish each other good night.the stars have eyes touching a round bulbous nose.
in good night,elmo,told in words,elmo notices the moon shining on his pillow.the moon invites him to hop on its moonbeam and take a ride through the night sky,where elmo races a shooting star,sees the cow jumping over the moon,and begins jumping like the cow.all of that jumping tires elmo,and he rides a moonbeam back to his bed,where he begins to fall asleep as the moon shines through his window.the moon on the cover has eyes touching a round bulbous nose.
a star night light,surrounded by stars,is built into the extended inside back cover to the right of the free pages of good night,ernie.a comparable moon night light is built into the extended inside back cover of good night,elmo.the instructions for the night light are identical for both books to turn on ernie elmo night light,press the star button.it turns off by itself.
the dragon tales series features friendly talking dragons that take children on adventures to teach them how to face their fears,and to find ways of coping with everyday problems,like making friends and learning new skills.when emmy,a,and max,her brother,move into a new home,they discover a magical dragon scale.when they chant a poem,the scale transports them to dragon land,a brightly colored fantasy world in which the children discover talking trees,a rainbow river,gnomes,giants,and other fanciful creatures and geography.one of the dragon characters is a wise old teacher who teaches at the school in the sky.in the forest of darkness episode,a character who is afraid of the dark is sent on a mission to find the star tree and return with one of its star seeds.in conjunction with that episode,ctw marketed a fear of the dark checklist.
trial court proceedings 
the cavaliers filed in district court their first amended complaint,containing claims for copyright infringement under et trademark infringement under et and false designation of origin under et the cavaliers alleged that random house and ctw had copied and appropriated their works,including the nicky moonbeam characters,illustrations,text,and night light.
the trial court granted random house and ctw motion for summary judgment on the following grounds the cavaliers general story lines in which anthropomorphic moon and stars ease children fears of sleeping in the dark,and the depiction of related scenes and stock characters,are not protectible by copyright good night,ernie,good night,elmo,and dragon tales were not substantially similar to the material in the cavaliers works and given the lack of substantial similarity,the cavaliers lanham act claims also failed.the cavaliers timely appealed.

to establish a successful copyright infringement claim,a plaintiff must show that he or she owns the copyright and that defendant copied protected elements of the work.shaw,at.copying may be established by showing that the infringer had access to plaintiff copyrighted work and that the works at issue are substantially similar in their protected elements.id.for purposes of their summary judgment motion,random house and ctw did not contest ownership or access.the sole issue before us is whether any of random house or ctw works were substantially similar to the cavaliers submissions.
we employ a analysis in this extrinsic test and an intrinsic determine whether two works are substantially similar.id.the extrinsic test is an objective comparison of specific expressive elements.t he test focuses on articulable similarities between the plot,themes,dialogue,mood,setting,pace,characters,and sequence of events in two works.kouf walt disney pictures television,cir quotation marks and citation omitted.although originally cast as a test for similarity of ideas,sid marty krofft television,mcdonald,cir,the extrinsic test,now encompassing all objective manifestations of expression,no longer fits that description.shaw,at.the intrinsic test is a subjective comparison that focuses on whether the ordinary,reasonable audience would find the works substantially similar in the total concept and feel of the works.kouf,at quotation marks and citation omitted.
a court must take care to inquire only whether the protectible elements,standing alone,are substantially similar.williams crichton,cir emphasis in original citation omitted accord apple computer,microsoft,cir.therefore,when applying the extrinsic test,a court must filter out and disregard the elements in making its substantial similarity determination.see shaw,at applying the extrinsic test to determine whether there is substantial similarity between the protected expression of ideas in two literary works emphasis added berkic crichton,cir rejecting consideration of general ideas as well as in determining substantial similarity under the extrinsic test.
copyright law only protects expression of ideas,not the ideas themselves.b.for example,in kouf we found no substantial similarity even though the works at issue both involve d a life struggle of kids fighting insurmountable dangers,because g eneral plot ideas are not protected by copyright law kouf,at quoting berkic,at.it is well established that,as a matter of law,certain forms of literary expression are not protected against copying.berkic,at.familiar stock scenes and themes that are staples of literature are not protected.id.at.in berkic,we rejected finding substantial similarity based on scenes such as depictions of the small miseries of domestic life,romantic frolics at the beach,and conflicts between ambitious young people on one hand,and conservative or evil bureaucracies on the other.id,or situations and incidents that flow necessarily or naturally from a basic plot premise,can not sustain a finding of infringement.id.in williams,for example,we found no infringement because the common elements of electrified fences,automated tours,dinosaur nurseries,and uniformed workers were that flowed from the concept of a dinosaur zoo.williams,at.
good night,ernie and good night,elmo 
the cavaliers allege that the following elements of good night,ernie were copied by random house and ctw from their submissions 
a night light with an on button on the inside back cover of a board book,with the light appearing as a moon with eyes,nose,and smiling benevolent expression 
a character looking into the sky,wondering who and what the stars are 
a character interacting with smiling,bright yellow,stars 
a character sitting on a crescent moon 
smiling,bright yellow,stars playing and lounging on the clouds during the day and wearing colorful woolen hats 
a character polishing a star with a cloth 
smiling,bright yellow,stars floating in a child bedroom,glowing and comforting the child 
stars trailed by a distinctive moondust.
the cavaliers allege that the following elements of good night,elmo were copied 
a night light comparable to that in good night,ernie 
moonbeams shining through a window 
a character saying hop on a moonbeam and take a ride 
a character interacting with smiling,yellow,stars trailing sparkling dust and surrounded by other stars.
we first compare the good night books to the nicky moonbeam stories as literary works,taken as a whole.we then compare individual art work from the good night books to that in the cavaliers submissions.
comparison of literary works as a whole 
on summary judgment,only the extrinsic test matters for comparison of literary works.if the cavaliers can show that there is a triable issue of fact under the extrinsic test,the intrinsic test subjective inquiry must be left to the jury and random house and ctw motion for summary judgment must be denied.smith,at kouf,at shaw,at.conversely,if the cavaliers can not show a triable issue of fact under the extrinsic test,random house and ctw necessarily prevail on summary judgment.a jury could not find copyright infringement because there can be no substantial similarity without evidence under both the extrinsic and intrinsic tests.kouf,at.we now apply the objective factors of the extrinsic test,considering only the protectible material,to determine whether good night,ernie good night,elmo,taken as a whole,are sufficiently similar to the cavaliers works to raise a triable issue of fact.
the cavaliers nicky moonbeam stories and good night,elmo share the general premise of a child,invited by a character,who takes a journey through the night sky and returns safely to bed to fall asleep.but basic plot ideas,such as this one,are not protected by copyright law.see berkic,at both deal with criminal organizations that murder healthy young people,then remove and sell their vital organs to wealthy people in need of organ transplants.to s
