we agree that no material issue of fact was raised regarding the motion picture association of america mpaa good faith belief that rossi was infringing upon copyrighted materials.because the mpaa actions,compliant with the notice and takedown provisions of the digital millennium copyright act of dmca,constitute justification,were privileged and were not unreasonable,we affirm the district court summary judgment in favor of the mpaa.
background 
michael rossi has owned and operated the website since.rossi described his website as an online magazine that provided visitors with a directory of websites containing information about movies.beginning january,rossi offered memberships to visitors to his website.

after receiving notice from his isp that his website would be shut down,rossi found a new isp to host.according to rossi,was offline for a pproximately second to hours,and the amount of money he lost due to the website shutdown was unmeasureable.

discussiona.good faith belief under c a v 
title ii of the dmca contains a number of measures designed to enlist the cooperation of internet and other online service providers to combat ongoing copyright infringement.see.title ii preserves strong incentives for service providers and copyright owners to cooperate to detect and deal with copyright infringements that take place in the digital networked environment,pt,at.title ii also was intended to balance the need for rapid response to potential infringement with the sic legitimate interests in not having material removed without recourse.at.when a copyright owner suspects his copyright is being infringed,he must follow the notice and takedown provisions set forth in c of the dmca,which provide in part 
a to be effective under this subsection,a notification of claimed infringement must be a written communication provided to the designated agent of a service provider that includes substantially the following 
i a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
ii identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed,or,if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification,a representative list of such works at that site.
iii identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled,and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate the material.
iv information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to contact the complaining party,such as an address,telephone number,and,if available,an electronic mail address at which the complaining party may be contacted.
v a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner,its agent,or the law.
c emphasis added.
rossi does not dispute that the mpaa complied with the notice and takedown provisions set forth in c a i iv.rather,rossi contends that the mpaa did not have sufficient information to form a good faith belief under c a v that rossi was illegally infringing the mpaa copyrights.rossi urges us to adopt a rule that in order to have a good faith belief of infringement,the copyright owner is required to conduct a reasonable investigation into the allegedly offending website.
it is undisputed that mpaa did not attempt to download any movies from rossi website or any links to the site.rossi contends that if mpaa had reasonably investigated the site by attempting to download movies,it would have been apparent that no movies could actually be downloaded from his website or related links.rossi contends that if the mpaa had conducted such an investigation,it would have inevitably concluded that rossi website could not possibly have been providing a source for downloading movies.in short,rossi interpretation of the good faith belief requirement would impose an objective standard of review for gauging the reasonableness of the mpaa conduct in notifying rossi and his isp of the allegedly infringing website.
mpaa counters that the good faith belief requirement is a subjective one.in support of its argument,the mpaa directs us to cases interpreting good faith as encompassing a subjective standard.mpaa also notes that congress could have,but did not,expressly import a specific objective standard or reasonable investigation requirement into c a v.
rossi contention notwithstanding,interpretive case law and the statutory structure of c support the conclusion that the good faith belief requirement in c a v encompasses a subjective,rather than objective,standard although no federal court has yet interpreted the meaning of a good faith belief within the context of c,courts interpreting other federal statutes have traditionally interpreted good faith to encompass a subjective standard.see alvarez ibp,cir t o satisfy,a employer bears the difficult burden of proving both subjective good faith and objective reasonableness citations omitted see also austin mcnamara,cir the legislative history of a indicates that its reasonableness requirements were intended to create an objective standard,rather than a subjective good faith standard.emphasis added brooks village of ridgefield park,cir the good faith requirement is a subjective one that requires that the employer have an honest intention to ascertain and follow the dictates of the fair labor standards act.the reasonableness requirement imposes an objective standard by which to judge the employer conduct.alterations and internal quotation marks omitted.th
