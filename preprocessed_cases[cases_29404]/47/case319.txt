we must decide whether a contractual grant of the exclusive right to use an individual biographies to create a broadway musical stage play also constitutes a transfer of a copyright ownership interest in that individual unpublished autobiography.
in,rex woodard,a lawyer,journalist,and four seasons devotee,entered into a written agreement to ghostwrite the autobiography the work of thomas devito,one of the original members of the band later known as jersey boys.pursuant to this agreement,woodward and devito would split the proceeds from publishing or otherwise exploiting the manuscript.after completing the work but before securing publication,woodward succumbed to lung cancer in.unbeknownst to woodward widow and heir,donna corbello,devito had registered the work with the copyright office solely under his own name in,four months before woodward death.
in,devito and another former four seasons band member,nicholas macioci,executed an agreement the agreement with two of their former bandmates,frankie valli and bob gaudio.pursuant to this agreement,devito and macioci granted to valli and gaudio the exclusive right to use aspects of their lives related to the four seasons including,by way of example,their creative contributions,biographies,events in their lives,names and likenesses the materials to develop a musical stage performance the play about the four seasons.devito and macioci further waived all claims in connection with the materials,including any claim for violation of copyright.
after an abortive attempt to create the play with an initial producer,valli and gaudio entered into a page letter agreement dated may,the agreement to produce the play with another production company.pursuant to this agreement,valli and gaudio granted the right to use the band,the band music,and the band members names,likenesses,and life stories.in exchange for these rights,valli and gaudio would receive certain specified advances and royalties calculated as a percentage of gross receipts from future productions.while the contract was printed on the letterhead of dodgers theatricals,and reserved a space on the signature page for that same entity,the text of the agreement defines a different entity,dodger stage holding theatricals,as the producer.pursuant to the agreement,valli and gaudio were to distribute and did in fact so distribute a portion of any such payments received to devito.the musical jersey boys,produced pursuant to this agreement,opened on broadway in late to popular and critical acclaim,and has enjoyed continued international success.
corbello first discovered arrangements made by devito and his bandmates after she and her renewed their efforts to publish the work on the eve of the jersey boys debut.supposing that the broadway musical might rekindle interest in the band,she approached devito who,after a month of correspondence,rejected her overtures,concluding that the work was not saleable.in,the success of jersey boys prompted corbello and her to confirm the copyright in the work in the hope of future exploitation,when they discovered that devito had already registered solely in his own name a manuscript virtually identical to the work.corbello subsequently filed a supplementary application with the copyright office to add woodward as a coauthor and of the work,which prompted the office to amend the certificate of registration to list woodward and devito as coauthors of the work and thereto.
based on such revelation,and further accounts from writers,actors,and others involved in the play that attributed inspiration in part to the unpublished autobiography,corbello initially brought suit against devito for equitable accounting,declaratory judgment,and breach of contract.valli divorce proceedings in brought to public light further documents,including the agreement,regarding devito involvement in producing the play.corbello filed a third amended complaint in may,alleging twenty causes of action,including equitable accounting,declaratory judgment,and copyright infringement under both and foreign law,not only against devito but also against valli and gaudio,as well as the writers,directors,and producers of the play and various related entities.
corbello alleges that the play constitutes,at least in part,a derivative work of the devito autobiography,the right to create which resides exclusively in the of the underlying work,and their lawful successors,assignees,and licensees.corbello thus concludes that she,as legatee of woodward joint copyright in the work,deserves to share in the profits reaped by the various appellees licensing and assignment,or infringement,as the case may be,of the underlying rights.
facing dueling motions for summary judgment on several of the counts,the district court issued two orders,incorporated into the judgment from which corbello here appeals,granting summary judgment to all appellees on corbello claims for equitable accounting,declaratory judgment,and copyright infringement.in so ruling,the district court concluded that the agreement constituted not an assignment of devito copyright interest in,but rather a selectively exclusive license to use,the work the agreement,the agreement,and devito subsequent conduct sufficiently licensed appellees to use the work in developing the play and because united states law governs whether the appellees possessed a valid license to use the work,corbello claims for copyright infringement under foreign law must also fail.corbello timely appealed,disputing all of these conclusions as well as the district court taxation of costs against her 
corbello first contends that the agreement constituted a transfer of devito copyright interest in the work,rather than a selectively exclusive license,and that she,as the legatee of woodward a duly registered and of the work is therefore entitled to a portion of the proceeds resulting from valli and gaudio exploitation of that ownership interest.
a of a copyright must account to other for any profits he earns from licensing or use of the copyright.oddo ries,cir.copyright law considers both exclusive licenses and assignments to be transfer s of copyright ownership.the statute enumerates various rights that copyright owners hold,including the right to prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work.id.copyright owners may transfer a ny of the exclusive rights comprised in a copyright,including any subdivision of any of the rights specified by section,id.d,so long as the transfer is evidenced by a signed writing,id.a.
the parties do not dispute that corbello succeeded to her husband interest in the copyright of the work.thus,corbello claims for declaratory relief and equitable accounting turn on whether devito effectively transferred some quantum of his copyright interest to appellees.
pursuant to the agreement,devito grant ed to valli and gaudio the exclusive right to use and incorporate the materials in one or more theatrical productions,and any and all ancillary and subsidiary exploitations thereof.as defined in the agreement,materials includes,inter alia,devito biographies.the agreement also contains a provision by which devito agreed to waive any claim in connection with the materials or works including any claim that the works violate any right of copyright.
despite concluding that the agreement inclusion of biographies in the definition of materials sufficiently included the work so as to grant valli and gaudio an exclusive license to use it in producing the play,the district court nevertheless found that the work fell outside of the agreement use of biographies for the purpose of transferring ownership of a copyright interest in the work.we are not persuaded by the district court interpretation.
the agreement is governed by new york law.under new york law,a contract is unambiguous if on its face,it is reasonably susceptible of only one meaning.greenfield philles records.if a contract is unambiguous,the court may not consider extrinsic evidence of the parties intent.id.at.
in the context of the agreement,the term biographies is not ambiguous.standard dictionary definitions emphasize that biographies generally include both a formal and substantial written component a biography is a history of a person life the substance that is usually written the form.merriam webster collegiate dictionaryy ed accord oxford english dictionary ed.the process of recording the events and circumstances of another person life,esp.for publication the documenting of individual life histories considered as a genre of writing or social history.first listed definition id.a written account of the life of an individual.second listed definition.as an account of devito life that has been reduced to writing,the work,on its face,qualifies under these straightforward definitions as a biography.
nor are we persuaded by appellees argument that biography,as used in the agreement,refers not to documented life histories,but rather to the general story of one life.first,this definition,even when offered by dictionaries,takes a subsidiary position to the more common definition of a documented history.see oxford english dictionary.ed third and final listed definition merriam webster collegiate dictionary ed an account of the life of something as an animal,a coin,or a building third and final listed definition.moreover,under new york law,courts may not choose to interpret a contractual provision so as to render another term superfluous.see sayers rochester telephone.supp.mgmt.pension plan.cir see also antonin scalia bryan garner,reading law the interpretation of legal texts discussing surplusage cannon.here,to read biography as referring to devito general life story would do just that,as materials is defined to include not only biographies,but also creative contributions,events in your life,names and likenesses.thus,appellees proposed definition can not be squared with new york rules governing proper contract interpretation.
further,to read biographies as appellees urge would largely defeat the overarching purpose of the agreement.under new york law,courts should consider individual contract provisions in light of the entirety of the agreement in the context of the parties relationship and circumstances.in re riconda.here,as the agreement clearly states and uncontradicted by the evidence in the record,the goal of the parties in executing the agreement was to develop a theatrical adaptation of their own and their band own histories devito can not plausibly claim to have retained his privilege as a copyright to create derivative theatrical works of any biographical manuscript he owns,yet surrendered exclusively to others his generic life story,along with his name and likeness,to create a play.relinquishing one right to exploit creatively his or her life story,while at the same time retaining a corresponding right over one written biography,would be a endeavor.we decline to impute such an incompatible purpose to the definition of biographies in the agreement.
pursuant to the agreement,devito granted valli and gaudio the exclusive right to use his biographies,unambiguously including the work,to create a play.such play constitutes a derivative work,the right to create which resides in each copyright holder of the underlying work and may be transferred by that holder to a third party thus,in granting this exclusive right to create,whether classified as an exclusive license or an assignment,the agreement constitutes a transfer of ownership of devito right in the work to valli and gaudio.
appellees argue that our precedent,sybersound records,uav,cir,prohibits a of a copyright,such as devito,from transferring that right without permission from his,in this instance,corbello.but that argument stretches sybersound holding too far.
copyright is a creature of statute,and the only rights that exist under copyright law are those granted by statute.silvers sony pictures entm t,cir en banc.specifically,a copyright consists of a bundle of six statutorily created rights,currently codified at.sybersound,at while identifies what rights are included in a copyright,d describes how an owner can transfer a copyright and its component parts.see d.section d provides that t he ownership of a copyright may be transferred in whole or in part by any means of conveyance or by operation of law.id.d.and d states that a ny of the exclusive rights comprised in a copyright,including any subdivision of the rights specified in section,may be transferred as provided by d and owned separately.id.d.
we had several occasions prior to sybersound to interpret d broad language authorizing the alienabilty of copyrights.in bagdadi nazar,we explained,i t is important to note that the various rights included in a copyright are divisible and that any of the exclusive rights comprised in a copyright may be transferred and owned separately,cir citing d.in gardner nike,we added,s ection d enables the owner to transfer any fraction of his or her ownership interest to another party,thereby making that party a whole or joint owner,cir.and in silvers sony pictures,an en banc panel explained that the six component parts of a copyright may be chopped up and owned separately,and each separate owner of a subdivided exclusive right may sue to enforce that owned portion of an exclusive right,no matter how small.at emphasis added.in short,we made clear prior to sybersound that copyrights are divisible and that a copyright owner can freely transfer any portion of his ownership interests in that copyright after all,the plain language of d commands as much.
sybersound dealt with a plaintiff standing to sue for owned the copyright to nine songs.at.one such owner attempted to transfer to sybersound the exclusive right to use those songs for karaoke purposes.id.at.sybersound later filed a lawsuit against other third parties,alleging those parties were infringing on sybersound right to use the songs for karaoke purposes.id.at.
we held that when one independently attempts to grant an exclusive license of a particular copyright interest,that licensee in this case,sybersound does not have standing to sue alleged infringers.id.at.after all,one,acting independently,may not limit the other independent rights to exploit the copyright.id.such a conclusion stems from the principle that a can not transfer more than he himself holds thus,an assignment or exclusive license from one to a third party can not bind the other or limit their rights in the copyright without their consent.in other words,the third party right is exclusive as to the assigning or licensing,but not as to the other and their assignees or licensees.as such,a assignee or licensee lacks standing to challenge the attempted assignments or licenses of other copyright owners.
the sybersound court grounds this venerable principle of copyright law deeply in the statutory text,citing the definition of a transfer of ownership as including an assignment or license of any of the exclusive rights comprised in a copyright but not including a non exclusive license,id.quoting,and a provision that permits subdivision and alienation of a ny of the exclusive rights comprised in a copyright,id.quoting d.but the court emphasis on the word exclusive in these provisions can not mean that only sole owners possess exclusive rights,as such a rule would run directly contrary to another principle of copyright law the right of one to sue infringers without joining any of his fellow,a right sybersound itself expressly recognizes.see id.at noting that may bring suit for copyright infringement without joining other citing davis blige.cir.after all,the copyright statute permits infringement suits only if brought by owners of an exclusive right against alleged violators of such exclusive right.emphasis added.if an exclusive right could only be possessed by a sole owner of a copyright,a would be unable to bring an infringement action to protect his interest.
moreover,such a limitation would contradict the principle of the free transferability of copyright ownership interests a principle reflected in both the express language of d and our circuit precedent,neither of which treat transferability differently based on whether the original copyright owner is a sole owner or a.see,silvers,at gardner,at bagdadi,at thus,sybersound merely imposes a standing limitation on copyright assignees and licensees that reflects the basic principle that one can not give away more than one share in a copyright it need not,and should not,be extended to limit a ability to transfer unilaterally any exclusive copyright interests that he himself possesses.
therefore,sybersound presents no obstacle to devito exclusive transfer of his right to valli and gaudio under the agreement.because the agreement unambiguously transfers devito right to valli and gaudio,and copyright must account to one another for any profits earned by exploiting that copyright,the district court erred in rejecting corbello claims for accounting and declaratory relief.
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of appellees with respect to corbello infringement claims based on its finding that valli and gaudio held a license to use the work in the production of the play.see worldwide church of god phila.church of god,cir the existence of a license creates an affirmative defense to a claim of copyright infringement.we have concluded,however,that the agreement constituted a transfer of devito interest in the copyright,rather than a license.therefore,appellees have necessarily failed to establish the existence of a license as an affirmative defense to corbello infringement action.
our conclusion that the agreement constituted a transfer of ownership of devito right in the work to valli and gaudio would ordinarily preclude corbello infringement claims against valli and gaudio,as a of a copyright can not be liable to another for infringement of the copyright.oddo ries,cir.but a material issue of fact remains as to whether the agreement reversionary clause later terminated valli and gaudio ownership right,resulting in the appellees subsequent infringement upon corbello copyright interest.
the agreement provided that the rights granted therein would continue perpetually either i if they merged with the play pursuant to a contract with an initial producer or ii pursuant to a contract into which valli and gaudio might enter with a second producer within two years of the initial producer rights lapsing.
corbello argues that valli and gaudio did not execute the agreement the second production contract within that period.specifically,she points to evidence in the record which suggests that the initial producer rights expired on december,and that the agreement,though dated may,was not in fact fully executed until october.if true,the reversionary clause of the agreement would have terminated valli and gaudio ownership right as of december,and any subsequent exploitation by appellees of the work may have infringed upon corbello copyright interest.appellees counter with testimony of michael david,president of dodger theatricals,which suggests that the parties to the agreement may have reached an oral agreement prior to december.in the face of such contradictory evidence regarding whether the reversionary clause terminated valli and gaudio right,disputed material facts preclude summary judgment as to corbello infringement claims based on valli and gaudio ownership of the copyright interest 
appellees argue alternatively that devito conduct resulted in a grant to them of an implied nonexclusive license to use the work,effective regardless of the reversionary clause in the agreement.in support of their argument,they cite devito delivery of the work to the writers of the play with the apparent intention that they would use the work to create the play,along with devito attendance at performances of,and acceptance of royalty checks from,the play.
while we may consider delivery of a copyrighted object as a relevant factor to determine the existence of an implied license,asset marketing,gagnon,cir,the copyright statute forbids courts from inferring a transfer of copyright or a license from mere delivery of the material object in which the work is embodied.rather,courts should focus primarily on the licensor objective intent at the time of the creation and delivery of the software as manifested by the parties conduct.gagnon,at.for instance,the ninth circuit ha s held that an implied license is granted when a person the licensee requests the creation of a work,the creator the licensor makes that particular work and delivers it to the licensee who requested it,and the licensor intends that the copy and distribute the work.gagnon,at internal quotation marks and footnote omitted.
here,devito intentions in delivering the work to the writers are unclear at best.appellees did not ask devito to create the work.in fact,the creation of the work long predated any specific effort on devito part to parlay his life into a broadway musical.gagnon,at finding an implied license when,among other things,the licensor created the copyrighted work at the licensee request.moreover,devito specifically denied that he ever licensed the work to appellees.devito initially provided the work to the writers for the purpose of providing background information on devito friend,raymond gyp decarlo.in doing so,devito gave explicit instructions that the writers should not duplicate or circulate the work and that the work should remain confidential,because devito wanted to publish the work in the future.the writers then returned the work to devito a mere few days later.devito apparent lack of familiarity with the content of the work as reflected in the play further undercuts any potential connection between his support of the play and his support of the appellees use of the work in its production.finally,the express provisions in the agreement governing the use of the work further controvert any apparent expectation that valli and gaudio might have had in otherwise using the work.
in light of such contradictory facts regarding devito intent in delivering the work,the district court grant of summary judgment on the ground of an implied license to the extent it rested on such a ground was inappropriate.
relying on its conclusion that the agreement constituted a license of devito copyright interest,rather than a transfer of ownership,the district court granted summary judgment to appellees on corbello claims of infringement under foreign law.because we here conclude that the agreement instead constituted a transfer of ownership,summary judgment on such foreign law grounds must be reversed as well.
corbello appeals the district court assessment of costs against her.because we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment,we vacate the award of costs and remand for reconsideration after other proceedings on remand.see,cusano klein,cir.
we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of appellees,vacate its assessment of costs against corbello,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.we award costs on appeal to corbello as the substantially prevailing party.see fed.a i f a judgment is affirmed in part,reversed in part,modified,or vacated,costs are taxed as the court orders.
reversed in part,vacated in part,and remanded.
i agree that we must remand this case to the district court for further proceedings.i disagree,however,that the word biographies in the agreement unambiguously includes the manuscript of the autobiography of devito ghost written by corbello decedent woodard for devito the work,completed some eight years earlier,and that the agreement therefore transferred certain derivative rights in the work to the to the agreement valli and gaudio.first,i would conclude that the language is ambiguous under new york law and remand on that basis for the district court to decide as a matter of fact whether the agreement included a transfer of rights with respect to the autobiography.but second,even if the agreement unambiguously transfers devito interest in the work,i think sybersound records,uav,cir,compels us to conclude that the transfer effected only a nonexclusive,rather than an exclusive,license to use the work for the creation of a musical stage play.
the majority offers a plausible but not the only plausible reading of the language of the agreement.because the language at issue is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation,brad city of new
