appellants seek review of a final determination of the copyright royalty judges,setting rates and terms relating to webcasting.see digital performance right in sound recordings and ephemeral recordings order.may.webcasting is the process of transmitting sound recordings over the internet.this case consolidates five separate appeals.a group of commercial webcaster appellants led by the digital media association dima argues that the rates for commercial webcasters set by the judges were unreasonable and that the absence of a cap on minimum fees paid per licensee was arbitrary and capricious.several small commercial webcaster appellants argue that the judges refusal to permit them to pay royalties as a percentage of revenues was arbitrary and capricious.noncommercial broadcaster the collegiate broadcasters,intercollegiate broadcasting system,and the national religious broadcasters noncommercial music license that the judges set unreasonable rates for noncommercial webcasters,that they established a minimum fee per station without substantial evidence,and that they improperly deferred consideration of requirements to a later proceeding.appellant royalty logic,a contender to serve as the clearinghouse or collective for royalty payments,argues that the judges exceeded their statutory authority by naming soundexchange,the sole royalty collective respondent copyright royalty board defends the judges determination.the board is the institutional entity in the library of congress that house s the judges.soundexchange intervened to defend the judges determination.
months after the briefing schedule had been set,royalty logic moved to file supplementary briefs on the issue of whether the appointment of the copyright royalty judges violated the appointments clause of the constitution of the united states.a motions panel of this court granted the motion without prejudice to the merits panel deciding whether or not to consider the issue,and set a supplemental briefing schedule,soliciting briefs from royalty logic,the board,and soundexchange.royalty logic argued that the judges appointment violated the constitution.soundexchange and the board argued it did not,and argued further that royalty logic had forfeited consideration of the issue by not raising it in initial briefing before this court.we hold that royalty logic has forfeited the appointments clause issue.we vacate the minimum fee for both noncommercials and commercials,and remand those portions of the determination for reconsideration by the copyright royalty judges.in all other respects,we affirm the determination.
background 
statutory background 
recorded music may be protected by two copyrights.one copyright protects the musical work written by a composer and usually owned by a music publisher.the other protects the sound recording and is owned by the producer of the sound recording.see.the copyright owners of musical works,but not those of sound recordings,have long enjoyed exclusive rights to public performances of their works.id.the practical effect of this scheme is that when radio stations play a song,they must pay a royalty to the musical work owner but not the sound recording owner.see id,a.

in delegating authority,congress required the judges to follow certain statutory guidelines.the schedule of rates and terms must distinguish among the different types of eligible nonsubscription transmission services then in operation and shall include a minimum fee for each such type of service.id.f b.rates should most clearly represent the rates and terms that would have been negotiated in the marketplace between a willing buyer and a willing seller.id.in determining such rates and terms,the judges must base their decision on economic,competitive and programming information presented by the parties.id.specifically,they must consider whether the service may substitute for or may promote the sales of phonorecords or otherwise affect the copyright owner other streams of revenue.id.f b i.the judges must also consider the relative roles of the copyright owner and the transmitting entity with respect to relative creative contribution,technological contribution,capital investment,cost,and risk.id.f b ii.finally,i n establishing such rates and terms,the judges may consider the rates and terms for comparable types of digital audio transmission services and comparable circumstances under voluntary license agreements described in subparagraph a.id.f b.identical statutory language applies to reasonable rates and terms for ephemeral recordings.id.e.

appointments clause challenge 
before reviewing the substance of the judges determination,we must address a question raised about the tribunal itself.nearly a year after appealing the judges order,and almost three months after filing its opening brief,royalty logic submitted a supplemental brief in which it argued for the first time that the manner in which the copyright royalty judges are appointed violates the appointments clause of the united states constitution.this court allowed the filing without prejudice to the merits panel deciding whether or not to consider the appointments clause issue and directed the board and soundexchange to file responsive supplemental briefs.supp.briefing order.may.
t he congress may by law vest the appointment of inferior officers a category that all parties agree includes the judges in the president alone,in the courts of law,or in the heads of departments.const.art.ii,cl.congress has entrusted the appointment of the judges to the librarian of congress.see a the librarian shall appoint copyright royalty judges after consultation with the register of copyrights.the librarian,of course,is neither the president nor a court of law.royalty logic argues that he is also not a head of department,maintaining that under freytag commissioner,d,only the heads of departments within the executive branch qualify.according to royalty logic,the library of congress is within the legislative branch.the government and soundexchange dispute both points.they note that the library serves several executive functions and that the librarian is subject to appointment and removal by the president.they also reject the reading of freytag that limits departments to those at the cabinet level.
we need not resolve the dispute.as appellees point out,royalty logic has forfeited its argument by failing to raise it in its opening brief.see sw.airlines transp.sec.it is certainly within our power to consider royalty logic challenge.the freytag petitioners failed to object to the special trial judge appointment,raising their constitutional argument for the first time on appeal.but the court emphasized that its consideration of the untimely objection was an exercise of discretion,and that only in rare cases is it proper to do so.freytag,at.see also id.at.scalia,concurring noting that the majority did not accept petitioners argument that appointments clause challenges can not be forfeited.
this is not the rare case that compels us to exercise our discretion to consider an untimely argument.an appointments clause challenge is nonjurisdictional,id.at.majority opinion,and thus not subject to the axiom that jurisdiction may not be waived,see networkip,llc fcc.and royalty logic has not given us any reason to depart from our normal forfeiture rule.it offers no justification for its delay.at oral argument,royalty logic counsel explained that the issue simply had not occurred to him until,several months after filing his opening brief,he was reading the cases and particularly freytag,and concluded that this was a foundational and structural issue.oral arg.rec.at.but these cases were not new.freytag was decided over eighteen years ago,and the most recent case cited in royalty logic supplemental brief dates from.see royalty logic supp.br.we have cautioned litigants that s upplemental briefs do not provide an opportunity to convert review of an agency order into a broadbased constitutional attack,and that we will not consider a supplemental brief that is nothing more than a poorly disguised attempt to file a second main brief to advance arguments overlooked in the party first main brief.plaquemines port,harbor terminal dist.fed.comm n.
nothing in the supplemental briefing which was allowed without prejudice to the decision we have now made to hold royalty logic to its forfeiture persuades us otherwise.to the contrary,the briefs incomplete treatment of the appointments clause issue underscores our decision.for example,the parties failed to cite or discuss the effect of our statements,in other contexts,that the library of congress is not part of the executive branch.see.legal found.sentencing comm n,noting that the library is exempt from the apa because its provisions do not apply to the congress that is,the legislative branch judd billington,former library employee could not bring claim under rehabilitation act because that statute applies only to employees in the executive branch.the absence of the webcasters views compounds the problem.were we to decide the constitutional question without thorough,considered briefing from all interested parties,we would run the risk of an improvident or opinion on the legal issues tendered,mcbride merrell dow,refusing to decide issue not raised until reply brief.
finally,the potential for consequences counsels against resolving the appointments clause question on this record.the librarian of congress appoints not only the copyright royalty judges but also the register of copyrights.see a.to hold that the librarian is not the head of a department within the meaning of the appointments clause would invalidate the judges determinations and call into question the status of every registered american copyright.we decline to resolve this important question of significance,carducci regan,on the basis of hasty,inadequate,and untimely briefing.
commercial webcasters challenges 
competitive market requirement 
the judges are required to determine royalty rates that most clearly represent the rates and terms that would have been negotiated in the marketplace between a willing buyer and a willing seller.f b.the commercial webcasters argue that an earlier decision by the librarian,affirmed by this court,requires the judges to base rates on a perfectly competitive market.see determination of reasonable rates and terms for the digital performance of sound recordings and ephemeral recordings webcaster i,july,because of the diversity among the buyers and the sellers,the copyright arbitration royalty panel noted that one would expect a range of negotiated rates,and so interpreted the statutory standard as the rates to which,absent special circumstances,most willing buyers and willing sellers would agree in a competitive marketplace.this claim fails for two reasons.first,the dictum from the prior decision calling for a competitive benchmark does not require rates to be based on a perfectly competitive market.second,our having affirmed webcaster i in lends no additional weight to the commercial webcasters argument.far from endorsing a competitive or perfectly competitive standard,we specifically refused to examine the correctness of the librarian decision regarding competitiveness,at emphasis added.because of the exceptionally deferential review undertaken in that case,our having affirmed the decision of the librarian can not be taken to bind the judges today.id.the statute speaks only of a willing buyer and a willing seller.this is the standard the judges were to apply in evaluating whether a market benchmark was an appropriate model on which to base their own rate determinations.
the statute does not require that the market assumed by the judges achieve metaphysical perfection in competitiveness.the judges,not this court,bear the initial responsibility for interpreting the statute.applying the lessons of chevron natural resources defense council,d,we can only assess the reasonableness of the judges interpretation of the inherent ambiguity in the statute mandate.appellants have pointed to nothing in the judges interpretation to establish unreasonableness.
royalty rates 
the judges set a per play royalty rate to be paid by commercial webcasters.this rate will increase,once a year,from per play in to per play in.see order.at.the rate schedule was based on the testimony of soundexchange expert economist michael pelcovits,who modeled his estimates on the market for interactive webcasting covering the digital performance of sound recordings.id.at.interactive is not within the scope of the statutory a listener to access particular sound recording s on request or a program of sound recordings specifically created for the recipient.j.by contrast,the webcasting at issue in this determination does not allow the same degree of user customization.therefore pelcovits proposed,and the judges adopted,an interactivity adjustment by which to decrease the interactive rates.see order.at.pelcovits calculated the adjustment through a process called hedonic regression,a statistical method that tries to isolate the value of a particular variable in a complex set of data.in this case,pelcovits tried to isolate the value of interactive service,which he used to reduce his final estimates.
the commercial webcasters argue that the market for interactive music by pelcovits in his model,which was generally adopted by the insufficiently competitive.they claim that the market for interactive music is different than the market for passive,webcasting because an interactive music service is not viable unless it can provide music from each of the four major record labels.the commercial webcasters argue that subscribers to interactive webcasting services expect access to recordings from all four major labels in exchange for the significant monthly payment that is a condition of their subscription.commercial op.br.assuming this asymmetry of consumer demand,they conclude that the judges should not have produced webcasting rates by looking to interactive music rates.to provide music from each major record label,an interactive music service must reach agreement with each major record label independently.according to the commercial webcasters,this competitive dynamic gives record labels disproportionate bargaining power.any one record label could block an entire service,so each in turn can negotiate higher rates.by looking to this market,they argue,the judges provided better terms to the copyright owners than they would have earned in the marketplace.
commercial webcasters presented this argument to the judges,supported by the testimony of their expert witness,economist adam jaffe.the judges considered the argument and found it to be largely unsubstantiated.id.at.they further noted that there was testimony that directly contradict ed any suggested generalization that the repertoires of all four major record labels are necessary as a prerequisite prior to undertaking the operation of a consumer music service in the various digital music service markets.id.at.the judges cited evidence that was able to operate its custom radio channels without one of those record labels for two years,even though the record label accounted for nearly of the market in terms of repertoire.id.they summarized their assessment of jaffe testimony by calling his concerns that the benchmark market wa s not sufficiently competitive little more than the theoretical speculations of an academic offering a quick outline of possible criticisms without carefully considering the applicable facts or alternative explanations.id.at.the judges assessed jaffe testimony and pointed to contrary evidence in the record.having evaluated the arguments on both sides,we hold that it was not unreasonable for the judges to base their webcasting rates in part on the market for interactive music 
the standard of review applicable in ratemaking cases is highly deferential.see.power,at.the deferential standard of review extends to our consideration of arguments by the commercial webcasters about whether a voluntary agreement could be considered comparable to the ratesetting the judges were undertaking.see f b.when setting rates and terms,the copyright royalty judges may consider the rates and terms for comparable types of digital audio transmission services and comparable circumstances under voluntary license agreements.f b emphasis added.the commercial webcasters argue that the judges committed reversible error by failing to consider a voluntary agreement between record companies and satellite digital audio services.nothing in the statute requires the judges to consider any comparable agreements,let alone particular agreements.it is generally within the discretion of the judges to assess evidence of an agreement comparability and to decide whether to look to its rates and terms for guidance.we therefore affirm the judges decision not to consider the agreement when setting rates for webcasting.
apart from the objections to the judges assessment of the market and voluntary agreements,the commercial webcasters also dispute the hedonic regression analysis used by pelcovits to reduce the rates.in a later determination,setting rates and terms for satellite radio subscription services,the judges credited a study with an interactivity adjustment much greater than the interactivity adjustment pelcovits used in this determination.see determination of rates and terms for preexisting subscription services and satellite digital audio radio services sdars.if the judges had used the sdars adjustment,the final rates would have been smaller.commercial webcasters contend that this was arbitrary.this argument fails for two reasons.first and most obviously,the judges are not bound by future agency action.the suggestion defies logic.the judges must act on the basis of a written record and prior determinations and interpretations of the copyright royalty judges.a.they are not required to act on the basis of future determinations of the copyright royalty judges.failure to conform with subsequent agency action can not be a basis for a finding of arbitrariness.see tesoro ref.mktg.ferc,rejecting futility argument based on subsequent agency action.second,even if the judges were so bound,their determination in sdars specifically criticized the interactivity adjustment,saying it might well be improved through a hedonic regression analysis.see.at.the judges failure to use a similarly inexact adjustment for webcasting was not arbitrary or otherwise contrary to law.
finally,the commercial webcasters argue for setting aside the judges proposed rates because they are crushing and disproportionate.commercial op.br.the apa permits us to set aside agency action that is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.this they have not shown.
the judges adopted a usage fee structure for all commercial webcasters.small commercial webcasters object to this uniform solution,seeking instead to pay a percentage of their revenues.the judges rejected such an argument because they found no evidence in the record about how to delineate between small webcasters and large webcasters and noted that none of the small commercial webcasters provided helpful evidence about what demarcates a small commercial webcaster from other webcasters at any given point in time.order.at.the small commercial webcasters now argue that the definition of small commercial webcaster is irrelevant because the approach would apply only to those webcasters that elected to pay a percentage of total gross revenue.the board and soundexchange say that this revised argument,which they claim was first raised at rehearing,is waived.see b a party waives any objection to a provision in the determination unless the provision conflicts with a proposed finding of fact or conclusion of law filed by the party.we assume without deciding that the small commercial webcasters initial proposal,combined with the references to gross revenue they made during the proceedings,are sufficient to avoid waiver.
regardless,their objection fails on the merits.the judges determination spelled out five reasons they favored payments based on performances rather than webcaster revenue performances are more directly tied to the nature of the right being licensed it is difficult to calculate revenue it is difficult to define revenue unambiguously auditing and enforcement would be more difficult and payments might not increase with increased usage of copyrights.id.at.
an regime charging a fraction of total gross revenue would address only two of the judges five concerns.it might remove some of the difficulty in calculating and defining revenue,because total gross revenue includes all money received by a webcaster.but it would not address the other problems raised by the judges that total gross revenue is not directly tied to the right being licensed that auditing and enforcement would be difficult and that usage might increase without a corresponding increase in royalty payments.in an attempt to address these problems,the small commercial webcasters point to the judges subsequent adoption of a royalty in the sdars,satellite radio proceeding.commercial op.br.because the judges adopted it for satellite radio,they argue,the judges should have adopted it for webcasting.beyond the ordinary problem of trying to hold an agency to action it takes in a subsequent proceeding,see supra part,the judges were explicitly reluctant to adopt that approach in the satellite radio proceeding 
because we have no true per performance fee proposal before us nor sufficient information from evidence of record to accurately transform any of the parties proposals into a true per performance fee proposal,the copyright royalty judges conclude that a fee structure for the sdars is the most appropriate fee structure applicable to these licensees.
sdars.at.the judges therefore appear committed to applying royalties for commercial services,and deviated from that preference for licensing only because the parties presented them with no better options.
finally,it was not error for the judges to reject the small commercial webcasters pleas that paying per performance would wreck their inefficient business models.the judges made clear they could not guarantee a profitable business to every market entrant.order.at.the judges are not required to preserve the business of every participant in a market.they are required to set rates and terms that most clearly represent the rates and terms that would have been negotiated in the marketplace between a willing buyer and a willing seller.f b.if small commercial webcasters can not pay the same rate as other willing buyers and still earn a profit,then the judges are not required to accommodate them.
minimum annual fee 
in addition to setting royalty be paid by webcasters to the owners of sound recording statute requires there to be a minimum fee for each type of service provided.f b.these fees are paid by licensees,like the webcasters,to the collective,to cover administrative costs of the copyright owners in administering the license.webcaster i.at.the judges found reasonable a minimum fee of an annual nonrefundable,but recoupable minimum per channel or station payable in advance.order.at.
commercial webcasters object to the per channel or station phraseology for its failure to set a cap on the number of minimum fees a licensee could be required to pay.in particular,they fear that some of their business models might be deemed to contain thousands or tens of thousands of channels,making the combined fees prohibitively expensive.anticipating such an interpretation,dima and soundexchange agreed to cap minimum fees at per year per licensee in.voluntary negotiation by affected parties is given effect in lieu of any determination by the judges.f.because some parties have not contracted around this provision,the issue is not moot and we have power to reach it.
the board argues that the commercial webcasters waived their right to make any objection to the minimum fees because they did not raise it before the judges.see b.but even if the commercial webcasters failed to specifically object to the omission of a fee cap,they objected to soundexchange proposal,which included no fee cap.see dima and radio broadcasters proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law.they also endorsed a agreement between soundexchange and dima that contained a fee cap the voluntary agreement.see dima,america online,and.proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law.these proposals conflict with the judges determination,which lacks any provision relating to a cap on the number of minimum fees that any licensee may be required to pay.b.therefore,the arguments were not waived.
on the merits,commercial webcasters raise several objections.they argue the determination was an arbitrary departure from webcaster i,which contained a flat minimum fee of per licensee,without any possibility of raising it for additional channels or stations.at.they also argue it was arbitrary for the judges to fail to limit the number of minimum fees that might be paid by a single licensee,when they relied in part on the voluntary agreement,which had such a limit.that agreement charged licensees a minimum fee of,or per channel or station,whichever is less,per year.d.finally,they argue that without a cap,the accumulation of minimum fees could become excessively burdensome.
the judges are free to depart from precedent if they provide reasoned explanations for their departures,and they discussed minimum fees in their determination.see order.at.but in only two footnotes do they appear aware of the possibility of individual licensees paying more than.see id.at nn.even in the judges discussion of side channels which included an example of one licensee being charged,id.at do not seem to anticipate the possibility of a webcaster paying hundreds of thousands of dollars or more.the voluntary agreement the judges quoted,see id.at,capped minimum fees at per licensee.depending on future interpretations of channel or station,the judges determination might impose enormous fees on some business models and tiny fees on others,based on regulations that have not yet been defined.such a regime is arbitrary and does not appear to represent what would have been negotiated in the marketplace between a willing buyer and a willing seller.see f b.
therefore we vacate the minimum fee provision for commercial webcasters,and remand for the judges to reconsider this portion of their determination.
the judges set a late fee of of the royalty payment due for that period,accruing monthly.see order.at.the commercial webcasters object,arguing that the judges should have considered course of dealing evidence showing that in practice,rates of such magnitude are very rarely,if ever,imposed.commercial op.br.the judges did,however,consider course of dealing evidence.see order.at.they considered it and were not persuaded that contracting parties ability to waive late fees require d rejection of a higher late fee.id.they noted that some contracts lacked discretion to grant waiver and observed that w hile waiving a late fee can promote good feelings in a private agreement,it has no bearing for a statutory license where copyright owners and performers can not terminate access to their works under the license.id.therefore we affirm the judges determination with respect to late fees.
confidential information 
webcaster i.at,codified at,entitled copyright owners to view certain confidential information of the webcasters,but only as part of their statements of account in aggregated form.c.the collective,which held the information,was prohibited from using it for any purpose other than royalty collection and distribution and activities directly related thereto.id.in the determination under review,the judges chose to expand access to statements of account,though limit ing this right to copyright owners and performers,and their agents and representatives.order.at.
the commercial webcasters object to this change,saying the information is sensitive and pointing to several marketplace agreements with confidentiality agreements similar to the prior regime.the judges reasonably rejected these arguments.as they made clear in their determination,there was no finding that disclosure of the types of information contained in the statements of account would harm the business interests of the reporting services.id.at.the commercial webcasters witness did not articulate how the information contained in the statements could injure the competitiveness of a service,or otherwise negatively affect its operation.id.the judges also found that the existing confidentiality arrangement negatively impact ed the copyright owners substantive rights under the section and licenses.id.because we ask only whether the judges acted reasonably based on record evidence,we are easily satisfied that the judges met their burden on this point.
noncommercial broadcasters challenges 
the judges set an annual noncommercial rate of per channel or station up to a monthly cap of ath.beyond this cap,the judges ordered noncommercial broadcasters noncommercials to pay the usage rate applicable to the commercial webcasters.the judges refused to modify an interim order establishing requirements for all services,instead deferring a decision on this issue to a future rulemaking.
noncommercials contend this rate and cap constituted reversible error because noncommercial broadcasting constitutes a different type of service than commercial webcasting and the act required the judges to treat different types of services differently,see f b.specifically,noncommercials contend that the judges arbitrarily rejected a flat fee benchmark for noncommercials in favor of a commercial interactive subscription benchmark adopted an annual per channel or station minimum fee as necessary to cover soundexchange administrative costs adopted a fee above a listenership threshold,contrary to their mandate and without evidentiary support and set the noncommercial usage fee equal to the commercial usage fee without evidentiary support.noncommercials also contend the judges erred in refusing to adopt new requirements.although the judges adoption of the fee was unsupported by record evidence,and we remand that issue,we conclude noncommercials other contentions are unpersuasive.
rejection of noncommercials proposed benchmarks 
in determining the noncommercial rates,the judges rejected,as benchmarks,two proposals offered by noncommercials rates loosely based on an agreement covering licenses under sections and of the copyright act for the term october,to december,npr agreement and rates for musical works paid by noncommercial radio stations for musical work performances under section of the act.at the outset,we note that the judges did not,as noncommercials contend,adopt soundexchange commercial interactive subscription benchmark for noncommercial broadcasting.the judges in fact rejected the proposed benchmarks of both noncommercials and soundexchange.order.at.although the judges derived rates above a listenership threshold from the rates applicable to commercial webcasters,the judges offered noncommercials a huge discount over these rates in the form of a monthly ath allowance that would be covered by a minimum fee.
rejection of the npr agreement as a benchmark 
executed in,the npr agreement provided that npr would pay soundexchange a lump sum for licenses over a period but did not specify the parties valuations of any given year of the contract.at the time the agreement was executed,npr had stations providing streaming content.by the end of the npr agreement period,npr had such stations.the agreement was silent as to how stations beyond the original were to be handled.
the judges rejected the npr agreement as a benchmark,finding that it did not provide clear evidence of a per station rate that could be viewed as a proxy for one that a willing buyer and a willing seller would negotiate today.order.at.the judges gave four reasons.first,the agreement provided for a lump sum amount to cover the entire term of the contract with no amount specified for different years.id.the judges noted that there was nothing in the agreement or the record to indicate the proper attribution of payments for any given year.the judges declined noncommercials invitation to arrive at this annual per station rate by simply dividing the lump sum amount by the number of years and number of stations covered,because such a proposal accounted for neither the time value of money in the latter years of the agreement nor the erosion in the purchasing power of the dollar since.id.at.second,the proposal sought to divide the average yearly rate by stations the number of npr stations covered by the agreement in,but the judges noted that the agreement covered only stations when it was executed and that neither the contract nor the record indicated how additional stations beyond the covered by the agreement were to be handled.id.at.depending on which figure was used,the two possible fees would have been approximately or double the amount of the other.id.third,the judges took issue with the fact that nothing in the agreement or the record indicate d the parties expectations as to levels of streaming.id.fourth,the judges stated that none of the final rate proposals of the noncommercial webcasters would cover the minimum annual fee determined for commercial webcasters.id.at.
in maintaining that this determination was arbitrary,noncommercials object not simply to the judges rejection of the agreement as evidence of the appropriate rate,but to their failure to adopt the agreement as the appropriate benchmark.see,noncommercials op.br.congress invited the judges to consider voluntary marketplace agreements for comparable types of digital audio transmission services and comparable circumstances.f b.noncommercials contend that the npr agreement was exactly the type of agreement suggested by congress,as it covered the same rights at issue here,the same activity noninteractive internet simulcast streaming of radio broadcasts,the same seller soundexchange and its members,and the same buyer npr,one of the noncommercial broadcasters who brought this appeal.noncommercials op.br.for the reasons that follow,however,the judges decision to reject the agreement as a benchmark was not arbitrary.
first,the judges noted that the number of npr stations covered by the agreement seemed to have nearly doubled over the course of the agreement,making it unclear which figure it ought to use in calculating a benchmark.second,given the judges dual concerns that flat fee structures permit increasing usage without increasing payment,order.at,and that this benchmark was proposed to cover all noncommercials,irrespective of whether they were part of a submarket in the marketplace for webcasting that was distinctly different from commercial webcasting,id.at,the judges could reasonably conclude the agreement silence as to the parties expectations as to levels of streaming,was relevant to their decision to reject the agreement as a benchmark.finally,the judges statement that the agreement did not serve as a proxy for one that a willing buyer and a willing seller would negotiate today,evinces concern with the age of the agreement,especially in light of their further emphasis that the lump sum payment covered the period between and.in addition to the judges concern that the proposal failed to account for the time value of money,reference to the agreement coverage dates highlights how outmoded the agreement was.this time period began a little over seven years prior to the order january,applicability date and just a few months short of nine years prior to the order may,effective date.the judges might have been able to compensate for some of these mathematical deficiencies in calculating a fee.but another lack of evidence that soundexchange valued each year of the agreement them from making those adjustments in a rational way.
noncommercials point out that the judges adopted rates for commercial webcasting that were based on an interactive commercial subscription benchmark that required mathematical adjustments to deduct the value added by interactivity even though the benchmark was concededly not without any warts.id.at.consequently,noncommercials contend that the judges rejection of the npr agreement as the benchmark was arbitrary because a gencies can not treat type a cases differently from similarly situated type b cases.noncommercials reply br.quoting indep.petroleum ass babbitt.this contention might have merit if the npr agreement and the interactive subscriptions benchmark suffered from the same shortcomings.however,the judges rejected the npr agreement for reasons independent of the mathematical adjustments it required.nevertheless,even if the required mathematical adjustments were the only shortcomings of the agreement,the judges adopted the benchmark for commercial webcasters based on the testimony of michael pelcovits,soundexchange expert,regarding the hedonic regression analysis that he performed to quantify and deduct the value of interactivity from the interactive commercial subscription benchmark.by contrast,noncommercials presented no evidence quantifying soundexchange yearly valuation of the npr agreement,the time value of money,or the declining purchasing power of the dollar.because the judges had no duty to compensate for these shortcomings,the situations were not similarly situated and any purported differences in treatment were not arbitrary.moreover,even if the judges erred in rejecting the npr agreement because the proposed fee would not cover the minimum annual fee determined for commercial webcasters,order.at,see infra part.b,this was harmless error in light of the judges other independent reasons for rejecting the agreement.see pdk,drug enforcement.

in rejecting the rates paid by noncommericial radio stations for musical works performances under section of the copyright act as a benchmark,the judges explained that the musical works benchmark proposed by noncommercials is based on a very different marketplace characterized by different sellers who are selling different rights.order.at.further,the judges found ample evidence in the record to controvert the underlying premise of this proposed benchmark that the market for sound recordings and the market for musical works are necessarily equivalent.see soundexchange proposed findings of fact discussing evidence that in comparable markets musical works publishers receive lower royalty rates than do owners of sound recording rights.
noncommercials do not dispute the judges rationale for rejecting this benchmark,but instead insist it was arbitrary for the judges not to justify rejecting reliance on the fee structure of these agreements as evidence that a structure,regardless of usage,was appropriate for noncommercials.however,because the judges noted that these agreements were so different from the rights at issue,representing different sellers who are selling different rights of different value,the judges did not act arbitrarily by rejecting these agreements even for this limited purpose.moreover,the rates set by the judges did establish a structure for the vast majority of noncommercial broadcasters then before them.order.at.the judges estimated that the monthly ath allowance would create,effectively,a structure covering approximately of the npr stations that streamed over the web.id.at.while this appeal was pending,npr was dismissed voluntarily from the case.order.because npr appears to have represented the largest of the noncommercial broadcasters,see order.at,the allowance may cover all the broadcasting needs of the remaining noncommercials.for instance,the national religious broadcasters noncommercial music license committee noncommercial religious broadcaster committee,the only noncommercial party other than npr to file proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law with the judges,stated that listenership on stations is typically small.cdr,a station,is representative of other stations and averages a concurrent online audience of just under listeners.noncommercial religious broadcasters committee proposed findings of fact.assuming days in a month,this listenership level would result in ath of streaming content,or only of the monthly ath allowance.
minimum annual fee 
the judges adopted an annual per channel or station minimum fee on the rationale that certainly the bare minimum that such services should have to pay is the administrative cost of administering the license.order.at.the judges set as the fee amount based on their previous conclusion that was the appropriate minimum fee for commercial webcasters and on the lack of record evidence to suggest that the submarket in which a noncommercial webcaster may reside would yield a different administrative cost to soundexchange as compared to the administrative costs associated with commercial webcasters.id.furthermore,the judges stated that soundexchange had made no distinction between webcasters with regards to the fee and relied on webcaster i for the notion that all webcasters should pay the same minimum fee for the same license.order.at.because there is no record evidence that represented soundexchange administrative cost per channel or station,the judges determination in this regard can not be sustained.
in discussing the appropriate minimum fee for commercial webcasters,the judges observed that they had little evidence of the administrative cost per licensee.id.they nevertheless set as the minimum fee for commercial webcasters because soundexchange proposed the amount,the amount was substantially lower than the minimum fees proposed by the various webcasters,id.at,and soundexchange must have anticipate d that would cover its administrative costs even in the absence of royalties,id.whatever merit this approach may have for commercial webcasters,the judges could hardly apply it rationally to noncommercial broadcasters,some of which proposed arrangements with minimum fees well below.see,noncommercial religious broadcasters proposed findings of fact.this is especially so given the lack of evidence supporting soundexchange administrative costs.the most that can be inferred from soundexchange proposal is that its annual per channel or station administrative costs do not exceed,not that they equal.additionally,noncommercials suggest there was record evidence refuting the level of soundexchange administrative costs the npr agreement,viewed most favorably to soundexchange,averages out to a rate significantly less than and so undercuts the judges view that a minimum fee represented the lower bound of soundexchange administrative costs.the judges offered no reason for rejecting the agreement as evidence of soundexchange administrative costs.
the board response on appeal misses the mark.it offers that if there was a lack of evidence of soundexchange administrative costs,the fault lies with noncommercials,which did not obtain discovery and introduce evidence to establish that fact.but this approach is inconsistent with rational decisionmaking,which requires more than an absence of contrary evidence it requires substantial evidence to support a decision,see natural res.def.council,herrington.furthermore,because soundexchange did not base its proposal on administrative costs,noncommercials could hardly challenge a theory first presented in the judges determination and not advanced by any participant.in effect,noncommercials can not be faulted for failing to present contrary evidence of administrative costs,because no evidence existed yet to counter.
in sum,it was arbitrary for the judges,in the absence of record evidence,to apply the fee to noncommercials on the theory that the bare minimum noncommercials should have to pay is the administrative cost of administering the license,and we remand the issue of the appropriate minimum fee for noncommercials.
adoption of a fee above a listenership threshold 
acknowledging that commercial and certain noncommercial webcasters represent two different segments of the marketplace,the judges noted that agreements produced by the parties in this proceeding covering noncommercial services typically structured payments as flat fees.order.at citing the npr agreement.the judges also noted the myriad of characteristics that noncommercials claim set them apart from commercial broadcasters,such as status,different noncommercial mission,and different sources of funding.id.at.nevertheless,the judges expressed concern that flat fees do permit increasing usage without increasing payment.id.therefore,to account for these competing considerations,the judges adopted a flat,rate structure up to a specified cap coupled with a per performance rate for usage exceeding the cap.id.in imposing the cap,the judges relied on testimony from soundexchange economic expert,erik brynjolfsson,that as noncommercial stations grow,they begin to compete with commercial stations for listeners.brynjolfsson opined that,beyond a certain size,a cap is necessary in order to reduce the chance that small noncommercial stations will cannibalize the webcasting market more generally and thereby adversely affect the value of the digital performance right in sound recordings.id.at quoting brynjolfsson written rebuttal testimony at.the judges agreed,concluding as a matter of pure economic rationale based on the willing seller standard,that the proliferation of a different price for noncommercials must include safeguards to assure that,as the submarket for noncommercial webcasters that can be distinguished from commercial webcasters evolves,it does not simply converge or overlap with the submarket for commercial webcasters.id.at.the judges explained that this convergence theory approximates the circumstances in which willing buyers and willing sellers would have a meeting of the minds that would result in a lower rate than the rate applicable to the general commercial webcasting market.id.at.
noncommercials contend that the record evidence and the judges reasoning demonstrate that the only appropriate fee structure for noncommercials is a flat fee.however,brynjolfsson testimony provided evidence against a plain structure beyond a certain listenership threshold,and the judges decision to adopt a listenership threshold was rationally based on brynjolfsson testimony of how the willing seller calculation would change as a noncommercial broadcaster grew and competed with a commercial webcaster for listeners.also,the judges did set a flat fee structure for the vast majority of noncommercials,most of which were not expected to exceed the specified cap.
noncommercials also contend that the judges legally erred by substituting a theory of convergence for the willing seller standard.as the judges stated,however,it relied on convergence as a proxy for what a willing buyer and willing seller would negotiate in the marketplace.id.at.to the extent noncommercials suggest that this statement constituted lip service to the statutory standard,as competition was the beginning and end of the board inquiry,noncommercials op.br,this criticism is no criticism at all because competition certainly would affect the actions of a willing seller,as the judges noted.even assuming the judges should have recognized noncommercial services unwillingness to accept a commercial rate in a marketplace transaction,id,the judges did not set a commercial rate for the noncommercials.it set a rate only above a listenership threshold.noncommercials are given a monthly discount of ath on the commercial rate.moreover,that assertion,as do many others made by noncommercials,speaks only to the willingness of the buyer to enter the transaction and says nothing of the seller.the judges,taking both buyers and sellers into account,came to a reasonable compromise between the two positions.
noncommercials further contend the judges arbitrarily selected listenership levels as the measure of alleged convergence.they maintain f ocusing on listenership rather than the standard congress set is,by definition,arbitrary because agency action is arbitrary if it relied on factors which congress has not intended it to consider.noncommercials op.br.quoting motor vehicle mfrs.ass state farm mut.auto.ins,d.as the judges could rationally conclude that competition for listeners would be a major factor affecting convergence,however,it was also rational for them to conclude that competition could be assessed by looking to listenership.the judges did not rel y on factors which congress has not intended it to consider,state farm,at,for competition is relevant to the willing seller standard.still,noncommercials maintain that the arbitrariness of setting ath as the convergence point underscores the arbitrariness of using listenership to assess convergence.even assuming the judges decision to set the convergence point at ath was arbitrary,it would not undermine their approach of using listenership to assess convergence miscalculating a convergence point does not undermine the validity of a convergence approach any more than an economics student who miscalculates the equilibrium point on a demand curve undermines the notion that such a point exists.
finally,noncommercials contend the evidence upon which the judges relied to support convergence does not demonstrate convergence.while noncommercials make several challenges on this score,their most fundamental objection is that this evidence related to a few of the largest npr stations.noncommercials op.br.the judges explained,however,that the evidence of convergence in the record appears to apply more clearly to the stations at the larger end of the range of npr station size,order.at.under these circumstances,the judges reasonably looked to evidence of the largest npr stations for evidence of convergence.although noncommercials protest that the judges cited very little evidence in support of convergence,the judges need not have cited any evidence to reach a rational result basing their determination on npr evidence from large npr stations made logical sense because without evidence relating to the largest npr stations,there would be very little evidence of convergence at all,noncommercials op.br.in other words,this evidence constituted the most,if not only,relevant evidence.to show this determination was arbitrary,noncommercials had to demonstrate that the judges misconstrued the evidence of convergence or else failed to consider important evidence that undermined their understanding of the convergent effect.the most noncommercials did,however,was to assert that the npr agreement undermined the theory of convergence because the agreement made no distinctions based on listenership.as noted,however,the judges rejected the npr agreement structure in favor of a structure that prohibited,beyond a threshold,increasing usage without increasing payment.also,the ath threshold imposed as a result of the adopted convergence theory would appear to apply only to large npr stations,lending further support to the judges use of and reliance on evidence from the larger npr stations.noncommercials thus fail to show the judges determination in this regard was arbitrary.
adoption of a noncommercial usage rate above a listenership threshold equal to the commercial rate 
noncommercials contend that setting the noncommercial usage fee equal to the commercial usage rate was arbitrary,capricious,and without record support.but the rate structures are not equal.while the prevailing rates for noncommercials that exceed a listenership threshold are equal to those of commercial webcasters,noncommercials contention attempts to obfuscate the fact that they are given a ath discount over the prevailing commercial rate.because noncommercials have made no objection that such an allowance is trivial,this contention is unpersuasive.to the extent that noncommercials position is that the commercial rate itself is arbitrary,it lacks merit.see supra part.
requirements 
although the parties introduced evidence as to requirements,the judges deferred a determination to a later rulemaking and left in place an interim rule.order.at.although noncommercials challenge this action as arbit
