the question presented in this appeal is whether a internet service provider subjected itself to personal jurisdiction in maryland by enabling a website owner to publish photographs on the internet,in violation of a maryland corporation copyrights.adapting the traditional due process principles used to determine a state authority to exercise personal jurisdiction over persons to the internet context,we hold that in the circumstances of this case,a maryland court can not constitutionally exercise jurisdiction over the georgia internet service provider.accordingly,we affirm the district court order dismissing the complaint against the internet service provider for lack of personal jurisdiction.
als scan,a maryland corporation with its place of business in columbia,maryland,commenced this action for copyright infringement against digital service consultants,digital,and digital customers,robert wilkins and alternative products,collectively,alternative products.als scan,which creates and markets adult photographs of female models for distribution over the internet,claims that alternative products appropriated copies of hundreds of als scan copyrighted photographs and placed them on its websites,and,thereby gaining revenue from them through membership fees and advertising.als scan further alleges that digital,as the internet service provider isp for alternative products,enabled alternative products to publish als scan copyrighted photographs on the internet by providing alternative products with the bandwidth service needed to maintain its websites.als scan thus alleges that all of the defendants have infringed and are infringing its copyrights within maryland and elsewhere by selling,publishing,and displaying its copyrighted photographs.
digital filed a motion to dismiss the complaint against it under federal rule of civil procedure b,asserting that the district court lacked personal jurisdiction over it.in support of its motion,digital provided affidavits demonstrating that digital is a georgia corporation with its only place of business in atlanta.digital asserts that it is an isp which provided bandwidth service to alternative products as a customer but that it is not affiliated in any way with alternative products except through an customer relationship.in addition,digital states that it did not select the infringing photographs for publication it did not have knowledge that they were posted on alternative products website and it received no income from alternative products subscribers.digital acknowledges that it does maintain its own website,but asserts that its website contains no means for any person to enter into a contract with,transfer funds to,or otherwise transact business with,digital.
digital also states that,other than through the internet,it has no contacts with the state of maryland.it avers that it conducts no business and has no offices in maryland that it has no contracts with any persons or entities in maryland that it derives no income from any clients or business in maryland that it does not advertise in maryland other than through its website and that it owns no property in maryland.
in a responding affidavit,als scan asserts that copies of its copyrighted photographs have appeared on alternative products two,and.it also alleges that one of its employees in maryland purchased an membership to,using a credit card,and,by obtaining that membership,the employee received a user name and a password to access the website.that website,it asserts,displayed als scan copyrighted photographs,allegedly in violation of the copyright act.
the district court granted digital motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.the court found that it had neither specific nor general jurisdiction over digital because digital does not engage in any continuous and systematic activities within maryland,and there is no evidence that als scan claim arises out of any contacts which digital may have with maryland.
from the district court ruling,als scan filed this interlocutory appeal 
the district court decision to dismiss the complaint against digital for lack of personal jurisdiction presents a legal question that we review de novo,see christian science bd.of dirs.of the first church of christ,scientist nolan,cir,although we review any underlying factual findings for clear error,see in re celotex,cir.
under federal rule of civil procedure k a,a federal court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant in the manner provided by state law.see esab group,centricut,cir.maryland courts have concluded that the state longarm statute,courts jud.proc,expands maryland exercise of personal jurisdiction to the extent allowed by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.see androutsos fairfax.because the limits of maryland statutory authorization for the exercise of personal jurisdiction are coterminous with the limits of the due process clause,the statutory inquiry necessarily merges with the constitutional inquiry,and the two inquiries essentially become one.stover,cir.thus,we apply the constitutional limitations on state service of process incorporated in rule k a,and our inquiry coalesces into the question of whether digital has sufficient minimum contacts with maryland.see diamond healthcare of ohio,humility of mary health partners,cir ciena jarrard,cir.
historically,the limits on personal jurisdiction were grounded in a court power over the actual person of the defendant.thus,a person presence within the territorial jurisdiction of a court was prerequisite to its rendition of a judgment personally binding him.int l shoe washington.citing pennoyer neff.over time,however,and with the introduction of personal service of summons or other forms of notice,the supreme court recognized that due process requires only that in order to subject a defendant to a judgment in personam,if he be not present within the territory of the forum,he have certain minimum contacts with it such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.int l shoe,at.quoting milliken meyer.with respect to corporations,the court has recognized that unlike an individual,its presence without,as well as within,the state of its origin can be manifested only by activities carried on in its behalf by those who are authorized to act for it.id.thus,the terms present or presence are used merely to symbolize those activities of the corporation agent within the state which courts will deem to be sufficient to satisfy the demands of due process.id.at.
although the courts have recognized that the standards used to determine the proper exercise of personal jurisdiction may evolve as technological progress occurs,it nonetheless has remained clear that technology can not eviscerate the constitutional limits on a state power to exercise jurisdiction over a defendant.in hanson denckla,d,the court explored the problem of reconciling technological advances with the limits of personal jurisdiction and stated 
as technological progress has increased the flow of commerce between states,the need for jurisdiction over nonresidents has undergone a similar increase.at the same time,progress in communications and transportation has made the defense of a suit in a foreign tribunal less burdensome.in response to these changes,the requirements for personal jurisdiction over nonresidents have evolved from the rigid rule of pennoyer neff to the flexible standard of international shoe state of washington.but it is a mistake to assume that this trend heralds the eventual demise of all restrictions on the personal jurisdiction of state courts.those restrictions are more than a guarantee of immunity from inconvenient or distant litigation.they are a consequence of territorial limitations on the power of the respective states.however minimal the burden of defending in a foreign tribunal,a defendant may not be called upon to do so unless he has had the minimal contacts with that state that are a prerequisite to its exercise of power over him.
id.at.internal citations omitted see also mcgee int l life ins,d noting that the trend toward expanding the permissible scope of personal jurisdiction is,in part,attributable to the fundamental transformation of our national economy over the years.the court has thus mandated that limits on the states power to exercise personal jurisdiction over nonresidents must be maintained,despite the growing ease with which business is conducted across state lines.
determining the extent of a state judicial power over persons outside of its borders under the international shoe standard can be undertaken through two different finding specific jurisdiction based on conduct connected to the suit or by finding general jurisdiction.see helicopteros nacionales de colombia,hall,d christian science,at.if the defendant contacts with the state are also the basis for the suit,those contacts may establish specific jurisdiction.in determining specific jurisdiction,we consider the extent to which the defendant purposefully avail ed itself of the privilege of conducting activities in the state whether the plaintiffs claims arise out of those activities directed at the state and whether the exercise of personal jurisdiction would be constitutionally reasonable.see christian science,at see also helicopteros,at.describing a basis for jurisdiction where a controversy is related to or arises out of a defendant contacts with the forum.
on the other hand,if the defendant contacts with the state are not also the basis for suit,then jurisdiction over the defendant must arise from the defendant general,more persistent,but unrelated contacts with the state.to establish general jurisdiction over the defendant,the defendant activities in the state must have been continuous and systematic,a more demanding standard than is necessary for establishing specific jurisdiction.see helicopteros,at.esab group,at.
in this case,als scan argues that digital activity in enabling alternative products publication of the infringing photographs on the internet,thereby causing als scan injury in maryland,forms a proper basis for the district court specific jurisdiction over digital.the question thus becomes whether a person electronically transmitting or enabling the transmission of information via the internet to maryland,causing injury there,subjects the person to the jurisdiction of a court in maryland,a question of first impression in the fourth circuit.
applying the traditional due process principles governing a state jurisdiction over persons outside of the state based on internet activity requires some adaptation of those principles because the internet is a person places information on the internet,he can communicate with persons in virtually every jurisdiction.if we were to conclude as a general principle that a person act of placing information on the internet subjects that person to personal jurisdiction in each state in which the information is accessed,then the defense of personal jurisdiction,in the sense that a state has geographically limited judicial power,would no longer exist.the person placing information on the internet would be subject to personal jurisdiction in every state.
but under current supreme court jurisprudence,despite advances in technology,state judicial power over persons appears to remain limited to persons within the state boundaries and to those persons outside of the state who have minimum contacts with the state such that the state exercise of judicial power over the person would not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.see hanson,at.noting that it is a mistake to assume that the technological trend heralds the demise of all restrictions.but even under the limitations articulated in international shoe and retained by hanson,the argument could still be made that the internet electronic signals are surrogates for the person and that internet users conceptually enter a state to the extent that they send their electronic signals into the state,establishing those minimum contacts sufficient to subject the sending person to personal jurisdiction in the state where the signals are received.under this argument,the electronic transmissions symbolize those activities within the state which courts will deem to be sufficient to satisfy the demands of due process.int l shoe,at.but if that broad interpretation of minimum contacts were adopted,state jurisdiction over persons would be universal,and notions of limited state sovereignty and personal jurisdiction would be eviscerated.
in view of the traditional relationship among the states and their relationship to a national government with its nationwide judicial authority,it would be difficult to accept a structural arrangement in which each state has unlimited judicial power over every citizen in each other state who uses the internet.that thought certainly would have been considered outrageous in the past when interconnections were made only by telephones.see,stover,at finding a defendant occasional telephonic requests for information from investigation services to be insufficient to subject the defendant to personal jurisdiction in a maryland court.but now,even though the medium is still often a telephone wire,the breadth and frequency of electronic contacts through computers has resulted in billions of interstate connections and millions of interstate transactions entered into solely through the vehicle of the internet.the convergence of commerce and technology thus tends to push the analysis to include a concept,under which each person who puts an article into commerce is held to anticipate suit in any jurisdiction where the stream takes the article.but the concept,although considered,has never been adopted by the supreme court as the controlling principle for defining the reach of a state judicial power.see generally asahi metal indus.superior court of,d.
until the due process concepts of personal jurisdiction are reconceived and rearticulated by the supreme court in light of advances in technology,we must develop,under existing principles,the more limited circumstances when it can be deemed that an citizen,through electronic contacts,has conceptually entered the state via the internet for jurisdictional purposes.such principles are necessary to recognize that a state does have limited judicial authority over persons who use the internet to contact persons within the state.drawing on the requirements for establishing specific jurisdiction,see helicopteros,at,which requires purposeful conduct directed at the state and that the plaintiff claims arise from the purposeful conduct,we adopt today the model developed in zippo manufacturing zippo dot com.
in zippo,the court concluded that the likelihood that personal jurisdiction can be constitutionally exercised is directly proportionate to the nature and quality of commercial activity that an entity conducts over the internet.at.recognizing a sliding scale for defining when electronic contacts with a state are sufficient,the court elaborated 
at one end of the spectrum are situations where a defendant clearly does business over the internet.if the defendant enters into contracts with residents of a foreign jurisdiction that involve the knowing and repeated transmission of computer files over the internet,personal jurisdiction is proper.at the opposite end are situations where a defendant has simply posted information on an internet web site which is accessible to users in foreign jurisdictions.a passive web site that does little more than make information available to those who are interested in it is not grounds for the exercise of personal jurisdiction.the middle ground is occupied by interactive web sites where a user can exchange information with the host computer.in these cases,the exercise of jurisdiction is determined by examining the level of interactivity and commercial nature of the exchange of information that occurs on the web site.
