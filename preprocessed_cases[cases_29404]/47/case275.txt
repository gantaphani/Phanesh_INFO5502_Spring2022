the settlement agreement signed by anderson and thomsen unambiguously assigned ownership of certain copyrights to famous dave.paragraph nine of the agreement plainly states that al is releasing all copyright,proprietary design and sign work to famous dave in all other restaurants that he has worked on with the exception of signature restaurants.a transfer of ownership requires no magic words to satisfy copyright law even a pro forma statement will do.radio television espanola new world entm t,cir quotation omitted.paragraph nine is a clear conveyance releasing to of the sum total of thomsen previous work for famous dave all other restaurants that he has worked on with the explicit exception of his signature restaurant designs and future designs.for ease of reference we will call the transferred works existing non signature designs.
