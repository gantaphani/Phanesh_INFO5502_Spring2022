judges decide cases that implicate fundamental rights,restrict liberty,or even terminate life.judicial authority is,however,circumscribed by the limits of judicial neutrality.few responsibilities weigh more heavily on a judge than the task of addressing questions of our own potential partiality and ensuring that the parties and the public have confidence in the judges who hear the cases that affect them.
for better or worse,many lawsuits have become exercises in mass aggregation,and judges must confront new issues relating to the propriety of their participation in such cases as they come before them.aetna life ins.lavoie,d noting that without due care constitutional disqualification arguments could quickly become a standard feature of litigation.we decide today that a judge who learns that he is a party to a class action lawsuit by virtue of his possession of a small financial interest in one of the parties or in the subject matter of the lawsuit,and who has devoted substantial time to consideration of that case,but who promptly divests himself of the otherwise disqualifying financial interest,need not recuse himself from continued participation in the disposition of that case.
background 
this appeal concerns the settlement of a large lawsuit brought as a class action on behalf of freelance authors whose work has been reproduced without their express consent on a variety of electronic databases,including but not limited to lexisnexis and westlaw.times tasini,d.class members received notice of the class action and its proposed settlement by mail,email,and publication,beginning on or about april.class members were required to submit their proofs of claim within days of the first date of the class notice program.the claims period thus expired on september.
on september,the united states district court for the southern district of new york george daniels,judge approved the settlement.several members of the class who objected to the settlement filed an appeal on october.on december,the appeal was calendared for oral argument to be held on march,before the second circuit,and,thereafter,more than three months after the expiration of the time for filing claims,a panel consisting of judges winter,walker,and straub received the parties briefs.
on march,after extensive preparation,judge winter and i realized that there was a high probability that we held copyrights in works,such as law review articles and speeches,reproduced on defendants databases.at oral argument on march,we publicly stated in open court that we would forego any financial interest in the settlement that we could possibly have now or in the future.brought to our attention that,because the claims period had expired without either of us asserting a claim,we were at that point ineligible to recover anything in the class action in any event.
within days,we solicited the opinion of the committee on codes of conduct of the judicial conference of the united states the committee as to how to proceed.by letter dated march,the committee informed us of its opinion that we should not continue to serve on the panel.letter from the committee on codes of conduct of the judicial conference of the united states to judges winter and walker,docket,at.relying on canon d i of the code of conduct for united states judges the code of conduct or the code,the committee reasoned that,because we are part ies to the proceeding,we must recuse ourselves.id.at.while the committee suggested that i t makes sense to allow an appellate judge to take action equivalent to opting out after the period expires so long as the action occurs promptly upon assignment and discovery of the potential conflict,id.at,it concluded that our divestiture on march was insufficient to cure our putative disqualification because we had devoted substantial time to the case before that date in preparing for oral argument,id.at 
on march,we informed the committee of the added fact that the case had been assigned to us after the claims period had therefore,even had we not affirmatively renounced any interest in the outcome,we would have been ineligible to participate in any recovery.on march,the committee chair informed us that this fact did not alter the committee opinion that recusal should occur.we must now decide whether to follow the committee opinion.
discussion 
recusal under the code of conduct and 
section of title,and its identical analogue in the code of conduct is designed to promote public confidence in the impartiality of the judicial process by saying,in effect,if there is a reasonable factual basis for doubting the judge impartiality,he should disqualify himself,reprinted in.thus,it provides that a judge should recuse himself not only when he is actually biased or partial,b see also id,but also when a reasonable observer might question his neutrality,id.a.as the supreme court has explained,b rendered objective and spelled out in detail the interest and relationship grounds of recusal that had been covered by judicial recusal statutes dating back to liteky united states,d.under a,by contrast,what matters is not the reality of bias or prejudice but its appearance.id.emphasis added.
nevertheless,despite the breadth of,a judge is as much obliged not to recuse himself when it is not called for as he is obliged to when it is.in re drexel burnham lambert,cir.indeed,we as judges must balance our duty to appear impartial against several practical considerations,including the availability of other judges,united states will,d rule of necessity,the cost in judicial resources of recusal and reassignment of the case to different judges,and the interest of the parties and the public in a swift resolution of the dispute.
to assist us in striking this balance,f provides that,
n otwithstanding the preceding provisions a and b,if any judge to whom a matter has been assigned would be disqualified,after substantial judicial time has been devoted to the matter,because of the appearance or discovery,after the matter was assigned to him or her,that he or she has a financial interest in a party other than an interest that could be substantially affected by the outcome,disqualification is not required if the judge divests himself or herself of the interest that provides the grounds for the disqualification.
this court has,for instance,found f directly appli cable to a situation involving a district judge belated discovery that he owned stock in a company that,in turn,owned a substantial number of shares in one of the corporate litigants in a case before him.kidder,peabody maxus energy,nearly three years of the litigants time and resources and substantial judicial efforts have been devoted to the litigation.judge pollack forthright divestiture of his stock eliminated the need for disqualification.
with this precis of our recusal law in mind,we turn to the particulars of this case.section b of title provides that a judge must recuse himself from a case if he knows that he has a financial interest in the subject matter in controversy or in a party to the proceeding.section b i likewise provides that a judge must recuse himself from a case if he i s a party to the proceeding.it is these two conjunction that ostensibly require our recusal.by dint of our probable possession of copyrights in works reproduced on defendants databases,we are putative class members and,as such,we could in theory share in the settlement of this case.
the question is whether f permits us to avoid recusal under b and b i.and we think it does.we begin with the text of the statute.see leocal ashcroft,d.on its face,f appears to apply only to a judge who discovers at a late date a financial interest in a party that would otherwise warrant recusal.however,f creates an explicit,on the one hand,financial interests to which it applies,and,on the other hand,interests that could be substantially affected by the outcome,to which it does not apply.section f thus echoes b iii,which mandates recusal if a judge or his spouse i s known by the judge to have an interest that could be substantially affected by the outcome,and we think it unlikely that congress meant f to stand only as an exception to one clause of b and to no other provision of,south carolina catawba indian tribe,d,like,for instance,the other clause of b,which forbids a judge participation in a case if he has a financial interest in the subject matter of the litigation.indeed,that the rule forbidding a judge participation in a case to which he is a party is situated elsewhere in the statute suggests that congress did not consider party status an interest that invariably could be substantially affected by the outcome,at least not in the context.infra discussing legislative history of f.
we therefore conclude that the text of f is at least ambiguous as to whether it should apply to judges who are parties to a lawsuit simply because they possess a small financial interest in one of the parties or in the subject matter of the litigation and thus permit divestiture to avoid recusal.and the committee agrees with our reading indeed,it has concluded that the analogue in the code to f does apply,at least on its face,to judges in our situation.see letter from the committee on codes of conduct of the judicial conference of the united states to judges winter and walker,docket,at.
in light of the text ambiguity,we turn to the legislative history of f.and the legislative history is quite clear,congress passed f to mitigate unnecessary restrictions on a judge ability to hear cases,thereby solving a specific problem that ha d arisen as a consequence of existing disqualification requirements and their application in class action cases,at,reprinted in.thus,as this court has explained,congress clearly did not envision class membership as invariably involving an interest substantially affected by the outcome,otherwise f could not solve the very problem it was meant to remedy.in re certain underwriter,cir.
finally,there are sound logical reasons to think that f applies to a judge who possesses a small financial interest that also happens to make him a party to a lawsuit before him.as we have explained,f is meant to help judges strike a balance between the duty to recuse when their impartiality might reasonably be questioned and the need to resolve cases expeditiously and without undue collateral litigation.it is inconsistent with the pragmatism inherent in such balancing to distinguish between ownership of a single share of stock without interest that is covered by f and ownership of a single share of stock that in addition renders the judge a party to a derivative class action lawsuit assuming the judge divests himself promptly of that interest 
in our case,too,there are particular circumstances that suggest the propriety of applying f.for instance,not judges are similarly situated.indeed,we have determined that only one active judge the third member of this panel,judge straub and one senior judge in our circuit are not putative members of the plaintiff class we also think it likely that every member of the supreme court is also a member of the class.
moreover,this court has explained that a judge could not ameliorate circumstances warranting disqualification when he should have known of the disqualifying interest long before its subsequent discovery and his attempted divestiture.chase manhattan bank affiliated fm ins,cir.thus,curative divestment should generally be possible when recusal is mandatory under a or b if a reasonable person would not have known the circumstances warranting recusal prior to his divestment of the offending interest.and,a reasonable person would not have known that we were class members prior to march,when our preparation led us to that conclusion.
ii.the committee opinion 
the committee agrees that canon the analogue to f applies to us.letter from the committee on codes of conduct of the judicial conference of the united states to judges winter and walker,docket,at.but it goes on to conclude that curative divestment is possible only if made immediately upon assignment of the case to the judge,id.at a ppellate judge may take action equivalent to opting out after the period expires once a judge has spent substantial time on a case,he may not.no consideration is given by the committee to when the judge learns of the potential conflict.we believe the committee has it backwards.plainly,f is meant to conserve judicial resources.we do not see how this purpose is served by requiring recusal of a judge who,unaware of the conflict,has devoted substantial time to a case,but permitting a judge who has not worked on the case to continue to serve on an appeal,at a time when reassignment entails few or no costs.tramonte chrysler,cir.
the committee argues that because our interest is that of a party,it must necessarily be an interest that could be substantially affected by the outcome.but this assumes an anomalous set of circumstances section f applies,but curative divestment is per se impossible.moreover,under the committee logic,f would preclude a judge who might otherwise be recused because he is an officer,director,or trustee of a party,b i,from promptly resigning and continuing to participate in the case.but surely the fact that a judge may be a trustee of a party,such as a legal organization like the american bar association or an artistic organization like the new york museum of modern art,does not necessarily warrant recusal if the judge is willing promptly to resign the offending position.
finally,the committee has excepted rule b class actions from the ambit of its recusal rule.see letter from the committee on codes of conduct of the judicial conference of the united states to judges winter and walker,docket,at.this conclusion must depend,at least in part,upon the insubstantiality of a rule b class member interest.see in re city of houston,cir noting that under rule b a might be a party in a certain sense but would not have to answer for attorneys fees.this same logic would seem to dictate that possession of a small financial interest and possession of a small financial interest giving rise to party status should be treated in similar fashion neither requires recusal provided the judge divests himself of the interest.
while we afford the committee recommendation a certain quantum of deference,the committee is tasked only with construing the code of conduct.see united states lauersen,cir.we are responsible for construing f in light of the following circumstances we learned that we were class members after preparing for oral argument more than five months after the close of the period in which claims could have been filed,and we promptly,the following day informed the parties in open court that we renounced any interest we could receive as class members.to paraphrase judge posner,b efore we discovered we had a financial interest,we could have had no incentive to favor either party now,when we ha ve no interest having divested ourselves of any right to claim settlement funds,w e can not enrich ourselves by favoring either party.union carbide cutting,cir posner.
we believe our decision not to recuse is authorized by f,strikes the appropriate balance between securing the interests of impartiality and its appearance and reducing the practical costs that unnecessary recusal entails,and does not diminish public respect for the judiciary.
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we have chosen not to discontinue our participation in this case.

thank you for your inquiry.
you inquire whether you must recuse yourselves from further involvement in an appeal that challenges approval of a class action settlement involving copyright interests.you are both covered by the class definition as are of the members of your court,and neither of you opted out of the class within the time allowed for doing so which,by operation of the federal rules of civil procedure,occurred while the action was still pending in the district court.the class was certified under rule b.
