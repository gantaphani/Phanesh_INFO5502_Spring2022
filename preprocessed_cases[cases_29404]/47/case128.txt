this appeal illustrates the pitfalls that can be encountered in the complexities of even routine litigation.sometimes those complexities result in the forfeiture of a defense that arguably has merit.when that occurs,an appellate court faces a choice between enforcing the forfeiture or burdening parties,witnesses,jurors,and the trial court with a retrial.that choice confronts us on this appeal by queenie queenie and its president and sole shareholder,marc gardner gardner and heavenly fabrics,heavenly and its president and sole shareholder,joseph heaven heaven,from the january,amended judgment of the district court for the southern district of new york naomi reice buchwald,district judge in litigation that began as a suit for copyright infringement.the judgment awards nygard international nygard attorney fees for successfully defending a copyright infringement claim and punitive damages on its counterclaim for tortious interference with prospective economic advantage.the punitive damages award is challenged on appeal.gardner is currently a debtor in a bankruptcy proceeding.we conclude that the automatic bankruptcy stay applies to gardner and to queenie,his wholly owned corporation,but not to the other,heavenly or heaven.we also conclude that,in the procedural context of this case,heavenly and heaven have forfeited their arguable defense that punitive damages are unavailable for lack of an award of compensatory damages,and we therefore affirm.
background 
in october,queenie sued nygard and others no longer parties to the litigation,alleging infringement of two registered copyrights for fabric designs.in march,nygard counterclaimed against queenie,gardner,heavenly,and heaven collectively counterclaim defendants.nygard claimed tortious interference with prospective economic advantage,alleging that the counterclaim defendants falsely registered both copyrights and wrongfully prosecuted their infringement claims against nygard.
because this appeal concerns primarily procedural aspects of the litigation,we summarize rather briefly the facts that the jury was entitled to find.queenie is a distributor of women garments.it obtains fabric designs from a variety of sources,including print mills,design studios,and fabric wholesalers.queenie uses these designs in creating its clothing,which is manufactured in independent fabric mills overseas,primarily in korea.heavenly is a textile importer.it contracts for the manufacture of fabrics for women apparel and provides designs to its clients,who in turn purchase fabric from heavenly for the purpose of creating garments that use these designs.queenie and heavenly have done business together for approximately eight years.nygard manufactures and distributes women apparel.
according to the counterclaim defendants,in early,heaven showed gardner two fabric designs that heaven claimed had been created by heavenly former employee,dong mi chung.heavenly assigned what it claimed were its rights in the two designs to queenie.in august,heavenly registered copyrights for both designs in the name of queenie,naming heavenly as the author of the designs.however,chung,the alleged designer,testified that she had not created the two designs.in fact,according to testimony of an executive of saehwa,a korean textile print mill,both designs had been created by third parties who had brought the designs to saehwa in october.
nygard bought fabric imprinted with the two designs from saehwa and used them in its manufactured garments.that use precipitated queenie suit against nygard for copyright infringement.nygard defended on the ground that queenie had obtained its copyrights by fraud on the copyright office.nygard theory,evidently accepted by the jury,was that queenie had somehow learned that nygard was going to use the saehwa designs on its products and then fraudulently obtained copyright registrations in order to sue nygard when its products came on the market.nygard counterclaimed against queenie for tortious interference with prospective economic advantage and named as additional counterclaim defendants gardner,heavenly,and heaven.the theory of the counterclaim was that nygard had been damaged in its relationships with its customers by the threatened and ultimately filed copyright infringement suit.nygard sought damages including its attorney fees in defending against the infringement claim.
litigation procedure.prior to trial,the parties agreed to a somewhat unusual bifurcation of issues,one that would plant the seeds for the principal issue on this appeal.they agreed that,if the jury found in favor of nygard on its counterclaim,the amount of compensatory damages would be determined by the court and the amount of any punitive damages would be determined by the jury as far as we can tell from the rather imprecise way the parties proceeded at trial and their equally imprecise briefs on appeal,this agreement stemmed from the parties shared understanding that attorney fees in defense of the infringement claim would count as compensatory damages on the tortious interference counterclaim and nygard position that such fees were the only item of quantifiable compensatory damages that it could prove.apparently,the parties believed that determining the amount of such fees would be appropriate for the court.
as a result of the agreed bifurcation,nygard did not present any evidence of the amount of its compensatory damages,but did present evidence to show the fact that it had sustained some damages.nygard pointed to the attorney fees it had incurred in defending against the infringement claim and testimony from a nygard employee,fiona duncan,that nygard had changed the way it did business as a result of the tortious conduct of the counterclaim defendants.duncan acknowledged that she could not put a dollar value on the impact of nygard changed business practices.
after both sides rested,no party moved for judgment as a matter of law jmol under rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.
the jury charge correctly explained the elements of tortious interference with prospective economic advantage,including the element that nygard sustained damages as a result of the tortious conduct of the counterclaim defendants.the jury was told that,if it found in favor of nygard on its counterclaim,the jury need not determine the amount of compensatory damages the amount of these damages would be determined later by the court.the jury was also told that,if it found that the counterclaim defendants were liable for nygard injuries,it could award punitive damages and determine their amount.
during its deliberations,the jury sought clarification of the meaning of economic advantage with respect to the tortious interference counterclaim,specifically asking whether this phrase pertain s to legal fees,loss of sales and settlements.
judge buchwald responded to the jury inquiry as follows 
the answer to the question is that it could refer to all of those things,but as this case has been structured,you have not been asked to place a dollar value on those damages or losses.i will do that if you find that nygard prevails on its counterclaim of tortious interference.
what you have been asked to,if you find that nygard has proven its counterclaim of tortious to determine whether punitive damages are appropriate in that context and,if so,for how much.
does that clarify what you need to know your job is the punitive damage side,if you find liability.mine is the actual damage side.ok 
the counterclaim defendants did not object to any of the relevant instructions.
the jury rejected queenie copyright infringement claim and found the counterclaim defendants liable to nygard for tortious interference with economic advantage.the jury awarded punitive damages of each against queenie and heavenly and each against gardner and heaven.
the counterclaim defendants moved for jmol,for a new trial,and for remittitur of the jury punitive damages award recognizing that,because of the bifurcation,nygard was to present its evidence as to the amount of compensatory damages to the court,the counterclaim defendants argued in support of jmol that nygard had not submitted proof that it had incurred any damages.still under the impression that attorney fees in defense of the infringement claim were compensable as tort damages,the counterclaim defendants argued that it was not outside the realm of possibility that the lawyer defending nygard at trial would work for free.no mention was made of duncan testimony concerning the changes in nygard business practices.a new trial was sought on the ground that the district court should not have permitted nygard to call chung as a rebuttal witness because she had not been included on nygard witness list.the punitive damages award was challenged for lack of proof of actual damages and because the tortious conduct had not been aimed at the general public.nygard opposed these motions and sought attorney fees.
the district court rejected the motions for jmol,a new trial,and remittitur of the punitive damages award.the jmol request was denied on the grounds that the bifurcation agreement waived the counterclaim defendants challenge to the sufficiency of proof as to compensatory damages and that the absence of a rule a motion precluded a rule b motion.a new trial was denied on the grounds that queenie,having subpoenaed chung as a witness,could not claim surprise,and that barring her testimony would have enabled the counterclaim defendants to expand a fraud upon the united states copyright office to a fraud upon the court.the challenge to the punitive damage award was rejected on the grounds that there had been no objection to the jury charge permitting the jury to award punitive damages and that the bifurcation agreement had waived the contention that punitive damages could not be awarded in the absence of compensatory damages.
with respect to nygard claim for attorney fees,the court ruled that attorney fees were not compensable as actual damages on the counterclaim,citing coopers lybrand levitt,dep t but awarded nygard its fees in the amount of and costs of as a prevailing defendant in a copyright infringement suit.see.
on november,gardner filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code.
discussion 
i.the automatic stay 
preliminarily,we consider whether the automatic stay,a,which requires a stay of this appeal with respect to gardner,applies to the appeals of the other appellants.we requested the parties views on the stay issue,and,as with many aspects of this litigation,have received somewhat unexpected responses.greenwald,who represented heavenly and heaven the heavenly appellants at trial,advised that he represents gardner in his bankruptcy case but not on this appeal,and continues to represent the heavenly appellants on this appeal.greenwald urges,on behalf of gardner,that the bankruptcy stay should apply to all four appellants,but,in his capacity as counsel for the heavenly appellants,he reports that they take no position with respect to the stay issue.no one representing queenie has responded to our request.triggs,representing nygard,responded that he did not believe it makes sense to oppose the application of the automatic stay to all parties to this proceeding.thus,gardner,the bankruptcy debtor,wants the stay to apply to himself,his corporation,and to the heavenly appellants nygard,the on this appeal,does not oppose application of the stay to all parties the heavenly appellants,who are on this appeal,explicitly take no position and queenie,also a,is silent on the issue.
we conclude that the automatic stay,which unquestionably applies to gardner,see koolik markowitz,cir stay of appeal by debtor of judgment entered against it on counterclaim,applies to his wholly owned corporation,queenie,but not to the heavenly appellants.a suit against a codefendant is not automatically stayed by the debtor bankruptcy filing.collier on bankruptcy d ed see croyden associates alleco,cir teachers insurance and annuity ass butler,cir it is that stays pursuant to a are limited to debtors and do not encompass.wedgeworth fibreboard,cir a stay in chapter proceeding applicable against any individual that is liable on a debt with the debtor.the automatic stay can apply to,but normally does so only when a claim against the will have an immediate adverse economic consequence for the debtor estate.examples are a claim to establish an obligation of which the debtor is a guarantor,mccartney integra national bank north,cir,a claim against the debtor insurer,asbestos litigation group in re,on rehearing,and actions where there is such identity between the debtor and the defendant that the debtor may be said to be the real party defendant,robins piccinin,cir.
under these principles,the stay applies to queenie because it is wholly owned by gardner,and adjudication of a claim against the corporation will have an immediate adverse economic impact on gardner.gardner contends that the stay should also apply to the heavenly appellants because i f this court decides the pending appeal of the debtors,it is effectively deciding gardner stayed appeal.in essence,gardner seeks to apply the stay to the heavenly appellants to avoid the later use against himself and his corporation of offensive collateral estoppel arising from a ruling on this appeal adverse to these appellants or at least to guard against the precedential effect of such a ruling.
we have not located any decision applying the stay to a solely because of an apprehended later use against the debtor of offensive collateral estoppel or the precedential effect of an adverse decision.if such apprehension could support application of the stay,there would be vast and unwarranted interference with creditors enforcement of their rights against.
gardner reliance on lomas financial northern trust in re lomas financial,is unavailing.that district court decision affirmed a bankruptcy court injunction staying a suit against a debtor corporation two key officers,who were accused of fraudulently causing a creditor to make a loan to the corporation.although the district court opinion mentions possible collateral estoppel,the ruling is primarily explained by the existence of the debtor indemnity obligation to the corporate officers.see id.at.moreover,the bankruptcy court authority to stay the litigation was invoked not only under section a but also under section of the bankruptcy code,which grants broader authority,see in re.litigation,cir.gardner cites three other decisions for the proposition that s ome courts conclude that a applies to third parties automatically.this argument exceeds the bounds of responsible advocacy.in two of the cited decisions the stay was granted primarily because the debtor corporation was obligated to indemnify the defendant,see north star contracting mcspedon in re north star contracting,maxicare health plans,centinela mammoth hospital in re family health services,and in the third decision the stay was denied,general dynamics veliotis in re veliotis.
we will stay this appeal only with respect to gardner and queenie,and proceed to consider the merits of the appeal with respect to the heavenly appellants.
ii.the merits 
on the merits of the appeal,as it affects nygard and the heavenly appellants,we agree with the district court that the absence of a rule a motion and the agreement to the bifurcation of damage issues combine to constitute a forfeiture of the counterclaim defendants arguable defense that punitive damages are unavailable in the absence of compensatory damages or perhaps at least nominal damages.a party is barred from challenging the sufficiency of evidence on an issue unless it has timely moved in the district court for judgment as a matter of law on that issue.kirsch fleet street,cir.had the counterclaim defendants contended before the jury verdict that nygard proof of the fact of compensatory damage was insufficient,nygard would have had an opportunity to remedy the alleged deficiency with further evidence from duncan or others as to the adverse economic impact of the tortious interference.it appears that the counterclaim defendants considered nygard evidence sufficient because they thought,as nygard did,that nygard attorney fees qualified as an item of compensable damages.but even if that assumption was incorre
