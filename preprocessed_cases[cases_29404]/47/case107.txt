a plaintiff may think that as the initiator of a lawsuit he is the lord and master of where the litigation will be tried and under what law.but if he is a party to a contract that contains forum selection and choice of law clauses his view of himself as ruler of all he surveys may,like an inflated balloon,suffer considerable loss of altitude.such is the situation plaintiff faces in the appeal before us,where we revisit an issue last addressed by us years ago what is the effect of a forum selection clause on a complaint that asserts claims arising under the copyright act see corcovado music hollis music,cir.
plaintiff peter phillips,professionally known as pete rock plaintiff or appellant,is a musician who in entered into a recording contract with defendant audio active limited barely breaking even bbe,a music company.this contract gave fruit to two albums in and.the first album all agree was governed by the recording contract and,except for phillips contention that bbe owes him money,it appears to have been produced,released and distributed according to plan.the second album is the source of the principal controversy between the parties.
in his complaint against bbe and defendants studio distribution studio,navarre corporation navarre,and sandbox automatic,sandbox collectively defendants,phillips averred that the recording contract contemplated the first album only,and that the release of the second album,over his objections,infringed his copyrights in the songs comprising the album.bbe and studio moved to dismiss plaintiff complaint on the basis of a forum selection clause in the contract pursuant to which the parties had agreed to litigate in england any proceeding arising out of the contract.
the united states district court for the southern district of new york daniels,held the forum clause governed phillips action,including his copyright claims relating to the second album.phillips appeals from the district court november,decision and order and its december,judgment granting bbe and studio rule b motion to dismiss his complaint for improper venue.plaintiff contends that the district court erred in reading the forum clause to than to be brought in england,that his copyright claims did not arise out of the recording contract and should have been exempted from operation of the forum clause,and that the clause should be set aside because its enforcement would be unreasonable.
we agree with the district court interpretation of the clause as mandatory and its holding that enforcement of the clause would not be unreasonable and affirm the dismissal of phillips breach of contract claim.however,plaintiff remaining claims predicated on defendants alleged infringement of his copyrights were improperly dismissed under the forum selection clause.
background 
a.the recording contract 
phillips entered into the recording contract with bbe in september under the terms of which he agreed to provide his services as a recording artist and producer to create musical compositions,and bbe agreed to pay the costs of production and to pay royalties to phillips,including a advance payable in two installments.
the contract required phillips to produce no less than ten newly recorded and previously unreleased tracks of no less than sixty minutes and defined these tracks as the master recordings.the minimum number of tracks was not paired with a maximum anywhere in the contract,but the master recordings were later defined as the album,which was provisionally entitled soul survivor.bbe acquired the right to exploit all products of phillips services under the contract and the entire copyright in the master recordings.the final paragraph of the recording contract contains a choice of law and forum clause that reads t he validity,construction,and effect of this agreement and any or all modifications hereof shall be governed by english law and any legal proceedings that may arise out of it are to be brought in england.phillips also signed a letter agreement,which is attached to the recording contract,authorizing soul brother records,to offer phillips services under the contract and stating that the letter agreement shall be subject to the same laws and exclusive jurisdiction as the above agreement.phillips received from bbe in a first installment of his advance on royalties.pursuant to the contract,the balance of the advance was payable upon delivery to bbe of the last of the master recordings.
release of second album 
in bbe released an album comprised of phillips musical compositions entitled,as foreseen in the contract,soul survivor.while phillips was preparing the songs that were released on soul survivor,he composed and recorded additional music.plaintiff alleges that in,bbe and studio,a second recording company,sought his permission to release the additional songs,but phillips,believing the tracks were not ready for release,denied their request.bbe,studio and navarre,a distribution company,nonetheless proceeded to release a second album in august or september of containing additional songs created by phillips.phillips asserts that sandbox and,both distributors of digital media,sold copies of the allegedly infringing album.plaintiff settled his claims against and these were dismissed with prejudice by the district court on may.
prior legal proceedings 
plaintiff commenced the instant action in the southern district of new york on january.his second amended complaint contained five counts against the defendants.count one stated that bbe had breached the recording contract by failing to pay the second installment of the royalties advance.counts two and three were for direct and contributory copyright infringement under the copyright act,et,and requested remedies provided by the act.counts four and five asserted alternative state law claims for unjust enrichment and unfair competition on the basis of defendants exploitation of the additional tracks.
on may,bbe and studio moved to dismiss under rules b,and on the grounds that the forum selection clause in the recording contract required phillips to bring his suit in england.in a decision and order dated november,and a final judgment dated december,the trial court granted bbe and studio motion to dismiss for improper venue under.b.the district court classified the forum selection clause as mandatory rather than permissive,and it held that phillips had failed to show that enforcement of the clause would be unreasonable.with respect to plaintiff copyright claims,judge daniels determined that any dispute concerning the defendants rights to exploit this music was primarily contractual because the defendants had acquired possession of the music legitimately under the contract.phillips appeals the november,decision and order and the december,final judgment.
discussion 
i forum selection clausea.dismissal 
determining whether to dismiss a claim based on a forum selection clause involves a analysis.the first inquiry is whether the clause was reasonably communicated to the party resisting enforcement.see,blair gottdiener,cir.the second step requires us to classify the clause as mandatory or permissive,to decide whether the parties are required to bring any dispute to the designated forum or simply permitted to do so.see john boutari son,wines spirits,attiki imps.distribs,cir.part three asks whether the claims and parties involved in the suit are subject to the forum selection clause.see,roby of lloyd,cir.
if the forum clause was communicated to the resisting party,has mandatory force and covers the claims and parties involved in the dispute,it is presumptively enforceable.see id.at.the fourth,and final,step is to ascertain whether the resisting party has rebutted the presumption of enforceability by making a sufficiently strong showing that enforcement would be unreasonable or unjust,or that the clause was invalid for such reasons as fraud or overreaching.bremen zapata,d establishing federal standard relating to enforcement of forum clauses applicable in admiralty and international transactions see bense interstate battery of,cir applying bremen standard to contractual dispute between domestic parties in context.

impact of choice of law clause 
in the absence of an applicable choice of law provision,it is well established in this circuit that the rule set out in bremen applies to the question of enforceability of an apparently governing forum selection clause,irrespective of whether a claim arises under federal or state law.avc nederland atrium inv,cir applying bremen in federal question case bense,at same jones weibrecht,cir reaffirming second circuit rule that bremen standard applies to diversity cases.
here,where the parties have agreed that the validity,construction and effect of the recording contract is to be governed by english law,we confront a different legal issue.in analyzing a forum selection clause,what effect should we give to a choice of law provision contained in the same contract largely for the reasons we hold parties to their contractual promises to litigate in a specified forum,federal courts give substantial weight to choice of law provisions.see roby,at discussing presumptive validity of choice of law clauses in international transactions state trading of india,assuranceforeningen skuld,cir a contractual choice of law clause generally takes precedence over choice of law rules richards lloyd of london,cir extending bremen standard to evaluation of choice of law clauses.but see advani,underwriters at lloyds,cir incorporating choice of law provision into test to determine points of contact between transaction and potential fora in admiralty case.
despite the presumptive validity of choice of law clauses,our precedent indicates that federal law should be used to determine whether an otherwise mandatory and applicable forum clause is enforceable under bremen,step four in our analysis.this is because enforcement of forum clauses is an essentially procedural issue,jones,at,while choice of law provisions generally implicate only the substantive law of the selected jurisdiction.see siegelman cunard white star,cir woodling garrett,cir explaining new york rule honoring parties choice of law to govern substantive but not procedural issues.were it otherwise,choice of law provisions selecting jurisdictions that disfavor forum clauses would put a district court to the awkward choice of either ignoring the parties choice of law or invalidating their choice of forum.see,bense,at declining to apply law specified in contract where such application would render the forum selection clause meaningless.
we find less to recommend the invocation of federal common law to interpret the meaning and scope of a forum clause,as required by parts two and three of our analysis.little discussion of the issue can be found in federal court decisions.see yavuz mm,cir.for example,we have turned to federal precedent to interpret forum clauses,but the underlying choice of law question has been left unaddressed.see,boutari,at applying federal precedent to ascertain meaning of forum clause where parties had elected greek law roby,at applying federal precedent to assess scope of clause where parties had chosen english law see also gucci,cir b ecause enforcement of a forum clause necessarily entails interpretation of the clause before it can be enforced,federal law also applies to interpretation of forum selection clauses.but see avc nederland,at noting that interpretation of forum selection clause in contract among predominantly dutch principals executed in the netherlands required application of dutch law.see generally jacob webb yackee,choice of law considerations in the validity enforcement of international forum selection agreements whose law applies,ucla int l foreign aff,describing practice of federal courts reflexively to disregard choice of law provisions when assessing forum selection clauses yavuz,at same.
the tenth circuit recently discussed the novel question posed by contracts containing choice of law and forum provisions.yavuz,at.reviewing a clause reading,t his convention is governed by the swiss law place of courts is fribourg,id.at,the court noted that before deciding whether to enforce the clause,it had to resolve several subsidiary questions whether the clause was mandatory or permissive,and whether it governed all of plaintiff claims.id.yavuz observed that the supreme court guidance on forum clauses did not extend to the choice of law question before it and now before us because the meaning of each forum or arbitration provision before the supreme court in bremen and its progeny has never been in question.id.at.
in light of the supreme court invocation of compelling reasons to uphold contractual choice of choice of,yavuz held that under federal law the courts should ordinarily honor an international commercial agreement provision as construed under the law specified in the agreement choice of law provision,id.at see also abbott labs.takeda pharm,cir simplicity argues for determining the validity and meaning of a forum selection clause by reference to the law of the jurisdiction whose law governs the rest of the contract in which the clause appears.
without the benefit of briefing by the parties on this issue,we can not understand why the interpretation of a forum selection clause should be singled out for application of any law other than that chosen to govern the interpretation of the contract as a whole.see yavuz,at.however,the parties neither objected to the district court citation to federal precedent in its interpretation of the clause before us,nor construed the clause under english law in their briefs.we will assume from the parties briefing that they do not rely on any distinctive features of english law and apply general contract law principles and federal precedent to discern the meaning and scope of the forum clause.see motorola credit uzan,cir t he parties briefs assume that new york law controls this issue,and such implied consent is sufficient to establish choice of law.john wyeth brother cigna int l,cir alito,applying general contract law principles to interpret forum clause where parties made little reference to english law.
ii the forum clause requires that any covered proceeding be brought in england 
forum selection clauses may serve two distinct purposes.contracting parties may intend to agree on a potential situs for suit so as to guarantee that at least one forum will be available to hear their disputes.a permissive forum clause only confers jurisdiction in the designated forum,but does not deny plaintiff his choice of forum,if jurisdiction there is otherwise appropriate.see boutari,at reversing dismissal based on permissive choice of forum clause avc nederland,at a clause provid es a plaintiff with a guaranteed forum,but does not deprive him of the right to sue in another having personal jurisdiction over the defendant.see also blanco banco indus.de,cir granting motion for dismissal based on inconvenient forum despite permissive choice of forum clause specifying forum chosen by plaintiff.alternatively,contracting parties may intend to agree in advance on a forum where any and all of their disputes must be brought to eliminate surprise of having to litigate in a hostile forum.roby,at.a mandatory forum clause is entitled to the bremen presumption of enforceability.id.
our inquiry is one of contract interpretation.hence,our initial focus is on the language of the contract.here that language provides that any legal proceedings that may arise out of the agreement are to be brought in england.a forum selection clause is viewed as mandatory when it confers exclusive jurisdiction on the designated forum or incorporates obligatory venue language.see boutari,at.
the district court found this clause mandatory.we agree.the parties use of the phrase are to be brought establishes england as an obligatory venue for proceedings within the scope of the clause.the reference to a particular location,although lacking the specificity of a particular court or city,adequately distinguishes the parties language from the clause we reviewed in boutari.at.in that case,we construed the phrase a ny dispute shall come within the jurisdiction of the greek courts as a permissive clause because it dealt solely with jurisdiction without indicating that such jurisdiction was exclusive.id.at.we recognized in boutari that obligatory venue language suffices to give mandatory force to a forum selection clause.id.at see seward devine,cir docksider,sea,cir.further,the mandatory force of the words are to be differentiates the instant clause from the language used by the parties in blanco,agreeing to certain fora in which their disputes may be brought.at.
our distinct treatment of jurisdiction and venue in this context is clear.because jurisdiction may be properly conferred on two or more fora,the fact that the contract in boutari conferred jurisdiction on the courts of greece did not preclude the parties from commencing litigation in a court outside of greece.at.however,contract language such as that presented in this that a proceeding be brought in incompatible with venue lying in new york.our finding that the clause is mandatory is buttressed by the stipulation in the letter agreement attached to the recording contract that the former is subject to the same exclusive jurisdiction as the latter.
iii scope of the forum selection clause in the instant case 
we turn now to decide whether the language in the recording contract mandating that any legal proceedings that may arise out of it be brought in england encompasses phillips suit.however important a forum selection clause is to the efficient functioning of international business,see,scherk,d,it is a creature of contract.plaintiff choice of forum in bringing his suit in federal court in new york will not be disregarded unless the contract evinces agreement by the parties that his claims can not be heard there.louis dreyfus negoce blystad shipping trading,cir noting that an arbitration clause,a creature of contract,does not compel arbitration of a dispute that parties did not intend to submit to arbitration.
breach of contract claim 
we dispose of the contract claim quickly.phillips asserts bbe breached the recording contract by failing to pay the second installment on his advance on royalties due upon delivery of the master recordings.he makes no argument that the forum selection clause,if found mandatory and enforceable,does not apply to his contract claim.the contract claim for money owed and due falls squarely under the forum selection clause the contract establishes phillips right to receive,and bbe duty to pay,the installment and sets forth the relevant conditions.
federal copyright infringement claims 
the effect of the forum selection clause on phillips copyright claims presents a more difficult question.the language of that clause frames our question do phillips copyright claims arise out of the recording contract 
plaintiff implicitly offers a straightforward argument of mutual exclusivity because his copyright infringement claims arise under the copyright act,they can not arise out of the contract.in harms eliscu,cir friendly,we held a claim arises under the copyright act and accordingly falls within the jurisdiction of the federal courts if the complaint is for a remedy expressly granted by the act,a suit for infringement or for the statutory royalties for record reproduction.id.at see bassett mashantucket pequot tribe,cir reaffirming harms test in federal jurisdiction context.counts two and three of phillips complaint allege direct and indirect copyright infringement and request remedies under of the copyright act.we agree these claims arise under the copyright act.thus,federal jurisdiction is properly invoked.see kamakazi music robbins music,cir holding defendant interposition of a contract as defense to copyright claims did not transform copyright suit into breach of contract action.
the relevance of harms to the present inquiry is where we part from appellant.despite its surface appeal,we are not persuaded by phillips suggestion that a claim arising under the copyright act for jurisdictional purposes can not also arise out of a contract for purposes of interpreting a forum selection clause.
federal courts have repeatedly found statutory claims to arise out of contract in interpreting scope of contractual provisions 
insofar as harms relies on the law invoked by the plaintiff to state his claims,it is anchored in doctrines that have long governed our exercise of arising under jurisdiction under,whereby a suit arises under the law that creates the cause of action,am.well works layne bowler.holmes,and federal jurisdiction is proper where the complaint is so drawn as to seek recovery directly under the constitution or laws of the united states,bell hood.
looking to cases involving similar contractual provisions and claims under other laws of the united states,we see that federal courts have routinely rejected phillips suggestion that a claim arising under a law of the united states is exempt from provisions governing disputes between contracting parties.see,scherk,at.holding that claim under securities exchange act was covered by arbitration clause in international contract governing any controversy or claim arising out of this agreement or the breach thereof bense,at finding complaint brought under federal antitrust law arose from distribution agreement between parties abbott,at rejecting plaintiff argument that breach of fiduciary duty claim arising under delaware tort law did not arise from the contract.
moreover,it is inappropriate in the present context to depend solely on the legal labels used by plaintiff to decide if his case arises out of the contract.when the question is one of federal jurisdiction,we recognize the plaintiff is in charge of deciding what law he will rely upon in bringing suit,bell,at.see bassett,at.it follows that legal causes of action stated by plaintiff afford all the information we need to decide whether arising under jurisdiction lies.it does not follow that plaintiff is the master to decide the meaning of a disputed contractual provision,which is,in effect,what appellant suggests in asking us to hold that his claims do not arise out of the recording contract based solely on the laws he cites in his complaint.phillips proposed approach is inconsistent with our refusal in roby to allow a party solemn promise to be defeated by artful pleading.at.
instead,when ascertaining the applicability of a contractual provision to particular claims,we examine the substance of those claims,shorn of their labels.id.at.this approach is consistent with the focus on factual allegations rather than on the causes of action asserted when deciding whether an arbitration clause applies to particular claims.see jlm,sa,cir genesco,kakiuchi,cir.
because we can not presume that the parties intended to exclude all statutory claims,or even all copyright claims,from the forum selection clause,we examine the substance of phillips claims as they relate to the precise language of the clause.see new moon,at the scope of the forum selection clause is a contractual question that requires the courts to interpret the clause and,where ambiguous,to consider the intent of the parties.wyeth,at w hether or not a forum selection clause applies depends on what the specific clause at issue says.
