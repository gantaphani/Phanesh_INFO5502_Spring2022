thais cardoso almeida brought this action against,amazon for displaying her image on its websites in furtherance of its sale of the book anjos proibidos.almeida asserted claims against amazon pursuant to.stat.west,for civil theft pursuant to.stat.west,and under florida common law doctrine of invasion of privacy.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of amazon as to all of almeida claims.the district court held that almeida right of publicity claim under and common law is preempted by the communications decency act of cda,and is otherwise unavailable under florida statutory doctrine.as to almeida civil theft claim,the district court held that almeida failed to establish amazon intent to misappropriate almeida image.we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment,although with respect to almeida right of publicity claim,we do so on different grounds.
background 
this case involves,an internet retailer,and its display of book cover images in furtherance of its internet book sales.at issue here is a photograph of the plaintiff almeida taken when she was ten years old and displayed on the cover and inside the second edition of the photographic book anjos proibidos,or forbidden angels.in essence,almeida claims that amazon should not display her image to promote the sale of anjos proibidos because she did not consent and did not receive just compensation for the use of her image.
in,fashion photographer fabio cabral requested permission from almeida mother to photograph her daughter for an artistic photo exhibit,and she signed an authorization form that provided 
the legal representative for the photographed minor both listed below authorizes free from restrictions the use of the photographic image produced by the photographer,fabio cabral,in an exhibition entitled girls under years and in the photographic book portpholics book of the same title as the exhibition for use during the vernissage and launch at the collectors photographic gallery.the authorization extends to the invitation,the poster and printed promotional material for the exhibition and launch of the book.
almeida image was displayed at cabral exhibit,at which the first edition of anjos proibidos was offered for sale,displaying black and white photographs of girls between the ages of ten and seventeen,including a photograph of almeida inside the book.two hundred copies of the book were sold before the authorities in sao paulo seized the remaining copies.cabral and the book publisher,itamarati grafica,were prosecuted for producing a work of child pornography,and both were acquitted.
in,ophelia editions published a second edition of anjos proibidos,which is the same in all respects,except that almeida picture is now on the book cover,there is a new introduction,and a few new pictures of other girls appear inside the book.the second edition was offered for sale on amazon website.
generally,amazon is recognized as a leading internet retailer with a particular focus on online book sales.it offers its customers a searchable product database,order placement capability,and delivery services through a distribution system.in addition,amazon enters agreements with web operators to link potential customers to amazon websites in exchange for a percentage of the sales price.it is customary business practice for amazon to provide a product detail page that displays the cover of each book offered for sale,as well as text describing the book.
in,almeida discovered that her picture was being displayed on websites in furtherance of the sale of the second edition of anjos proibidos.amazon product detail page displayed the second edition cover photograph of almeida and a quote attributed to a old almeida i really liked fabio.he.i never felt any shame in making the photos.
on march,almeida attorney sent a letter to amazon requesting statutory damages,pursuant to.stat,for its unauthorized use of her image.on march,amazon responded by letter saying that it would voluntarily remove the listing for anjos proibidos from its websites.the listing with almeida image was in fact removed promptly from amazon websites.moreover,there is no indication that amazon had knowledge or should have had knowledge that the book cover displayed an image that the author and publisher were not authorized to use.on july,almeida attorney sent a civil theft demand letter to amazon pursuant to.stat,to which amazon apparently did not respond.
on november,almeida filed suit in county,florida asserting claims under the right of publicity statute.stat.the civil theft statute.stat.and the florida common law invasion of privacy doctrine.on january,amazon invoked diversity jurisdiction and removed the case to federal district court.on july,the district court granted amazon motion for summary judgment as to all of almeida claims.
the district court held that almeida may not recover under section because the subject matter of her claim has been preempted by the cda.assuming arguendo that the cda does not preempt the subject matter of almeida section claim,the district court concluded that almeida consented to cabral use of her image,and,therefore,section b bars application of the statute.further,the district court dismissed amazon invasion of privacy claim on the same basis as the statutory right of publicity claim as to almeida civil theft claim,the district court determined that almeida failed to establish amazon felonious intent by clear and convincing evidence.finally,the district court awarded amazon attorney fees based on almeida civil theft claim.
on appeal to this court,almeida challenges the district court decision as to the cda on a number of grounds.first,almeida argues that the district court erred by raising the cda sua sponte when amazon was required to raise the cda as an affirmative defense.second,almeida asserts that the right of publicity is an intellectual property right and the cda does not apply to causes of action predicated on any law pertaining to intellectual property.third,almeida contends that the cda does not immunize amazon because it is not an information content provider as that term is defined by the cda.
as to the merits of almeida right of publicity claim,almeida argues that she never consented to the use of her image in the second edition of anjos proibidos,so the doctrine does not apply.finally,with respect to the district court civil theft determination,almeida argues that the district court erred by failing to allow for meaningful discovery as to amazon intent,by awarding attorney fees based on finding that the claim lacked a substantial basis in law or in fact,and by entering a fee award based on its in camera review without an explanation as to the amount of fees.
discussion 
right of.preemption by the cda 
first,we address the district court conclusion that the cda preempts the subject matter of almeida right of publicity claim.subsection c of the cda provides 
c protection for good samaritan blocking and screening of offensive material 
treatment of publisher or speaker 
no provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.
civil liability 
no provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be held liable on account of a any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene,lewd,lascivious,filthy,excessively violent,harassing,or otherwise objectionable,whether or not such material is constitutionally protected or b any action taken to enable or make available to information content providers or others the technical means to restrict access to material described in paragraph.
c the cda preempts state law that is contrary to this subsection.see e no cause of action may be brought and no liability may be imposed under any state or local law that is inconsistent with this section.
the majority of federal circuits have interpreted the cda to establish broad federal immunity to any cause of action that would make service providers liable for information originating with a user of the service.zeran am.online,cir in this case,the district court adopted this approach,but even this broad statutory immunity does not apply without limitation.see e providing that n othing in this section shall be construed to impair the enforcement of any federal criminal statute e providing that n othing in this section shall be construed to limit or expand any law pertaining to intellectual property e providing that n othing in this section shall be construed to prevent any state from enforcing any state law that is consistent with this section e providing that n othing in this section shall be construed to limit the application of the electronic communications privacy act of or any similar state law.here,the district court did not consider whether immunizing amazon from liability under the right of publicity would limit any law pertaining to intellectual property.
whether the cda immunizes an interactive service provider from a state law right of publicity claim is an issue of first impression for this court.few federal courts have considered the effect of e on the cda grant of immunity,although it is clear that any law pertaining to intellectual property at least refers to the three traditional forms of intellectual property copyright,patent,and trademark.see allison vintage sports plaques,cir stating that the three principal forms of intellectual property are copyright,patent,and trademark.thus,federal district courts have held that e unambiguously precludes applying the cda to immunize interactive service providers from trademark claims.see ford motor,construing e to preclude application of cda immunity to claims based on the violation of federal trademark laws gucci,hall,d,recognizing that immunizing trademark infringement claims would limit laws pertaining to intellectual property.
almeida contends that the cda does not preempt section because it is a quintessential right of publicity claim,and the right of publicity is a widely recognized intellectual property right.see etw jireh publ g,cir stating that t he right of publicity is an intellectual property right of recent origin which has been defined as the inherent right of every human being to control the commercial use of his or identity allison,at concluding that the common law right of publicity is an intellectual property right for purposes of the doctrine thomas mccarthy,melville nimmer the rights of publicity a tribute,stating that the right of publicity has matured into a distinctive legal category occupying an important place in the law of intellectual property black law dictionary ed defining intellectual property as follows a category of intangible rights protecting commercially valuable products of the human intellect.the category comprises primarily trademark,copyright,and patent rights,but also includes rights,publicity rights,moral rights,and rights against unfair competition.
further,almeida argues that e extends to all intellectual property rights,even intellectual property rights.see perfect,d at holding that based on e the cda does not apply to california statutory and common law right of publicity claims.indeed,courts have held that intellectual property is not a static concept for purposes of the cda.gucci,d at noting that nowhere does section state that the laws to which it refers are limited to the intellectual property laws as they existed when enacted.almeida contends that extending the meaning of e makes sense because the purpose served by publicity rights is similar to that of traditional intellectual property rights.see zacchini broad,d explaining that the state interest in providing a right of publicity is closely analogous to the goals of patent and copyright law,focusing on the right of the individual to reap the reward of his endeavors and having little to do with protecting feelings or reputation.
amazon responds that even if the right of publicity protects a type of intellectual property right,congress did not intend for e to apply to publicity rights.first,amazon argues that congress did not intend by the cda to protect claims.see e no cause of action may be brought and no liability may be imposed under any state or local law that is inconsistent with this section.but see perfect,d at holding that e applies to california wrongful use of registered mark law,cal.bus,and california right of publicity law,cal.
second,amazon argues that almeida right of publicity action is a suit,and congress did not intend to limit the cda immunity with respect to suits.amazon points to the sixth circuit description of the cda purpose in zeran,
congress recognized the threat that lawsuits pose to freedom of speech in the new and burgeoning internet medium.the imposition of tort liability on service providers for the communications of others represented,for congress,simply another form of intrusive government regulation of speech.section was enacted,in part,to maintain the robust nature of internet communication and,accordingly,to keep government interference in the medium to a minimum.
zeran,at see etw,at the right of publicity is a creature of state law and its violation gives rise to a cause of action for the commercial tort of unfair competition.
thus,while there appears to be no dispute that the right of publicity is a type of intellectual property right,almeida argues that it is not clear from the statute that any law pertaining to intellectual property includes claims based upon state intellectual property rights.moreover,neither party points to any legislative history indicating congress intent as to the effect of e.see gucci,d at stating that section legislative history provides no clues as to the meaning of section e.
while we agree with almeida that the district court should have addressed e before invoking the cda grant of immunity,we believe that regardless of the answer to this question,the district court did not need to address the difficult issues of application of the cda under the facts of this case.in gucci,the court described the initial e issue as,whether plaintiff complaint would withstand a motion to dismiss even in the absence of.gucci,d at ford motor,stating that a motion to dismiss a federal trademark claim against a service provider must turn on whether plaintiffs complaint successfully states a claim for violation of the trademark laws without regard to the cda.in this case,we ask whether an internet retailer,such as amazon,could be held liable under florida right of publicity statute for displaying a book cover image in furtherance of the book sale.as we explain below,almeida right of publicity claim based on.stat.would not withstand a motion to dismiss under the law.therefore,it was unnecessary for the district court to determine whether the cda preempts almeida state law right of publicity claim,and we do not reach any of almeida challenges to the district court application of the cda here.
application of section 
almeida alleges that amazon displayed her image on its websites in order to promote anjos proibidos,without her consent or just compensation,in violation of.stat.section reads in pertinent part 
no person shall publish,print,display,or otherwise publicly use for purposes of trade or for any commercial or advertising purpose the name,portrait,photograph,or other likeness of any natural person without the express written or oral consent to such use 
stat.the statute does not apply to 
a the publication,printing,display,or use of the name or likeness of any person in any newspaper,magazine,book,news broadcast or telecast,or other news medium or publication as part of any bona fide news report or presentation having a current and legitimate public interest and where such name or likeness is not used for advertising purposes 
b the use of such name,portrait,photograph,or other likeness in connection with the resale or distribution of literary,musical,or artistic productions or other articles of merchandise or property where such person has consented to use of her or his name,portrait,photograph,or likeness on or in connection with the initial sale or distribution thereof or 
c any photograph of a person solely as a member of the public and where such person is not named or otherwise identified in or in connection with the use of such photograph.
in the present case,the district court concluded that almeida consented to the use of her photograph in the first edition of anjos proibidos.thus,it held that section b bars the statute application to the subsequent use of almeida image in the second edition.almeida responds that she only consented to the use of her image for the first edition of anjos proibidos.as almeida did not consent to the use of her image in connection with the sale of the second edition,she argues that section b does not apply.we agree with the district court that almeida has no recovery under section,although we do not reach the issue of whether section b applies to the facts of this case.instead,we hold that it is clear from almeida complaint that amazon did not use almeida image for trade,commercial,or advertising purposes as those terms are used in the statute.
the florida legislature enacted section in order to expand the remedies available under the common law right against misappropriation courts have interpreted the statute commercial purpose requirement to require that a defendant unauthorized use directly promote a product or service.see tyne time warner entm t,so d,stating that t he purpose of section is to prevent the use of a person name or likeness to directly promote a product or service because of the way that the use associates the person name or personality with something else loft fuller,so d,explaining that section,by prohibiting the use of one name or likeness for trade,commercial or advertising purposes,is designed to prevent the unauthorized use of a name to directly promote the product or service of the publisher.applying this standard,courts have held that the use of an image in a publication is not for a commercial purpose under section merely because the publication is offered for sale.valentine,cir loft,so d at.
the instant section action is brought against amazon,an internet bookseller that provides services similar to a traditional bookseller.amazon provides its online customers with a searchable book database with links to product detail pages for each book in its database.each product detail page provides the book cover image,the publisher description of the book,and in many instances editorial and customer content.from the product detail page,customers may link to an order placement page,where they may complete their purchase and specify the shipping method.in this manner,amazon role as an internet bookseller closely parallels that of a traditional bookseller.because internet customers are unable to browse through shelves of books and observe the actual book cover photos and publisher content,amazon replicates the bookstore experience by providing its customers with online cover images and publisher book descriptions.
almeida argues that all content provided by internet retailers on product detail pages is displayed for a commercial purpose as that term is used in section.almeida contends that internet retailers use product detail page content for the purpose of promoting the sales of particular products,the sales of unrelated products,and the retailer brand identity.finally,according to almeida,all prior cases have held that internet retailers are liable under section for the unauthorized use of images to promote their products.see gritzke holding,llc,wl,at,dist.lexis,at concluding that plaintiff stated a claim under section by alleging that the of a girls gone wild videotape made the plaintiff the focus of the videotape advertisements,and prominently displayed the plaintiff on the videotape package,in advertisements,and on the defendant web site bosley,d,granting injunctive relief against of a wet contest videotape based upon the factual finding that defendant prominently displayed the plaintiff name,image,and likeness on the cover of the defendants video,and that such advertisements were not merely incidental to the promotion of these products.we disagree with almeida broad interpretation of section liability for internet retailers,and we distinguish the cases she cites in support of the proposition that all content on product detail pages is provided for a commercial purpose within the meaning of section.
first,the defendants in gritzke and bosley made the editorial choice to include the plaintiffs images in the videotape,and to make the plaintiffs the focus of their advertisements,by prominently displaying the plaintiffs on the videotape package,in advertisements,and on defendants websites.second,in each case,the plaintiffs alleged that defendants marketing efforts were aimed at emphasizing the role of plaintiffs.particularly,in bosley,the plaintiff was a local news anchorwoman and regional celebrity,which fact the video producers allegedly exploited by marketing the videotape with an emphasis on the appearance of the naked anchor woman.bosley,d at.
in contrast,amazon does not make editorial choices as to the book cover images it displays on its website.that choice was made by the publisher ophelia editions.moreover,almeida does not allege that amazon display of her image emphasized her role in cabral photo exhibit,or that it can be distinguished from amazon customary display of book cover images.
rather,we find that,as a matter of business practice,amazon use of book cover images closely simulates a customer experience browsing book covers in a traditional book store.thus,it is clear that amazon use of book cover images is not an endorsement or promotion of any product or service,but is merely incidental to,and customary for,the business of internet book sales.see vinci am.can,ohio app d,ohio holding that the mention of olympic athletes names was incidental to the promotion of dixie cups,and thus not a violation of ohio common law right of appropriation,because the use was purely informational and there was no implication that the athletes used,supported,or promoted the product restatement second of torts cmt.d stating that the mere incidental use of a person name or likeness is not actionable under the right of publicity.
under the allegations of almeida complaint,we discern no set of facts by which an internet retailer such as amazon,which functions as the internet equivalent to a traditional bookseller,would be liable for displaying content that is incidental to book sales,such as providing customers with access to a book cover image and a publisher description of the book content.accordingly,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment as to amazon right of publicity claim,but we do so on the ground that amazon did not use almeida image for the purpose of directly promoting a product or service in violation of section.
civil theft 
felonious intent 
to maintain a cause of action under the civil theft statute,almeida must show by clear and convincing evidence an injury caused by the defendant violation of one or more of the provisions of the criminal theft laws found in.stat.west.stat.see palmer got ta have it golf collectibles,d,stating that a cause of action for civil theft derives from two statutory sources the criminal section setting forth the elements of theft,and the civil section granting private parties a cause of action for a violation of the criminal section quoting ames provident life accident ins.almeida claims that she can prove by clear and convincing evidence that amazon violated section,which provides 
a person commits theft if he or she knowingly obtains or uses,or endeavors to obtain or to use,the property of another with intent to,either temporarily or permanently 
a deprive the other person of a right to the property or a benefit from the property.
b appropriate the property to his or her own use or to the use of any person not entitled to the use of the property.
in order to establish a violation of section,almeida must show that amazon knowingly obtained or used,or endeavored to obtain or to use,almeida property with the felonious intent to appropriate the property to amazon own use or to the use of any person not entitled to the use of the property.palmer,d at s
