this appeal,concerning restored copyrights,requires the court to construe for the first time section of the copyright act,which was enacted in its present form as part of the uruguay round agreements act uraa,stat.the,uneeda doll uneeda,appeals from the november,order of the district court for the southern district of new york richard owen,district judge,preliminarily enjoining uneeda from manufacturing,distributing,or selling troll dolls,which are alleged to infringe a restored copyright owned by the,troll.on appeal,uneeda contends that troll has not demonstrated that it owns the restored copyright,and it is a reliance party within the meaning of section and is thus entitled to sell its existing inventory of dolls during a period.we conclude that troll is likely to succeed in proving ownership of the restored copyright and that uneeda is not a reliance party.we therefore affirm the order of the district court.
background 
a brief history of troll dolls.this case involves the copyright to troll dolls,those ugly but somehow endearing plastic dolls with oversized heads,big grins,pot bellies,and frizzy hair.see efs marketing,russ berrie,cir.the troll doll was first created in the late by a danish woodcarver,thomas dam.dam called his doll a good luck troll.by,dam was selling his troll dolls in the united states.
in,dam founded a cleverly named danish company,dam things establishment,through which he marketed his dolls.in,dam things establishment obtained a copyright for the troll doll.the copyright registration listed dam things establishment as the author of the dolls and as the year of first publication.that same year,however,the copyright was invalidated because some dolls had been sold in the united states without the proper copyright notice,and the dolls thereby entered the public domain.see scandia house enterprises,dam things establishment.the good luck troll is still protected by copyright in denmark.
after the troll dolls entered the public domain,numerous companies began marketing the dolls in the united states.see efs marketing,at.the market for troll dolls was somewhat cyclical,as the dolls popularity surged every decade or so.the most recent surge in popularity occurred in the early.see id.
thomas dam died in.following dam death,his heirs granted troll,a danish company,the exclusive right to exploit and license the troll dolls.
the restoration of the good luck trolls copyright.congress enacted the uraa on december.among other things,the uraa amended section of the copyright act to bring the united states into compliance with the berne convention which it had joined in.see dam things from denmark russ berrie,cir.section restores copyrights for a wide range of foreign works that had previously entered the public domain in the united states because of noncompliance with certain formalities,primarily notice of copyright,imposed by united states copyright law.see h see also dam things from denmark,at.
the parties do not dispute that the good luck troll copyright was automatically restored pursuant to the uraa on january.upon learning of the restoration,troll applied for,and was granted,a registration certificate in.the registration lists thomas dam as the author and troll as the owner of the copyright,and it states as the date of first publication.after receiving the registration,troll began enforcing its restored copyright.
uneeda manufacture and marketing of dolls.in or,dam things establishment licensed uneeda doll,udci,uneeda predecessor,to produce and distribute a line of troll dolls under the name.the record shows that udci sold periodically between and.according to udci chairman,however,udci also sold at least through and probably up to.in,udci sold all of its assets,including its copyrights,other intellectual property rights,and goodwill,to uneeda.
in and,troll president met wilson lee,a manager of uneeda hong kong affiliate,at a toy fair in germany.on both occasions,lee allegedly informed him that uneeda was no longer manufacturing or selling troll dolls and had no intention of doing so in the future.notwithstanding these discussions,just as troll was planning a major relaunch of its troll dolls,it learned in august that uneeda was selling newly produced to walmart.the contained copyright notices in uneeda name.walmart withdrew the dolls after troll informed it that the dolls infringed its copyright.
the district court proceeding.troll commenced this copyright infringement action in the district court for the southern district of new york on october,troll served uneeda with written notice of its intent to enforce the copyright a procedure sometimes required under section,as discussed below on october.after a hearing,the district judge granted troll motion for a preliminary injunction in an order entered november.see troll uneeda doll,d.finding direct evidence of actual copying,the district judge concluded that uneeda sales of threatened irreparable harm to troll.see id.at.he also concluded that troll was likely to succeed on the merits of its copyright infringement claim,rejecting uneeda claim to protection as a reliance party under the uraa.see id.at.accordingly,he preliminarily enjoined uneeda from manufacturing,distributing,or selling dolls pending resolution of the case.see id.at.
discussion 
the standards for obtaining a preliminary injunction and for appellate review of the grant of such an injunction are well known and need not be repeated.see forest city daly housing,town of north hempstead,cir preliminary injunction standards nicholson scoppetta,cir appellate review standard.
uneeda does not challenge the district court conclusion that troll would suffer irreparable harm without a preliminary injunction.the issue on appeal is whether troll is likely to succeed on the merits of its infringement claim.uneeda argues that troll is unlikely to succeed because troll has not established that it owns the restored copyright,and uneeda is a reliance party within the meaning of section,entitling it to sell off its inventory of for one year following troll service of a notice of intent to enforce the restored copyright.
ownership of the restored copyright 
uneeda contends preliminarily that the district court erred in determining that troll owns the restored copyright we conclude that troll is likely to succeed in proving ownership because evidence submitted to the district court supports a determination that troll owns the restored copyright.troll president testified that,after dam death in,dam heirs transferred dam rights to the troll dolls to troll.in addition,the copyright registration lists troll as the owner 
according to uneeda,troll trial court evidence contradicts evidence submitted to the copyright office and the district court for the district of new jersey.first,uneeda points out,the original registration certificate listed dam things establishment,not dam himself,as the author of the good luck trolls.consequently,uneeda argues,troll must establish a chain of ownership from dam things establishment,not from dam through his heirs,as troll argued in the district court.but the uraa specifies that authorship is to be determined by reference to the source country law,not by reference to copyright registration.see b see,alameda films s a authors rights restoration,cir applying mexican law.neither party submitted evidence of danish law to the district court.in any event,to obtain a preliminary injunction,troll needed to show only that it was likely to prove ownership,and it seems likely that danish law would consider dam to be the author of the troll dolls since he created the dolls several years before he established dam things establishment 
second,uneeda contends that troll is estopped from arguing that it acquired rights to the troll dolls from dam heirs because it represented to the district court for the district of new jersey in another action that it acquired those rights from dam things establishment.see dam things from denmark,at.the doctrine of judicial estoppel does not prevent troll from asserting a different theory of ownership in this case in any event,even if it is unclear whether troll obtained ownership of the copyright from dam things establishment,as the third circuit stated,or from dam heirs,as troll claims here,troll is likely to prove ownership one way or the other.
ii.whether uneeda is a reliance party 
uneeda primary argument on appeal is that troll can not bring an action at this time to enjoin uneeda sales because uneeda,as a reliance party under the uraa,is entitled to a period.to understand this argument,it is necessary to review the uraa provisions in some detail.
a.the uraa 
congress enacted the uraa on december,to bring the united states into compliance with the berne convention rule of retroactivity see dam things from denmark,at see also william patry,patry on copyright patry melville nimmer david nimmer,nimmer on copyright nimmer.the uraa restored copyright protection for foreign works that had fallen into the public domain for technical reasons unrelated to expiration of the copyright term.congress intention in restoring such protection to foreign copyrights was to secure similar protection for american copyright holders abroad.see dam things from denmark,at.
the uraa restores copyrights as of january,for original works that are not in the public domain of their source countries through expiration of their copyright terms,are in the public domain in the united states because of noncompliance with legal formalities,have at least one author who was a national or domiciliary of an eligible country and were first published in an eligible country and were not published in the united states within thirty days of first publication.see h.a copyright restored under section vests initially in the author of the work as determined by the law of the source country of the work.id.b.the parties do not dispute that the invalidated troll doll copyright qualifies for restoration under these provisions.
much of section concerns the enforcement of restored copyrights against parties that were legitimately exploiting works in reliance on their public domain status.the statute creates a category of prior exploiters called reliance parties,who may continue to exploit the work until the owner of the restored copyright makes known its intent to enforce its copyright.the statute creates three categories of reliance parties 
a any person who,with respect to a particular work,engages in acts,before the source country of that work becomes an eligible country,which would have violated section if the restored work had been subject to copyright protection,and who,after the source country becomes an eligible country,continues to engage in such acts 
b any person who,before the source country of a particular work becomes an eligible country,makes or acquires or more copies of that work or 
c any person who,as the result of the sale or other disposition of significant assets of a person described in subparagraph a or b,is a successor,assignee,or licensee of that person.
h.thus,subsections a and b make the status of a reliance party turn on whether a person took certain actions with respect to a work prior to the date that the source country of that work became an eligible country.and,for purposes of subsections a and b,a source country that was a member of the berne convention when the uraa was enacted including denmark became an eligible country on the date of the uraa enactment,december.see id.h b hoepker kruger,d,see also patry nimmer.c b i ii.the district court mistakenly looked to the date of copyright restoration,january,rather than the date of the uraa enactment,to determine the date when denmark became an eligible country and hence whether uneeda or its predecessor was a reliance party by reason of having acted with respect to the troll dolls prior to that date.see troll,d at.this error was understandable,as several other courts have also tied reliance party status to the date of copyright restoration.see peliculas y videos internacionales,harriscope of los angeles,d,dam things from denmark russ berrie,d,rev on other grounds,cir.
an owner of a restored copyright may not enforce its copyright against a reliance party without first giving notice,either constructive or actual,of its intent to enforce the copyright.until january,an owner of a restored copyright could file a notice of intent to enforce its copyright with the copyright office,thereby putting all reliance parties on constructive notice of its intent.see e.troll did not file such a notice.alternatively,at any time,a copyright owner may serve a notice of intent directly on a reliance party.see id.e.troll served a notice of intent on uneeda on october.after receiving actual or constructive notice of intent to enforce,a reliance party must cease making copies of the protected work.see id.d a ii iii,b ii iii.however,the reliance party is entitled to a grace period in which to sell off its already existing copies.see id.d a ii i,b ii i see also dam things from denmark,at.
uneeda claim to reliance party status 
uneeda contends that its predecessor,udci,was a reliance party under subsection h a because udci continued to engage in infringing acts after denmark became an eligible country upon the uraa enactment,and under subsection h b because udci made at least one copy of the troll doll before the uraa enactment.accordingly,uneeda further contends,it is a reliance party under subsection h c because it is udci successor,and it is therefore entitled to the uraa period.
uneeda subsection h a contention.because subsection h a confers reliance party status on a person who continues to engage in infringing acts after december,uneeda subsection a contention requires us to construe the term continues,which is,as far as we are aware,a task courts have not previously undertaken troll argues that the provision contains a continuing acts requirement and that resuming sales after nine or ten years,as uneeda did,does not satisfy this requirement.uneeda responds that the language of subsection a does not require the infringing activity to be uninterrupted and that the periodic renewal of cyclical exploitation continues such exploitation.
the text of the statute is ambiguous and could support either interpretation.given the statute ambiguity,it is appropriate to consider the legislative history.see rombro dufrayne in re med diversified,cir.the chairman of the house subcommittee on intellectual property and judicial administration stated 
a key to the reliance party status under this provision is the requirement that the person have continued to engage in the described conduct.this requirement incorporates the continuing infringement doctrine and is also relevant to section concerning statutory damages and attorney fees.under this doctrine and section,the defendant must have engaged in an ongoing series of acts.cessation of that activity for an appreciable period of time will deprive one of reliance party status.
cong.rec,statement of hughes.the chairman reference to statutory damages and attorney fees indicates that he understood the continuing infringement doctrine as the principle that infringement commences for the purposes of determining whether infringement commences before a copyright registration when the first act in a series of acts constituting continuing infringement occurs.johnson jones,cir.
under,a plaintiff may not recover statutory damages or attorney fees for any infringement commenced before the effective date of a copyright registration.the courts have held,based on the provision text,legislative history,and purpose,that a plaintiff may not recover statutory damages and attorney fees for infringement occurring after registration if that infringement is part of an ongoing series of infringing acts and the first act occurred before registration.see,id.at holding that the purposes of section would be thwarted by holding that infringement is commenced for the purposes of each time an infringer commits another in an ongoing series of infringing acts,and citing cases singh famous overseas,that verb commenced generally presupposes as a subject some kind of activity that begins at one time and continues or reoccurs thereafter.
the legislative history of section suggests that congress understood sect
