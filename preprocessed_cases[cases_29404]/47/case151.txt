this case concerns appellant peter brownstein claim under the copyright act seeking a declaratory judgment of joint authorship of an ethnic identification system that he created with appellee tina lindsay,the lindsay cultural identification determinate lcid.lindsay purports to have conveyed the copyrights to the lcid to appellee ethnic technologies e tech.the contested work is a computer program that implements rules for identifying the ethnicity of proper names for the purposes of direct marketing.in addition to a declaration of his joint authorship,brownstein sought an accounting of the profits from the ethnic identification system.in response,appellees counterclaimed to cancel the copyright registrations that brownstein had received for the system computer code,which was his contribution to the work.
after the district court denied summary judgment,the case went to trial.at the end of brownstein case,the district court granted appellees judgment as a matter of law under rule a on brownstein joint authorship claim.a.the district court found that brownstein claim was and that he could not succeed on the merits of his claim based on the evidence adduced at trial.the district court severed appellees counterclaim and later issued an opinion granting summary judgment to appellees on their counterclaim.
this appeal presents two issues of first impression for our circuit.the first is when a joint authorship claim under the copyright act arises and accrues and the second is whether courts have the authority to cancel copyright registrations.for the following reasons,we hold that an authorship claim arises and accrues when a plaintiff authorship has been expressly repudiated.we also hold that courts have no authority to cancel copyright registrations.we will reverse both the district court grant of judgment as a matter of law to appellees and its grant of summary judgment to appellees on their counterclaim.also,we will remand the case for a new trial.
background 
brownstein relationship with lindsay and e.the beginning 
brownstein and lindsay worked together at future prospective clients,fpci,a direct mailing list company,when they began developing the ethnic identification system.fpci later assumed a new corporate identity,list services direct,lsdi beginning around december,lindsay began devising the idea and developing the rules for categorizing names by ethnicity,by looking at first names,last names,suffixes,prefixes,and geographic location.these rules became known as the ethnic determinate system eds they could be written out in text,just as one might write out a recipe or driving directions.the system would use this set of rules to run a computer program that would predict the ethnicity of a random list of names from a direct mailing database.
in january,lindsay enlisted brownstein to turn her rules into computer code.this required brownstein to code a number of computer programs that did everything from rewriting a list of names into the proper data format for processing to turning lindsay rules into computer code.these programs became known as the ethn programs over the years,brownstein improved and updated the ethn programs,with each new generation of programs being a distinct work from the previous generation.the combined system of lindsay rules and brownstein computer code was named the lcid.the result was that lindsay was the sole author of the eds,as an independent work of the lcid,brownstein was the sole author of the ethn programs,as another independent work of the lcid,and they both had an equal authorship interest in the lcid as a joint work of the eds and the ethn programs.
lindsay and brownstein did much of their work on the lcid during company time.in june,they incorporated tap systems,tap to commercialize the lcid.lindsay and brownstein were equal owners of tap and the lcid became known as the tap system.
lindsay and brownstein also decided to register the copyrights to their work for extra security.lindsay received her first copyright registration for the eds in february,entitled an ethnic determinant system knowledge and basis.copyright registration no.txu the registration.later that year,in december,lindsay received a second copyright registration to protect her improved version of the eds,which carried the same title.copyright registration no.txu the registration.as such,the second registration was for a derivative work of the first registration the difference with the second registration is that she included a copy of brownstein ethn programs as a deposit copy for the registration and several fields of the registration application referenced a computer process and codes associated with the copyright lindsay applied for and secured both copyright registrations on her own,without the involvement of brownstein,and listed herself as the only author.she then gave brownstein a copy of the copyright registrations to hold for safekeeping he claims that he never reviewed the registrations until many years later,shortly before trial.
in the fall of,lindsay and tom raskin,an executive at lsdi,had a confrontation over the copyright registration she had filed earlier that year for the eds,which brownstein overheard and recounted in a affidavit.raskin demanded that she turn over the copyright registration to him because he believed that lsdi was the rightful owner of her system.lindsay refused,which infuriated raskin to no end and would cause raskin to later sue lindsay and brownstein.eventually,with tension building between the lsdi management and the duo,and their venture gaining steam,they both left lsdi in june.
throughout this whole time,brownstein let lindsay handle tap business affairs.he was so focused on programming code for the lcid that he claims that he did not know of a software license purportedly granting tap ownership of the lcid until.
the progress of tap 
over the course of several years,lindsay executed a number of agreements to form new business entities to promote the lcid and to transfer ownership of the lcid to those entities.
on june,lindsay unilaterally attempted to grant tap ownership of the lcid the combined system of her rules and brownstein ethn programs.app.software license agreement,june.by doing so,lindsay had hoped that tap would own the lcid and be able to exploit it freely.lindsay was the only signatory to that software license she signed both as the copyright holder of the lcid and the agent of tap.brownstein was not a signatory to the license,nor was he asked to be one.
later that year,lindsay and brownstein decided to partner with one of their former employers,consumers marketing research,cmr,to create e tech,a joint venture between the two companies.a september,license agreement the agreement was signed only by linsday and cmr executive,ginger nelson.the agreement listed lindsay and brownstein as executive officers of the new venture which was just called the llc until a superseding agreement in formally named the venture ethnic technologies,llc.app.the parties agreed to combine cmr technology with the lcid which was referred to as the tap system,the combination of which would be called the e tech system.the agreement also acknowledged that tap owned the lcid.the superseding december,agreement the agreement largely mirrored the agreement,except that it formally called the joint venture ethnic technologies,llc and the combined system e tech.app.lindsay and nelson were also the only signatories to the agreement,although brownstein initialed three corrections made to the agreement.app.thus,while brownstein can be imputed with knowledge of these agreements as a owner of tap and an executive of e tech,he never signed the agreements.
as an e tech executive,brownstein executed five licensing agreements to e tech customers between and.app.agreement with edith roman associates app.agreement with wells fargo app.agreement with penn media app.agreement with merkle data technologies app.agreement with central address systems.one of these agreements acknowledged that the e tech system was the exclusive property of e tech,while the four others acknowledged that e tech owns all rights,including copyrights to the e tech system.
the aftermath 
the remainder of brownstein relationship with e tech was marred by three lawsuits the first initiated by lsdi in federal court,the second initiated by him in new jersey state court,and the third initiated by him in federal court.although brownstein did not sign any of the aforementioned licensing agreements including the software license,agreement,and agreement,he did sign the two settlement agreements related to litigation with lsdi in and the new jersey state court oppressed shareholder lawsuit in.
in,lsdi and raskin lindsay and brownstein former employer sued tap in the district of new jersey over its use of the lcid.that action eventually settled in september,with lsdi retaining rights to the ethn programs written up to that point and any derivative works or modifications thereof,referred to as the lsdi program,and tap retaining the rights to the eds and any derivative works or modifications thereof 
the september,settlement agreement the settlement agreement from the lsdi litigation stated that lindsay and brownstein would not claim rights to certain computer programs and derivatives or modifications thereof the lsdi program and that they had rights to lindsay copyrights.app.settlement agreement.notably,the settlement agreement equated the eds with the lcid eds which may be called lcid the district court in this litigation found this to be a critical fact app.settlement agreement.
in may,brownstein left e tech on bad terms.he filed an oppressed shareholder lawsuit against lindsay and e tech in the superior court of new jersey.this litigation settled in may.during this period,brownstein filed for his own copyright registrations in december,which covered his ethn programs.
the may,settlement agreement the settlement agreement from the new jersey state court oppressed shareholder lawsuit stated that the terms of the settlement would not affect the lawsuit leading to this appeal,which was then pending,forced brownstein to relinquish his interests in e tech,and released the defendants lindsay and e tech and brownstein from related claims.app.settlement agreement.specifically,this settlement agreement vitiated brownstein right,title,and interest as a shareholder,officer,employee or director in tap or as manager,partner,member,officer,director or employee of e tech.app.settlement agreement.
nevertheless,it was not until march that brownstein took affirmative steps to protect his joint authorship of the lcid by filing the instant lawsuit seeking declaratory judgment of his authorship of the lcid and,by virtue thereof,his ethn programs against lindsay and e tech.this lawsuit was instigated by lindsay deposition testimony for the new jersey oppressed shareholder lawsuit,in which she confirmed what brownstein had not intuited until then she had submitted brownstein ethn programs with her second copyright registration,the registration,and might be claiming sole authorship of the lcid as a result.in total,he waited years from the date of lindsay copyright registrations,to file a lawsuit.
b.the district court proceedings 
on march,brownstein filed his complaint in this instant action,which sought a declaratory judgment of joint authorship of the lcid,an accounting of the profits from his joint authorship of the lcid,and replevin of physical copies of the ethn programs allegedly kept at e tech offices.lindsay and e tech filed a counterclaim to cancel brownstein copyright registrations to the ethn programs.
in february,a jury trial was held in this action the only witnesses called were brownstein and lindsay.brownstein testified first lindsay was then called and brownstein counsel conducted his direct examination.before appellees counsel called lindsay as their own witness,appellees moved under rule for judgment as a matter of law.the following day,the district court heard oral argument on the motion and ruled from the bench in appellees favor.
the rule a ruling from the bench brownstein claim for joint authorship of the lcid 
the district court granted rule a judgment as a matter of law in favor of appellees on brownstein joint authorship claim foremost,the basis of the district court ruling was that the statute of limitations under the copyright act had run since brownstein had adequate notice of his authorship claim more than three years prior to filing his complaint.app.trial tr.as the district court framed it,w hy did brownstein wait years and until after all of the other ensuing events without saying anything about it app.trial tr.
under the discovery rule,the district court found that there were sufficient storm warnings to brownstein that lindsay was claiming sole authorship of the lcid,as far back as.finding that lindsay act of registering her copyrights started the statute of limitations running,the district court explained that there is evidence that the injurious act of lindsay applying for copyright registration was actually known as far back as.app.trial tr.the district court found it dispositive that brownstein not only had the copyright registrations in his possession but that he also had actual knowledge of the series of agreements and the argument between lindsay and raskin,all of which showed that lindsay was holding herself out as the sole author of the lcid.app.trial tr.in particular,the district court found that brownstein had conceded that lindsay copyright registrations covered the lcid because he signed the settlement agreement,which the district court paraphrased as stating that tina lindsay obtained a certificate of registration from the copyright office in for eds,which may be called lcid.app.trial tr.
the district court reasoned that every piece of evidence in this case contradict ed brownstein testimony that he had no clue that lindsay was claiming to be the sole author of the lcid including his ethn computer programs until she gave her deposition.app.trial tr.from this,the district court concluded not only that brownstein had constructive knowledge that lindsay considered herself the sole author but also that he had actual knowledge of it.the district court also concluded that there was no evidence that lindsay ever considered brownstein a of the lcid.
the district court further ruled that brownstein was not a of the lcid or of his computer programs because there is no evidence to support this claim of in the record.app.trial tr.therefore,the district court reasoned,even if he was not barred by the discovery rule and the statute of limitations,his claim would still fail on the merits.
the summary judgment opinion lindsay and e tech counterclaim to cancel brownstein copyright registrations 
after it granted appellees rule motion on brownstein authorship claim,the district court issued an opinion granting summary judgment on appellees counterclaim to cancel brownstein two copyright registrations.the district court found that it had authority to cancel brownstein copyright registrations because the threshold determination as to the ownership of the works at issue is to be made by the court,as appellees seek to invalidate the registration because brownstein had no right to register the work,not because of some regulatory defect.app.summ.op.at.the district court proceeded to cancel brownstein copyright registrations because it had previously found that brownstein claim was without merit in deciding the rule motion.app.summ.op.at.thus,it concluded that brownstein had no authorship interest in the lcid or his ethn programs and that all of the lcid and its derivatives were created for tap and owned exclusively by tap.app.summ.op.at.the district court noted that,specifically,the and agreements refer to the relevant programs as belonging exclusively to tap.app.summ.op.at.the district court also found that the settlement agreement from the new jersey oppressed shareholder lawsuit relieved brownstein of any right,title and interest in tap and e tech,including the lcid,which it found that tap and e tech owned.app.summ.op.at.
ii.statement of jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had jurisdiction under,and.we have jurisdiction under.
our review of a judgment as a matter of law under rule a is plenary.beck city of pittsburgh,cir.a motion for judgment as a matter of law under federal rule of civil procedure a should be granted only if,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,there is no question of material fact for the jury and any verdict other than the one directed would be erroneous under the governing law.id.quoting macleary hines,cir.
our review of a district court grant of summary judgment is plenary.william graham haughey,cir.summary judgment may only be granted if there is no genuine dispute as to a material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a.
iii.analysis 
our circuit has rarely had occasion to venture into the area of joint authorship under the copyright act.in andrien southern ocean county chamber of commerce,cir,we touched upon the issue in determining whether a printer contribution to the printing of a map gave it joint authorship of the map or whether such contributions through printing were works for hire.this is the first time that our circuit has faced a joint authorship claim squarely on the merits.
in granting appellees rule motion,the district court decided two factual issues.the first issue was whether brownstein was a of the lcid.if he was deemed a,the second issue was whether his joint authorship claim was barred by the statute of limitations because he was put on inquiry notice that lindsay had disclaimed his.in deciding both of these issues,the district court erred because these were factual determinations that should have been left to the jury.when viewed in the light most favorable to brownstein,the evidence presented at trial could allow him to succeed on his joint authorship claim.
in granting summary judgment on appellees counterclaim,the district court determined that it had the authority to invalidate brownstein copyright registrations.for the reasons that follow,the district court should not have granted summary judgment on the counterclaim because it had no authority to cancel brownstein copyright registrations.
we will address each of these three issues in turn whether brownstein was a of the lcid,whether his claim is barred by the statute of limitations,and whether the district court had authority to cancel brownstein copyright registrations.
joint authorship 
in order to reach the issue of when brownstein authorship claim arose and accrued,we must first determine if he was a of the lcid.
the lcid as a joint work 
the issue at the root of this case is whether brownstein is a of the lcid,which depends on whether the lcid is a joint work.when two or more people create a joint work,they become and of the work,each entitled to undivided ownership in the entire work.melville nimmer david nimmer,nimmer on copyright hereinafter nimmer on copyright see defining a joint work andrien,at.this ownership interest vests from the act of creating the work,rather than from any sort of agreement between the authors or any act of registration with the copyright office.
for two or more people to become,each author must contribute some amount of creative,original,or intellectual expression to the work and both must intend that their contributions be combined.nimmer on copyright see gaiman mcfarlane,cir.the components must also be inseparable or interdependent parts of a whole but each coauthor contribution need not be equal for them to have an equal stake in the work as a whole.nimmer on copyright.thus,if person a writes lyrics to a song and intends for a composer to write the score,person b who writes the score becomes a in the work.see gaiman,at providing the example of two,one a professor with brilliant ideas and the other an excellent writer childress taylor,cir holding that a lyricist and composer of a song were even though the lyricist wrote the words before he knew the identity of the composer who would later write the music.
at oral argument,appellees conceded that brownstein and lindsay were of the lcid up until its iteration.oral arg.at,july.this concession means that appellees admit that brownstein contributed a amount of creative expression to the lcid through his work on the ethn programs and that lindsay intended for the eds to be combined with the computer code he drafted to form the lcid.moreover,this framework concedes that the eds and the ethn programs are interdependent works,which comports with lindsay assertions.in both the software license and her testimony at trial,she admitted that her rules and brownstein code were inseparable.app.trial tr.the lcid had to have programs.in schedule a of the license,she wrote that the series of computer programs and system data of the lcid were irrevocably entwined.app.software license agreement,schedule a.
importantly,this concession also means that appellees admit that the ethn programs were not works for hire,as lindsay had insinuated in some of her testimony at trial.the district court also concluded that the ethn programs were works for hire in granting summary judgment on appellees counterclaim,which was an argument that appellees advanced in their answer and which we find to be in error.
to analogize here,lindsay wrote the lyrics,while brownstein composed the score.the exception to this joint authorship rule is the work for hire rule,where a collaborator creates his contribution to the work as part of his employment or for a commission b nimmer on copyright.in such a case,authorship inures to the employer or commissioner.b.
a work for hire requires that the work be made by an employee within the scope of his or her employment or that the work be commissioned.see nimmer on copyright marco accent publ g,cir see also warren freedenfeld,mctigue,cir.at trial,lindsay claimed that she directed brownstein on how to turn her rules into computer code.app.trial tr.at my direction.i told him exactly what to write.on the other hand,brownstein had to use his own intellectual creativity to select the computer commands to use.he controverted lindsay testimony on the stand when he testified that he automated lindsay manually inputted list of rules and names,which gave brownstein q uite a bit of discretion in how he coded the ethn programs.app.trial tr.
by every indication,and given appellees concession,brownstein computer programs were not works for hire.b.brownstein was both an officer and shareholder of tap and an officer of e tech.he was not an employee of tap or e tech nor was he commissioned to write the code by tap or lindsay.most importantly,he was not compensated for the express purpose of writing code for them.
the effect of lindsay and brownstein copyright registrations 
pivotal to this case is distinguishing an author interest in the copyright to his work from the registration of his work.a copyright,as a right,vests immediately upon the creation of the work.a.for this reason,a copyright must not be confused with the act of registering that right.registration serves primarily to create a record of the creation of the work and it also allows the author to bring civil claims under the copyright act.a nimmer on copyright.
with few exceptions,a deposit copy must be submitted with an application for copyright registration.a,b.a deposit copy does not necessarily limit the copyrightable work itself.nimmer on copyright.here,a deposit copy means that lindsay sent a physical printout of brownstein code to the copyright office for safekeeping and was only sent a deposit receipt in return,which would serve an archival function in the event of infringement and help elucidate her copyrightable work.id.
lindsay copyrights and copyright registrations 
due to the district court conflation of the eds and the lcid,which are distinct works with distinct copyrights,it was misled into finding that lindsay copyright registrations covered the entire lcid,including brownstein ethn programs.this false premise then led the district court one step further to conclude that lindsay could unilaterally transfer ownership of the lcid through the trio of licensing agreements that she executed.the district court largely assumed that her copyright registrations covered the entire lcid because brownstein ethn programs were included as a deposit copy with her second registration.but the district court assumption is belied by the copyright registrations themselves and the law undergirding the registration process.lindsay copyright registrations only cover the eds.
lindsay registrations did not extend to the lcid as a whole or the ethn programs.notably,lindsay first registration was entitled an ethnic determinant system knowledge and basis,which unambiguously refers to the eds,her system of rules.her second registration had the same title and was marked as a derivative work of the first,so it,too,only covered the eds.the most significant difference between her two registrations is that the second registration included brownstein ethn programs as the deposit copy and described the eds as a computer system process and data rules in the nature of authorship field of the registration application.she also wrote a dditional ethnic categories,additional rules,names,codes d escription of computer process included in another field of the second registration.nowhere,though,did she write ethn programs in the registration.accordingly,her registrations could not claim ownership of the ethn programs simply based on the contents of the deposit copy.
the district court reliance on the deposit copy as an indication of the second registration scope was also misguided.lindsay,herself,admitted as much at trial.she testified that the deposit copy did not reflect the scope of her copyrights or authorship,explaining that the deposit copy of the ethn programs was only meant to provide an example of how the eds would be implemented,not to claim ownership of brownstein programs.app.trial tr.
thus,the fact that lindsay submitted brownstein code in the form of the deposit copy does not establish that she held a copyright to his ethn programs or the lcid as a whole.since brownstein,alone,wrote the code,the only rights lindsay could have had to his code would flow through the lcid as a joint work with her rules.further,even if her registrations covered the lcid and were entitled the lcid,including the ethn programs,that act would not vest exclusive ownership of the lcid in lindsay.brownstein would remain a and because copyright registration does not establish the copyright,which attaches at the moment of creation.consequently,lindsay copyright registrations,if anything,are merely placeholders for the indivisible joint rights she inherently had in the eds and the lcid with brownstein.
brownstein copyrights and copyright registrations 
as mentioned above,brownstein had copyrights exclusively in his ethn programs as an independent work and in the lcid as a.in addition,he also had copyrights to whatever new generations of the ethn programs and lcid that he created as derivative works of his first set of ethn programs and the lcid.therefore,although lsdi retained rights to the ethn programs that were considered the lsdi program in the settlement agreement,the subsequent generations of ethn programs that brownstein developed remained under his ownership because they were derivative works of the lsdi program.brownstein copyright registrations would,therefore,cover any post generations of the ethn programs that were not covered by the settlement agreement with lsdi.
derivative works of the lcid 
at oral argument,appellees contended that the post versions of the lcid are derivative works and that,therefore,brownstein has no rights to these improved versions of the lcid.appellees are correct in one respect and wrong in another the post versions of the lcid may indeed be derivative works but brownstein retains an interest in the post versions of the lcid insofar as they are based on any version of the lcid to which he is a coauthor.it is possible that the post versions of the lcid continued to employ the code created by brownstein,but such a determination would require additional factual development at trial.
derivative works are works that build upon and improve a previous work,such as a remix of an old song.while the original work may be copyrightable,a derivative work is copyrightable on its own basis.id nimmer on copyright.derivative work protection only extends to those parts of the derivative work that are novel beyond the original work and the author or authors of the underlying work retain their rights to their original work.see dam things from denmark,troll.aps russ berrie,cir.
a copyright is better described as a bundle of rights the right to reproduce the copyrighted work,the right to prepare derivative works from the copyrighted work,and the right to perform or display the copyrighted work.see davis blige,cir.thus,the author has the exclusive right to produce derivative works.see dun bradstreet software,grace consulting,cir dam things from denmark,at.if the original work is copyrightable,then the original author or authors must consent to the creation of a derivative work by a third party unauthorized creation of a derivative work,which incorporates the original work,constitutes an infringement of the underlying work.nimmer on copyright dun bradstreet software,at dam things from denmark,at.
as a result,even if brownstein is not a of some of the derivative versions of the lcid,he remains the of the underlying work and has an ownership interest in derivative versions of the lcid to the extent that they incorporate the underlying work.the extent of brownstein authorship and ownership of these derivative works is a factual question that must be decided by a jury.
the license and settlement agreements 
having defined the inherent copyrights of lindsay and brownstein,the next question is what rights were conveyed by the series of license and settlement agreements.some agreements purport to grant licenses,while some purport to transfer ownership,but it is not at all clear which agreements accomplish what.
with respect to licensing a joint work,each is entitled to convey rights to the joint work without the consent of his.nimmer on copyright.see davis,at.the only caveat is that the licensing author must account to his for his fair share of profits from any license.nimmer on copyright.if a attempts to convey exclusive rights,his can convey the same exclusive rights in effect,such an exclusive license becomes a license.id.see davis,at a may grant a license to use the work unilaterally,because his may also use the work or grant similar licenses to other users and because the license presumptively does not diminish the value of the copyright to the.accordingly,the only way for truly exclusive rights to be conveyed to a joint work is for all to consent to such an exclusive conveyance.as with tenants in common of real property,a can transfer or assign the rights to his ownership interest in the joint work,but this does not affect the ownership rights of his.nimmer on copyright davis,at.
with respect to transferring the ownership of a joint work,a can not transfer the ownership interest of his.the copyright act statute of frauds requires that any transfer of an ownership interest must be signed and in writing.a see barefoot architect,bunge,cir.
due to appellees concession that brownstein was a of the lcid through,lindsay could not have transferred ownership of the lcid before without brownstein consent in a writing with his signature.even if lindsay registrations covered the entire lcid,she would have had no authority to convey an exclusive license to the joint work of the lcid without brownstein consent and could only have assigned the rights to her own ownership interest in the lcid.nimmer on copyright,see davis,at.
under these facts,lindsay could have only conveyed a license to the lcid to tap and,subsequently,to e tech.such licenses to the lcid would have no effect on brownstein copyrights and ownership interest in his ethn programs and the lcid.accordingly,the only set of rights to which lindsay could have conveyed an exclusive license or transferred ownership on her own would be to the eds,of which she was the sole author.if lindsay did transfer her ownership of the eds to tap,that,too,would not have disturbed brownstein rights.
since the agreement and agreement both emanate from the rights conveyed in the software license,those two agreements rise and fall with the software license.since the software license did not transfer brownstein ownership interest in the lcid as a joint work,neither could the agreement or agreement.the settlement agreement did divest brownstein of any interest he had in tap and e tech.but,if tap and e tech never had exclusive rights to brownstein ethn programs as part of the lcid,then brownstein could not be divested of those rights via the settlement agreement.moreover,the settlement agreement only quashed brownstein right,title,and interest as a shareholder,officer,employee or director in tap or as manager,partner,member,officer,director or employee of e tech.it says nothing specifically about his rights as of the lcid or sole author of the ethn programs.
in sum,brownstein copyrights and ownership interest in his ethn programs and,by virtue thereof,the lcid were not affected by the series of agreements,except to the extent that the lsdi settlement agreement abrogated his ownership of the pre generations of the ethn programs,the lsdi program.
b.the statute of limitations 
even though brownstein is a of the lcid through and possibly a of derivative versions of the lcid created thereafter,an open question remains about whether the statute of limitations has run on his authorship claim.the statute of limitations under the copyright act is three years for all civil actions b.here,brownstein must show that his joint authorship claim did not begin to accrue until march,at the latest.
inquiry notice of brownstein authorship claim 
once brownstein was on inquiry notice of his authorship claim,his cause of action began to accrue and the statute of limitations began to run.deciding when brownstein was on inquiry notice of his authorship claim depends on two determinations when a cause of action first arose and when he should have known that a cause of action had arisen.in our circuit,the discovery rule governs the second determination,while we adopt the express repudiation rule from our sister circuits to govern the first.
a.the discovery rule 
we follow the discovery rule in determining when a cause of action begins to accrue.the discovery rule is a general inquiry notice rule,which states that a claim accrues when the plaintiff discovers or should have discovered with due diligence that his rights had been violated.william graham,at.in william graham,we extended the discovery rule to copyright actions,noting that eight of our sister circuits had done the same.id.at.we held that a plaintiff would be able to discover his injury with due diligence if there were storm warnings which gave the plaintiff sufficient information of possible wrongdoing to place him on inquiry notice of culpable activity.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.the discovery rule also holds that the clock only starts running once a cause of action arises since a plaintiff can not experience storm warnings of a violation until his rights have been violated.id.at.consequently,prospective plaintiffs have no duty to investigate future causes of action.id.at.
express repudiation 
since graham does not establish when a cause of action arises for declaration of authorship,we must turn to our sister circuits for guidance 
the ninth circuit,seventh circuit,and second circuit have adopted an express repudiation rule,such that a joint authorship claim arises and an author is alerted to the potential violation of his rights when his authorship has been expressly repudiated by his.see zuill,at gaiman,at gary friedrich,llc marvel characters,cir.thus,in assessing the accrual of a joint authorship claim,we will apply the discovery rule to the express repudiation rule.fusing these two concepts,the discovery rule will only apply once a plaintiff authorship has been expressly repudiated since he can only be on inquiry notice once his rights have been violated.
this express repudiation rule spawned from a ninth circuit case,zuill shanahan,cir.since zuill,only a smattering of circuit cases have endorsed the rule.see cambridge literary,goebel porzellanfabrik,cir roger miller music,publ g llc,cir.similar to the discovery rule,the express repudiation rule looks for evidence that a has acted adversely to the plaintiff status as a see gaiman,at zuill,at gary friedrich,llc,at see also aalmuhammed lee,cir merchant levy,cir.many of these cases analogize of copyrights to tenants in common of real property.see zuill,at gaiman,at davis,at.
applied here,brownstein injury occurred whenever lindsay expressly repudiated his joint authorship of the lcid.this required that lindsay do something that communicated not merely that she is the author,but that she is the sole author or that brownstein is not a for instance,this would occur if brownstein became aware that she was claiming that she was the sole author of the lcid in an agreement or if brownstein overheard a conversation where lindsay said that she commissioned brownstein to do the work for her as a work for hire.or,as in gaiman and zuill,this would happen if lindsay directly sent brownstein a letter which stated that she was the sole author of the lcid.express repudiation could also occur if lindsay was exploiting the lcid without remuneration to brownstein.see,gary friedrich,llc,at cambridge literary,at.
the district court considered the date of express repudiation which it characterized as the date of injury to be the date that lindsay registered her copyrights since,in listing herself as the only author of the registration,she was implicitly disclaiming brownstein joint authorship.app.trial tr.in my view,the injurious act defined by the statute actually occurred upon the registration of the copyright.this stretches the meaning of express repudiation too thin.the act of registering a copyright does not repudiate put differently,the way to expressly repudiate your authorship is not to register the copyright in your name.
as one of our sister circuits has held,a copyright registration,standing alone,does not serve as repudiation of joint authorship because are not expected to investigate the copyright register for competing registrations.see gaiman,at.but see saenger,nationwide ins.licensing,cir holding that copyright registration puts the world on constructive notice of ownership diamond gillis,d,holding that registration of a song qualified as express repudiation.in gaiman,the seventh circuit held that the purpose of a copyright registration is not to start the statute of limitations running because it is not adverse to a coauthor interest in the joint work.at.
the peril of the district court rationale is apparent a challenger to a plaintiff authorship could surreptitiously apply for copyright registration of the plaintiff work to start the statute of limitations running and,if the plaintiff did not discover the registration until three years thereafter,the plaintiff authorship would be nullified.
appellees contend that blanket statements in some of the agreements declaring lindsay as the sole author of the lcid expressly repudiated brownstein authorship rights.we disagree.the more apt inquiry is whether any statement in the agreements was hostile or adverse to brownstein authorship rights.see gaiman,at zuill,at.for repudiation to be express,it must be plain.see aalmuhammed,at.a copyright holder should not be required to investigate every whisper and rumor that another has declared himself the author of his copyrighted work.see gaiman,at.a whisper or rumor also does not stir up the type of storm warning that would put an author on inquiry notice.it follows that,if an action is not hostile to an author rights,it may not be plain that his authorship rights have been repudiated.
there are several potential sources of express repudiation at play lindsay copyright registrations,the argument between lindsay and lsdi raskin,the trio of license agreements the software license,the agreement,and the agreement,the settlement agreements the settlement agreement and the settlement agreement,and the e tech licensing agreements executed by brownstein from until.we will rule out one of these sources and leave the others for the jury to decide on remand.
lindsay copyright registrations 
lindsay copyright registrations could not have expressly repudiated brownstein rights since,by their plain language,they only covered the eds.as discussed above,the deposit copy did not expand the scope of her second registration by including brownstein ethn programs.more importantly,as just established,a registration does not expressly repudiate authorship.
ii.the argument with raskin 
in the argument,which brownstein recounted in his affidavit for the lsdi litigation,lindsay told raskin that the copyright was in her name because she initiated it and did all the work and spent her own money and time to do it.app.brownstein aff.this argument declared very little expressly about lindsay copyrights it did not identify the work to which she was claiming ownership and,at that time,raskin and lsdi were not yet aware of the lcid they were only aware of the eds.as a result,this argument did not necessarily provide brownstein a storm warning that lindsay was repudiating his joint authorship of the lcid.
iii.the software license 
the software license is key because it is the first link in the chain of title that lindsay supposedly conveyed through the trio of agreements all of the subsequent license and settlement agreements turn on what was originally conveyed to tap in this software license.the software license purported to give tap an exclusive license to the lcid,which included lindsay rules and brownstein computer programs.see app.software license agreement,schedule a.in her testimony,lindsay explained that this was her intention because the software license was supposed to mak e sure that tap owns both the rules and the computer code.app.trial tr.lindsay was the only signatory to the license,both as the copyright holder and the representative of tap.brownstein was not a signatory to the agreement,which is the foible of lindsay plans.
interestingly,her intention to grant an exclusive license to brownstein ethn programs,as part of the lcid,did not actually interfere with brownstein ownership rights.as described previously,a is allowed to grant a license to the joint work without the consent or involvement of her but such a license is treated like a nonexclusive license and does not negate the other ownership interest.nimmer on copyright see davis,at.viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to brownstein,it is possible that he thought that the software license merely conveyed a nonexclusive license for the lcid to tap rather than declaring lindsay the sole author of the lcid.despite her subjective thoughts or evaluations,brownstein rights were not adversely affected by lindsay actions.
further,a close look at the agreement shows that the language does not state that lindsay was the exclusive author or owner of the entire lcid.it vaguely calls lindsay the copyright holder without describing her specific copyright interests or referencing her actual copyright registrations.app.software license agreement,june.a reader might assume from this that she is the sole copyright holder of the lcid,but this would only be an assumption and not based on the strict language of the agreement.
iv.the agreement and the agreement 
the agreement which partnered tap with cmr fares no better in lindsay attempt to establish express repudiation since it was contingent on the rights held by tap.the strongest language from this agreement only says that tap owns all rights,including copyrights to the tap system,which is the exclusive property of tap.app.as discussed above,the software license could not have conveyed brownstein ownership interest in the lcid to tap without his consent in a signed writing.at most,tap owned lindsay ownership interest in the lcid.
in fact,the agreement states that the joint venture and the counterparty,cmr,acknowledge at all times that the original tap system the lcid remains the property of tap.app.how could the property interest in the lcid be transferred to a new owner if it remained the property of the original owner thus,all the agreement actually did was give the joint venture,what would become e tech,a license to use the lcid and allowed e tech to combine the lcid with cmr technology.it said nothing that was adverse to brownstein ownership interest in the lcid his rights could with the terms of the agreement.
although very similar to the agreement,the agreement did convey all of tap assets to the joint venture,but this also did not disturb brownstein ownership interest in the copyrights to the ethn programs and,by virtue thereof,the lcid.as mentioned,all tap possessed was a license to the lcid from the software license and possibly the assignment of lindsay ownership interest in the lcid.thus,contrary to lindsay belief,the agreement did not vest e tech with exclusive ownership over the lcid.as long as his ownership rights remained intact,brownstein might not have seen any storm warnings requiring him to investigate the potential repudiation of his authorship.
v.the settlement agreement 
the agreement which presents the most potential for lindsay argument is the lsdi settlement agreement,which brownstein actually signed and which gave lsdi ownership over certain computer code referred to as the lsdi program.lindsay claims that it decreed her exclusive ownership of the lcid by stating that her two copyrights cover the eds which may be called the lcid,but it is not for a settlement agreement to define the scope of her copyrights or her copyright registrations such a misnomer did not necessarily serve as a storm warning of repudiation of brownstein joint authorship of the lcid.otherwise,it does not say much in her favor.
that language only renamed the eds which is all her exclusive copyrights and her copyright registrations likely covered as the lcid,for the purposes of the agreement.moreover,other language in the agreement controverts any exclusive ownership lindsay would have been given over the lcid in the agreement by declaring that lindsay,nelson,brownstein,et,tap and cmr are the sole owners of the copyrights.app.settlement agreement.thus,if the settlement language governed the boundaries of the copyrights,then lindsay would actually have to share ownership in her copyrights with brownstein and the other parties to the settlement agreement.it is surely difficult to characterize this as a storm warning if anything,it might have confirmed for brownstein that his rights to the lcid were preserved.
vi.the settlement agreement 
the settlement agreement is of little help to lindsay.she argues that,by disowning any right,title and interest in e tech,brownstein forfeited his ownership interests in his computer code.but what the agreement actually says is that brownstein forfeited his rights and interest as a shareholder,officer,employee or director in tap or as manager,partner,member,officer,director or employee of e tech.app.settlement agreement.there is no basis to argue that brownstein independent ownership rights in his ethn programs were subsumed in his positions in tap or e tech.further,as noted earlier,it is doubtful that tap or e tech ever had exclusive ownership of the lcid and brownstein ethn programs.
vii.brownstein e tech licensing agreements 
these standard consumer licensing agreements state that e tech owns the copyrights to the e tech system as its exclusive property,which is accurate and undisputed.brownstein signed five of these agreements with e tech customers between and,which satisfies the statute of frauds and imputes him with knowledge of their language.the distinguishing and critical fact is that the e tech system is a joint work formed from the combination of the lcid and cmr own system.therefore,by declaring that e tech owned the e tech system,the agreements were not asserting that e tech owned the copyrights to the lcid,which is a separately copyrightable component of the e tech system.it is plausible that brownstein might have been put on inquiry notice by these agreements but,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to brownstein,it is also plausible that these agreements would not have provided storm warnings of repudiation aft
