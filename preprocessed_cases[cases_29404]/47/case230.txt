plaintiffs frank fogerty and nathan crow appeal the district court order granting summary judgment and awarding attorneys fees to defendants collectively,mgm in this copyright infringement case.as we agree with the district court that plaintiffs have not presented a sustainable theory of relief,we affirm that ruling.as we disagree with the district court award of attorneys fees,we reverse that ruling.
michael wilson and barbara broccoli,the current producers of the james bond films and principals of eon productions,sought a composer to write the musical score for the nineteenth bond film the world is not enough.in september,wilson and broccoli selected david arnold,a composer,a grammy award winner for the musical score for independence day,and the author of the end theme song for the bond film tomorrow never dies.arnold maintains a private recording studio in london,where he composed the theme song and gave it the same name as the film.in writing the song,arnold collaborated with lyricist don black,who also lives in london and who has written the lyrics to the theme songs for four previous bond films.arnold and black met several times in november and december of to discuss the lyrics for the world is not enough,and they exchanged phone calls,faxes and during that time in collaborating on the song.
arnold also contacted shirley manson,the lead singer for the garbage,and asked her to record the song.she agreed.
between late october and november of,arnold played the melody of the world is not enough over the phone to his personal assistant trish hillis,before whom he often informally auditioned his songs.according to arnold,he strung some together,and all of a sudden the song came to life,and he thought that was probably it.ja.on december,arnold again played the world is not enough for hillis,this time on a piano at his london home.when arnold played the music for hillis,he had completed the song and lyrics,save for the brief transition of approximately eight bars in the middle of the song.in december,arnold also played the melody for geoff foster and isabel griffiths,employees of air studios,on a grand piano in the studio main hall.
in early january,arnold completed the song and created a demo recording of it on his computer at his private recording studio.arnold computer shows january,as the last day he modified the demo recording.
at roughly this time,arnold played the world is not enough for michael wilson and barbara broccoli,the producers of the upcoming film.they liked the song.on january,arnold traveled to pinewood studios in england and played the song for michael apted,the director of the world is not enough,who was extremely pleased with the song.ja.
arnold next asked trish hillis to deliver a copy of the demo to shirley manson,who as noted had agreed to record the song.on january,hillis phone log shows that she contacted ian wesley,the general manager of mushroom records,garbage record label.wesley told hillis that manson was staying at the royal garden hotel in london and to deliver the recording to the hotel at the next day.on january,after hillis arrived at the royal garden hotel,she called harold kohl,garbage tour manager,who told her to leave the recording at the front desk.a bill from the royal garden hotel indicates that shirley manson stayed there on january,and manson later recalled receiving the song from kohl in january while staying at the hotel.
arnold next sent a recording of the song to his american agent,vas vangelos,who lives in los angeles.an invoice shows that air studios billed eon productions for a shipment to vangelos on february.michael sandoval,then an executive vice president at mgm,requested a copy of the world is not enough from vangelos.sandoval received the world is not enough on february,and he played the song for other mgm executives.no one apparently liked the song initially because it was a ballad and because they had hoped for a theme song with a different tempo.
on the same day february,nathan crow visited michael sandoval at mgm and delivered a recording of his song this game we play,which he had with frank fogerty.according to crow,sandoval liked the song,suggested that he might consider it for the film the thomas crown affair and kept a copy of the recording.arnold the world is not enough,it turns out,shares an identical sequence with crow this game we play.
before manson recorded the commercial version of the world is not enough,mgm contacted arnold in march of and suggested that a motif in the world is not enough was too similar to a motif in earlier bond theme songs.arnold agreed to remove the sequence,which all agree is unrelated to the sequence that this game we play and the world is not enough have in common.
in june and august of,shirley manson and her band recorded the world is not enough.manson requested one lyrical change in the song because the line i know when to kiss and i know when to kill did not meet her tastes.ja.arnold and black changed the lyrics,and she completed the recording.
convinced that arnold and mgm had copied the sequence from this game we play in composing the world is not enough,fogerty and crow filed a copyright infringement action in the united states district court for the middle district of tennessee.the parties conducted discovery,and mgm moved for summary judgment,claiming that the undisputed facts showed that arnold independently created the world is not enough.
the district court granted mgm motion,concluding that arnold had independently written the tune to the song 
defendants and composers of the world is not enough did not have access to this game we play through any of the avenues postulated by plaintiffs because a review of the record indicates that the melody and significant portions of the world is not enough were completed prior to the dates that any alleged access by defendants to this game we play could have occurred.
op.at.the district court also rejected plaintiffs alternative claim that the two songs are strikingly similar,an independent theory of liability that warrants relief even when the plaintiff can not prove access.id.at.there is no evidence adduced by plaintiffs,the court concluded,to support the proposition that the two works are so strikingly similar that copying is the only plausible explanation of the similarities.id.at.
in the aftermath of this ruling,mgm moved for attorneys fees under of the copyright act,and for nontaxable costs under federal rule of civil procedure d.alleging that plaintiffs claims were objectively unreasonable,mgm sought in attorneys fees and in costs.the district court granted mgm motion for attorneys fees in the interests of justice and in furtherance of the objectives of the copyright act.op.at june.plaintiffs claims were objectively unreasonable,the district court observed,in that plaintiffs pursued litigation despite multiple declarations establishing independent creation of the world is not enough before any of the defendants had access to plaintiffs original work,and plaintiffs offered no direct evidence to support one of the two basic elements of copyright infringement.id.at.the district court,however,conclude d that a reduction in the billed hours is appropriate in light of the overstaffing of this litigation,the redundant billing,and vague entries on the firm invoices,id.at,and awarded mgm in attorneys fees,id.at.holding that fees for legal research federal express charges messenger service postage out of town travel and copies were not allowable,the district court denied mgm request for nontaxable costs of.id.at.for routine taxable costs,the district court awarded.id.at.
summary judgment is appropriate when the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.where the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the party,the supreme court has held,there is no genuine issue for trial.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d quotation omitted.a district court decision receives de novo review.see farhat jopke,cir.
the copyright act gives copyright owners exclusive rights to reproduce,prepare derivative works from,distribute,and publicly perform or display a copyrighted work.see.to the ends of protecting these rights,the act allows t he legal or beneficial owner of an exclusive right under a copyright to institute an action for any infringement of that particular right.b.a claim of copyright infringement requires proof of ownership of a valid copyright,and copying of constituent elements of the work that are original.feist publ ns,rural.serv,d see also ellis diffie,cir.
because claimants rarely have direct evidence of copying,they typically try to establish an inference of copying by showing access to the work by the defendant s and a substantial similarity between the two works at issue.ellis,at.access,we have held,is essentially hearing or having a reasonable opportunity to hear the plaintiff s work and thus having the opportunity to copy and may not be inferred through mere speculation or conjecture.id.quotations omitted.the substantial similarity analysis first requires a filtering of the unprotectable aspects of the protected work,then asks whether an ordinary observer would perceive the original and the alleged copy as substantially similar.see kohus mariol,cir.once a plaintiff establishes access and substantial similarity,the defendant may rebut the presumption of copying by showing independent creation of the allegedly infringing work.ellis,at see also susan wakeen doll ashton drake galleries,cir.lastly,even without proof of access,a plaintiff still may prevail by showing a striking similarity between the works,precluding all possible conclusion but that the work was copied.murray hill publ ns,twentieth century fox film,cir.
in applying these principles to this case,the parties share considerable common ground.mgm does not dispute that fogerty and crow own a valid copyright in this game we play,and plaintiffs concede that they failed to produce direct evidence of copying.for purposes of this appeal,the parties also agree that fogerty and crow proved that mgm had access to their work after february,and that the two songs are substantially,but not strikingly,similar.
the question under these circumstances is whether david arnold independently created the world is not enough before february,and whether the undisputed evidence establishes that fact.we believe it does.
fogerty and crow concede that david arnold did not have access to this game we play until crow delivered a recording of the song to michael sandoval at mgm on february.before that date,deposition testimony and personal calendar entries show that david arnold and don black collaborated on the world is not enough in november and december.arnold performed the song twice for his personal assistant trish hillis between october and december of.he also performed the song for geoff foster and isabel griffiths of air studios in december,and the film producers barbara broccoli and michael wilson heard the song in early january.arnold also made a demo recording of the song,and his personal computer at air studios indicates that he last modified the recording on january.the next day,arnold delivered a copy of the song to pinewood studios where the film director,michael apted,listened to the song.
arnold and hillis also testified that hillis delivered a copy of the recording to the royal garden hotel in london where shirley manson was staying.hillis produced her phone log showing that she made several calls concerning the delivery on january,and her personal calendar indicated that she planned to go there on january to deliver arnold song.mgm also produced a hotel receipt indicating that shirley manson stayed at the royal garden hotel on january.hillis testified in her deposition that she left the recording at the hotel desk for harold kohl,garbage tour manager,and manson recalled receiving the recording from kohl at the hotel.
aside from a lyrical change to the song the removal of one line to accommodate shirley manson and one change to the score the removal of the motif to accommodate the mgm executives,the witnesses that testified or gave declarations agree that the song they heard before february,did not otherwise change after that date.in the face of this evidence that arnold and black independently created the world is not enough before mgm first had access to this game we play on february,plaintiffs raise a series of arguments designed to show that they nonetheless should be able to present their claim to a jury.each is unconvincing.
first,they suggest that they can respond to this evidence simply by claiming that a jury might choose to disregard it or might find it unpersuasive.that is not true.see cox.dep t of transp,cir a nonmoving party may not avoid a properly supported motion for summary judgment by simply arguing that it relies solely or in part upon credibility considerations i nstead,the nonmoving party must present affirmative evidence to defeat a properly supported motion for summary judgment.curl int l bus.machs,cir t he party opposing summary judgment must be able to point to some facts which may or will entitle him to judgment,or refute the proof of the moving party in some material portion,and the opposing party may not merely recite the incantation,credibility,and have a trial on the hope that a jury may disbelieve factually uncontested proof.quotation omitted eaton broad,a copyright plaintiff can not base her opposition to summary judgment entirely on the hope that a fact finder will disbelieve the persons who have submitted affidavits on issues of access.matsushita,at.when the moving party has carried its burden under rule c,its opponent must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.footnote omitted.
second,in the absence of affirmative evidence rebutting mgm chain of events,plaintiffs claim that inconsistencies in mgm evidence by themselves create a genuine issue of material fact.they note,for example,that mgm executives disliked the world is not enough but liked this game we play in early february.the different reactions,plaintiffs urge,show that the two songs were not substantially similar on february,and show that arnold must have copied this game we play after february,because the songs are substantially similar today.too many competing inferences,however,separate this premise from plaintiffs proposed conclusion.fogerty and crow neglect to mention that mgm executives listened to each song for different arnold case to determine if the song would work for the new bond film,in plaintiffs case to see if their song would work for another film.because the mgm executives listened to each song in different musical,artistic and commercial one solicited for the bond movie and the other unsolicited and at most considered for another theory of infringement is too speculative to warrant a jury trial on its own.
fogerty and crow next scrutinize arnold and black testimony.arnold declaration indicates that he made an initial demonstration recording of the the world is not enough on january.black declaration,however,indicates that he made a recording with arnold in november or december.neither version of events,however,places creation of the demo recording after february.a factfinder could believe arnold it could believe black or it could believe parts of each individual testimony.but it could not rationally come to the conclusion that the recording was made after february,especially in light of plaintiffs inability to refute the delivery of a recording of the song to manson at the royal garden hotel on january.
fogerty and crow point to one other alleged discrepancy between arnold and black testimony that deserves mention.posturing as someone working with james horner,the composer of the titanic sound track,crow contacted don black by phone and asked whether black would be interested in writing the song lyrics for the film oceans.during the conversation,crow asked black questions about the world is not enough,including when he received the song to write the lyrics.black,who later explained that he was try
