facts procedural history 
feltner is the sole shareholder of krypton international corporation,a holding company that owns all of the stock in defendant krypton broadcasting corporation kbc.kbc,in turn,owns three television stations in the southeast,which were also named as defendants in this action in,each of the three stations licensed television programs from columbia,either directly,or by assuming the rights and obligations under contracts with former station owners.the licensed programs include the four series at issue in this litigation who the boss silver spoons hart to hart and hooker.
in,the stations failed to make timely licensing payments and columbia terminated the licensing agreements.when the stations nonetheless continued to air the series,columbia filed the present action in federal district court alleging various claims against the defendants,including copyright infringement.during the course of the litigation,columbia dismissed all claims against all defendants with the exception of the copyright claims against feltner.on september,the district court granted partial summary judgment in favor of columbia,finding feltner vicariously and contributorily liable for the copyright infringement committed by the defendant stations.
on january,feltner sought leave to file a motion to vacate the order granting partial summary judgment in favor of columbia.in the motion to vacate,feltner asserted that columbia was not the exclusive licensee of the series in question at the time columbia filed the lawsuit,and that therefore,columbia lacked standing under the copyright act.the district court denied feltner request for leave to file the motion to vacate and did not address the merits of feltner standing argument.
columbia elected to recover statutory damages in lieu of actual damages pursuant to c of the copyright act,which permits an award of statutory damages for all infringements involved in the action,with respect to any one work.a emphasis added.although feltner requested a jury trial on the issue of statutory damages,the district court denied the request.proceeding with a bench trial,the district court found as a matter of law that each episode of each series was a separate work for purposes of computing statutory damages the district court also found that each airing of the same episode by a different station constituted a separate act of infringement.finally,the district court found that feltner infringement was willful.based on these findings,the district court determined that feltner infringed separate works,and on april,the district court entered judgment against feltner in the amount of.the district court also granted a motion by columbia for attorneys fees and costs incurred through april.
a prior panel of this court generally affirmed the district court rulings,columbia pictures television krypton broadcasting of birmingham,cir but the supreme court reversed.the supreme court held that the seventh amendment guarantees feltner the right to a jury trial on all issues pertinent to an award of statutory damages under c of the copyright act,including the amount itself.feltner columbia pictures television,d.
following the supreme court ruling,we remanded the case to the district court for a jury trial on the sole question of the amount of money to award columbia,within the range permitted by the statutory damages provision of the copyright act,for each of the works that feltner infringed.columbia pictures television krypton broadcasting of birmingham,cir.the jury ultimately returned a million verdict for columbia.this verdict is equivalent to an award of for each of the works infringed,which is within the statutory damages range for willful infringement.the district court entered judgment against feltner on april.
shortly after judgment was entered,columbia filed a motion for attorneys fees and a motion for an order certifying the judgment against feltner for registration in another jurisdiction.in addition,feltner filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or for a new trial.the district court granted columbia motion to certify the judgment,denied columbia motion for attorneys fees,and denied feltner motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or for a new trial.this appeal followed.
discussiona.feltner appeal from the jury verdict 
feltner first appeals from the jury million verdict in favor of columbia.specifically,feltner asserts that a new trial is warranted because the district court erred in denying his motion in limine to dismiss the suit because columbia lacks standing under the copyright act denying his motion in limine to preclude a jury trial on statutory damages granting columbia motion in limine to reaffirm the district court prior ruling that feltner infringed separate works ruling as a matter of law that the two stations that aired who the boss were not joint tortfeasors for purposes of calculating statutory damages and denying feltner new trial motion.we address each of these arguments in turn.
feltner motion to dismiss for lack of standing 
feltner asserts that the district court erred in denying his motion in limine to dismiss the suit for lack of standing under the copyright act.a prior panel of this court already held that feltner failed to timely raise this issue in opposition to a motion for summary judgment,and that feltner failed to satisfy the requirements for a motion for reconsideration.columbia pictures,at.in light of this prior ruling,the law of the case doctrine bars reconsideration of the issue whether columbia standing as an exclusive licensee is properly before the court.see jeffries wood,cir en banc milgard tempering,selas of,cir.
feltner motion to preclude a jury trial on statutory damages 
feltner also asserts that the district court erred in denying his motion in limine to preclude a jury trial on the issue of statutory damages.here,feltner argues that in holding that the statutory damages provision of the copyright act violates the seventh amendment,the supreme court effectively found that the statutory damages provision of the copyright act is unconstitutional in its entirety.feltner thus urges us to find that the supreme court decision in this case rendered the statutory damages provision of the copyright act constitutionally unenforceable.
this argument is not persuasive.what the supreme court held is that to the extent c fails to provide a jury trial right,it violates the seventh amendment and is therefore unconstitutional.however,this holding in no way implies that copyright plaintiffs are no longer able to seek statutory damages under the copyright act.indeed,the position urged by feltner is contrary to the express language of the supreme court decision in this case.as the feltner court stated,if a party so demands,a jury must determine the actual amount of statutory damages under c feltner,at.the court later reaffirmed this point by stating,the seventh amendment provides a right to a jury trial on all issues pertaining to an award of statutory damages under c of the copyright act,including the amount itself.id.this language evinces the court intent to preserve a plaintiff ability to seek statutory damages under c of the copyright act.
feltner argues that this interpretation of the supreme court decision amounts to an impermissible rewriting of c.according to feltner,if the court finds that c is constitutionally infirm because it fails to provide for a jury trial,then the court must strike down c in its entirety and wait for congress to c with a jury trial provision included.this argument fails to understand the supreme court holding in this case.in feltner,the supreme court held that c provides a remedy for copyright infringement,and the seventh amendment provides a right to a jury trial when that remedy is at issue.this holding is consistent with the supreme court interpretation of other federal statutes that provide a remedy but similarly fail to provide for a jury trial.see,tull united states,d regarding civil penalties under the clean water act curtis loether,d holding that although it is not clear whether section of the civil rights act of provides for a jury trial,a jury trial is provided by the seventh amendment.
this interpretation is also consistent with nimmer reading of the supreme court decision in feltner.according to nimmer 
eight justices of the supreme court have now determined that congress did not allow for juries to be appointed under section a,which is therefore unconstitutional one might therefore conclude that an award of statutory damages can not ever be invoked against a defendant who demands her right to a jury trial but in the world of the seventh amendment,a finding that a statute is unconstitutional typically does not render it inoperative.whenever the supreme court has determined that the particular statute under examination does not accord the right to a jury but the seventh amendment so requires in that type of case,the same pattern recurs notwithstanding that the court holds the enactment of congress unconstitutional,the statute itself goes on functioning.

finally,we note that since the supreme court ruling in feltner,various courts have conducted jury trials on the issue of statutory damages.see,yurman design,paj,d,stating that i t is worth noting that the question of statutory damages was put to the jury,rather than decided by the court,given the supreme court decision in feltner segrets,gillman knitwear,cir remanding for a jury trial following supreme court ruling in feltner.
therefore,we find that the supreme court decision in feltner did not eliminate c of the copyright act,and we affirm the district court denial of feltner motion to preclude a jury trial on statutory damages.
columbia motion to reaffirm that feltner infringed works 
feltner next argues that the district court erred in granting columbia motion in limine to reaffirm the district court prior ruling that each episode aired by feltner is a separate work for purposes of computing statutory damages.copyright act c permits the copyright owner to recover an award of statutory damages for all infringements involved in the action,with respect to any one work,for which any one infringer is liable individually,or for which any two or more infringers are liable jointly and severally.c emphasis added.in addition,c states that all the parts of a compilation or derivative work constitutes one work.id.emphasis added.thus,under the copyright act,each work infringed may form the basis of one award.columbia pictures,at emphasis added.
although the copyright act does not define the term work,every circuit to address the issue has held that separate copyrights are not distinct works unless they can live their own copyright life.walt disney powell,quoting robert stigwood group,cir.as applied to episodes of a television series,this test requires us to determine whether each episode has an independent economic value and is,in itself,viable.gamma audio video,cir citing walt disney,at.we adopted this test for what constitutes a work in a prior appeal of this case.columbia pictures,at.
in this appeal,feltner argues that in light of the supreme court ruling,the issue whether each episode constitutes a separate work is a question of fact for the jury to decide,and that because this issue was not presented to the jury,he is entitled to a new trial.although there may be a case in which the issue of what constitutes a work is a jury question,we need not address that issue at this time.in the present action,the question whether each episode of a television series is a separate work is a question of law because there are no underlying factual disputes for the jury to resolve.segrets,at stating that the supreme court decision in feltner does not require that issues properly decided on summary judgment be remanded to a jury.as the district court explained in granting columbia motion to reaffirm its prior ruling that feltner infringed works 
the facts which underlie the determination of the number of infringements are not disputed there are no factual disputes on this issue for the jury to decide.the prior ruling was made by the court as a matter of law,since there were no factual issues the ninth circuit noted that the court made this finding.the ninth circuit went on to affirm this court determination that each episode in a television series constitutes a separate work this holding was not certified by the supreme court,and was not affected by the supreme court opinion,and thus remains the law of the case.
because t here are no factual disputes for the jury to decide,our prior ruling on this issue was not disturbed by the supreme court decision in this case.accordingly,the law of the case doctrine bars reconsideration of the question whether each episode constitutes a separate work for purposes of computing statutory damages.see jeffries,at milgard,at.the district court ruling on this issue is therefore affirmed.
feltner appeal of the district court ruling that the two stations that aired who the boss were not joint tortfeasors 
feltner next argues that the district court erred by allowing two awards of statutory damages for one work under copyright act c.specifically,feltner asserts that he is entitled to introduce evidence that the two defendant stations that aired who the boss are joint tortfeasors,and that therefore,each station airing of the same episode should only count as one work.this argument is not persuasive for two reasons.first,there is no evidence in the record to suggest that the stations are joint tortfeasors.second,to the extent that feltner seeks to introduce evidence to demonstrate his connection with each of the stations,that simply makes feltner a joint tortfeasor with each does not make each station a joint tortfeasor with respect to the other.columbia pictures,at.this district court decision on this issue is therefore affirmed.
feltner new trial motion 
feltner also argues that the district court erred in denying his new trial motion.specifically,feltner argues that a new trial is warranted because the jury verdict was excessive and the district court erred in excluding certain evidence.we review a district court denial of a motion for a new trial for an abuse of discretion.scott ross,cir.
excessive verdict 
feltner first asserts that the jury verdict in this case was excessive.as set forth above,the copyright act provides a plaintiff the option of electing either statutory damages or actual damages.a.in this case,columbia elected to seek statutory damages.a plaintiff may elect statutory damages regardless of the adequacy of the evidence offered as to his actual damages and the amount of the defendant profits.nimmer,supra,a.if statutory damages are elected,t he court has wide discretion in determining the amount of statutory damages to be awarded,constrained only by the specified maxima and minima.peer int l pausa records,cir quoting harris emus records,cir.subject to certain exceptions,at the time this case was tried to a jury,the statutory minimum was and the maximum was.c.in the case of willful infringement,however,the maximum amount per work infringed was id.at c.we will uphold a jury finding of willful infringement if it is supported by substantial evidence.transgo,ajac transmission parts,cir.
here,the district court initially held a bench trial and found that feltner was liable for million in statutory damages for infringing works.this award amounts to approximately per work infringed.that award was vacated,however,after the
