we confront one of the knottiest problems in copyright jurisprudence whether a case involving interdependent copyright and contract claims arises under the federal copyright laws for the purposes of a.melville nimmer david nimmer,nimmer on copyrights a,at.the complaint before us essentially alleges copyright infringement for the sole purpose of obtaining a determination of ownership.because questions regarding the ownership of a copyright are governed by state law,we determine that subject matter jurisdiction is lacking and affirm.
facts and procedural history 
in,appellant fox broadcasting fox entered into a contract with appellee scholastic entertainment,scholastic.pursuant to the contract,scholastic,which is a producer and marketer of motion picture,television,and video programming based on children literary works,agreed to produce a television series based on the goosebumps children books and to license the rights to exhibit and distribute the shows to fox.fox was to air the initial exhibition of the shows on fox broadcasting and later distribute the series to other television outlets for a period of years.in addition to the original exhibition fees,scholastic was entitled to a portion of the profits made during the distribution phase.by its terms,the contract will expire in.
for several years the parties performed their responsibilities under the contract without conflict.scholastic produced programs and six specials for which fox paid an initial exhibition fee of approximately million.in,however,scholastic learned that the fox family channel ffc,which was not a party to the contract,was airing the goosebumps series.scholastic received no compensation for these airings,which continued through august of.
scholastic confronted fox,claiming that it was owed at least million as a result of the ffc airings because they constituted a distribution under the agreement.in contrast,fox asserted that the ffc airings were exhibitions and,therefore,scholastic was not entitled to additional licensing fees.after attempting to resolve the disagreement for over a year,scholastic filed suit in state court for breach of contract and fiduciary duty.
discovery in the state court proceeding commenced.as a result,scholastic learned that fox had given ffc an irrevocable license to exhibit,and to permit others to exhibit,the goosebumps series for a cost of per episode and per special.as a result,scholastic claims it was deprived of the benefit of the original agreement between itself and fox.according to scholastic,this unauthorized licensing frustrated the entire purpose of the agreement because the fox airings alone were not intended to comprise scholastic total compensation for the production of the series.instead,scholastic was dependent on the good faith efforts of fox to distribute the series to other outlets at market prices.presumably,the price paid by ffc was not the price that would have prevailed had ffc been unrelated to fox.
upon ascertaining the extent of fox violation,scholastic sent a letter to fox terminating the agreement in september and informed fox that it was contemplating the goosebumps series to third parties.fox rejected the notion that scholastic was entitled to terminate the contract.
scholastic then filed suit in district court claiming that the agreement had been effectively terminated and that the ongoing use of the goosebumps series by fox and ffc constituted copyright infringement.fox counterclaimed,alleging that the contract was still in effect and requesting that the district court enjoin scholastic from licensing the agreement to third parties.the district court dismissed scholastic claims without prejudice and granted fox request for a preliminary injunction enjoining scholastic from the agreement.
the district court plainly concluded that the underlying dispute between scholastic and fox was the agreement had been effectively,therefore,suitable for adjudication in state court.scholastic did not appeal the dismissal,evidently content to litigate in state court what it believed,consistent with the district court dismissal,to be a question of contract law.furthermore,scholastic stipulated that it would forego any attempt to relicense the goosebumps series until a determination of ownership is made.
approximately four months later,the district court sua sponte dismissed fox counterclaims.in doing so,the district court refused to address the for summary judgment or other substantive matters,determining them to be moot as a result of the dismissal.that the dismissal was based on a lack of subject matter jurisdiction becomes clear in light of the district court statement this is a contract case.it a contract case simply and the state court can decide it.
in summary,scholastic and fox entered into a contract,the subject matter of which was the copyright protected television series goosebumps.upon learning of material breaches by fox as a result of the ffc airings,scholastic terminated the agreement.scholastic termination,if effective,would cause the reversion of all ownership rights to scholastic,rendering fox continuing use of the series copyright infringement.fox,on the other hand,claims that the contract is still in effect and that,pursuant to the agreement,it alone has the right to exhibit and distribute the series.because scholastic has stipulated that it will not relicense the goosebumps series until a determination is made as to the status of the agreement,however,scholastic can not be guilty of copyright infringement.therefore,this case hinges entirely on whether scholastic attempt to terminate the agreement was successful.it is important to note that this court now considers only the dismissal of fox counterclaims,as scholastic chose not to appeal the dismissal of its claims but instead submitted a refashioned complaint encompassing only the contractual issue to the state court.
fox asserts on appeal that the district court erred in dismissing its counterclaims.specifically,fox alleges that the sua sponte dismissal violated its due process rights the district court had subject matter jurisdiction and it is entitled to summary judgment.

ii.subject matter jurisdiction 
the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over any civil action arising under any act of congress relating to copyrights.at the same time,it is well established that just because a case involves a copyright does not mean that federal subject matter jurisdiction exists.vestron,at.federal courts have consistently dismissed complaints in copyright cases presenting only questions of contract law.dolch united california bank,cir.as a result,the federal courts walk a fine line between usurping the power of the state courts and providing redress for copyright infringement.this balancing act is further complicated by the interdependence of contract and copyright claims,which can camouflage the genuine issues to be resolved.see,vestron,at.
