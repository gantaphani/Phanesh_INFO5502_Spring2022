in,printex discovered shirts bearing the aeropostale trademark and a design similar to.according to jae nah,the president of printex,the only difference between and the design on the aeropostale shirts is that the latter was printed using cruder,techniques and machinery.aeropostale placed orders with bubbles for the shirts in june of,and it offered for sale and sold the shirts between september and december of.the tags on the shirts say made in china.bubbles,however,stated that it had no understanding or information about the party that created the design resembling.
on april,printex sued defendants for infringement of its copyright in.after bringing this infringement action,printex became aware that its copyright registration for small flower group a contained an error.two of the five designs,but not,had been published before the july,date of registration.on february,printex filed an application for supplementary registration to add april,as the date of first publication for small flower group printex thereafter contacted the copyright office to ask about its registration of a single unpublished work that contained both published and unpublished designs.the copyright office told printex that the unpublished designs,including,would retain copyright protection but that the previously published designs would not.on may,printex filed a second application for supplementary registration to remove the two previously published designs from small flower group on june,the copyright office approved printex application and issued a certificate of supplementary registration for small flower group a it states february,as the effective date of supplementary registration.
printex and defendants filed for summary judgment.the district court granted defendants motion for summary judgment and denied printex motion,holding that there was no genuine issue of material fact as to defendants access to or substantial similarity between the allegedly infringing design on the aeropostale shirts and.the district court did not address defendants alternative argument that printex copyright registration was invalid because of the two previously published designs that were initially included in small flower group defendants then moved for attorneys fees,and the district court granted their motion.printex timely appealed to this court.
we have jurisdiction under.we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.ellison robertson,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a ellison,at.a genuine dispute is one that could reasonably be resolved in favor of either party.see ellison,at.
to establish copyright infringement,a plaintiff must prove two elements ownership of a valid copyright,and copying of constituent elements of the work that are original.feist publ ns,rural.serv.
the district court granted summary judgment for defendants because it concluded that there was no genuine issue of material fact as to the second element,defendants copying of original elements of.
because direct evidence of copying is not available in most cases,a plaintiff can establish copying by showing that the defendant had access to the plaintiff work and that the two works are substantially similar.smith jackson,cir.printex offered no direct evidence that defendants copied.to survive summary judgment,it had to show a genuine issue of material fact as to both access and substantial similarity.printex contends that the district court erred in holding that there was no genuine issue as to either access or substantial similarity.we agree.
proof of access requires an opportunity to view or to copy plaintiff work.three boys music bolton,cir quoting sid marty krofft television,mcdonald,cir.to prove access,a plaintiff must show a reasonable possibility,not merely a bare possibility,that an alleged infringer had the chance to view the protected work.art attacks ink,llc mga entm t,cir.absent direct evidence of access,a plaintiff can prove access using circumstantial evidence of either a chain of events linking the plaintiff work and the defendant access,or widespread dissemination of the plaintiff work.three boys music,at.
printex seeks to prove access by showing that was widely disseminated.the district court held that there was no genuine issue of material fact as to defendants access because,it found,the only evidence of widespread dissemination was jae nah declaration stating that printex first sold in october of and that printex produced and sold thousands of yards of fabric bearing design number to numerous customers from.the district court concluded that such vague and conclusory statements certainly create no more than a bare possibility that defendants may have had access to plaintiff design number and that a bare possibility is insufficient to create a genuine issue on access.
however,nah declaration statements were not the only evidence of widespread dissemination.the record also contained a printout,attached as an exhibit to nah declaration,entitled sales by item detail for the period from january,through august.the printout is a list of invoices for and shows,for each invoice,the date,invoice number,brief description,customer name,quantity,and dollar amount.only fabric sold before defendants alleged infringement is relevant.the sales records show that printex sold more than yards of through may of,before aeropostale june orders for the allegedly infringing shirts 
we must decide whether printex sale of more than yards of fabric bearing creates a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether was widely disseminated.we conclude that it does.
the evidence required to show widespread dissemination will vary from case to case.in three boys music bolton,the plaintiffs argued that their that did not even make the top for a single week and was not released on an album or cd before the defendants created their allegedly infringing been widely disseminated during the defendants teenage years.at.they offered the testimony of three disc jockeys regarding the song airtime on radio and television.id.we upheld the jury finding of access d espite the weaknesses of the plaintiffs theory of reasonable access but indicated that we might not have reach ed the same conclusion as the jury regarding access.id.at.in rice fox broadcasting,we stated that because the plaintiff video only sold approximately copies between and,it could not be considered widely disseminated,cir.in art attacks ink,llc mga entertainment,inc,we held that the plaintiff had not widely disseminated its designs,even though the designs were displayed at fair booths and kiosks,on persons wearing the,and on the internet.at.noting,among other things,that the plaintiff sold only bearing the designs per year,we held,a reasonable jury could not have concluded that there was more than a bare possibility that the defendant had access to the plaintiff designs,and affirmed the district court grant of summary judgment for the defendant.id.at.
the circumstances here differ from those of our prior cases,and so those cases,though instructive,are not dispositive.in rice,the dissemination occurred worldwide,over a period.at.in art attacks ink,the respective parties sold different goods,and dolls.at.in contrast,printex and bubbles operate in the same industry in the same los angeles area.printex,a fabric printing company,sold more than yards of fabric bearing to fabric converters.it is a reasonable inference that many or most of these purchasers were in the los angeles area.apparel vendors like bubbles purchase fabric from fabric printing companies and fabric converters.in addition,the dissemination of occurred over a period immediately preceding defendants alleged infringement.a reasonable jury could find that was widely disseminated in the los fabric industry,and hence that there was a reasonable possibility that defendants had an opportunity to view and copy printex design.see art attacks ink,at three boys music,at see also peel rug,cir holding that plaintiff rug wholesaler had raised genuine issue as to whether its designer rug was widely disseminated among those involved in the united states rug trade.we hold that printex raised a genuine dispute of material fact on access.
to determine whether two works are substantially similar,we apply a test.smith,at.the extrinsic test is an objective comparison of specific expressive elements it focuses on the articulable similarities between the two works.cavalier random house,cir quoting krofft,at.the intrinsic test is a subjective comparison that focuses on whether the ordinary,reasonable audience would find the works substantially similar in the total concept and feel of the works.id.quoting kouf walt disney pictures television,cir.
summary judgment is not highly favored on questions of substantial similarity in copyright cases.shaw lindheim,cir quoting narell freeman,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the court can conclude,after viewing the evidence and drawing inferences in a manner most favorable to the party,that no reasonable juror could find substantial similarity of ideas and expression.id.quoting narell,at.where reasonable minds could differ on the issue of substantial similarity,however,summary judgment is improper.id.
the district court compared the copy of that printex deposited with the copyright office to defendants allegedly infringing shirts and concluded that no reasonable juror could find that the two works are substantially similar.the district court reasoned that the observable similarities between the designs were of a surface nature only,in that both designs represent overall floral patterns of approximately the same size.the district court then stressed several critical differences between the designs the flowers,stems,and leaves on are far more detailed than those on the allegedly infringing shirts,which have softer edges and are more impressionistic in appearance on,multiple shades of one color are used to give the flowers their definition and sharper edges,while multiple shades of green are used to give the leaves and stems their definition and clean lines,but on the allegedly infringing shirts,by contrast,the flowers are of one uniform color,with the leaves and stem a single shade of green contains an overall background pattern of almost flowers that is completely lacking on the allegedly infringing shirts and the groupings of flowers,stems,and leaves within a vertical row are spaced much farther apart on than on the allegedly infringing shirts.
notwithstanding these observations by the district court,our comparison of and defendants allegedly infringing design leads us to conclude that a reasonable juror could find that the two designs are substantially similar.
first,we apply the extrinsic test.because copyright law protects expression of ideas,not ideas themselves,we distinguish protectible from unprotectible elements and ask only whether the protectible elements in two works are substantially similar.see cavalier,at.in comparing fabric designs,we examine the similarities in their objective details in appearance,including,but not limited to,the subject matter,shapes,colors,materials,and arrangement of the representations.see id.at comparing art works.
original selection,coordination,and arrangement of unprotectible elements may be protectible expression.see feist publ ns,at cavalier,at metcalf bochco,cir each note in a scale,for example,is not protectable,but a pattern of notes in a tune may earn copyright protection.for this reason,the second circuit has rejected the argument that,in comparing fabric designs for copyright infringement,a court must dissect them into their separate components,and compare only those elements which are in themselves copyrightable.knitwaves,lollytogs,cir i f we took this argument to its logical conclusion,we might have to decide that there can be no originality in a painting because all colors of paint have been used somewhere in the past.internal quotation marks omitted.in knitwaves,lollytogs,the court concluded that the defendant leaf and squirrel sweaters were substantially similar to the plaintiff sweaters,citing,among other things,the defendant selection of the same two fall symbols,leaves and squirrels,and its arrangement of the symbols as felt appliques stitched to the sweaters surface,on strikingly similar backgrounds,and in virtually the same color scheme.id.at.similarly,in hamil america,gfi,the second circuit held that the defendant and plaintiff floral patterns were substantially similar because gfi ha d duplicated hamil america selection of clustered flowers and leaves,its coordination of these elements in particular spatial combinations,and its arrangement of these design elements on a tossed pattern that appears in repeat,cir.more specifically 
both patterns depict small clusters of flowers and leaves.the shapes of the flower petals and the leaves are virtually identical,and feature similar defining line work and highlights in the flowers and leaves.both patterns depict leaves that do not appear to be attached to any of the flowers.both patterns are tossed,which means that they have no top or bottom and are,and appear in repeat.
though the second circuit ordinary observer and more discerning ordinary observer tests differ somewhat from our test for substantial similarity its reasoning,at least in the context of fabric designs,is persuasive,and it guides our comparison of the designs in this case.is a repeating pattern of bouquets of flowers and branches the idea of a floral pattern depicting bouquets and branches is not protectible,and has elements that are not protectible,for example the combination of open flowers and closed buds in a single bouquet or the green color of stems and leaves.see satava lowry,cir however,printex original selection,coordination,and arrangement of such elements is protectible.see feist publ ns,at metcalf,at.because there is a wide range of expression for selecting,coordinating,and arranging floral elements in stylized fabric designs,copyright protection is broad and a work will infringe if it substantially similar to the copyrighted work.mattel,mga entm t,cir.that is,there are gazillions of ways to combine petals,buds,stems,leaves,and colors in floral designs on fabric,in contrast to the limited number of ways to,for example,paint a red bouncy ball on black canvas or make a lifelike jellyfish sculpture.see satava,at.
our comparison of defendants allegedly infringing design and reveals objective similarities in protectible elements.both patterns feature two types of small bouquets of flowers,one featuring the largest flower in profile view,the other featuring the largest flower in an view,and both emerging from three buds.both patterns also depict small,branches interspersed between the two types of bouquets.the shape and number of the flower petals and leaves are similar in the two designs.see hamil,at.the two types of bouquets are arranged at similar angles in both designs,and the bouquets and branches ar
