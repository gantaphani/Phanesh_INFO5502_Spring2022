appellant atkins brought this action against alleging copyright infringement in the commercial use of carrier and bottle designs for a product called redneck beer,along with a claim for violation of the lanham act.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of appellees.because we find that there are substantial issues of material fact,we vacate the judgments in favor of defendants,and remand for further proceedings.
appellant atkins is the sole proprietor of leslie atkins communications,an advertising,marketing,and public relations firm.atkins offers services aimed at developing brand identities for products in various businesses.appellee fischer is president of the fischer organization,a real estate firm.in or,he originated the concept of a product called redneck beer.fischer contacted several brewing companies in an effort to find a means of producing and marketing his proposed product.he was unsuccessful at first.
fischer then decided that he would attend a beer convention in las vegas in hopes of finding a joint venture partner or a manufacturing partner with whom he could arrange to produce and market redneck beer.fischer contacted several graphic artists in hopes of obtaining rough preliminary sketches or drawings of a potential packaging design for redneck beer to use as a sales tool at the convention.
fischer ultimately entered into an agreement with atkins by which atkins would create designs for redneck beer.the parties executed two formal agreements,a project order agreement and a terms conditions agreement on september.under the terms of the project order agreement,fischer and atkins agreed to two stages of work stage one involved the production of two color illustrations or paintings,one of a bottle of redneck beer and one of a sixpack carrier,with an artist rendering of logo labels stage two involved final logo development and production of art.the fees for the two stages of work were and,respectively.both parties understood that neither party was obligated to proceed with the second stage of the agreement.the terms and conditions agreement contained the following provision ownership and possession of all underlying creative work developed and supplied by leslie atkins communications shall remain the exclusive property of leslie atkins communications creative work includes,but is not limited to,sketches,copy,photographs,illustrations,type,and mechanical art boards.atkins testified at deposition that she believed that this provision allowed her to retain her rights to her creative work and to set a price for use of that creative work.atkins also testified that she charged fischer less than she otherwise would have,with the understanding that she would be able to obtain royalties for the use of her work.
following the execution of the agreements,atkins subcontracted with a graphic artist,tom gaadt,to prepare initial sketches of possible redneck beer designs.under atkins direction,gaadt produced several preliminary sketches bearing hillbilly or design elements suggestive of the beer redneck name.atkins fischer,civ,slip op.at.atkins showed these sketches to fischer,and fischer selected a design featuring a red bandana at the bottle neck and a body label of a blue jeans pocket with a red bandana hanging from the pocket.gaadt produced new illustrations of the selected design.on september,shortly before fischer left for the las vegas convention,atkins delivered the new illustrations to fischer.on the date of delivery,appellant sent a note to appellees that stated i glad we finally going to design a look for red neck beer.
after returning from the convention,fischer requested that atkins make some modifications to the design,including the addition of some colors and a tab label on the blue jean pocket with fischer printed on it.atkins had these modifications made and delivered the revised illustrations to fischer on october.fischer paid atkins in full for the first phase of the contract.
the second phase of the contract was never reached because fischer declared that he was unhappy with atkins designs.in january of,appellee fischer brewing company was incorporated in washington,dc.by march of,appellees had engaged a number of different advertising firms to work on designs for the redneck beer bottle label and carrier.on march,appellees entered into a manufacturing services agreement with the stroh brewing company.a provision in the agreement with stroh required fischer brewing to warrant that it was the exclusive owner or licensee of all trademarks and copyrights which it would use and authorize stroh to use in manufacturing and marketing the product.on advice from counsel,fischer sought execution of a agreement by atkins.atkins refused to sign the agreement.on april,atkins filed a copyright registration for her designs.
by august of,fischer and fischer brewing company had registered the name redneck with the patent and trademark office and had begun selling and distributing redneck beer.they marketed redneck beer with labels and containers bearing designs by art advertising,that were marked by a label and placed in carriers featuring a design of a blue jeans pocket and a red bandana.
in march of,atkins filed a complaint against appellees,alleging copyright infringement and false designation of origin under section a of the lanham act,a.appellees filed an answer that included several affirmative defenses.over two years later and after the close of discovery,in december of,appellees moved to amend their answer and assert an additional license.the district court granted the motion and reopened discovery.atkins thereafter filed a motion for summary judgment.
on november,the district court denied atkins motion for summary judgment and sua sponte granted summary judgment for appellees.the court concluded that appellees had an implied nonexclusive license to use atkins work in the commercial production of redneck beer.the court also held that the carrier design appellees actually used was not substantially similar to atkins designs.in addition,the court,without explanation,dismissed atkins lanham act claim.atkins appealed,arguing,among other things,that the district court erred in holding that appellees had an implied license to use atkins work in the commercial production of redneck beer that the district court erred in concluding that the carrier design used by appellees was not substantially similar to atkins carrier design and that the district court erred in dismissing the lanham act claim.

the only disputed issue in this phase of the case is whether atkins intended fischer to copy and distribute her work.atkins acknowledges that she delivered her designs to fischer before the las vegas beer convention with the intent that fischer would use her designs as a sales tool at the convention,but she argues that fischer actions in marketing the product thereafter exceed the scope of his license to use the designs.maclean,cir t he licensor can still bring suit for copyright infringement if the licensee use goes beyond the scope of the nonexclusive license.atkins argues that she did not intend for fischer to use her designs as anything more than a sales tool at the convention and that,at a minimum,a genuine issue of material fact exists with regard to the inten
