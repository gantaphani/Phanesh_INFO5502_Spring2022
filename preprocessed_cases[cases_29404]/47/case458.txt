in this copyright infringement case,the plaintiff claimed copyright protection of a factual,the selection,order,and arrangement of information about yachts listed for a vis the defendants competing factual compilation,which came onto the scene after the plaintiff had obtained certificates of copyright registration.the case was tried to a jury,which found for the plaintiff.the defendants now appeal they raise several issues,among them whether the court erred in instructing the jury that it could find copyright infringement if there were substantial similarities between the original elements of the plaintiff compilation and corresponding elements of the defendants compilation.according to the defendants,the court should have required the plaintiff to prove that the allegedly infringing elements were virtually identical to the plaintiff original elements.
we find no error in the district court substantial similarities instructions or in any of the other issues the defendants raise.we therefore affirm the district court judgment.
buc international corporation buc was founded in and publishes the buc used boat price guide.the buc used boat price guide lists recreational boats and yachts along with their market values.walter sullivan sullivan,the president of buc,joined the company shortly after it was founded and became its president in by the,buc developed a computer network and software application called buc marine sales charter network bucnet service or bucnet.
bucnet service was designed to create a centralized directory of yacht listings so that brokers could more easily access industry information.before bucnet service came along,yacht brokers and boat dealers with central listing typically shared information with other brokers by mailing or faxing descriptions of their listings to each other.there was no uniformity in these listings the yacht brokers prepared them according to their own individual methods and tastes.with the advent of bucnet service,brokers could share,compare,search and track the status of vessel listings on a computer,in lieu of sending listings to fellow brokers.brokers gained access to bucnet service by entering into a license agreement with buc when licensed,a broker obtained bucnet software and a password that enabled the broker to log on to buc database and view,print,search and copy its listings.the vessel listings in the bucnet database were not available to the public only bucnet licensees had access to these compilations.bucnet was thus a multiple listing mls,as opposed to a primarily website available to the public at large.
buc success with bucnet service was not instantaneous.it took three to four years for buc to develop the first version of the bucnet program and to reach a critical mass of licensed brokers and vessel listings.to facilitate the presentation of information on bucnet,sullivan developed the standard listing form and format.a licensed broker used this schema in submitting information about a yacht unless some other arrangement would better portray the vessel at hand,in which case the broker would modify the bucnet format.of the thousands of vessels bucnet listed when this case came to trial,more than percent were listed under the standard listing form and format.
sullivan selected and arranged the format section headings that appeared on the computer screen in,he registered in buc name a copyright in the compilation,selection and organization of the bucnet database,the centralized directory of yacht listings,and obtained a certificate of copyright registration from the register of copyrights.sullivan thereafter renewed buc copyright registration in the bucnet database annually.in some years,buc obtained or renewed several certificates of registration.in,the words and text of vessel listings were appended to the words compilation,selection and organization of the bucnet database.buc placed a copyright notice on each of the vessel listings appearing on bucnet 
in june of,florida yacht brokers association fyba and several other professional yacht broker associations collaborated to form international yacht council limited iyc one of the associations objectives in forming iyc was the creation of an online mls for yacht listings.the associations felt a need for a mls in addition to bucnet because,as one of iyc principal organizers explained,vessel listings were scattered all over the internet with no single reference resource to search all availabilities and central listings.
in february of,fyba,acting for the associations that would form iyc,published a request for proposal soliciting third parties to submit plans for developing and operating for iyc a mls on march,after considering several proposals,iyc entered into a contract with mls solutions,mls solutions to develop and manage iyc mls 
mls solutions developed a mls for iyc,somewhat similar to that of bucnet,that displayed a database of vessel listings.the iyc site was designed as a two part system one part included the mls database as a private site for brokerage business,and the other part operated as a public website vessel listings were placed on the iyc website by mls solutions.mls solutions received the listings from the brokers via email or fax.many of these brokers were bucnet licensees.in sending listings to mls solutions,these bucnet licensees would simply copy the listings they had submitted to buc,and mls solutions would,in turn,place them on the iyc website by january,brokers and salesmen numbering nearly had listed over boats on iyc mls.approximately of those listings were derived from bucnet listings.some of these were furnished by bucnet licensees.others were obtained by mls solutions staff who had acquired bucnet passwords from buc licensees.when buc realized how mls solutions was acquiring the listings it was posting on iyc website,buc started placing markers,a series of symbols and letters,in the middle of each listing.buc had programmed bucnet to enable it to determine the identity of the licensee who owned the password and when,the exact time the accessed bucnet and viewed a listing.when the listing later appeared on iyc mls,buc could locate the marker and identify the owner of the password.using these markers,buc discovered that iyc mls presented over listings which replicated bucnet listings these iyc listings bore not only the bucnet markers,but many also contained buc copyright notice.
on june,buc brought this lawsuit against iyc,mls solutions,and mls solutions president,william pazos,for copyright infringement,seeking injunctive relief and damages buc promptly moved the district court for a preliminary injunction,and on july,the court held an evidentiary hearing on the motion.four days later,the court ruled on the motion.buc int l int l yacht council,wl.july,order granting in part mot.for prelim.inj.
first,addressing the likelihood that buc would prevail on the merits,the court found that buc had valid copyrights in the compilation of the bucnet service database to the extent that listings in the database used descriptive words,and that the defendants had copied original elements of the compilation.id.at.second,the court found that absent an injunction,buc would likely sustain irreparable injury.id.at.third,balancing the equities,the court concluded that the injury buc would sustain if the defendants were not enjoined outweighed the harm an injunction would cause the defendants.id.fourth,the court found that an injunction would not be contrary to the public interest.id.the court therefore enjoined the defendants from copying descriptive expressions from buc mls listings and ordered the defendants to remove them from the iyc website.id.
after this injunctive order,the parties engaged in exhaustive discovery and amended their pleadings.the claims subsequently tried to a jury were framed as follows three counts against iyc for direct,vicarious,and contributory copyright infringement,respectively one count against mls solutions for contributory copyright infringement and one count against pazos for contributory copyright infringement.the defendants admitted that buc had obtained certificates of registration for the copyrights described in the complaint but denied the validity of those copyrights on the ground that nothing in the compilation,selection and organization of the database constituted an original work of authorship.the defendants also relied on several affirmative defenses which the district court submitted to the jury that they were entitled to use buc compilation under the fair use doctrine that they had an implied license from buc that buc had waived its right to copyright protection and that buc had unclean hands.in addition to asserting these defenses,the defendants filed counterclaims seeking a declaration that buc copyrights were invalid on grounds,among others,that nothing in the claimed copyrights constituted an original work of authorship.
the trial began on march.buc established the facts set out in part,supra,and rested.the defendants then moved for judgment as a matter of law.the district court denied their motion,and they proceeded to put on their defenses at the close of all the evidence,they again moved for judgments as a matter of law,and the court denied their motions.following closing argument,the court submitted the case to the jury on a charge that described the three means of copyright infringement direct,vicarious,and contributory spelled out buc burden of proof and stated the elements of the defendants affirmative defenses.on the parties stipulation,the jury received the following interrogatories,which we reproduce along with the jury answers

so say we all.
dated april,
the jury returned its verdicts on april.with these verdicts in hand,the district court promptly granted buc a permanent injunction against iyc and mls solutions and entered a declaratory judgment in favor of buc on the defendants counterclaims.the provisions of the permanent injunction mirrored those of the preliminary injunction iyc and mls solutions were enjoined from copying descriptions of yachts or features on yachts from buc listings,and from maintaining any copies of those listings on iyc website.after the verdict,the defendants,now iyc and mls solutions,renewed the motions for judgment as a matter of law they made at the close of all the evidence and alternatively moved for a new trial the court denied their motions and entered final judgment for buc against iyc and mls solutions,and for pazos,in conformance with its previous dispositive rulings.iyc and mls solutions then lodged this appeal.
iyc and mls solutions jointly assert the following arguments in their opening brief on appeal the district court erred in denying their motions for judgment as a matter of law the court erred in instructing the jury that,to establish its copyright infringement claims,buc had to prove that iyc listings were substantially similar to buc listings,whereas the court should have instructed the jury,in accordance with defense counsel request,that buc had to prove that iyc listings were virtually identical to buc listings the court erred in declaring that buc copyrights were valid the court abused its discretion in admitting buc evidence regarding the causation of actual damages and the court abused its discretion in charging the jury on statutory damages.we dispose of the fourth and fifth assertions in the margin and address the first three in the following text.
iyc and mls solutions contend that the district court should have granted their motions for judgment as a matter of law on the grounds that buc copyright registration in its compilation database did not extend protection to the individual vessel listings,buc failed to register a copyright in each listing buc work did not satisfy the definition of a compilation contained in because the material found on bucnet did not preexist the listings and buc compilation lacked originality.the problem appellants face is that the first two grounds were not cited in their motions for judgment as a matter of law made at the close of all the evidence.as a general rule,we do not consider issues not presented in the first instance to the trial court see,iraola cia,cir stating that a federal appellate court generally will not consider an issue that was not raised before the trial court.we adhere to that rule here.as for the third ground,only mls solutions preserved under rule b the argument that buc compilation lacked originality as a matter of law 
in evaluating the argument that buc compilation lacked originality,we commence with the basic tenets of copyright law the copyright act of extends protection to original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression.a.while the act protects original expression,it is well established that this protection does not extend to any underlying facts or ideas.see b feist publ ns,rural.serv,d.compilations of facts,however,may be copyrightable.see feist,at.at.in feist,the supreme court navigated the tension in the ambit of copyright protection for factual compilations compilations are afforded copyright protection,while facts themselves are not.at.at.originality,the court explained,mandates this legal distinction it is t he sine qua non of copyright,and means that the work was independently created by the author as opposed to copied from other works,and that it possesses at least some minimal degree of creativity.at.at.synthesizing these principles,the court held that a compiler selection,arrangement and coordination,if original,are the only protectable elements of a factual compilation.bellsouth adver.publ g donnelley info.publ g,cir en banc emphasis added citing feist,at.at.
what is sufficiently original to merit copyright protection for a factual compilation while originality is not a rigorous standard,the selection and arrangement of facts can not be so mechanical or routine as to require no creativity whatsoever.feist,at.at.in feist,the court held that the copyright holder selection,coordination,and arrangement of facts,its compilation,lacked the requisite originality because the copyright holder simply took data and arranged it alphabetically in its telephone white pages directory.id.neither the copyright holder selection of basic information about people applying for telephone service name,town and telephone number nor its alphabetical coordination and arrangement of that information was original.id.at.at.
similarly,in bellsouth advertising publishing donnelley information publishing,we applied the feist originality analysis to a copyright infringement action concerning a yellow pages classified business directory and held that the selection,coordination and arrangement of facts in the directory lacked the minimal degree of creativity necessary for copyright protection.at.in terms of selection,we distinguished between a creatively original selection of facts and the creative means used to discover those facts.id.at.while the former is protected as an original work of authorship,the latter,methods used to discover facts collect data,are not.id.we also held that an alphabetized list of business types,with individual businesses listed in alphabetical order under the applicable headings,was not an original coordination and arrangement of facts.id.at.a bedrock of these cases is the precise identification of what,if any,elements in the compiler selection,coordination and arrangement of facts are original.as we discuss infra,the standard for copyright infringement of factual compilations hinges on distinguishing original elements of creative authorship from components in the public domain.
turning now to the mechanics for bringing an infringement action,it is important to note that f or original works of authorship created after,copyright automatically inheres in the work at the moment it is created without regard to whether it is ever registered.montgomery noga,cir citing a arthur rutenberg homes,drew homes,cir melville nimmer david nimmer,nimmer on copyright a.while registration is not a condition of copyright protection,a,it is a prerequisite for bringing an action for copyright infringement.see a upon proper commencement of the copyright infringement action,the copyright holder must prove both ownership of a valid copyright,and copying of constituent elements of the work that are original.feist,at.at citation omitted.
mls solutions challenges the originality of buc compilation in three ways first,mls solutions contends that buc is not the owner of a valid copyright because the brokers were the real authors of the selection and arrangement of the section headings in the compilation,buc was not the origin of the selection and arrangement.second,assuming for the sake of argument that buc owned a valid copyright,mls solutions claims that the merger doctrine precludes protection for buc selection of section headings.finally,mls solutions argues that buc selection and arrangement of section headings lack the minimal creativity necessary to constitute an original work of authorship.we consider these points in order.
mls solutions first point is that the brokers,not buc,were the authors of the compilation because they had the option of using the bucnet standard format or manually selecting their own section headings and arrangement.this contention lacks merit because the evidence shows that the brokers modified the bucnet format for the section headings in only to of the listings referred to at mere two percent of listings.the effectively ability to alter the standard format in the selection and order of the section headings did not render the brokers authors of the compilation,nor did it destroy buc authorship in the compilation that it created and used in short,broker deviation from the bucnet format of section headings was de minimis,and the district court did not err in denying mls solutions motion for judgment as a matter of law on this ground.
second,mls solutions contends that buc selection of section headings does not survive application of the merger doctrine.the merger doctrine provides that expression is not protected in those instances where there is only one or so few ways of expressing an idea that protection of the expression would effectively accord protection to the idea itself.bellsouth,at citing kregos associated press,cir.as noted above,copyright normally protects the expression of ideas,but not the ideas themselves.see b.for example,the idea of hunting a formidable whale at the lead of an eccentric captain is not protected by copyright law.the expression of this idea as it is encapsulated in the novel,however,is protected by copyright 
the merger doctrine operates as an exception to the normal dichotomy.the doctrine holds that,when there are so few ways of expressing an idea,not even the expression is protected by copyright.to illustrate this point,imagine the symbol often used on public signs displaying a circle with a diagonal line crossed through it.when,for example,an image of a cigarette is centered in the middle of the circle with the line through it,this visual sign expresses the idea that smoking is not allowed.this same symbol is used in a wide variety of contexts to express that something is prohibited,no swimming,no food or drink,no cell phone.since there are effectively only a few ways of visually presenting the idea that an activity is not permitted,copyright law would not protect the expression in this case,the circle with the line through it.
here,mls solutions argues that there are so few ways of effectively describing a boat,that buc selection of section headings should not receive copyright protection.it claims that recognizing buc copyright in the selection of its section headings would be tantamount to buc owning the idea of dividing vessel listings by rooms,functional and aesthetic features of the vessel.in essence,mls solutions defines the idea at issue very narrowly organizing a vessel listing by using section headings that highlight rooms or other features of the boat.
the most recent version of buc section headings appearing on bucnet listings that was presented at trial included accommodations and layout overview vessel walkthrough electronics and navigation electrical system deck hull construction engine and mechanical equipment water sports and recreation fishing equipment sails and rigging other additional salesperson remarks exclusions disclaimer according to mls solutions,the merger doctrine precludes copyright protection over buc selection because buc has expressed the idea of organizing a vessel listing by using standard industry terms,such as rooms,mechanical equipment,and so forth.with a limited number of industry terms available to express the idea of describing a vessel,mls solutions contends that the expression has merged with the idea.
in addressing mls solutions argument,we note the tension in the underlying policies of the dichotomy and the merger doctrine.on the one hand,we do not want to grant a monopoly over an idea.on the other hand,we seek not to frustrate the goal of securing copyright protection for original expressions of authorship.at the margins,the distinction between idea and expression can be subtle and difficult.mindful of these principles,we turn to the application in this case.
the first relevant inquiry in deciding how to apply the merger doctrine calls for a determination of precisely what the idea and its expression are.generally speaking,buc idea was how to present brokers with information about a boat.buc expressed this idea by selecting certain features of a boat that it thought would be important to brokers,and arranging them according to what sullivan thought was the most important information first.while mls solutions would have us define the idea more narrowly,dividing a vessel listing by rooms or other features of a boat,we think that definition skews the analysis in favor of finding merger.articulating the idea and expression is not merely an exercise in semantics it is a policy decision that must be carefully drawn.by defining the idea around the contours of the chosen expression,mls solutions attempts to cast the idea and the expression as one.this type of analysis would swallow up the dichotomy,and the merger doctrine would become the rule instead of the exception.a more balanced conception of the idea here yields the conclusion that buc idea was to present yacht brokers with information about boats.under this definition,mls solutions argument is,in effect,reduced to the suggestion that the only way to describe a boat for the purposes of a vessel listing is to use the section headings that buc selected for its compilation.in other words,mls solutions must argue that the idea of presenting brokers with information about boats can only be expressed in very few,using buc selection of section headings.
the testimony at trial belies mls solutions argument.brokers testified that,prior to bucnet,there was no uniformity in the way information about yachts was used different headings and organized information in different formats for their vessel listings.buc admitted into evidence vessel listings from various companies that were not generated using the bucnet standard format.while some of these listings featured section headings used in the bucnet standard format such as mechanical equipment and accommodations,they varied substantially in the overall selection and arrangement of this information.the variety in the listings demonstrates that there are many ways to select and organize information in a yacht listing.the number of potential expressive options indicates that buc selection of section headings did not merge with the larger idea of describing a yacht.in that same vein,mls solutions is not foreclosed from using industry terms like galley or hull it simply can not use them in the same manner in which buc did.
mls solutions final reason why the district court erred in denying its motion for judgment as a matter of law is that buc compilation lacks the minimal degree of creativity necessary for an original work of authorship.buc presented evidence of originality in the form of testimony from sullivan and a buc licensee.sullivan said that he evaluated what he thought was the most critical information for the brokers and structured buc compilation based on those assessments.joseph marino,a yacht broker and buc licensee,testified to the state of affairs in the yacht market prior to the establishment of bucnet,and the lack of uniformity in organizing vessel listings there was anything in the industry before.it was just a hodgepodge of what i,as a salesperson and broker,decided to send out.and each one was a little different,a variation of something else.when counsel for buc asked marino whether buc selection and arrangement were original,marino responded,yes.absolutely.
the defendants attempted to cast doubt on the originality of buc compilation through both of buc witnesses and testimony that defense witnesses gave.they sullivan,and tried to undermine his credibility about originality by pointing out the more expansive view of copyright ownership and originality that he had held prior to trial.for example,sullivan at one time claimed that buc owned all of the rights in the compilation,selection and organization of the text,codes and data contained within the bucnet service database.by the time the trial commenced,though,buc copyright claim was limited to the organization,selection and arrangement of data in the vessel listings.as to the originality of selection,the defendants attempted to show that terms like vessel walkthrough and master stateroom predated bucnet and had been used in the boating industry for years.allan gardner,chief technology officer for mls solutions,testified that the categories and subcategories on bucnet were common terms and by no means unique or original.according to him,the broker was ultimately responsible for the selection of the headings employed moreover,the order and arrangement of the listings was based on common sense and did not add any real value.
having reviewed the record,we find no error in the district court denial of mls solutions motion for judgment as a matter of law.buc and the defendants introduced conflicting testimony in support of their respective positions regarding the originality of the bucnet compilation.buc presented evidence of the creativity that went into the selection,order and arrangement of its compilation,highlighting the work of authorship that emerged from a motley sea of vessel listings.the defendants,on the other hand,tried to depict a banal compilation of information.considering the swearing match over originality,we can not say that the court should have resolved the originality issue as a matter of law.
appellants next contend that they should be afforded a new trial because the district court erred in instructing the jury that it could find copyright infringement if there were substantial similarities between the original elements of buc compilation and the corresponding elements of the defendants compilation.instead of using the words substantial similarities,appellants submit that,as they requested,the court should have instructed the jury that in order to find copyright infringement,it had to find that elements of the defendants compilation were virtually identical to the original elements of buc compilation.
to assess the merits of appellants argument,we consider how the district court went about fashioning the charge it delivered to the jury.we focus,in particular,on the court handling of the instructions the parties asked to be included and the objections defense counsel interposed to instructions the court employed.
on september,the district court entered an order instructing the parties to submit jury instructions by march.the parties complied with the order.both sides requested the court to instruct the jury that copyright infringement could be found if elements of the infringing compilation were substantially similar to the original elements of buc compilation both sides proceeded to try the case with the substantial similarity standard in mind 
the trial began on march.on april,a friday,the parties rested their cases,and the court entertained the defendants motions for judgment as a matter of law.the court denied the motions and immediately convened a charge conference.the court began the conference by giving counsel a draft of the instructions it proposed to give.included in the draft were the instructions at issue here they read as follows 
the plaintiff claims that defendant copied original elements of the plaintiff copyrighted work.the plaintiff has the burden of proving the following elements by a preponderance of the evidence.that defendant had access to the plaintiff copyrighted work and.that there are substantial similarities between the defendant work and original elements of the plaintiff copyrighted work.to find for the plaintiff,you must find that defendant copied the selection,coordination or arrangement of plaintiff compilations.if the plaintiff does not have explicit proof of copying,the plaintiff may show copying by demonstrating that defendant had access to the copyrighted work and by showing that there is a substantial similarity between the copyrighted work and defendant work.works are substantially similar if.the ideas in the plaintiff copyrighted work and in the defendant work are substantially similar and.the expression of ideas in the plaintiff copyrighted work and the expression of ideas in the defendant work are substantially similar.the test for expression of ideas is whether an ordinary reasonable person would find the total concept and feel to be substantially similar.
emphasis added 
the court and counsel went over the court draft page by page.when they arrived at the instructions quoted above,defense counsel objected to the court use of the words substantial similarity and asked the court to use the words virtual identicality instead,relying on apple computer microsoft as their authority defense counsel did not formally withdraw the substantial similarity instructions that they previously submitted.nor did they present the court with a set of substitute instructions.rather,they simply requested that virtual identicality,or virtually identical,be substituted for the words substantial similarity,or substantially similar.the court overruled counsel objection,stating that it would give the challenged instructions.
after the rest of the instructions contained in the district court draft had been discussed,the charge conference adjourned for the weekend,with this court would consider further objections to the instructions it proposed to give,or requests for additional instructions,if made in writing and hand delivered to the court chambers by monday morning.the parties closing arguments to the jury would commence that afternoon at one.
on monday morning,defense counsel filed a notice of supplemental authority,nautical solutions,wl,at,in support of their objection to the court use of the substantial similarity standard,and renewed their request that the court use the virtual identicality standard instead counsel did not reduce their requested instructions to writing,however,or otherwise provide the court with the substance of the instructions they wanted they evidently believed that inserting the words virtual identicality for substantial similarity was all that was necessary.
when court reconvened at one monday afternoon,defense counsel called the court attention to their notice of supplemental authority.in the absence of the jury,counsel once again asked the court to make the virtual identicality substitution they had been requesting.after noting that counsel had not submitted the substitute instructions in written form,the court denied counsel request.
appellants contend that it would have been a simple matter for the court to make the substitution it suggested.all the court had to do was strike out two words and substitute two others as amended in this way,the instructions would have expressed the virtual identicality standard correctly and in full.assuming arguendo that this is so,however,does not answer the question of whether the virtual identicality standard applies in a compilation scenario such as the one presented here.to answer that question,we must consider the standard that the particular,this circuit used in resolving claims for the infringement of factual compilations.
we begin with the observation that,in general,the standard for copyright infringement is substantial similarity.see warren publ g,microdos data,cir en banc.this standard occupies a value on the legal spectrum between no similarity and identicalness.melville nimmer david nimmer,nimmer on copyright a see also bateman,at two works need not be identical in order to be deemed substantially similar for purposes of copyright infringement.while the works need not be identical,there must be sufficient congruence between the original elements of the copyrighted work and the copied work such that a jury could find infringement.
the substantial similarity standard applies to actions for the infringement of factual compilations.see,warren publ g,at bellsouth adver.publ g donnelley info.publ g,cir en banc quoting key publ ns,chinatown today publ g,cir.the nuances of the substantial similarity test vary,however,depending on the nature of the copyrighted work at issue.for example,in cases involving a compilation,substantial similarity imparts a narrowed construction.bellsouth,at.
t he components of a compilation are generally in the public domain,and a finding of substantial similarity or even absolute identity as to matters in the public domain will not suffice to prove infringement.what must be shown is substantial similarity between those elements,and only those elements,that provide copyrightability to the allegedly infringed compilation.
id.quoting key publ ns,at.given the teachings of feist,it is the original selection and arrangement of the collected data that bear legal significance for factual compilations.see feist,at.at e ven a directory that contains absolutely no protectible written expression,only facts,meets the constitutional minimum for copyright protection if it features an original selection or arrangement.citation omitted.
by comparison,the virtual identicality standard calls for a greater degree of similarity between the copyrighted work and the allegedly infringing work than does substantial similarity.mitek holdings,arce eng g,cir.virtual identicality,as adopted in this circuit,applies to claims of compilation copyright infringement of nonliteral elements of a computer program.id.at.mitek involved a copyright infringement claim for the selection,coordination,and arrangement embodied in a computer program and its user interfaces.id.we recognized that a user interface,such as a screen display itself an audiovisual work,may be entitled to copyright protection as a compilation.id.ultimately,we affirmed the district court decision that virtual identicality between the two implicated programs was lacking because,in part,one program depict ed its commands as icons in the windows environment while the other program displayed them as words.id.at quoting mitek holdings,arce eng g.we note that mitek,while not elaborating on the basis for its adoption of the virtual identicality standard,did make clear that its application of the standard was specific to the type of compilation copyright claim in that case,claims of compilation copyright infringement of nonliteral elements of a computer program.id.at.
with the foregoing analysis in hand,we turn to the specific compilation before us.buc claimed copyright protection in the selection,order,and arrangement of information about yachts listed for sale.regardless of whether the yacht listings appear on a computer screen or in printed format,buc claim involves the selection,order and arrangement of the section headings,categories,and vessel inventory,the constituent elements of the bucnet factual compilation.for example,the choice of consistently presenting the accommodations and layout heading before the engine and mechanical equipment heading is manifested in the same way irrespective of the chosen medium.unlike the plaintiff in mitek,buc was not claiming infringement in the selection or arrangement embodied in a screen display or some other nonliteral element of its computer program.nor was buc contending that iyc and mls solutions had copied the overall appearance of the bucnet program as viewed on a computer screen.buc presented the jury with claims for the infringement of the selection,order and arrangement of a factual compilation,not the nonliteral elements of a computer program.substantial similarity was,therefore,the appropriate standard.appellants argument that the court erred in submitting that standard to the jury accordingly fails.
we ought not end this discussion,however,without commenting on the argument that the district court abused its discretion in refusing to entertain the merits of appellants request to substitute virtual identicality for substantial similarity as the appropriate standard for judging whether appellants compilation infringed the original elements of buc compilation.
the complaint in this case was filed in june.apple computer,microsoft,cir,the virtual identicality case defense counsel cited during the charge conference,had been on the books for nearly eight years mitek,an eleventh circuit case,explicitly adopted the apple computer virtual identicality standard in certain limited contexts at.mitek came down on august,two months shy of six years before buc complaint was filed.defense counsel either overlooked mitek or concluded that it was inapposite,for they represented to the court in the proposed jury instructions they filed prior to trial that substantial similarity was the applicable standard.counsel reinforced that representation at trial by not taking issue with buc attorney comment in his opening statement to the the evidence would show that the defendants compilation was substantially similar to the original elements of buc compilation.
given this history,the court was understandably surprised when defense counsel shifted gears during the charge conference and objected to the court proposed use of the substantial similarity standard.counsel gave no explanation for their new they said was that virtual identicality was the standard to be used according to apple computer microsoft.did counsel furnish the court with a copy of that decision no.did counsel inform the court that the eleventh circuit had adopted apple computer standard,but did so in a case involving non literal elements of a computer program mitek,at.no.what counsel did was to provide the court with the citation to nautical solutions marketing,which had been decided on april,just one day before the charge conference was convened,and which applied mitek virtual identicality standard.see wl,at.in sum,defense counsel apparently expected the court,at the eleventh hour,to do what counsel had not out the law books,decide for itself which standard applied,and then draft a set of jury instructions.
the court chose not to do that.in its order denying the defendants request for a new trial on the ground that the court erred in using the words substantial similarity,the court said this 
mls solutions waived any right to an instruction on virtual identicality.the court scheduling order states that all proposed jury instructions must be submitted in writing one week prior to the calendar call.specifically,all requested instructions must be typed on a separate page and,except for eleventh circuit pattern instructions,must be supported by citations of authority.this requirement allows the court sufficient time to conduct research on the proposed jury instructions however,in this case,the request for an instruction on virtual identicality came minutes before closing arguments,and more importantly,the request did not include a written proposed instruction on virtual identicality.
buc int l int l yacht council,slip op.at.june,order denying mot.for new trial.we would be hard pressed,indeed,to hold that given these circumstances,the district court abused its discretion.
appellants lastly contend that the district court erred in entering,on receipt of the jury verdicts,a declaratory judgment in favor of buc on their counterclaims.their counterclaims challenged the validity of buc copyrights.so did their answers to buc complaint,which denied the complaint allegation that buc owned valid copyrights.the jury rejected their denial,and upheld the complaint allegation in answering yes to the first interrogatory the court submitted to it does buc own valid copyright registrations.the issue thus becomes whether the jury answer bound the district court.the answer is yes.
it is well settled that where claims at law and in equity are joined and the legal claims are tried separately by a jury,the jury verdict operates as a finding of fact binding on the trial court in its determination of the equitable claims.dybczak tuskegee,cir see also elsea,cir c w leasing,orix credit alliance,cir.
the jury answered the first interrogatory after considering the court instruction that the plaintiff has the burden of proving both of the following by a preponderance of the evidence the plaintiff is the owner of a valid copyright and the defendant copied,displayed or distributed original elements from the copyrighted work.the jury determination that buc copyrights were valid was necessarily based on several factual findings,including that buc compilation contained original elements of creative authorship.in that the defendants had no objection to the jury instructions concerning originality and consented to the verdict form the jury responded to,the argument that the jury findings were somehow tainted necessarily fails.the district court,in its evaluation of the declaratory judgment,was thus bound by the jury finding that buc owned valid copyrights.
the judgment of district court is affirmed in all respects.
