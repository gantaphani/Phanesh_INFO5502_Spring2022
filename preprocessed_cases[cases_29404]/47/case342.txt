auto parts network usap brought suit against parts geek,llc and various individuals alleging,among other things,copyright infringement in certain software.the district court granted summary judgment against usap on its claim of copyright infringement because it concluded that usap did not own the allegedly infringed copyright.because there are genuine issues of material fact as to whether usap owns a copyright in all or part of the software at issue,we reverse in part,vacate in part,and remand 
the story starts in,when richard pine and todd daugherty founded benzbin,a website that sold mercedes benz car parts.by,pine and daugherty met two more internet entrepreneurs,brian tinari and lowell mann.
together they began to work on what had by then become partsbin,a website selling replacement parts for cars of all makes.partsbin needed software to help it process customer orders over the internet software and so tinari entered into discussions with a computer programmer,lucas thomason,to license an order processing program of thomason called manager thomason wrote the program in late or early,while he was and doing business as lucas networks.thomason gave partsbin a perpetual license to use manager and partsbin began using the software in its business.
sometime around april,after thomason provided the company with the manager software,partsbin hired him as its director of eservices.as part of the position,thomason moved into one of pine houses that doubled as a partsbin office.while at partsbin,thomason worked on,among other things,creating websites,catalogs and maintaining the network.he also continued to make modifications and enhancements to manager,some at the direction of his supervisors,and some of his own accord because he thought it might be helpful or needed given partsbin changing needs.for example,partsbin began as both a retailer and direct distributor of the parts it sold online it carried stock,sold,and delivered whatever parts customers ordered.but this integrated business model meant that the size of its online catalog was limited by the size of its warehouse.partsbin business entered a new phase after its primary supplier agreed to ship parts directly to partsbin customers without having partsbin keep the parts in stock.use of this drop shipping technique expanded partsbin business to the extent that tinari,one of the partsbin founders,called it a material breakthrough.
thomason tailored the manager software to fit partsbin business changes.he added one of these modifications,called auto vend,around to early.auto vend is a distributor selection system if a customer orders a part that is out of stock in partsbin own warehouse,auto vend will identify an appropriate distributor to fill the customer order.
as partsbin evolved,so did manager.in his time working at partsbin,thomason developed at least four more versions of manager manager,manager,manager,and manager there is no record of a written agreement between thomason and partsbin regarding the ownership rights to thomason modifications and enhancements to manager.
partsbin became an internet success story.by,its annual sales had reached approximately million.partsbin success attracted suitors,one of which was usap,another online retailer of aftermarket auto parts.in may,usap and partsbin entered into an acquisition agreement,whereby usap agreed to purchase partsbin for some million.the acquisition agreement listed partsbin assets as including all its intellectual property,defined in relevant part as all rights to and interests in all software,copyrights registrations and applications thereof software was defined,in turn,to mean title and interest in the partsbin software programs identified in a schedule attached to the agreement.the attached schedule of intellectual property rights stated in relevant part 
system owned by company partsbin 
manager owned by company partsbin 
after the acquisition,usap hired many of partsbin key employees,including the four founders pine,daugherty,tinari,and mann,thomason,and pine,dannie hendershot,who was also an partsbin employee.according to thomason,his primary role at usap was to manage manager by again making modifications and enhancements to the software in order to accommodate the needs of his and supervisors.eventually,these updates led to the development of at least two more versions of software,manager july,and versapart.
thomason resigned from usap in july.around that same time,pine,tinari,mann,and hendershot also left usap to launch a new online aftermarket car parts retailer named parts geek.parts geek needed software,so it contacted thomason.thomason began work on the parts geek project about four weeks before he left usap.he finished writing the new software,called admin,by october and parts geek began accepting orders through admin shortly thereafter.
parts geek was another success,growing to over million in sales by the end of.this rapid growth attracted usap attention and suspicion,culminating in this suit by usap against parts geek and thomason claiming,among other things,that admin infringes usap copyrights in manager.usap also brought three state law causes of action misappropriation of trade secrets,breach of contract,and unfair competition,and parts geek responded with federal antitrust and state tortious interference counterclaims.
parts geek and thomason moved for summary judgment on usap claims,and usap did the same on parts geek counterclaims.as part of its opposition to summary judgment,usap submitted the first report of its software expert,which stated that admin included a feature substantially similar to auto vend in manager.in addition,usap requested a continuance of the summary judgment proceedings until it could depose thomason and,its software expert could prepare a second report comparing the first four versions of manager,and to the later versions of the software versapart and admin.the district court denied the continuance for usap software expert second report,but allowed the continuance as to thomason deposition.both parties filed supplemental summary judgment briefing following the deposition.
the district court granted summary judgment to parts geek and thomason on usap copyright infringement claim for manager,concluding that usap did not own the copyright to any versions of manager because thomason never agreed to transfer his ownership of the manager program or any of its subsequent versions to either partsbin or usap.because the district court concluded that usap had no ownership interest in manager,it ruled that usap had no standing to bring suit for infringement.following summary judgment,parts geek and thomason moved for attorneys fees for usap claims related to the manager software.the district court granted the motions and awarded fees.the parties timely appealed.
on appeal,usap claims that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of parts geek and thomason because usap does have an ownership interest in those portions of manager that thomason prepared while he was working at partsbin.according to usap,thomason work while employed at partsbin was work made for hire,and therefore partsbin was the copyright owner of at a minimum any copyrightable enhancements thomason added to manager while working for partsbin,id.at b.usap asserts that it became the copyright owner of these enhancements when it acquired partsbin intellectual property.by the same work for hire theory,usap also claims the copyright to the enhancements thomason added to manager while he was employed at usap.finally,usap asserts that parts geek and thomason infringed usap copyright to these enhancements by using substantially similar features as part of admin.
we have jurisdiction pursuant to and review de novo a district court grant of summary judgment,as well as its interpretation of the copyright act.ellison robertson,f d,cir.as the moving parties,parts geek and thomason bear the burden of proving the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.id.a genuine issue of material fact exists if there is evidence from which a jury could reasonably render a verdict in favor of usap,the party.anderson liberty lobby.in determining whether a jury could so find,we draw all reasonable inferences in favor of usap.ellison,at.
we must first determine whether usap theory of copyright ownership is based on a correct legal interpretation.the key to usap argument is the interaction of two provisions in the copyright act the provision making employers the copyright owner of an employee work made for hire,b,and the provision governing copyright ownership of derivative works,id.at.we consider each in turn.
we begin by considering the applicability of the work made for hire doctrine to thomason development of software enhancements to manager while employed at partsbin and usap.software source code is subject to copyright protection.justmed,byce,cir.under a of the copyright act,copyright ownership vests initially in the author or authors of the work,which is generally the creator of the copyrighted work.see cmty.for creative non violence reid.the act carves out an important exception,however,for works made for hire.id.at.if a work is made for hire,the employer or other person for whom the work was prepared is considered the author and owns the copyright unless the parties have expressly agreed otherwise in a written instrument signed by them.b see also thomson larson,cir the provisions are an exception to the rule that copyrights belong in the first instance only to creators.relevant here,a work made for hire is defined as a work prepared by an employee within the scope of his or her employment.
although the copyright act does not define either employee or scope of employment,these terms must be understood in light of the general common law of agency.reid,at applying agency principles to conclude that an artist who had been commissioned by a corporation to create a sculpture was not an employee who had created the work within the scope of his employment.reid cited to section of the restatement second of agency as a source of these common law principles,id.at,and courts have accordingly adopted section test for determining when a work is made by an employee within the scope of employment a it is of the kind the employee is employed to perform b it occurs substantially within the authorized time and space limits and c it is actuated,at least in part,by a purpose to serve the employer.avtec,peiffer,cir quoting restatement accord shaul cherry valley springfield cent.sch,cir same see also melville nimmer david nimmer,nimmer on copyright b b i.
we join our sister circuits in adopting this approach.provided that partsbin and usap had the right to create derivative work based on manager,any separately copyrightable software source code developed by thomason while at partsbin,and later usap,is a work made for hire if thomason was an employee of partsbin and usap,and the development of software code was the type of work he was employed to perform,the work occurred substantially within the authorized work hours and space limits,and the work was actuated,at least in part,by a purpose to serve partsbin and usap.
we next consider how and when enhancements to software programs such as manager can be separately copyrightable as derivative works.a work based upon one or more preexisting works that recast s,transform s,or adapt s the preexisting work is referred to as a derivative work.a copyright owner has the exclusive right to prepare and authorize the preparation of derivative works based upon the copyrighted work.id.at.a nonexclusive license of this right may be granted orally,or may even be implied by conduct.effects assocs.cohen,cir quoting nimmer on copyright a.
the resulting derivative work may be independently copyrightable,but the scope of this copyright is limited.for example,where the copyright owner has authorized a third party to prepare a derivative work based on the owner work,copyright protection in the derivative work will cover only the material contributed by the author of such work,as distinguished from the preexisting material employed in the work.b see stewart abend,the aspects of a derivative work added by the derivative author are that author property,but the element drawn from the work remains on grant from the owner of the work.russell price,cir.copyright in this contributed material is independent of,and does not affect or enlarge the scope,duration,ownership,or subsistence of,any copyright protection in the preexisting material.b.however,copyright protection for a derivative work does not extend to any part of the work in which such preexisting material has been used unlawfully.a.thus,if a third party uses preexisting work in violation of the copyright act,see ets hokin skyy spirits,cir,the resulting derivative work is not entitled to copyright protection.in short,provides that a derivative author may own the copyright in material the author contributed to a preexisting work,but not in infringing material or material the author did not create.
we have adopted the second circuit test for ascertaining whether a derivative work meets copyright law fundamental requirement of originality.in order to be copyrightable,the original aspects of a derivative work must be more than trivial and the original aspects of a derivative work must reflect the degree to which it relies on preexisting material and must not in any way affect the scope of any copyright protection in that preexisting material.entm t research grp.genesis creative,cir quoting durham indus.tomy,cir.this durham test establishes two ways of asking the same underlying question whether the derivative work meets the constitutional requirement of originality enunciated in feist publications,rural telephone service.in feist,the supreme court held that t o qualify for copyright protection,a work must be original to the author,meaning that the work was independently created by the author as opposed to copied from other works,and that it possesses at least some minimal degree of creativity.id.at.thus,the first prong of the durham test asks whether the derivative work is original to the author and,possesses the minimal degree of independent creativity required by feist.durham,at entm t research,at.the second prong asks whether the author of the derivative work made so few changes to the preexisting work that issuing a copyright for the derivative work would prevent the owner of the preexisting work from exercising some of its rights under copyright law.entm t research,at.
durham illustrates how this test should be applied.in that case,a toy company that produced mickey mouse,pluto,and donald duck toys claimed that it owned a derivative copyright in these disney characters.durham,at.the court rejected this claim.first,the court held that the toys contained no independent creation and lacked even a modest degree of originality.id.at.second,the court explained that if it recognized the toymaker derivative copyright in the toys,then other licensees of disney would as a practical matter,have to make substantial changes in these characters in order to avoid infringing the toymaker derivative rights.id.at.as a result,disney right to copy or to permit others to copy its own creations would,in effect,be circumscribed.id.because any material the toymaker contributed to the disney characters was trivial and lacked the requisite originality,durham concluded the toys were not copyrightable.id.at see also entm t research,at.
applying this test,we conclude that in order to be copyrightable derivative works,thomason contributions to manager would have to be lawfully based on manager and contain enhancements that do not affect the scope of copyright protection in manager.see entm t research,at.
having separately examined the work for hire and derivative work provisions of the copyright act,we now must read them together.based on our review,we conclude that absent a written agreement to the contrary,the employer is the author of a work made for hire.b.if such a work is lawfully derived from a preexisting copyrighted work,the employer holds the copyright to the original,material contributed to the preexisting work.therefore,we agree with usap interpretation of the law if thomason contributions to manager while he was an e
