background 
pfs owned and operated a food distribution center in oskaloosa,iowa pfs oskaloosa.pfs oskaloosa was originally owned by a private individual,and was bought by conagra poultry company conagra poultry in.in november,pilgrim pride bought conagra poultry and acquired pfs oskaloosa.
raduechel began working at pfs oskaloosa in,and became general manager around.spain began working at pfs oskaloosa in,and was promoted to sales manager in or.while raduechel and spain worked at pfs oskaloosa,two of pfs oskaloosa largest customers for poultry sales were affiliated foods affiliated and fareway stores fareway.raduechel handled all sales to affiliated,and spain handled all sales to fareway.
when pilgrim pride acquired conagra poultry,pilgrim pride assumed raduechel compensation agreement with conagra poultry,which included a base salary and an incentive plan.the incentive plan provided raduechel would receive a bonus in an amount tied to a percentage of pfs oskaloosa profits,but also included a provision that allowed reduction of the bonus,down to zero in extreme conditions,if raduechel general job performance was unsatisfactory,or raduechel managerial attitude was not in the best interest of the company.under the incentive plan,raduechel salary was approximately in base salary and approximately in bonus.raduechel compensation agreement was effective until may.
in december,raduechel attended a pfs managers meeting in dallas,texas.although compensation was not formally discussed at the meeting,raduechel became concerned that his compensation and business at pfs oskaloosa would be reduced.raduechel,however,left the meeting thinking pfs would have a proposed compensation package for him by the end of january.
raduechel told spain about the concerns raduechel was having regarding potential compensation and business reduction at pfs oskaloosa.raduechel and spain began to formulate a plan b in the event things did not work out at pfs oskaloosa.plan b entailed raduechel and spain starting their own distribution company,d b solutions,to compete with pfs oskaloosa.
in late january,raduechel and spain met with pothoven at midwestone to discuss financing for d b solutions.pothoven advised raduechel and spain to create a business plan,and pothoven recommended several accountants to assist raduechel and spain.raduechel and spain then contacted donohue at td t,and met or corresponded with donohue several times during late january and early february to discuss and prepare a business plan.during one of the meetings,raduechel and spain gave donohue financial documents from pfs oskaloosa.upon seeing the documents,donohue expressed concern that the documents were confidential,and told raduechel and spain to seek legal advice regarding the documents.although donohue inadvertently retained the documents,neither raduechel,spain,nor donohue used the documents or showed them to anyone after the documents were initially disclosed.
in early march,bobby matkin matkin,a pfs executive,visited pfs oskaloosa.during the visit,matkin told raduechel that pfs did not yet have a proposed compensation package for raduechel.raduechel was told a proposed compensation package would be provided to him by april.raduechel became frustrated,and continued to work on financing for d b solutions at midwestone with hicks.pfs did not provide raduechel with a proposed compensation package on april.
on may,midwestone extended a line of credit,a real estate loan,and a commitment on a letter of credit to raduechel and spain for operation of d b solutions.around may,matkin provided raduechel with a proposed compensation agreement.the agreement provided for a base salary of and required raduechel to manage both pfs oskaloosa and pfs green bay office.raduechel rejected the offer.matkin then offered raduechel a base salary of to manage only pfs oskaloosa.raduechel rejected matkin amended offer,and resigned from pfs oskaloosa on june.
after raduechel resigned,matkin inquired into spain interest in becoming the branch manager at pfs oskaloosa.on june,spain was offered the branch manager job for a base salary of.spain rejected the offer on june,and resigned that same day.raduechel and spain started operating d b solutions after spain resigned,and affiliated and fareway began buying poultry from d b solutions around late june to early july.
on june,pfs filed a complaint in the district court against raduechel,spain,and d b solutions seeking damages and injunctive relief for breach of fiduciary duties,civil conspiracy,and unjust enrichment and constructive trust.pfs subsequently added copyright infringement and misappropriation of trade secret claims,and the district court granted a preliminary injunction against the operation of d b solutions on august.after the preliminary injunction was entered,d b solutions stopped operation however,fareway and affiliated did not return to pfs oskaloosa as customers,and instead began buying poultry directly from the companies preferred poultry suppliers.
on august,pfs sent a letter to raduechel explaining pfs would not pay raduechel the bonus which was due under raduechel conagra poultry compensation agreement and incentive plan that expired on may.pfs stated raduechel was not entitled to the bonus under the terms of the incentive plan due to pfs complaint against raduechel and the district court grant of a preliminary injunction.as a result,raduechel filed a counterclaim against pfs for payment of the bonus alleging violation of the iowa wage payment collection act iwpca,breach of oral contract,breach of written contract,and promissory estoppel.
pfs amended its complaint,adding donohue,td t,midwestone,hicks,and pothoven as defendants on the civil conspiracy,constructive trust and unjust enrichment,and misappropriation of trade secrets claims.pfs also added a claim for aiding and abetting against all defendants.
on february,pfs moved to dismiss raduechel counterclaim under.b.the district court granted the motion on august.raduechel then moved the district court to reconsider its ruling on pfs motion to dismiss.the district court denied raduechel motion for reconsideration on january.
on january,the district court addressed summary judgment motions from pothoven,midwestone,hicks,pfs,donohue,and td t.the district court granted pothoven motion for summary judgment and dismissed pothoven from the action granted donohue and td t motion on the constructive trust and unjust enrichment claim,and granted partial summary judgment to pfs on the issue of raduechel and spain liability for breach of fiduciary duties and misappropriation of trade secrets.the district court left for trial the issues of causation and damages on the breach of fiduciary duties and misappropriation of trade secrets claims against raduechel and spain,and denied the summary judgment motions in all other respects.raduechel and spain subsequently moved the district court to reconsider the grant of summary judgment,but the district court denied the motion.
before trial,the parties agreed pfs claim for unjust enrichment and constructive trust should be stayed until the resolution of the legal claims in pfs amended complaint.thus,the district court ordered all evidence regarding pfs claim for unjust enrichment and constructive trust be withheld until after trial.
a jury trial began on february.on february,the jury returned a verdict in favor of all defendants on all of the remaining claims.the jury found raduechel and spain breach of fiduciary duties and misappropriation of trade secrets were not proximate causes of damage to pfs the accounting and banking defendants had not misappropriated trade secrets the accounting and banking defendants did not enter into a conspiracy with raduechel and spain and the accounting and banking defendants did not aid and abet raduechel and spain breach of fiduciary duties.the jury did not address the issue of damages.
after trial,pfs moved for equitable relief in conjunction with the unjust enrichment and constructive trust claim which had been stayed.pfs asked the district court for disgorgement of raduechel and spain salaries during the time raduechel and spain were breaching their fiduciary duties.on september,the district court found it would not be equitable to require raduechel and spain to disgorge their salaries,and denied pfs motion.
pfs then moved the district court for a new trial,arguing the jury finding of no proximate cause on the breach of fiduciary duties and misappropriation of trade secrets claims against raduechel and spain,as well as the jury findings on the conspiracy and aiding and abetting claims,were against the greater weight of the evidence.the district court denied pfs motion.this appeal follows.
ii.discussion 
motion for a new trial on the breach of fiduciary duties and misappropriation of trade secrets claims 
pfs first challenges the district court denial of pfs motion for a new trial on pfs breach of fiduciary duties and misappropriation of trade secrets claims against raduechel and spain.the district court found pfs was not entitled to a new trial because there was evidence pfs initial losses after raduechel and spain left were offset by pfs retention of raduechel and spain bonuses,and there was evidence any prolonged loss suffered by pfs was caused by the large sum pfs paid in attorney fees for the litigation and pfs failure to act quickly to regain affiliated and fareway as customers.the district court noted pfs effort to regain affiliated and fareway as customers and pfs attorney fees were technically relevant to the issue of damages.however,the district court concluded,in the context of the present action,the court finds that any distinction between proximate cause and damages is largely academic,and u nder this scenario,the issue of proximate cause was subsumed by the issue of damages,and the jury appropriately answered no on the question that appeared first in the verdict forms.
pfs,primarily relying on storage tech.cisco,cir,and vigoro,crisp,cir,now maintains it was entitled to a new trial because no reasonable jury could have found raduechel and spain misconduct did not proximately cause damage to pfs when the evidence at trial showed fareway and affiliated stopped buying chicken from pfs,and began buying chicken from d b solutions,in the summer of pfs further contends the district court reasoning was erroneous because the district court improperly conflated the issues of proximate cause and damages by equating the jury no proximate cause finding with a finding of no damages.pfs also refutes the district court reasoning by asserting pfs was damaged by the loss of affiliated and fareway as customers regardless of pfs net losses or pfs retention of raduechel and spain bonuses pfs effort to regain affiliated and fareway as customers is irrelevant to proximate causation and in the event we find a new trial is warranted,the hypothetical possibility that raduechel and spain could have quit pfs and lawfully formed d b solutions is not a defense to proximate causation or damages.
we review a district court denial of a motion for a new trial for abuse of discretion.see keeper king,cir.when a motion for a new trial is founded on the assertion that the jury verdict is against the weight of the evidence,the district court ruling is virtually unassailable on appeal.id.internal quotations and citations omitted.viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict,computrol,newtrend,cir,we will reverse only when there is an absolute absence of evidence to support the jury verdict.slidell,millennium inorganic,cir citation omitted.the crucial determination is whether a new trial should have been granted to avoid a miscarriage of justice.keeper,at internal marks and citation omitted.
the iowa supreme court has endorsed the definition of proximate cause which the district court used in the jury instructions in this case,and which provides,
the conduct of a party is a proximate cause of damage when it is a substantial factor in producing damage and when the damage would not have happened except for the conduct.substantial means the party conduct has such an effect in producing damage as to lead a reasonable person to regard it as a cause.
there can be more than one proximate cause of an injury or damage.
see benn thomas,iowa.the iowa supreme court has also explained,
courts have recognized a distinction between proof of the fact that damages have been sustained and proof of the amount of those damages.if it is speculative and uncertain whether damages have been sustained,recovery is denied.if the uncertainty lies only in the amount of damages,recovery may be had if there is proof of a reasonable basis from which the amount can be inferred or approximated.
orkin exterminating burnett,iowa citations omitted.
under iowa law,a reasonable jury could have concluded raduechel and spain misconduct did not proximately cause pfs to lose affiliated and fareway as customers.first,the jury was presented evidence that fareway was planning to leave pfs regardless of raduechel and spain formation of d b solutions.fareway head meat buyer,rod nedved nedved,testified fareway had encountered problems with pfs and had discussed leaving pfs several months before d b solutions was formed.fareway vice president of purchasing,randy naeve naeve,corroborated nedved testimony.spain also testified fareway had left pfs and bought some poultry products directly from a supplier from to,and nedved testified it was inevitable fareway would leave pfs and begin buying direct from a supplier.nedved further testified the operation of d b solutions was not the sole reason fareway left pfs,but rather,leaving pfs to buy direct was more financially sound,easier for communication,and more reliable.although pfs contends this testimony does not account for the time when fareway left pfs and was buying chicken through d b solutions in the summer of,we conclude spain,nedved,and naeve testimonies provide a reasonable basis for a jury to conclude fareway was planning to leave pfs and buy direct regardless of the operation of d b solutions and fareway stopped doing business with pfs and began doing business with d b solutions in the summer of,not because of raduechel and spain misconduct in forming d b solutions,but because fareway had encountered problems with pfs before the formation of d b solutions.
second,a reasonable jury could conclude pfs lost affiliated and fareway as customers due to pfs own actions.raduechel testified he initially expected a proposed compensation package from pfs in late january,approximately four months before the expiration of raduechel conagra compensation agreement,but did not receive a proposed compensation package from pfs until may,four days before raduechel conagra compensation agreement expired.matkin,pfs vice president of logistics and distribution,admitted pfs was taking a significant risk that raduechel would leave and compete with pfs when pfs delayed offering raduechel a compensation package until a few days before raduechel conagra poultry agreement expired.further,raduechel testified pfs first compensation proposal involved approximately half of the compensation raduechel previously had with conagra poultry,and increased work and responsibility with pfs green bay office pfs modified compensation proposal,after raduechel rejected the first proposal,eliminated the increased work and responsibility with pfs green bay office,but still required raduechel to take an approximate pay cut raduechel felt pfs could not find a way to compensate me and was expecting me to leave and d b solutions was plan b for raduechel up until raduechel submitted his resignation.
the director of meat operations for affiliated,mike wallace wallace,testified affiliated bought poultry from raduechel because wallace trusted raduechel and valued raduechel service.wallace further testified he would have bought from raduechel regardless of whether raduechel was employed by pfs or d b solutions.viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury verdict,raduechel,matkin,and wallace testimonies provide a reasonable basis for a jury to conclude wallace would have followed raduechel regardless of raduechel employer,and thus pfs,not raduechel and spain misconduct,caused the loss of affiliated as a customer,because pfs did not adequately take actions to retain raduechel and thereby preserve pfs relationship with affiliated.
similarly,naeve testified that,prior to the formation of d b solutions,fareway had encountered quality and accuracy problems with pfs deliveries,namely fareway had received some poultry and had received some poultry from suppliers other than fareway preferred supplier.naeve testimony was corroborated by nedved,who also testified about the quality and accuracy issues fareway had with pfs deliveries before d b solutions began operating.nedved testified fareway began buying poultry from spain at d b solutions due to spain ability to guarantee poultry from fareway preferred supplier,and stated fareway could buy poultry from any supplier if fareway maybe had issues or reasons to go another direction.a reasonable jury could conclude,based on this testimony,pfs lost fareway as a customer in the summer of due to pfs quality and accuracy problems,not necessarily the formation and operation of d b solutions.
finally,pfs reliance on storage tech.and vigoro is not persuasive.in vigoro,we affirmed a district court finding that an employee breached fiduciary duties.see vigoro,at.however,our discussion did not analyze whether the district court properly found the breaches proximately caused damage.rather,our discussion focused on whether the district court properly found the employee had breached fiduciary duties,and whether the district court erred in determining the amount of damages.see id.at.vigoro,thus,does not apply to the specific proximate cause arguments pfs makes in this case.similarly,in storage,we held,under minnesota law,an employer had not proven the certainty of damages for claims of breach of fiduciary duties and misappropriation of trade secrets because the employer failed to produce enough evidence for a jury to calculate damages.see id.at.this discussion regarding the certainty of damages under minnesota law is different from our examination of pfs specific proximate cause arguments,and does not influence our analysis in this case.
we conclude the jury proximate cause finding was not a miscarriage of justice,and the district court did not abuse its considerable discretion in denying pfs motion for a new trial on the breach of fiduciary duties and misappropriation of trade secrets claims.because we conclude a reasonable jury could have found raduechel and spain formation and operation of d b solutions did not proximately cause pfs to lose affiliated and fareway as customers,we choose not to address pfs other contentions regarding the district court reasoning for upholding the jury verdict.see palavra,cir in reviewing district courts,we may affirm the judgment on any basis disclosed in the record,whether or not the district court agreed with or even addressed that ground.
conspiracy claim 
pfs next argues the district court erred in its treatment of pfs conspiracy claim against the accounting and banking defendants because the district court should have granted pfs motion for a new trial on the conspiracy claim,and improperly instructed the jury on the conspiracy claim.
new trial motion 
pfs contends it was entitled to a new trial on the conspiracy claim against the accounting and banking defendants because the evidence at trial showed the accounting and banking defendants knew raduechel and spain were top executives at pfs,knew d b solutions would directly compete with pfs,and knew d b solutions planned to take a significant portion of pfs business.pfs asserts this evidence demonstrates the accounting and banking defendants knew raduechel and spain were acting improperly,and thus the accounting and banking defendants had the requisite knowledge and intent to enter into a conspiracy.pfs also claims the district court erred in justifying the jury verdict with an advice of counsel defense and a mistake of law defense.
we review the district court denial of pfs motion for a new trial for abuse of discretion,and give the district court ruling high deference.see keeper,at.under iowa law,l iability for civil conspiracy requires an agreement between the actor and the party sought to be held liable.wright brooke group,iowa citation omitted.this agreement must exist between the two persons to commit a wrong against another,ezzone riccardi,iowa,and results only from a defendant knowing and voluntary participation in a common scheme to take action,lawful or unlawful,that ultimately subjects the actor to liability to another.wright,at internal marks and citations omitted.
accounting defendants 
the district court found pfs was not entitled to a new trial on the conspiracy claim against the accounting defendants because donohue testified he did not know raduechel and spain were breaching fiduciary duties and he did not intend to help raduechel and spain damage pfs.the district court also reasoned the accounting defendants expert,susan chantland chantland,testified donohue actions were consistent with prevailing accounting practices.the district court found donohue and chantland testimonies credible and consistent with a jury finding that the accounting defendants lacked the required intent to engage in a conspiracy,and thus a new trial was not warranted.we agree with the district court.
donohue testified he never heard raduechel or spain state it was raduechel or spain intent to conspire to injure pfs,and it was not donohue impression that it was raduechel or spain intent to injure pfs.rather,donohue stated he believed raduechel and spain were staying at pfs after consulting donohue,and donohue would not have worked with raduechel and spain if he knew raduechel and spain were acting to injure pfs.donohue further testified donohue did not create a business plan,or financial projections,for raduechel and spain donohue only analyzed the general flow of the calculations raduechel and spain provided donohue donohue did not encourage,or actively participate,in the formation of d b solutions donohue was not aware of the use of confidential information from the documents raduechel provided donohue donohue advised raduechel to get legal advice when he recognized possible confidential information on the documents and although donohue inadvertently retained the documents raduechel provided him,donohue never used,reviewed,or published the documents after identifying the possible legal concern with the documents.
chantland testified,under professional accounting standards,donohue ability and responsibility to determine whether raduechel and spain were breaching their fiduciary duties was beyond donohue province as an accountant.chantland also opined donohue acted within all professional accounting standards during his service to raduechel and spain.
based upon donohue and chantland testimonies,the record contains sufficient evidence to substantiate the jury verdict because donohue and chantland testimonies reasonably show the accounting defendants did not knowingly and voluntarily enter into a scheme with raduechel and spain to breach raduechel and spain fiduciary duties or misappropriate trade secrets.the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying pfs motion for a new trial on the conspiracy claim against the accounting defendants,nor does a miscarriage of justice exist.
banking defendants 
similar to its finding for the accounting defendants,the district court also found pfs was not entitled to a new trial on the conspiracy claim against the banking defendants.the district court reasoned hicks testimony established the banking defendants were not aware of an unlawful scheme by raduechel and spain to breach fiduciary duties or misappropriate trade secrets.the district court concluded hicks testimony provided a basis for the jury verdict because the evidence reasonably showed the banking defendants did not possess the requisite knowledge to enter into a conspiracy.we agree with the district court.
like donohue,hicks testified he never heard raduechel or spain state it was raduechel and spain intent to injure pfs,and hicks never had the impression it was raduechel and spain intent to conspire against,or injure,pfs.hicks explicitly stated he never had an agreement with raduechel,spain,and donohue to injure pfs.hicks also testified he believed raduechel and spain were employees,he did not know about a contract for spain,and he believed raduechel contract with pfs had expired.hicks further testified he had no knowledge of,and never saw or reviewed,the documents which pfs alleged contained trade secrets.
the banking defendants expert,michael guttau guttau,testified it was relatively frequent for a bank to consider a loan application and grant a loan to an employee who wants to start a competing business with an employer,even before the employee has resigned from the employer.guttau also testified it would not be a red flag for a bank to have two top executives come to a bank and apply for a loan to start a business which would compete with the executives employer.guttau further attested to the banking procedures used by the banking defendants,and after reviewing the banking defendants file for d b solutions,guttau opined the information on raduechel and spain loan application would not trigger concern over the confidentiality of the information.
a reasonable jury could find hicks and guttau testimonies credible,and based upon their testimonies,find the banking defendants did not have knowledge of a scheme by raduechel and spain to breach fiduciary duties or misappropriate trade secrets.thus,hicks and guttau testimonies provide a basis for the jury verdict,and the district court denial of pfs motion for a new trial on the conspiracy claim against the banking defendants did not create a miscarriage of justice.
finally,we are not persuaded by pfs contention that the district court order erroneously relied on advice of counsel and mistake of law defenses.we do not read the district court order as basing the ruling on these defenses,and we choose not to address further pfs allegations.we conclude the district court did not erroneously deny pfs motion for a new trial on the conspiracy claim.
jury instruction 
pfs also contends the district court jury instruction on the conspiracy claim was erroneous.pfs asserts its theory on the conspiracy claim was that raduechel and spain were using unlawful means soliciting one another to accomplish the lawful end of forming d b solutions.pfs claims the district court failed to instruct the jury on pfs theory because the district court declined to use pfs proposed jury instruction,which would have instructed the jury that a conspiracy is a combination of two or more persons to accomplish,through concerted actions,an unlawful end or a lawful end by an unlawful means.
the district court instruction defined conspiracy as follows 
a conspiracy is an agreement of two or more persons to commit a wrong against another.the agreement can be oral or written,informal or formal,and need not be detailed.the agreement need not be expressed in words and may be implied and understood to exist from the conduct itself.it may be proved by direct or circumstantial evidence.merely because two or more persons associate with each other,or meet to discuss common interests or goals does not,by itself,establish a conspiracy.
a person participates in a conspiracy when the person joins the agreement with the intention to accomplish the wrongful act.a participant need not know all the details of the agreement nor all of the other participants.one who innocently furthers wrongful conduct by another does not participate in a conspiracy.
we review a district court jury instructions for abuse of discretion.mems city of paul dep t of fire and safety,cir citation omitted.w e ask whether the instructions,taken as a whole and viewed in the light of the evidence and applicable law,fairly and adequately submitted the issues in the case to the jury.id.quoting wheeling pittsburgh steel beelman river terminals,cir.a district court has broad discretion in instructing the jury,and jury instructions do not need to be technically perfect or even a model of clarity.id.quoting b b hardware,hargis,cir.we will reverse only upon a finding that the instructional error affected the substantial rights of the parties.id.citing wheeling,at.
the district court conspiracy instruction was not an abuse of discretion.the instruction followed the iowa model civil jury instruction defining both civil conspiracy and participation in a civil conspiracy.see iowa model civil jury instructions.this instruction is consistent with iowa law.see id.citing iowa authority see also robbins heritage acres,iowa a civil conspiracy requires proof of an agreement or understanding to effect a wrong against another.citation omitted ezzone,at for conspiracy,an agreement must exist between the two persons to commit a wrong against another.
because the instructions stated,a conspiracy is an agreement of two or more persons to commit a wrong against another,the instructions allowed the jury to find for or against pfs on its theory that the banking and accounting defendants were agreeing to perpetrate the wrong of breach of fiduciary duty or misappropriation of trade secrets.the instruction was broad enough to encompass situations involving an unlawful end or a lawful end by unlawful means.robbins,at.although pfs would have preferred more specific language,the district court instruction fairly and adequately presented the iowa conspiracy claim to the jury,and was not erroneous.see campbell vinjamuri,cir the trial court has a great deal of discretion in framing the jury instructions and the court need not give the exact language desired by the parties.citing mcilroy dittmer,cir.the instruction provided pfs with sufficient guidance to argue pfs case and themes.
aiding and abetting claim 
similar to the conspiracy claim,pfs charges the district court erroneously denied pfs motion for a new trial on the aiding and abetting claim against the accounting and banking defendants.pfs also argues the district court gave an erroneous instruction on the aiding and abetting claim.
new trial motion 
the district court found,based on the testimonies of donohue and hicks,the greater weight of the evidence established the accounting and banking defendants did not have the requisite knowledge for aiding and abetting.the district court thus concluded pfs was not entitled to a new trial on this claim.
pfs now asserts the district court ruling was improper.pfs claims it was entitled to a new trial because the account
