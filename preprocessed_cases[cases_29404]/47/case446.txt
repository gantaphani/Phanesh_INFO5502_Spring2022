the copyright act of requires authors to register their works with the federal copyright office in order to be entitled to the act protections against copyright infringement.two conflicting interpretations of the act registration requirement have been upheld by circuit courts registration occurs when the copyright owner submits an application for registration to the copyright office,or,conversely registration occurs when the copyright office actually approves or rejects the application.we hold that the second interpretation is correct.the copyright office must approve or reject the application before registration occurs or a copyright infringement action can be brought.
la resolana architects,pa la resolana,appeals the dismissal of its copyright infringement suit against,clay realtors angel fire,lance clay,gary plante,and angel fire home design clay realtors.we take jurisdiction pursuant to,and,finding la resolana application for copyright registration had not yet been approved when the litigation commenced,we affirm.
background 
in late and early,a representative of la resolana,a santa fe architecture firm,met with representatives from clay realtors about developing townhouses in angel fire,new mexico.the la resolana representative allegedly showed clay realtors some architectural drawings and plans la resolana had created specifically for the angel fire project.ultimately,however,the parties never reached an agreement regarding the drawings,never contracted to do business together,and went their separate ways.
in october,a la resolana representative familiar with the drawings was in angel fire,new mexico,visiting another building site.while there,he saw townhouses being sold by clay realtors that looked strikingly similar to those depicted in the architectural drawings developed by la resolana in.
shortly thereafter,on november,la resolana applied to register the copyrighted drawings with the copyright office.la resolana sent the requisite applications,fees,and deposits to the copyright office.upon receiving confirmation that the copyright office had received their materials,but before receiving confirmation that the copyright office registered the copyrights,la resolana sued clay realtors for copyright infringement.the suit was docketed on november.
on march,clay realtors moved to dismiss the complaint arguing that la resolana could not sue for copyright infringement until it obtained a certificate of copyright registration from the copyright office.la resolana responded by attaching a march,letter from the copyright office indicating that all necessary materials had been received,the copyrights had been approved for registration on january,and the effective registration date was november.however,the copyright office had not yet issued la resolana a certificate of copyright registration.
finding the march letter was not admissible evidence,the district court concluded that the drawings were not registered.since the court therefore lacked jurisdiction over the copyright infringement action,it dismissed the case without prejudice.
ii.analysis

copyright law 
our review in this case starts with the statutory scheme created by the copyright act of,and its legislative history found at stat.codified at,et the act or title.
historical background 
the constitution authorizes congress to regulate copyright protection.const.art i.prior to the passage of the act,copyright law consisted of a confusing mix of federal and state laws that differed greatly depending on the state and whether a work was published or unpublished.see,at,reprinted in.a primary purpose of the act was to improve this state of affairs.thus,i nstead of a dual system of common law copyright for unpublished works and statutory copyright for published works,congress adopt ed in a single system of federal statutory copyright from creation.id.as a result of the copyright act of,all legal rights within the general scope of copyright law became governed exclusively by title of the united states code.a.by creating a new,single federal system,congress preempted all state copyright law.see,at,reprinted in,the intention of section is to preempt and abolish any rights under common law or statutes of a state that are equivalent to copyright.
in its effort to simplify copyright law,congress made it easier to obtain copyright protection by recognizing that a copyright exists the moment an original idea leaves the mind and finds expression in a tangible medium,be it words on a page,images on a screen,or paint on a canvass.see a copyright protection subsists in original works of authorship fixed in a tangible medium.
congress streamlining of copyright law did not end at the creation of copyrights,though.in addition to eliminating statutory formalities in obtaining a copyright,congress also created a single,centralized,federal registration system.
registration 
under the act,registering a copyright is a relatively simple and inexpensive process registering a copyright requires the submission of three items to the copyright office a deposit,photocopy of the work to be copyrighted,b an application to register a copyright,and a fee.once a copyright owner files the requisite deposit,application,and fee,the register of copyrights examines the work to determine copyrightability 
a when,after examination,the register of copyrights determines that the material deposited constitutes copyrightable subject matter,the register shall register the claim and issue to the applicant a certificate of registration.
b in any case in which the register of copyrights determines that the material deposited does not constitute copyrightable subject matter or that the claim is invalid for any other reason,the register shall refuse registration 
a,b emphasis added.
congress made sure,however,that the registration system did not extinguish the automatic creation and recognition of copyrights.in fact,a explicitly states that registration is not a condition of copyright infringement.in addition,the registration system is completely voluntary.see id.t he owner of copyright may obtain registration of the copyright emphasis added.
although congress established a voluntary registration system,it created incentives for copyright owners to register their copyrights.to this end,certain benefits flow only to those who register their copyright.the most significant benefit to registering copyrights under the act is the issue raised in this right to enforce a copyright in federal court in an infringement suit.a 
infringement suits are the mechanism through which other important incentives and remedies created by title operate.for example,when actual damages are difficult to ascertain or a work has seemingly little extrinsic value,statutory damages are available under.equally important in the litigation context,under a certificate of registration is prima facie evidence of the validity of the copyright.for copyright owners hesitant to engage in the long and expensive process of litigation,attorney fees for prevailing parties are also recoverable under.finally,and perhaps most important,a registrant can obtain an injunction against an infringer under.to obtain these remedies,though,a federal court must have jurisdiction to hear a suit for infringement.
federal court jurisdiction under title 
the plain language of the statutes 
turning to the question of federal jurisdiction under the copyright act,we start with the language of the statute.if the statutory language is not ambiguous,and the statutory scheme is coherent and consistent,our inquiry ends.barnhart sigmon coal,d.section a is the jurisdictional linchpin to copyright infringement actions 
no action for infringement of the copyright in any united states work shall be instituted until preregistration or registration of the copyright claim has been made in accordance with this title.in any case,however,where the deposit,application,and fee required for registration have been delivered to the copyright office in proper form and registration has been refused,the applicant is entitled to institute an action for infringement if notice thereof,with a copy of the complaint,is served on the register of copyrights.
emphasis added.on its face,allows an action for infringement to be instituted only when registration has been made in accordance with the act.congress amended on april,by adding the term preregistration or before registration.congress tasked the copyright office with defining which class of copyrights would be eligible for preregistration.since preregistration was not possible when this suit commenced,the new language does not control the outcome of this appeal.we discuss this amendment in more detail below.
the most important step necessary before instituting an infringement action is registering one copyright.registration is satisfied by completing the following steps 
application and payment of fee,
deposit of a copy of the copyrightable material,
examination by the register of copyrights,
registration or refusal to register by the register,
issuance of certificate of registration.
the plain language of the statute thus requires a series of affirmative steps by both the applicant and the copyright office.no language in the act suggests that registration is accomplished by mere receipt of copyrightable material by the copyright office.instead,the register of copyrights must affirmatively determine copyright protection is warranted,before registration occurs under the act and only upon registration or refusal to register is a copyright holder entitled to sue for copyright infringement under until those steps are followed and registration is made,federal courts lack subject matter jurisdiction over the infringement claim.
our interpretation of the act is bolstered by other provisions pertaining to the registration process.section a,for example,provides 
when,after examination,the register of copyrights determines that the material deposited constitutes copyrightable subject matter,the register shall register the claim and issue to the applicant a certificate of registration.
emphasis added.this language requires the following affirmative acts by the examin e,to register,and then to issue the certificate of registration.nothing in this process suggests that the filing of an application alone would be sufficient to register the work.
the language of b is similarly instructive 
in any case in which the register of copyrights determines that the material deposited does not constitute copyrightable subject matter or that the claim is invalid for any other reason,the register shall refuse registration 
this section is the flip side to the requirement that the material be examined before registration.upon examination,this provision allows the register either to register the claim or refuse registration in any event,requiring an affirmative act by the copyright office disallowing registration if the register believes the material is not an original copyrightable work under.
section supports our view that registration is not automatic 
the owner of copyright may obtain registration of the copyright claim by delivering to the copyright office the deposit specified by this section,together with the application and fee specified by sections and.
emphasis added.this provision,like the others,envisions substantive review of the material by the register of copyrights.if it were otherwise,the verb would be shall obtain instead of may obtain.corbis ugo networks,d.
a final provision of the act underscores our view of the statutory scheme.section b,establishing remedies under the act,states that t he legal or beneficial owner of a copyright is entitled,subject to the requirements of section,to institute an action for any infringement of that particular right.emphasis added.this statutory language clearly instructs that a copyright owner can sue for infringement only after the copyright is registered,or registration is refused.
taken together,these statutory provisions stand for the proposition that registration,or its refusal,requires more than the simple receipt of materials submitted by an author,and does not occur until the register of copyrights takes action.
interpretations of the plain language of the statutes 
despite the act seemingly plain language,courts construing these provisions are split into two competing interpretive camps the registration approach,which we have adopted,and the application approach.
a.the registration approach 
courts employing the registration approach interpret the act using the plain language of title,as we have done.we are in good company.indeed,even well before the act,judge learned hand concluded that the plain language of title allows copyright owners to sue for infringement only after a copyright is actually registered by the copyright office.see vacheron coultre watches,benrus watch,cir the text of the statute denies the right to sue for infringement until the provisions of this title with respect to the deposit of copies and registration of such work shall have been complied with since the owner must submit an application and pay the required fees in order to make a deposit,b ed.supplement v,we can think of no other added condition for registration but acceptance by the register.
a number of courts have found this approach the better reading of the act.for example,the eleventh circuit in homes,ameron homes,cir,held,in dismissing an infringement action as premature,that the registration requirement is a jurisdictional prerequisite to an infringement suit.while this is the only circuit court decision to reach the issue,a number of district courts have adopted the registration approach.for example,in mays assocs.euler,d,the district court agreed in construing that actual registration is a jurisdictional prerequisite,because the term application is used in the same section as the term registration and is clearly something separate and apart from registration.another district court,focusing on a different provision of the act,recognized that section a requirement of examination would be meaningless if filing and registration were synonymous.robinson princeton review,wl.lastly,the district court in loree rodkin mgmt,d,found that the register discretion to refuse copyright registration drives an iron wedge between mere application and actual registration as the sine qua non of registration 
while we generally agree with these courts in construing the act,we have one minor disagreement concerning the issuance of the certificate.a few courts have held that the act requires an applicant to first obtain the paper certificate from the copyright office as a prerequisite to filing an infringement action.see,strategy source,lee,d,finding copyright owners can not sue for infringement until they receive a certificate of registration from the copyright office loree rodkin mgmt,d at same.in our view,however,the language of the foregoing sections demonstrates that registration is separate from the issuance of a registration certificate and that a court jurisdiction does not turn on the existence of a paper certificate,but rather on the fact of registration,however it is demonstrated.we believe that statutory language commands this result for two reasons.
first,a says after the register of copyrights determines that the material constitutes copyrightable subject matter it shall register the claim and issue a certificate.the and issue a certificate phrase in a highlights the fact that registration does not occur upon issuance of a certificate of registration,but rather independently of,and before,the issuance of a certificate.the paper certificate does play an important role in judicial proceedings,however.under c,the certificate is prima facie evidence of the validity of the copyright,a considerable benefit to a plaintiff in an infringement action,but it is not required for registration to occur.
second,the conspicuous absence of the words certificate or certification in dictate that registration is separate from the issuance of a certificate of registration.if the opposite were true,would prevent copyright owners from suing until they received their paper certificate,which seems contrary to the overall thrust of the provision as we noted,although the paper certificate has evidentiary value,it does not drive the existence of federal jurisdiction.therefore,suits for infringement can be brought when a copyright is registered,and such registration occurs when the copyright office approves the application.
b.the application approach 
the second interpretive camp rejects the registration approach.the application approach interprets title using a methodology.a representative case is from the fifth circuit.in apple barrel productions,beard,cir,the court,without much elaboration,held that federal jurisdiction is satisfied merely by proving payment of the required fee,deposit of the work in question,and receipt by the copyright office of a registration application.see also lakedreams taylor,cir same.these courts are also in good company.according to one of the leading treatises on copyright law,this is the preferable approach since it most efficaciously facilitates the judicial protection of copyrights through infringement actions.see melville nimmer,nimmer on copyright,vol.b a.
looking to the act,courts adopting the application approach conclude that because a copyright owner can sue regardless of whether an application for registration is ultimately granted or rejected,delaying the date on which a copyright owner can sue is a senseless formality.see nimmer,b a i apple barrel,at citing nimmer foraste brown,d,discussing rationale for application approach.these courts also rely on the language of,that registration is not a condition of copyright protection,and d,that once a copyright is registered,the effective date of the registration relates back to the date the copyright office received the last of the filing materials,the deposit,fee,and application.see d foraste,d at.
finally,these courts look to the date of the application for registration as a condition to filing an infringement action,but issuance of a registration certificate is a condition to statutory damages and other statutory remedies.nimmer,b a i.thus,the argument goes,a copyright owner can get into court without being held hostage by the vagaries of the copyright office in its ministerial act of issuing the certificate.see international kitchen exhaust cleaning ass power washers of,d,adopting the application approach because it best effectuate s the interests of justice and promote s judicial economy 
the application approach,at first glance,has some appeal.indeed,as discussed above,it is odd that one can possess a copyright but be unable to file suit until it is voluntarily registered by the copyright holder.what is more,the scheme allows an infringer to dilute a copyright until a government official is able to sift through and approve what is surely a large stack of copyright registration applications courts adopting the application approach plausibly claim that their approach provides a sort of rough justice because it allows copyright owners to file suit while still maintaining the requirement that an owner obtain a certificate before a court can invoke the remedies contained in title.see nimmer,b a.
whatever the practical force of this argument,we can not ignore the plain meaning of the statute,nor change the legislative scheme.see strategy source,d at to conclude that registration or the refusal of registration are not jurisdictional prerequisites is to disregard the plain language of these statutes and to in effect them.there are three reasons we think the application courts statutory analysis is wrong.first,this approach requires a reading of title.title language does not convey certain remedies and benefits upon application and other remedies and benefits upon registration.the remedies are part of a single package.
second,the argument that copyright holders are left without a remedy until registration begs the question.congress created significant incentives for registration under the act.every remedy outlined in title,including injunctions,is conditioned upon a copyright owner having registered the copyright.see permitting only those copyright owners who have met the requirements of section,to institute an action for infringement.it is not illogical for congress to condition the remedies of the act to those who register under the act.congress could very reasonably have concluded that these rights and remedies are the carrot to induce registration and the stick is the lack of federal court jurisdiction until registration is accomplished.
finally,the application approach allows for shifting legal entitlements.if,for example,an applicant could obtain the advantage of the presumption that the copyright is valid upon application,see c,but then,after examination the register of copyrights determined the material is not copyrightable,the presumption of validity would swing back and forth such a predicament would generate uncertainty in copyright litigation that the act was designed to moderate.
in conclusion,we reject the proposition that confers federal court jurisdiction for an infringement action upon mere submission of a copyright application to the copyright office.in our view,the statute requires more actual registration by the register of copyrights.until that happens,an infringement action will not lie in the federal courts.
subsequent acts of congress 
our interpretation of the act is also supported by two of congress changes to the in,and the other in april.
amendments.
in,congress considered the berne convention implementation act berne act,which sought to ally the united states with a set of international rules and regulations,known as the berne convention,that protects intellectual property in the global marketplace and is adhered to by much of the global community.the berne convention eliminates most,if not all,formalities that are required to obtain and enforce copyrights.see berne convention for the protection of literary and artistic works,the enjoyment and the exercise of these rights shall not be subject to any formality.
as congress considered the berne act,a report issued by the senate judiciary committee expressed concern that a registration requirement was a formality incompatible with the text of the berne convention.see,at,reprinted in,the committee has concluded that section a is incompatible with article of berne.the senate judiciary committee proposed to alleviate this incompatibility by changing a to read registration is not a prerequisite to the institution of a civil action for infringement of copyright.id.at.as one senator said in arguing in favor of the amendment 
r egistration while not,technically speaking,a condition for the existence of copyright,is,however a precondition for the exercise of any of the rights conferred by copyright this metaphysical distinction between the existence of a right and the exercise of that right is not maintainable under our legal tradition which disfavors rights without remedies.
at.however,the house of representatives did not agree and rejected the senate proposed modification.see cong.rec,the house passed bill left current law intact,finding that current recordation and registration are not formalities prohibited by berne.
in the end,congress passed a narrower amendment.the amendment added the language to excepting certain foreign works from the registration is necessary e xcept for actions for infringement of copyright in berne convention works whose country of origin is not the united states.the legislative compromise created a solution registration is continued as a prerequisite to suit by domestic
