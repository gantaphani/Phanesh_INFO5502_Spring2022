this appeal,which arises in the context of software licenses,requires us to address the burden of proof applicable to the first sale defense to a copyright infringement claim.although a copyright holder enjoys broad privileges protecting the exclusive right to distribute a work,the first sale doctrine serves as an important exception to that right.under this doctrine,once a copy of a work is lawfully sold or transferred,the new owner has the right to sell or otherwise dispose of that copy without the copyright owner permission.a.of course,the defense is contingent on rightful ownership.the old adage possession is of the law has no traction under a 
this appeal stems from a messy copyright dispute between adobe systems,and joshua christenson and his software company,software surplus,ssi or software surplus in the district court,litigation of this case was punctuated by discovery disputes,sanctions,and multiple rulings on the admissibility and exclusion of evidence.the importance of these factors,which the parties emphasize on appeal,is diminished by the central issue who bears the burden of proving the first sale defense in a software licensing dispute.while the copyright holder bears the ultimate burden of establishing copyright infringement,the party raising a first sale defense bears an initial burden with respect to the defense.at the summary judgment stage,this burden is discharged by producing evidence sufficient for a jury to find that the alleged infringer lawfully acquired ownership of genuine copies of the copyrighted software.once this initial burden is satisfied,the burden shifts back to the copyright owner to establish the absence of a first sale,because of a licensing or other arrangement when the copy first changed hands.
the district court correctly held that adobe established its registered copyrights in the disputed software and that christenson carried his burden of showing that he lawfully acquired genuine copies of adobe software,but that adobe failed to produce the purported license agreements or other evidence to document that it retained title to the software when the copies were first transferred.we affirm the district court dismissal of both the copyright and trademark claims.
background 
in october,adobe filed this lawsuit against christenson.the factual basis for adobe claims was simple on his website,christenson sold adobe software which he purchased from a distributor without adobe authorization,allegedly infringing adobe copyrights and trademarks in the process.christenson asserted numerous defenses,including the first sale defense to the copyright claim.he also filed a counterclaim against adobe and a complaint against the software information industry association siia for defamation,disparagement,and more,on the basis that siia issued a press release about this case stating that christenson and his company sold infringing copies,including counterfeit versions and swindled consumers.
the following chronology helps explain why neither party completely closed the loop on proof.the case began as many do the district court referred the case to a magistrate judge to set discovery and dispositive motions deadlines.a protracted series of discovery exchanges and disputes eventually overlapped with briefing on for summary judgment,and the case then departed somewhat from the expected course.
adobe,with siia,moved for partial summary judgment on liability for the copyright and trademark claims and for summary judgment on the counterclaims and claims pertaining to the press release.on the copyright claim,adobe argued that the first sale defense did not apply because adobe only licenses and does not sell its software.for support,adobe relied on a declaration to that effect by its anti piracy enforcement manager,chris stickle.stickle generally described different ways that adobe licenses software,such as by limiting copies to academic users or distributing copies bundled with hardware under restrictive terms,the latter being known as original equipment manufacturer oem products.other evidence submitted by adobe included a list of specific copyrights,a list of adobe product licenses that had been produced by christenson,excerpts of christenson deposition in which he acknowledged that he sold academic and oem software,screenshots of the software surplus website stating that it sold academic and oem software,and customer returns and complaints in which customers complained that they had received software licensed for academic use from christenson despite having understood that they had purchased software appropriate for users.regarding the trademark claim,adobe also argued that christenson should be liable for false advertising,although as the district court later pointed out,adobe complaint did not include this claim.
christenson,in turn,moved for summary judgment on the copyright and trademark claims.in response to the copyright claim,christenson argued that only adobe had access to the terms of its contracts with the original recipients of the copies at issue christenson,as a downstream distributor,did not have this information.he thus urged the court to place the burden on adobe to disprove the first sale doctrine.with this burden in mind,christenson asserted that adobe could not disprove that a first sale occurred because adobe was unable to point to the terms of any actual contract.christenson also offered evidence of his purchase of copies of adobe software from third parties.christenson raised a nominative fair use defense to the trademark claim,arguing that he used adobe trademark only to refer to adobe genuine goods.
the scope of what the court could consider in deciding the for summary judgment proved a persistent point of dispute between the parties.after the parties filed their summary judgment motions,christenson filed a motion to preclude adobe from relying on contracts,licenses,or agreements that adobe failed to disclose under rule a.a.the magistrate judge granted this request and precluded adobe from using or introducing such documents except for those that had been produced by christenson.christenson then asked the district court to strike any excluded documents and related assertions from adobe already ripe motion for summary judgment.
the district court decided the motion to strike and motions for summary judgment in one order.ruling for christenson on the copyright claim,the court stated that it was uncontroverted that defendants lawfully purchased genuine copies of adobe software from suppliers before reselling those copies.reasoning that the burden shifted to adobe to produce evidence that it merely licenses and does not sell the relevant software,the court noted that adobe would be unable to do so because it was precluded from offering any licenses the actual terms of which were central to summary judgment.
the court granted christenson motion to strike a license template because the document had not been disclosed by adobe or produced by christenson.other evidence was precluded because the court determined that an actual contract was required to prove whether adobe transactions resulted in a license as opposed to a sale.i n the absence of those writings,the court foreclosed adobe declarants from testifying to prove the terms and legal effect of adobe licensing agreements.
christenson also prevailed on the trademark claim.the court credited his nominative fair use defense because he used the trademarks to refer to the trademarked goods themselves.the court rejected adobe false advertising theory because it was not included in the complaint.
finally,the court denied adobe motion for summary judgment on the counterclaims related to the press release.the court then stayed the surviving counterclaims and entered judgment in christenson favor on the copyright and trademark infringement claims pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,resulting in a final,appealable order.
copyright claima.prima facie case of copyright infringement 
to prevail on a claim of copyright infringement,adobe must prove ownership of a valid copyright and violation by christenson,the alleged infringer,of at least one of the exclusive rights conferred by the copyright act.umg recordings,augusto,cir.
adobe claims that it holds copyrights in a long list of different versions of familiar software titles,such as adobe photoshop for windows and macintosh,adobe photoshop extended for windows and macintosh,adobe photoshop,and adobe photoshop extended.each new version reflects the result of revisions and additions to the underlying source code of the initial program.as proof of ownership,adobe submitted the certificates of registration and the registration numbers for each listed title.christenson does not dispute that the adobe products he bought and sold are on adobe list or that the listed titles are subject to copyright protection.adobe thus established ownership of valid copyrights of a long list of computer software.see c t he certificate of a registration made before or within five years after first publication of the work shall constitute prima facie evidence of the validity of the copyright and of the facts stated in the certificate.
the copyright act confers several exclusive rights on copyright owners,including the right of distribution.granting a right to distribute copies of the copyrighted work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership,or by rental,lease,or lending.no factual dispute exists that,through the software surplus website,christenson sold copies of adobe copyrighted works without authorization from adobe.christenson did not establish any difference between the software titles listed by adobe,shown in screenshots of the software surplus website,and those that he sold.adobe easily established a prima facie case of copyright infringement.
b.the first sale defense 
in the face of an otherwise slam dunk copyright violation,christenson asserts that his conduct fell within an exception to adobe distribution rights under the first sale doctrine.under the copyright act,this affirmative defense provides that the owner of a particular copy lawfully made under this title,or any person authorized by such owner,is entitled,without the authority of the copyright owner,to sell or otherwise dispose of the possession of that copy a.the practical effect of this language is to significantly circumscribe a copyright owner exclusive distribution right only to the first sale of the copyrighted work because once the copyright owner places a copyrighted item in the stream of commerce by selling it,he has exhausted his exclusive statutory right to control its distribution.quality king,research int l,see also vernor autodesk,cir a copyright owner exclusive distribution right is exhausted after the owner first sale of a particular copy of the copyrighted work.before answering the question left open in augusto of who bears the burden of proof as to this defense,it is important to understand the contours of the term sale.see augusto,at.
in digital copyright cases,the distinction between a sale and a license has become central.but this distinction did not arise with the advent of computer software.as early as,the supreme court recognized that a sale creates a defense to a copyright claim while a license does not.see bobbs merrill.straus,bobbs merrill held the copyright to the novel the castaway and sued macy company for copyright infringement.each copy of the book had a notice on the title page that the retail price was one dollar and a sale at a less price will be treated as an infringement of the copyright.id.at.macy purchased copies of the book at a discount and intended to sell them for less than a dollar.the court held that bobbs merrill did not have a right to control future sales of macy copies because a copyright owner who has sold a copyrighted article,without restriction,has parted with all right to control the sale of it.id.at emphasis added.
shortly after the bobbs merrill decision,congress codified the first sale doctrine in the copyright act of.in this initial statutory iteration,the first sale rule did not explicitly require the defendant to own the copy at issue 
that the copyright is distinct from the property in the material object copyrighted,and the sale or conveyance,by gift or otherwise,of the material object shall not of itself constitute a transfer of the copyright,nor shall the assignment of the copyright constitute a transfer of the title to the material object but nothing in this act shall be deemed to forbid,prevent,or restrict the transfer of any copy of a copyrighted work the possession of which has been lawfully obtained.
congress amended the copyright act in and revised the first sale defense.a.unlike its predecessor,the amended statute explicitly required that a defendant raising a first sale defense own the copy at issue.id.limiting the first sale defense to the owner of a particular copy emphasis added.the first sale defense did not extend to any person who has acquired possession of the copy from the copyright owner,by rental,lease,loan,or otherwise,without acquiring ownership of it.id.at d.the legislative history confirms that congress intended to restate and confirm the principle that,where the copyright owner has transferred ownership of a particular copy of a work,the person to whom the copy is transferred is entitled to dispose of it by sale,rental,or any other means,at emphasis added,reprinted in.
the supreme court first analyzed a in quality king.distinguishing between the owner of a copy and a,such as a licensee,the court emphasized that because the protection afforded by a is available only to the owner of a lawfully made copy or someone authorized by the owner,the first sale doctrine would not provide a defense to any nonowner such as a bailee,a licensee,a consignee,or one whose possession of the copy was unlawful.at.in other words,to claim the benefits of the first sale defense,the holder of the copy must actually hold title.
section a focus on ownership takes on a special significance in the digital context.in a world where licensing agreements are ubiquitous,license agreements,rather than sales,have become the predominate form of the transfer of rights to use copyrighted software material.apple,psystar,cir.in practice,because the first sale doctrine does not apply to a licensee,licensing arrangements enable software companies to restrict initial licensees of software from selling their licensed copies of the software to downstream users.
broadly construed,the licensing exception in the software context could swallow the statutory first sale defense.we have recognized,however,that some purported software licensing agreements may actually create a sale.see vernor,at augusto,at.to determine whether there is a legitimate license,we examine whether the copyright owner specifies that the user is granted a license significantly restricts the user ability to transfer the software and imposes notable use restrictions.vernor,at.where these factors are satisfied,the upshot is that the copyright holder has sold its software to the user,and the user can assert the first sale defense.see augusto,at.
in the software copyright context,a dispute about the first sale defense raises several questions first,which party the copyright holder or the party asserting the defense bears the initial burden of showing ownership through lawful acquisition second,what does it take to discharge that burden and finally,which party bears the burden of proving or disproving a license versus a sale general principles of evidence,coupled with the statute and the legislative history,provide the answer.
the burden of proof for an affirmative defense to a civil claim generally falls on the party asserting the defense.this same principle holds true in copyright.see melville nimmer david nimmer,nimmer on copyright f a s a matter of definition,the defendant bears the burden of proof as to all affirmative defenses.for example,in claiming the fair use defense to copyright infringement,it is the proponent burden to come forward with favorable evidence about relevant markets to establish the effect of the challenged use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.campbell acuff rose music.another key example is found in the digital milleniu
