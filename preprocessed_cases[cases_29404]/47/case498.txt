in this case of first impression in california,we hold that when a plaintiff deliberate and egregious misconduct makes any sanction other than dismissal inadequate to ensure a fair trial,the trial court has inherent power to impose a terminating sanction.
in,plaintiff stephen slesinger,ssi sued defendant the walt disney company disney,alleging that disney failed to pay certain royalties under its licensing agreement with ssi.that agreement granted disney rights to exploit the winnie the pooh series of children that ssi founder had obtained in from pooh creator,milne.in or,to assist in prosecuting its lawsuit,ssi hired an investigator to surreptitiously obtain disney documents.other than a purported admonition to obey the law,ssi provided no direction or supervision for the investigator activities.working at least until,the investigator took thousands of pages belonging to disney,including documents marked privileged and confidential.he obtained the documents by breaking into an uncertain number of disney office buildings and secure trash receptacles,and by trespassing onto the secure facility of the company with which disney had contracted to destroy its confidential documents.the documents were passed on to ssi attorneys and principals,who reviewed them,but kept no records of the documents they received or of those they discarded.until,ssi concealed the investigator activities from disney and the court.in,following an evidentiary hearing on a motion by disney for a terminating sanction,the trial court concluded that no lesser sanction could protect disney against ssi use of information.therefore,as an exercise of its inherent power,the court dismissed ssi lawsuit with prejudice.
on ssi appeal from the terminating sanction,we conclude that california trial courts have inherent power to issue a terminating sanction when a plaintiff misconduct is deliberate,is egregious,and makes lesser sanctions inadequate to ensure a fair trial.because substantial evidence shows that ssi misconduct meets this standard,we also conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing ssi case as an exercise of the court inherent power.
factual and procedural background 
the litigation 
british author milne created the winnie the pooh series of children stories.in,stephen slesinger acquired from milne the rights to commercially exploit the works in the united states and canada.stephen slesinger formed a corporation,ssi,to which he assigned the pooh rights.in,ssi licensed certain rights of commercial exploitation to disney.ssi and disney modified their licensing agreement several times.in,they executed a new contract,which became the focus of the instant litigation.
in february,ssi sued disney for breach of contract,fraud,and declaratory relief.in the operative third amended complaint,ssi alleged that disney breached its contractual obligations to account and pay for its exploitation of the pooh rights under the agreement,including sales of pooh merchandise.ssi also alleged that during the negotiations leading to the agreement disney misrepresented,among other things,the items for which it would pay royalties,and that disney thereafter misrepresented its compliance with its contractual obligations to account for royalties.in its declaratory relief claim,ssi sought a declaration that it could terminate the contract based on disney breaches.
lengthy,bitter litigation followed,occasioned by claims and counterclaims of misconduct.in,ssi obtained evidentiary and monetary sanctions against disney for destroying substantial portions of the files of vincent jefferds,a senior disney who was disney principal representative in negotiating the licensing agreement.a key dispute in ssi lawsuit involves representations allegedly made by jefferds during the negotiations.
having obtained sanctions against disney,however,ssi fell victim to its own litigation abuses.in,disney moved for a terminating sanction against ssi,alleging that ssi had committed pervasive misconduct.in february,the trial court a different judge from the one who had sanctioned disney held a evidentiary hearing on disney motion.the evidence was complex and conflicting it included,among other things,live testimony,deposition testimony,witness declarations,correspondence between the parties,and prior discovery pleadings.what emerged was a portrait of litigation misconduct run riot,involving ssi employment of an investigator,terry lee sands,to take documents from disney facilities and trash receptacles as well as the secure facility of the document destruction firm retained by disney.we summarize the entire record under the applicable standard of review in the light most favorable to the trial court ruling terminating ssi lawsuit,drawing all inferences in support of the trial court ruling which are reasonably supported by the evidence.see laguna auto body farmers ins.exchange d.laguna.
ssi principals and agents,and the hiring of terry lee sands 
ssi is a family run corporation.during the period relevant to this appeal,its sole corporate officer president and sole board member was shirley slesinger lasswell,widow of ssi founder stephen slesinger.lasswell was responsible for managing ssi.she lived in florida,and kept ssi winnie the pooh files in her office there.lasswell died while this appeal was pending.
ssi sole shareholder is pati slesinger,lasswell daughter by stephen slesinger.pati slesinger managed ssi lawsuit against disney from the inception,keeping in close contact with lasswell.
one of ssi agents was david bentson,pati slesinger husband bentson performed many tasks to assist ssi in its lawsuit,and worked directly with terry lee sands,the investigator whose conduct lies at the heart of disney sanction motion.
sands was never a licensed private investigator.nonetheless,in or he was working for the nick harris detective agency when the agency was hired by ssi,marshall morgan,to work on ssi lawsuit within a month,sands began working directly with david bentson and attorney morgan.his assignment was to help ssi prosecute its lawsuit by surreptitiously obtaining disney documents.
sands employment lasted at least until,and probably longer based on the advice of ssi counsel,bentson admonished sands to make sure what you doing is legal and that you do it by the book.bentson,however,took no steps to ensure that sands obeyed the admonition.as bentson testified at the sanction hearing,that was my job all i did was pay his bills and receive documents.bentson would pass the documents delivered by sands on to ssi attorneys.he also reviewed at least some of them.those he believed might be of interest to lasswell he faxed to her in florida.in his sanction hearing testimony,he did not know how many documents he faxed to lasswell it could have been two,it could have been five.bentson and pati slesinger also reviewed some of the documents together at the offices of ssi lawyers.
with no supervision by ssi,sands was free to obtain disney documents as he saw fit.although ssi first employed sands in or to take disney documents,it did not reveal that fact until march.in the interim,disney knowledge of sands activities evolved by starts and spurts,beginning with two anonymous telephone calls received by disney security in june.
the anonymous june calls 
disney security received the first anonymous call on june.according to the report of the call prepared by a disney security officer,the caller said that he worked for a david unknown last name and worked with a terry lee sands.the caller explained that he and terry knew when disney had their days for trash and went to their dumpster locations,broke in and took copies of documents that included contracts and royalties for the animated feature winnie the poo h t hey would take paperwork from locations in northridge,burbank,glendale and trash cans on flower street.t here was even one incident where they were able to get past the security guard at the olive building,enter some of the offices and take documents,contracts off the desks.the caller said that he was giving disney this information because he had not been paid for his services.
the second call occurred two weeks later,on june.according to the security report,the caller reiterated that he and terry lee sands were hired by david to go through disney trash and take contracts,papers and other documents relating to a court case going on now involving licensees,contracts and underpayment of royalties by disney for winnie the pooh items t hey were able to obtain information that would be harmful to disney if it ever came out.the caller said that he was upset because david and terry had learned of his first call and were after him.
disney security investigated the calls,but found no reports that documents were missing.further,a personnel history on terry lee sands produced no information.therefore,disney security placed the investigation in abeyance awaiting further developments.
disney did not learn the identity of the anonymous caller until november,when it deposed richard dale holman,one of terry lee sands associates.in his deposition testimony,holman,admitted that he had made the calls.
ssi possession of the restricted items list 
after disney security inquiry,the next significant development occurred in october.then,in a letter to disney attorneys that served as a prelude to discovery litigation,ssi counsel revealed that ssi had recently found certain documents in its file,and had no record as to the source.the documents were pages from the restricted items list,a document maintained by disney counsel.the document summarized information relating to disney exclusive licenses with third parties.
as created by disney,the cover page of the restricted items list declared the document to be confidential.further,the document included a section labeled corporate participants.a footer at the bottom of each page of this section stated internal use only.the pages disclosed by ssi,however,did not include the cover page or any page bearing the confidentiality footer.
characterizing the pages as privileged internal documents,disney demanded their return and an explanation for ssi possession of them.in a series of correspondence,ssi attorneys refused to return the documents,denied that ssi had any knowledge about how it came to possess them,and filed a motion to require disney to turn over more such documents.ssi asserted,among other things,that nothing on the documents indicated that they were privileged or confidential,or that disney treated them as such.
on october,disney deposed shirley lasswell in her deposition testimony,lasswell testified that she had never heard of terry lee sands.she denied having hired an investigator with respect to winnie the pooh issues,and denied having authorized anyone in her family to do so.asked if she knew ssi was taking documents from disney offices and trash,she replied i do know where you got that from.i do know anything like that.i do recall anything like that.confronted with a copy of the restricted items list recently produced by ssi,lasswell testified that she did not recognize the documents and did not know what they were.
after lasswell october deposition,lasswell asked pati slesinger why she had been questioned about ssi use of an investigator to take documents.slesinger told her that an investigator had been retained to go through disney garbage.
because ssi refused to return the confidential documents from the restricted items list,disney moved for a protective order in march.ssi opposition to that request reiterated that it had no reason to believe the documents were confidential and insisted it did not know how it obtained them.before the motion was heard,however,ssi agreed to return all copies it had.accepting that representation,disney took its motion for a protective order off calendar.
ssi possession of the patterson memorandum and the kaplan note 
in november,ssi revealed to disney that it possessed the patterson memorandum and the kaplan note.
the patterson memorandum was written on disney letterhead by thomas patterson,a disney accountant,to carrie stone,disney of merchandising.the memorandum is undated.however,carrie stone worked for disney only from october to may.therefore,the memorandum was written sometime during that period,at least four and a half years after ssi filed suit in february.
in the memorandum,patterson requested a full breakdown on all pooh merchandising for the years to,to complete his research for corporate legal.he then stated there appears to be faulty accounting at best,on the audits we discussed.there is also a tremendous amount of returned goods i can not account for.it appears most records have been stored on disk and removed from the system.
the kaplan note is handwritten,dated october,on disney letterhead.its designation comes from the notation that a copy was sent to larry kaplan,a disney attorney.the note reads i think it would be advantageous on our part if we moved all the slesinger files to our southern location.
when produced by ssi,neither the patterson memorandum nor the kaplan note bore a bates stamp that would indicate that disney had produced it in discovery.moreover,as disney later learned,ssi had redacted fax transmission headers showing that the kaplan note had been sent from slesinger office to ssi fax transmission consistent with bentson practice of receiving documents from sands,and faxing them to ssi attorneys.
over the next six months,disney repeatedly sought an explanation for ssi possession of the two documents.ssi insisted it did not know how or why it came to have them.
in january,ssi served discovery responses,verified by lasswell,stating that both the patterson memorandum and the kaplan note had been produced by disney in discovery and that ssi had no other disney documents that lacked a bates stamp.by that time,pati slesinger had told lasswell that ssi used an investigator to search disney garbage.also,of course,pati slesinger and david bentson were well aware of sands activities.but lasswell verified discovery response on behalf of ssi made no mention of sands as the source of the documents.
not satisfied with ssi explanation,disney demanded clarification put bluntly,someone associated with ssi received these two documents and thus knows the means by which ssi came into possession of them.ssi response,again verified by shirley lasswell,was ssi believes each document was produced by disney.each document appears to be written by disney personnel.ssi does not recall further specific details responsive to this request.
ssi disclosure of sands employment 
not until the march,deposition of pati slesinger did ssi acknowledge that it had employed terry lee sands to take disney documents.in that deposition,slesinger testified that a prior ssi attorney,marshall morgan,had hired a detective agency,nick harris detectives.slesinger had met with one of the detectives,terry lee sands,whom ssi employed j ust to obtain information,including documents.
on june,disney served sands with a notice of deposition and a request that he produce copies of all documents found in his investigation for ssi.however,when sands appeared for the deposition in september,he produced no documents.he testified that when served with the subpoena on june,he did have any documents.later evidence revealed that ssi greenberg glusker see fn,ante were in possession of the june,file,consisting of pages contained in a folder labeled documents received from terry sands on,a date three days before sands was served.
during his deposition,sands admitted that he had taken disney documents,but testified that he had done so only from publicly accessible dumpsters.he also testified that he kept no records of the documents he had given to ssi.
after sands deposition,disney immediately wrote ssi,demanding copies of all of the documents and other materials taken from disney trash receptacles or other locations or surreptitiously received from any person.through counsel,ssi responded that the discarded papers sands had found were never used in the litigation in any way t hey have had no impact on the proceedings at all.
ssi production of more than pages of disney documents 
in october,pursuant to subpoenas issued by disney,ssi began producing what turned out to be more than pages of disney documents taken by sands.the documents were produced from files maintained by pati slesinger,shirley lasswell and ssi counsel.the documents were accompanied by a redaction log showing that ssi had redacted handwritten comments as being privileged on the grounds of and work product privilege.as to those with a designated author,of the redacted comments were written by pati slesinger and by david bentson.also,ssi represented that it had discarded many of the disney documents that sands had taken,and that it had no record about which documents it discarded and when.
among the documents ssi did produce were the following.
two versions of the restricted items list 
we have already mentioned the restricted items document maintained by disney counsel summarizing information relating to disney exclusive licenses with third parties.in october,when ssi first revealed to disney that it possessed pages of the document,ssi represented that nothing on the pages it possessed suggested they were confidential.
in,however,ssi produced to disney two copies of the restricted items list.the first copy came from the files of ssi attorneys.it contained the cover page as created by disney with the declaration of confidentiality.it also contained the corporate participants section with the footer on each page declaring internal use only.the second copy came from files maintained by pati slesinger.the cover page in this copy lacked the confidentiality declaration that appeared on the disney original.this copy also lacked the confidential corporate participants section.
ii.two versions of the interrogatory tables 
the interrogatory tables are a series of documents prepared by disney consumer products relating to winnie the pooh products for the period.as created by disney,each page of the tables had a footer reading attorney work product.privileged and confidential.created at the request of counsel.no copy of the tables originating from disney lacked this footer.
ssi produced two sets of the interrogatory tables.one set,from counsel files,contained the confidentiality footer.the other set,from pati slesinger files,did not.
iii.the fuller memorandum 
the fuller memorandum was written by kathy fuller,a legal assistant for disney,on office of counsel stationary and dated july.it was directed to edward nowak,disney senior litigation attorney handling ssi lawsuit.fuller wrote the memorandum to help prepare disney defense in the case.the subject line reads slesinger disney.the following legend appears immediately above the text of the memorandum privileged and confidential.in the memorandum,fuller refers to attorney nowak inquiry regarding how merchandise sales differ from videocassette sales.the memorandum analyzes the definition of merchandise and discusses one of the key issues in the lawsuit whether disney was contractually obligated to pay ssi royalties on the sale of winnie the pooh videocassettes also,the fuller memorandum is one of the documents from which ssi redacted notations made by pati slesinger.
iv.the suit overview document 
the suit overview document is an document prepared by disney strategic planning department in consultation with its attorneys.the document,though apparently a preliminary draft,distilled the central issues of the lawsuit and assigned a risk analysis to potential outcomes 
all draft copies of the document found in disney files had a cover page declaring,privileged work product.however,the copy produced by ssi lacked that cover page.
v.the june,file 
we have already mentioned the june,file folder that was labeled documents received from terry sands on,and that contained pages of disney documents,including an internal disney news summary dated june.in september,ssi jones day produced the file,which it had received from ssi immediately preceding counsel greenberg glusker.the file also contained,among other things,a july audit report addressed and delivered to vincent jefferds the disney senior who had negotiated the contract with ssi and two complete files belonging to disney executive wendall mohler.mohler files,which included memoranda written on office of counsel letterhead,were in pristine condition.
at the sanction hearing,ssi could provide no explanation for its counsel possession of the contents of the file.slesinger disclaimed any knowledge of the file.sands did not recognize it.a representative of greenberg glusker did not know how the firm came to possess it 
ssi motion seeking permission to use the patterson memorandum 
in the midst of disgorging disney documents,ssi filed,in october,a motion re discarded document.in the motion,ssi requested judicial approval to use the patterson memorandum at trial.although ssi had earlier characterized the discarded disney documents obtained by sands as having no impact on the proceedings at all,ssi now characterized the patterson memorandum as highly relevant to its claim that disney had defrauded ssi in accounting for winnie the pooh revenues.further,although ssi had first represented that it did not know how it obtained the document,and had later represented through shirley lasswell verified discovery responses that disney had produced it during discovery,ssi now presented a different explanation the document was found in a disney trash bin between and.
ssi motion was supported by declarations from sands and david bentson.in his declaration,sands stated that at some point between approximately and,he found the patterson memorandum in a publicly accessible dumpster at a burbank disney office,and delivered it to bentson.in his declaration,bentson explained that he recognized the patterson memorandum as one of the papers sands brought to me from the disney trash in the early to.
ssi motion sought a ruling that by allegedly placing the memorandum in the trash,disney had abandoned it and therefore waived the privilege.ssi motion was pending when,in february,disney moved for a terminating sanction based on ssi pervasive misconduct and illegal activities.
the scope of sands searches 
at the sanction hearing ssi did not dispute that it employed sands to take disney documents.it contended,however,that sands took documents from trash dumpsters at only one buena vista plaza building at west olive in burbank.it also contended that the dumpsters were accessible to the public,and that sands violated no law.
in addition to the buena vista plaza building,disney conducts business at three other locations in burbank,and two in glendale from to,disney contracted with golden state fibres golden state to collect and destroy confidential disney documents from its four burbank facilities.golden state document destruction facility is located in canoga park it is secure,surrounded by fences and walls.golden state handled its responsibilities as follows.golden state supplied the main studio lot with locking,yard metal bins in which documents slated for destruction were placed.the bins were placed inside of the gated and guarded perimeter of the studio lot,an area not open or accessible to the public.once a week,golden state employees came to the lot,locked the bins,loaded the bins onto a flatbed truck,secured the bins with rope,and transported them to canoga park.at the three other burbank disney locations including the buena vista plaza,golden state provided floor bins which were placed inside the disney offices in areas not available or accessible to the public.golden state employees collected the documents from the containers,placed them in plastic carts,and loaded the carts into locked trucks for transport to canoga park.generally,golden state destroyed documents the day of receipt.if not,the locked bins taken from the main studio lot were locked inside of golden state plant and the carts containing the documents from the other disney facilities remained in the trucks secured by padlocks parked inside of the golden state facility.
sands began his activities by obtaining an internal disney directory to help locate the offices of various individuals.in testimony specifically disbelieved by the trial court,sands claimed to have consulted the police,who told him that there was no law prohibiting his going into a dumpster located next to a public alleyway.he also claimed,again in testimony specifically disbelieved by the trial court,to have ultimately obtained documents only from publicly accessible dumpsters at the buena vista plaza building,and never to have obtained documents from the golden state facility in canoga park.
at some point in or,pati slesinger and david bentson visited the buena vista plaza site by stopping their car nearby and looking at it.they wanted to confirm that it was,according to slesinger testimony at the sanction hearing,open and public,and i guess legal,too.slesinger found the site to be on a publicly accessible road,and hence she determined that sands seizure of documents from the site seemed,yes,legal.
despite sands testimony that he searched only publicly accessible dumpsters at the buena vista plaza building in burbank,there was considerable evidence credited by the trial court that his searches were much broader,and included golden state secure facility in canoga park.earlier statements by sands himself contradicted the notion that he limited his searches to one location,and suggested two or more locations moreover,although sands denied taking documents from golden state,he testified that he knew golden state destroyed disney documents,and that he followed golden state trucks from at least one disney building to that location 
in the first of his two anonymous telephone calls to disney security in,richard holman reported that he and sands took documents from locations in northridge,burbank,glendale and trash cans on flower street and on one occasion were able to get past the security guard at the olive building,enter some of the offices and take documents,contracts off the desks.holman,son,richard dale holman,provided a declaration from which it could be inferred that sands took documents from golden state and another facility.in the declaration,holman,stated that he went on a few trash searches with sands.born in august,holman,would have been to years old in the period to.according to holman,t wo searches occurred at the waste management facility in the san fernando valley.a third search occurred farther west in the san fernando valley.likely reseda or canoga park.at this location,terry and i went onto the property through a hole in the fence at the back of the property.terry said i went along as an alibi in case a security guard came.during all three searches,i held a duffel bag while it was filled with legal documents.during all three searches,we removed approximately or inches tall of documents.
golden state canoga park facility was secure,surrounded by fences and walls.thus,holman,claim to have entered a canoga park or reseda facility with sands through a hole in the fence,and to have held a duffel bag while sands filled it with documents,suggested that sands illegally entered golden state facility,and stole,from either locked trucks or the locked plant,disney documents that were intended for destruction 
finally,the nature of some of the documents sands passed on to ssi suggested that he could not have obtained them from the buena vista plaza building.neither the author of the patterson memorandum thomas patterson,nor its intended recipient carrie stone,ever worked at buena vista plaza.the restricted items list was kept by disney counsel,whose office was in the tower building located on west alameda in burbank.kathy fuller,author of the fuller memorandum,and the intended recipient disney attorney edward nowak worked at the team disney building,located on the disney studio lot at south buena vista.similarly,disney strategic planning department,which prepared the suit overview document,was located in the team disney building.finally,the june,file contained an audit report sent to vincent jefferds the disney senior who negotiated the contract with ssi,and two complete files in pristine form belonging to another disney executive,wendall mohler.neither jefferds nor mohler ever worked at buena vista plaza.
no evidence suggested how these various documents could have ended up in the trash at the buena vista plaza building.there was,however,evidence suggesting how the documents,nonetheless,ended up in ssi possession.either sands entered one or more of disney burbank facilities and took the documents from the bins provided by golden state for disposal of confidential documents or sands trespassed onto golden state facility in canoga park and took the documents before golden state had a chance to destroy them.
ssi alteration of disney documents 
disney presented circumstantial evidence that pati slesinger or someone else on ssi behalf altered copies of the restricted items list and the interrogatory tables after receiving them from sands to delete any reference to their confidentiality.
at the sanction hearing,erich speckin,a forensic document specialist,testified that he had examined the two copies of the restricted items list and of the interrogatory tables produced by ssi in.as we have already noted,the copy of restricted items list from the files of ssi attorneys contained the cover page with the declaration of confidentiality as created by disney,and the corporate participants section with the footer on each page declaring internal use only.the copy from pati slesinger files,however,contained a cover page that lacked the confidentiality declaration.also,slesinger copy did not contain the confidential corporate participants section.
similarly,the copy of the interrogatory tables from the files of ssi attorneys contained the footer created by disney on each page declaring attorney work product.privileged and confidential.created at the request of counsel.but the copy from slesinger files lacked the footer.
according to speckin,slesinger copies of the documents were made from the sets possessed by ssi counsel.in other words,slesinger or someone else had altered the cover page of the restricted items list to delete its confidentiality declaration in slesinger copy omitted the confidential corporate participants section from slesinger copy and altered each page of the interrogatory tables to delete its confidentiality footer in slesinger copy.
pati slesinger denied having altered the documents or having directed anyone else to do so.
the fax legends 
copies of several documents produced by ssi contained fax legends tracing them to slesinger and lasswell offices,as well as the offices of ssi counsel.among these documents was a copy of the fuller memorandum,which contained a fax header indicating that in september it was sent to ssi attorneys from slesinger office.
similarly,a copy of a page from the interrogatory tables contained a legend showing the fax numbers of pati slesinger office in beverly hills and shirley lasswell office in florida.the legend indicated that in september,the page was faxed from slesinger office to lasswell office.the page contained the footer stating the page to be confidential.a copy of the kaplan memorandum produced by ssi also bore two fax legends,one indicating it had been sent from slesinger office and another indicating receipt by ssi counsel.
the trial court ruling on disney sanction motion 
ssi opposition to disney sanction motion raised three primary arguments first,that sands had taken documents only from publicly accessible dumpsters at the buena vista plaza second,that disney had created both confidential and sets of the restricted items list and interrogatory tables,and ssi had not altered the copies in its possession and third,that none of the documents taken by sands was useful to ssi.
the trial court issued a comprehensive statement of decision.the court found that sands had taken documents from multiple disney locales and the golden state facility committing civil trespass in the process,and that ssi had either explicitly or implicitly authorized his activities.expressly finding pati slesinger not credible,the court found that she or someone else on ssi behalf had altered documents to make it appear they were not confidential.with respect to shirley lasswell,the court noted that although in her deposition testimony she denied knowing of sands activity,there were fax transmission headers to and from lasswell florida office on some of the confidential disney documents taken by sands.the court found that sands and ssi failure to keep records of the documents obtained by sands and of those discarded by ssi was not accidental,because ssi did not want the scope of sands activities disclosed.further,the court reasoned that ssi could give no satisfactory assurance that it had produced all the illicitly obtained documents it possessed,leading the court to conclude that ssi likely possessed additional such documents.
concerning the disney documents ssi did produce,the court found them to reveal,among other things,privileged information useful to ssi.the court considered,but rejected,lesser sanctions,including an order that ssi return all disney documents,and an order for monetary sanctions.the court reasoned that ssi principals who read disney writings possess in their minds information which no court order or sanction can purge.the court does not believe ssi will comply fully with any future remedial order if ssi concludes,as it apparently has in the past,that compliance with a court order does not serve its private tactical objectives.the court concluded ssi has tampered with the administration of justice and threatened the integrity of the judicial process.ssi misconduct is so egregious that no remedy short of terminating sanctions can effectively remove the threat and adequately protect both the institution of justice and disney from further ssi abuse.exercising its inherent powers to preserve and protect the integrity of the judicial process,the court dismisses ssi action with prejudice as a terminating sanction.
ssi motion for a new trial 
ssi moved for a new trial,limited to the issue of the appropriate remedy for ssi misconduct.for the first time,ssi proposed an alternative to a terminating sanction,consisting of a change in trial counsel,employment of document review counsel to isolate tainted documents from new trial counsel,and a series of prophylactic court orders the proposal was supported by declarations from ssi attorneys who had reviewed the disney documents taken by sands.each concluded that the documents would add nothing to ssi case.further,ssi argued that its proposal did not rely on promises or assurances by ssi or by its principals.ssi presented no declarations from slesinger,lasswell,or bentson concerning their use or retention of stolen documents.
the trial court denied ssi motion for a new trial.it explained that ssi proposed remedy could not purge the illicitly obtained information from the minds of ssi principals,and could not assure that they would not use the information in shaping ssi litigation strategy.
discussion 
inherent power to dismiss 
ssi presents a challenge to the trial court reliance on its inherent power to dismiss ssi lawsuit.according to ssi,california trial courts have no inherent power to dismiss a case as a sanction for misconduct.relying primarily on lyons wickhorst cal d,lyons,and bauguess paine cal d,bauguess,ssi asserts that a trial court inherent power to terminate litigation is confined to cases in which the plaintiff has unreasonably delayed in prosecuting the action,or in which the plaintiff claim is a sham or fictitious.further,ssi argues that the existence of an inherent power to dismiss is inconsistent with the state constitutional right to a jury trial.finally,ssi suggests that even if the inherent power to terminate an action for misconduct exists,the power can be exercised only when the party to be sanctioned has violated a court order.
none of ssi contentions is.ssi misconstrues lyons and bauguess,and misconceives the nature and scope of inherent judicial power.
the doctrine of inherent judicial is,the existence of power vested in courts by their creation,and independent of legislative early in english common law along two paths,namely,punishment for contempt of court and of its process,and regulating the practice of the court and preventing the abuse of its process.jacob,current legal problems.american courts embraced the doctrine as part of their heritage.as early expressed by the united states supreme court,courts possess powers that necessarily result from the nature of their institution,powers that can not be dispensed with,because they are necessary to the exercise of all others.hudson cranch.see meador,inherent judicial authority in the conduct of civil litigation,texas law review.
from their creation by article vi,section,of the california constitution,california courts received broad inherent power not confined by or dependent on statute.walker superior court cal d,see also civil code section ferguson keays cal d,ferguson california courts possess inherent powers enjoyed by english common law courts,except for those precluded by.this inherent power includes fundamental inherent equity,supervisory,and administrative powers,as well as inherent power to control litigation.rutherford,cal th,d.although it has been held that california courts have inherent authority to impose evidentiary sanctions as a remedy for litigation misconduct see peat,marwick,mitchell superior court d.peat,no california decision has held that a court may,when faced with pervasive litigation abuse,use its inherent judicial power to dismiss the action.we have no doubt,however,that california courts possess such power.
past california decisions have affirmed dismissals as an exercise of inherent power in two situations.first,because delay in prosecution interferes with the orderly process of litigation and may make a fair trial unlikely,california courts have inherent power to dismiss civil cases for unreasonable,inexcusable delay in prosecution.people jefferds cal,karras western title ins.d.second,because courts should hear only actual disputes,and should prevent harassment of defendants,california courts possess the inherent authority to dismiss cases that are fraudulent or vexatious.estate of king d,cunha anglo california nat.bank d.
in lyons,supra,cal d,the supreme court observed that in the past the inherent power to terminate litigation has been confined to these two types of situations.id.at.but this in not an exhaustive listing of the circumstances in which dismissal as an exercise of inherent power is authorized.to the contrary,lyons implicitly acknowledged that a court has inherent power to dismiss an action for misconduct that violates established procedures or a court order.lyons held simply that the misconduct involved in that plaintiff refusal to participate in mandatory judicial not an adequate ground to exercise that power.a close examination of lyons demonstrates the point.
in lyons,the trial court ordered the parties to participate in mandatory judicial arbitration pursuant to the version of code of civil procedure section.id.at.the plaintiff refused,resulting in a defense award.the plaintiff requested a trial de novo,but on defense motion,the trial court dismissed the action as a sanction for the plaintiff refusal to participate in the judicial arbitration.id.at.on appeal as here relevant,the majority opinion analyzed the dismissal in part as an exercise of inherent judicial power.besides noting that past exercise of the inherent power to dismiss had been confined to cases involving failure to prosecute and fictitious or sham claims,the majority looked also to lower federal court decisions construing the power to dismiss under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure for a violation of the federal rules of civil procedure or failure to comply with a court order.the majority recognized that federal courts have inherent power to dismiss an action sua sponte for the same reasons.id.at.
the lyons majority summarized federal case law as follows as demonstrated by the federal cases construing rule b,there are two important inquiries to be made by trial courts when determining whether a plaintiff actions warrant a dismissal with prejudice.first,the court must discern whether the plaintiff pattern of conduct was so severe and deliberate as to constitute extreme circumstances.citation.second,the court must look to see whether alternatives less severe than dismissal are available.the sound exercise of discretion requires the judge to consider and use lesser sanctions unless the court authority can not possibly be otherwise vindicated.citation.id.at.
the majority used this analysis to examine the circumstances under which the plaintiff motion for a trial de novo was dismissed.ibid.the majority held that dismissal as a sanction for refusing to participate in mandatory judicial arbitration was too drastic a remedy in light of the fact that arbitration was not intended to supplant traditional trial proceedings,but to expedite the resolution of small civil claims.id.at.
a minority agreed with the majority opinion conclusion that dismissal here was too drastic a penalty for appellant refusal to present evidence at the arbitration proceedings.id.at,reynoso,conc.but the minority would have left open the question whether,in a particularly egregious case,a trial court would have inherent power to dismiss the action.id.at.
nothing in the lyons majority opinion precludes the use of inherent power to terminate litigation as a remedy for litigation misconduct other than refusal to participate in mandatory judicial arbitration.to the contrary,the lyons majority acknowledges the existence of inherent power to dismiss an action for misconduct violating established procedures or a court order,but limits its exercise to extreme circumstances of deliberate misconduct when no lesser sanction would be effective to cure the harm.see witkin,cal.procedure ed.proceedings without trial,citing lyons,supra,cal d at,and observing that the trial court inherent power to dismiss is limited to extreme circumstances where the court authority can not possibly be otherwise vindicated.
ssi also argues that bauguess,supra,cal d,militates against finding an inherent power to dismiss for litigation misconduct.in bauguess,the supreme court held that trial courts have no authority to award attorney fees as a sanction for misconduct unless granted by statute or specified by contract.id.at.the court recognized the existence of inherent judicial power to supervise judicial proceedings,but reasoned that inherent power to award attorney fees as a sanction was unnecessary,because courts have ample power to punish the misconduct as contempt.id.at.moreover,the court concluded that approving such power was unwise,because it may imperil the independence of the bar and thereby undermine the adversary system ibid and because it would be a power without procedural limits and potentially subject to abuse ibid.
the rationale of bauguess does not apply here.far from being unnecessary,the existence of inherent power to terminate litigation for deliberate and egregious which makes lesser sanctions inadequate to ensure a fair essential for the court to preserve the integrity of its proceedings.such power does not imperil the independence of the bar and undermine the adversary system.bauguess,supra,cal d at.rather,it restores balance to the adversary system when the misconduct of one party has destroyed it.and,as illustrated by the instant case,such power can be exercised with full procedural due process the trial court held a noticed evidentiary hearing,and ssi makes no claim that the procedure violated its due process rights.bauguess is simply inapposite.
the recognition that california courts have inherent power to terminate litigation for deliberate and egregious misconduct when no other remedy can restore fairness is consistent with the overwhelming weight of authority from federal courts and courts of other states.see meador,supra,texas law review at terminating sanctions are generally acknowledged to be within a court inherent power,to be imposed only when lesser sanctions are inadequate.although nuances of analysis exist among these decisions,the general theory supporting them is straightforward courts can not lack the power to defend their integrity against unscrupulous marauders if that were so,it would place at risk the very fundament of the judicial system.aoude,supra,at.
california courts,too,retain flexibility to exercise historic inherent authority in modern circumstances,fashioning procedures and remedies as necessary to protect litigants rights.see board of supervisors superior court th,d cottle superior court th,d.when a plaintiff deliberate and egregious misconduct in the course of the litigation renders any sanction short of dismissal inadequate to protect the fairness of the trial,california courts necessarily have the power to preserve their integrity by dismissing the action.without such power,the court would sacrifice its essential role of determining,in accordance with the fair application of relevant law,who should prevail in the case or controversy presented.see schultz,supra,at.
there are,of course,limits on the inherent authority of california power may only be exercised to the extent not inconsistent with the federal or state constitution,or california statutory law.ferguson,supra,cal d at,martin superior court cal,see.ssi makes no claim that dismissal of the instant action violated federal constitutional principles with good reason,given the state of federal case law.see also gonzalez trinity marine group,cir,gonzalez dismissal of action for fabrication of evidence following evidentiary hearing does not violate right to a jury trial.
the only state constitutional impediment asserted by ssi is the right to a jury trial under article i,section,of the california constitution.ssi argues that without statutory authorization,litigation misconduct can not constitute a waiver of the right to a jury trial.see grafton partners superior court cal th,d,invalidating contractual jury waivers on the ground that waiver of a jury trial in civil cases is permitted only as authorized by statute.but the exercise of the inherent power to dismiss for deliberate and egregious misconduct does not rely on the fiction of an implied jury trial waiver.it relies,rather,on the power the court derives from its nature as an institution of justice,and on the acknowledgement that the right to a jury trial presupposes a fair trial,and that requiring a jury trial when fairness can not be assured would be unjust.
further,the exercise of the inherent power to dismiss,like all inherent authority,derives in part from the court historic powers in equity.see peat,supra,d at.cummings,supra,at aoude,supra,at.equitable defenses are tried to the judge alone the judge findings may well obviate a jury trial on remaining legal issues,without abridging the right to a jury trial.see nwosu uba th,d.when a court grants a motion seeking dismissal on the basis of the opposing party misconduct,the court does not violate the right to a jury trial,any more than when the court upholds other defenses in equity that defeat the plaintiff lawsuit.see schultz,supra,at holding evidentiary hearing,making credibility findings,and assessing need for sanctions does not violate right to a jury trial under wisconsin constitution.
just as no constitutional impediment to the existence of inherent power to dismiss for pervasive misconduct exists,no legislative impediment exists,either.the legislature recognizes that courts possess inherent power to dismiss depriving the offending party of a jury circumstances not covered by statute.code of civil procedure section,the general dismissal statute,lists several grounds for involuntary dismissal.it also provides the provisions of this section shall not be deemed to be an exclusive enumeration of the court power to dismiss an action or dismiss a complaint as to a defendant,subd.m.similarly,chapter of the code,beginning with section,governs dismissal for delay in prosecution.section of that chapter states this chapter does not limit or affect the authority of a court to dismiss an action or impose other sanctions under a rule adopted by the court pursuant to section or by the judicial council pursuant to statute or otherwise under inherent authority of the court.italics added.similarly,the power to impose sanctions under the civil discovery act,et supplements,but does not supplant,a court inherent power to deal with litigation abuse.peat,supra,d at.
finally,contrary to ssi contention,a court exercise of inherent power to dismiss for misconduct need not be preceded by violation of a court order.the essential requirement is to calibrate the sanction to the wrong.whether the misconduct violates a court order is relevant to the exercise of inherent power,but it does not define the boundary of the power.see,cummings,supra,at witness tampering aoude,supra,at fabrication of evidence and other acts constituting a fraud on the court.the decision whether to exercise the inherent power to dismiss requires consideration of all relevant circumstances,including the nature of the misconduct which must be deliberate and egregious,but may or may not violate a prior court order,the strong preference for adjudicating claims on the merits,the integrity of the court as an institution of justice,the effect of the misconduct on a fair resolution of the case,and the availability of other sanctions to cure the harm see,aoude,supra,supra,at.we do not attempt to catalogue all the factors that must be considered in any particular case,except to emphasize that dismissal is always a drastic remedy to be employed only in the rarest of circumstances.we also do not attempt to catalogue the types of misconduct necessary to justify an exercise of the inherent power to dismiss,because corrupt intent knows no stylistic boundaries.aoude,supra,at.rather,we hold only that when the plaintiff has engaged in misconduct during the course of the litigation that is deliberate,that is egregious,and that renders any remedy short of dismissal inadequate to preserve the fairness of the trial,the trial court has the inherent power to dismiss the action such an exercise of inherent authority is essential for every california court to remain a place where justice is judicially administered.von schmidt widber cal,quoting blackstone commentary.
b.the trial court imposition of a terminating sanction was not an abuse of discretion 
having concluded that california trial courts possess the inherent power to issue a terminating sanction for pervasive misconduct,we now consider whether,in the present case,the trial court properly exercised that power.our review is for abuse of discretion.creative,creative cotton,th,d.we view the entire record in the light most favorable to the court ruling,and draw all reasonable inferences in support of it.see laguna,supra,d at.we also defer to the trial court credibility determinations.hurtado statewide home loan d.the trial court decision will be reversed only for manifest abuse exceeding the bounds of reason.kuhns state of california th,d.
ssi levels several attacks on the trial court ruling.none is persuasive,and we dispose of each in turn 
the timeliness of disney motion 
in the trial court,ssi argued that disney motion for a terminating sanction was untimely.on appeal,in its summary of the evidence,ssi implicitly resurrects the argument under the heading disney waited over eight years to complain about the trash searches.ssi asserts that richard holman,two anonymous telephone calls to disney security in june put disney legal team on notice as to the same trash searches and alleged that were the subject of the sanction motion in february,y et disney did not pursue this matter with the court or even complain to ssi about it for eight years.
we treat ssi assertion as a contention requiring discussion.in granting disney motion,the trial court implicitly rejected ssi contention that disney motion was untimely.see,sammis stafford th,d a reviewing court must infer that the trial court made all factual findings necessary to support its decision.substantial evidence supports the court implied ruling.
disney security investigated the anonymous calls,but found no information on which it could act.no other information surfaced until october,when ssi counsel revealed ssi possession of pages from the restricted items list.in its correspondence with disney concerning the documents,ssi denied that it had any knowledge as to the source of the documents.later,when disney deposed shirley lasswell in october,she denied any knowledge of sands,and any knowledge whether ssi had hired someone to take disney documents.after disney moved for a protective order in march,ssi opposition to that motion still insisted that ssi had no idea how it obtained the restricted items list.
under the evidence credited by the trial court,ssi responses were either intentionally false,or made with deliberate indifference to the truth.pati slesinger and ssi lawyers knew that sands had surreptitiously taken documents from disney property.ssi agent,david bentson,worked directly with sands,receiving the documents and disseminating them to slesinger,lasswell,and ssi attorneys.the court could reasonably infer that acting through its agents bentson and ssi lawyers and its principals slesinger and lasswell ssi either intentionally misled disney,or deliberately made no reasonable effort to trace the restricted items list to sands activities.nonetheless,ssi agreed to return all copies of the restricted items list it possessed,resulting in disney withdrawing its motion for a protective order.
in january,ssi served discovery responses,verified by lasswell,stating that both the patterson memorandum and the kaplan note had been produced by disney in discovery and that ssi had no other disney documents that lacked a bates stamp.by that time,of course,lasswell had been informed by pati slesinger that ssi had employed an investigator to search disney garbage,but her verified discovery response made no mention of this fact,and no mention of the thousands of pages of disney documents ssi possessed.lasswell had been faxed some of these documents by david bentson as early as september,when he faxed to her a page from the interrogatory tables containing a footer declaring the document to be confidential.
not until the march deposition of pati slesinger did ssi first reveal that it had employed sands to obtain disney documents.in june,disney served sands with a notice of deposition and a request that he produce copies of all documents found in the course of his investigation for ssi.however,when he appeared for the deposition in september,he brought no documents with him,and testified that although he had taken disney documents from publicly accessible dumpster sites,he kept no record of the documents he took,and had none of them when he was served with the deposition subpoena.
after sands deposition,disney wrote ssi,demanding copies of all documents taken from disney.ssi responded that the papers sands had found were never used in the litigation in any way t hey have had no impact on the proceedings at all.
in october,responding to subpoenas served by disney,ssi began disclosing the bulk of what turned out to be more than pages of disney documents taken by produced from the files of pati slesinger,shirley lasswell,and ssi counsel.included among the documents disclosed was the june,file,consisting of pages contained in a file labeled documents received from terry sands on italics added,a date three days before sands had been served to appear at his deposition.ssi did not reveal its possession of these documents until september.
on this record,disney did not unreasonably delay in making its sanction motion.the time lapse from the anonymous calls to the motion in february was caused not by disney lack of diligence,but by ssi concealment of sands employment,its false or claims to have no knowledge concerning how it came to possess internal disney documents,and its refusal to give any hint as to the magnitude of the misconduct until forced to do so.
ssi unlawful conduct 
the trial court disbelieved sands testimony that he had only taken documents from disney buena vista plaza facility.the court concluded that sands committed multiple trespasses over an extended period of years at many targeted facilities,including the golden state facility,which was a primary source of disney documents procured by sands.the court specifically credited the information contained in richard holman,first anonymous telephone call,in which holman,said that he and sands went to disney dumpster locations,broke in and took copies of documents from locations in northridge,burbank,glendale and trash cans on flower street and once were able to get past the security guard at the olive building,enter some of the offices and take documents,contracts off the desks.the court also found that,contrary to ssi claims,the dumpsters at buena vista plaza were located on private not public property,that disney did not abandon the documents contained in the dumpsters,and that sands had no right to trespass to obtain the documents.further,the trial court statement of decision contains references to ssi unlawfully obtained documents,and observes that ssi had no right to break laws to obtain evidence.
on appeal,ssi does not challenge these findings,including the finding of civil trespass.but ssi observes that the trial court made no express finding of criminal trespass,and further urges that t he charge of criminal conduct never was nor could be substantiated because there was no showing that sands conduct included all of the required elements to establish either a criminal trespass,or a violation of the burbank ordinances governing trash containers.
ssi insistence that criminal trespass was neither proved nor found is puzzling.regardless of whether sands committed criminal trespass,the evidence credited by the court established that he improperly entered areas of disney properties not accessible to the public and that he trespassed onto golden state secure facility and,at those locations,improperly took documents that disney had not abandoned.he thus committed the crimes of theft,and burglary.in any event,whether characterized as civil wrongdoing,criminal wrongdoing,or both,sands misconduct in the name of ssi was deliberate and than adequate to invoke the court exercise of its inherent power to dismiss.
ssi liability for sands conduct 
the trial court concluded that ssi implicitly if not expressly sanctioned sands conduct.the court stated ssi claims it instructed sands to only obtain disney documents by lawful means,but ssi remains fully responsible for sands misconduct,even if his acts,as ssi agent,were contrary to ssi explicit instructions.citation.in light of all the circumstances,ssi had to suspect sands was engaged in questionable conduct and that he was procuring documents from many disney sources.yet,ssi failed to adequately supervise sands activities and essentially closed its eyes.in another passage,the court concluded that pati slesinger knew all along of sands illicit activities.
according to ssi,however,the court reasoning will not wash because i t is undisputed that ssi counsel and david bentson instructed sands to obey the law and t here is no evidence that ssi or its lawyers knew that sands was acting unlawfully.rather,ssi always understood that sands was searching publicly accessible dumpsters at the buena vista plaza site.
ssi argument suffers from two primary flaws.the first is legal a litigant is vicariously liable for its investigator intentional misconduct committed within the course and scope of employment.see noble sears,roebuck d.see also witkin,summary of cal.law ed.agency and employment.indeed,i t is immaterial that the employee acts in excess of authority or contrary to instructions.witkin,supra,at see also martin leatham d.the policy rationale is clear a contrary rule would permit an employer to reap the benefits of its employee misconduct simply by claiming it had instructed the employee only to engage in lawful conduct.hence,even if the trial court had accepted ssi argument that sands acted without authorization an argument it rejected,sands unlawful conduct would still be imputed to ssi because it occurred in the course and scope of the investigation that ssi hired him to undertake.in short,sands deliberate misconduct is also the deliberate misconduct of ssi.
the second flaw in ssi argument is factual ssi relies only on the evidence that supports its position,and overlooks circumstantial evidence from which it may be inferred that ssi knew of sands illegal conduct,or at the very least acted with deliberate indifference to whether it was legal.
the evidentiary basis of ssi argument is the testimony of david bentson that he instructed sands not to violate the law,and the testimony of pati slesinger that she knew of no violation of the law by sands.the trial court,however,disbelieved this testimony,and credited the ample circumstantial evidence which contradicted it.sands took thousands of pages of disney documents and passed them on to bentson,and through him to ssi lawyers,pati slesinger,and lasswell.the trial court could reasonably infer that the sheer volume of documents would lead a reasonable person to question whether more than one repository was being searched,especially if that person were truly concerned about ensuring the legality of the document searches.of course,the ssi agent to whom sands reported,david bentson,gave sands a free hand,and did nothing to supervise his activities or ensure they were legal.further,some of the documents taken by restricted items list,the interrogatory tables,the fuller memorandum,and the suit overview conspicuous notations stating that disney considered them to be privileged and confidential.common sense suggests that such documents are not the type that a litigant would simply discard in publicly accessible trash dumpsters,as opposed to disposing of them in a more secure way.
strong circumstantial evidence suggested that pati slesinger knew that sands had taken documents disney considered confidential.ssi copies of the fuller memorandum and the interrogatory tables bore september fax transmission legends indicating they were sent from pati slesinger office.also,ssi ultimately produced two sets of the restricted items list and the interrogatory tables one set with the confidentiality markings as originally created by disney,and one set without them.in testimony credited by the trial court,disney forensic document specialist,erich speckin,testified that the sets without the confidential markings,which came from slesinger files,were made from the set that did have those markings,which came from the files of ssi attorneys.from this testimony,the court could reasonably infer that pati slesinger or someone else on ssi behalf had altered one set of both the restricted items list and the interrogatory tables to omit any indicia of confidentiality.moreover,in the years before disney sanction motion,ssi consistently concealed sands activities and its possession of disney fact the trial court could reasonably interpret as demonstrating consciousness of guilt and a desire to keep the full extent of the misconduct secret.
this evidence leads to the reasonable conclusion,as found by the trial court,that ssi had to suspect sands was engaged in questionable conduct,and y et essentially closed its eyes.in other words,ssi,at best,acted with deliberate indifference to whether sands conduct was legal.
ssi alteration of documents with the intent to mislead 
as noted in the preceding section,the trial court found that copies of the restricted items list and interrogatory tables contained in pati slesinger files had been altered by her or someone on ssi behalf to delete all notations of confidentiality.the purpose of these alterations,the court inferred,was to create the false impression that the documents were not confidential,or the false impression as argued by ssi at the sanction hearing that disney had created both confidential and sets.based on slesinger demeanor as a witness and the evidence linking her to the documents,the court disbelieved her testimony that she was not responsible for the alterations.
on appeal,ssi does not challenge the trial court finding that copies of the restricted items list and interrogatory tables produced by pati slesinger were altered.ssi argues,however,that there is no evidence that the alterations were made by slesinger or anyone else with the intent to mislead.however,ssi points to no other motive suggested by the evidence.indeed,the inference of intended deception is from the act of alteration deleting confidentiality markings from documents makes the documents appear,makes questions about their provenance less pointed,and makes their unexplained possession appear less blameworthy.
ssi notes that in it first produced copies of the restricted items list and the interrogatory tables bearing the confidential markings,and then later produced the altered versions.according to ssi,this chronology undermines the inference that ssi intended to conceal from disney its possession of confidential documents.the argument misses the point.ssi concealed its possession of documents with confidential markings until,when it finally produced them.its later production of the altered versions without the confidentiality markings says nothing about the purpose behind the alterations when they were made.in any event,as one federal appellate court has explained in upholding a terminating sanction for egregious misconduct,t he failure of a party corrupt plan does not immunize the defrauder from the consequences of its misconduct.aoude,supra,at.
the usefulness of the documents to ssi 
the trial court found that the documents retained by ssi were decidedly not useless.a number of key writings ssi retained are directly related to this litigation and reveal,among other things,privileged information useful to an opponent such as ssi.ssi contends that this finding is unsupported,because each of the categories of papers mentioned in the trial court ruling as potentially useful to slesinger is either not privileged,not useful,or both.
in making its contention,ssi parses each document in isolation rather than considering the significance of the documents in totality.ssi also sanitizes its analysis by ignoring the illicit methods by which it obtained the documents and tried to keep its conduct secret.ssi claims that the conclusions in the suit overview document became hopelessly outdated years ago,and that the fuller memorandum was benign because it simply recited an analysis that disney had already disclosed to ssi.ssi also claims that its possession of the restricted items list and the interrogatory tables,even if obtained through gross misconduct,is insignificant,because they contained information that ssi was otherwise entitled to obtain through discovery.
contrary to ssi approach,the proper focus is on the illicitly obtained documents considered as a whole,and on ssi misconduct in obtaining the documents,concealing its wrongdoing,and making no accurate accounting of the documents it obtained or discarded.in this context,it was reasonable for the trial court to conclude that the fine distinctions drawn by ssi between useful and useless information carry little weight.the trial court could reasonably infer ssi learned more than individual pieces of information it obtained an insight into disney confidential approach to the insight ssi could use to its advantage in the litigation.further,the court could also reasonably infer that ssi concealed its wrongdoing precisely because it found the theft of disney documents useful and because it knew some documents were privileged.indeed,the entries in ssi redaction log suggest that pati slesinger,david bentson,and ssi attorneys made use of the stolen documents.
ssi appellate claim that none of the stolen documents is useful also contradicts the position ssi took in the trial court.for instance,in,when ssi first produced the restricted items list,it claimed the document was clearly relevant to its claim that disney had failed to account for all winnie the pooh revenues.the next year,ssi attached a copy of the restricted items list to one of its discovery motions.in ssi motion to use the patterson memorandum,ssi argued that the document supported its claim that disney had defrauded ssi in accounting for winnie the pooh generated revenues,an argument ssi reiterated in its opposition to disney motion for terminating sanctions.in a supplemental pleading opposing terminating sanctions,ssi characterized the stolen documents as shocking because they showed disney accounting could not be trusted and that disney had abused discovery procedures and had misled auditors.in that pleading,ssi stated that it intended to file a sanctions motion based on this proof.in its opening statement at the sanction hearing,ssi stated that some of the stolen documents supported its claim about disney discovery abuses and that ssi intended to use the documents for the purposes of conducting the discovery on the merits.thus,in the trial court ssi consistently recognized that the information in the stolen documents was material both to the merits of the lawsuit its claim of fraudulent accounting and to its strategy discovery litigation.ssi own behavior thus demonstrates the materiality of the information it illicitly obtained.
the trial court rejection of the proposal for document review counsel 
in its statement of decision on disney motion for a terminating sanction,the trial court concluded that it had no confidence that ssi would obey any prophylactic order,and that it was not convinced ssi had either produced or discarded all the documents it possessed.the court also stated that ssi principals knew information gleaned from stolen disney documents that could not be purged.in its statement of decision on ssi motion for new trial,in which it rejected ssi proposal of document review counsel see fn,ante,the court reiterated the substance of these findings no power the court possesses can purge ssi knowledge.the full extent of ssi knowledge remains uncertain as does the potential impact of application of that knowledge to potential future litigation decisions and events.no power the court possesses short of termination can fully guard against the conscious or subconscious application of ssi knowledge in shaping the future course of the litigation and its outcome.on this reasoning,the court rejected ssi proposal for document review counsel.
ssi challenges the court reasoning as pure speculation.the court reasoning,however,relied not on speculation,but ssi history of history that is reliably predictive.on the evidence credited by the court,ssi pattern of misconduct was breathtaking.it reasonably suggested that ssi would not obey remedial orders if disobedience might be to its tactical advantage.see electronic funds solutions,llc murphy th,d terminating sanction was not an abuse of discretion because the trial court could have reasonably concluded that given defendants brazen violation of a discovery order,a lesser sanction would not have been sufficient to compel compliance with any future court orders.
similarly,the court reasonably concluded that ssi might well possess illicitly obtained documents that it had not produced or discarded.ssi never supervised sands,never catalogued the documents he took,and never made any record of what ssi purportedly discarded.ssi and its former counsel greenberg glusker could not even account for ssi possession of the june,file,and could provide no explanation why it was not produced until september.see fn,ante.combined with the court dismal view of the credibility of pati slesinger,lasswell,and bentson,ssi history of duplicity or deliberate indifference to the truth concerning the disney documents reasonably cautioned against accepting ssi protestations that it had produced all it possessed,and that nothing of value had been learned as the trial court cogently noted ssi is dishonest and shows no remorse.
likewise,no speculation exists in the court determination that ssi principals had gleaned information from the documents that no court order could dissipate.pati slesinger and bentson conceded reviewing documents.notations made by them on certain documents were deleted by ssi as privileged before the documents were produced.pati slesinger or someone else on ssi behalf altered copies of the restricted items list and interrogatory tables to remove notations of confidentiality.bentson faxed at least some documents to lasswell because he believed they would be of interest to her.to the extent there is any mystery as to how many documents ssi principals reviewed,how many they discarded,how many they might still possess,and how valuable the information learned might be,the mystery is a direct result of ssi misconduct.ssi is itself responsible for creating a record in which disney proof raised justifiable concerns on these points.ssi is also responsible for the dearth of credible evidence to alleviate those concerns.
ssi argues that the court concern over ssi lack of trustworthiness is not relevant in evaluating its proposal of drc.according to ssi,whether the proposal is effective depends not on ssi conduct,but on the conduct of new trial counsel and the drc,who are officers of the court.however,from to,ssi was represented by six different law firms see fn,ante.despite the changes in representation,ssi misconduct persisted.the one constant was the involvement of ssi principals,pati slesinger and shirley lasswell,and ssi agent,david bentson.see fn,ante.the court could reasonably conclude that with ssi as the client,employment of new trial counsel and drc would be inadequate to protect against ssi use of improperly obtained information.see lipin bender,the plaintiff personally stole,copied and reviewed documents protected by the privilege and work product doctrine dismissal of her lawsuit was not an abuse of discretion because the wrongdoing and the knowledge were the client own,which she would carry into any new relationship and perna electronic data systems,the plaintiff personally took and photocopied privileged documents ordering the plaintiff to obtain new counsel would be ineffective as the plaintiff would have already tainted the entire litigation process by this intrusion.
moreover,it is not reasonable to expect new trial counsel to fulfill,in any meaningful way,a screening or prophylactic function to preclude ssi principals from introducing into the litigation the fruits of sands searches.trial counsel would have a duty to zealously represent ssi,but would be placed in an adversarial position,having to forcefully inquire about,and perhaps investigate,the source of documents produced by ssi,or ideas and suggestions made by ssi further,on the record presented the trial court could reasonably doubt that ssi would honestly cooperate with new trial counsel efforts.see lipin bender,supra,at,the trial court reasonably concluded that policing an order requiring the plaintiff to establish,once new counsel was in place,an independent source for any information that could otherwise have been obtained from the stolen documents was not an adequate safeguard given the nature and persistence of the plaintiff misconduct.
simply put,the trial court was not required to gamble its ability to provide a fair trial on ssi turning over a new leaf.the court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting ssi proposal of drc and concluding that dismissal was the only viable sanction.
our conclusion that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting ssi proposal of drc disposes of ssi claim that imposition of the terminating sanction was punitive.as framed by ssi,a sanction is punitive if a lesser sanction is more than sufficient to remedy the effects of any misconduct.boldface and capitalization omitted.however,because the trial court acted well within the bounds of reason in rejecting ssi proposal of drc the only alternative sanction proposed by ssi,its finding that dismissal was the only sanction that could protect disney can not be deemed punitive.
the earlier sanctions imposed on disney 
ssi observes that disney was subject to evidentiary and monetary sanctions for its destruction of certain files of vincent jefferds,the disney who negotiated the licensing agreement although ssi concedes that two wrongs do not make a right,it argues that the terminating sanction entered on disney motion is an improper windfall to disney.according to ssi,the terminating sanction relieves disney of the consequences of its own wrongful destruction of evidence for which disney had been previously severely sanctioned by another judge and of the duty to defend this lawsuit and,as a result,puts disney in a better position than it would have been in had ssi investigator never peered into a single garbage dumpster.
the earlier sanctions against disney,however,provide no cover for ssi misconduct.the evidentiary sanctions against disney assuming they were properly entered,see fn,ante rectified the harm done to ssi.the terminating sanction imposed against ssi rectified the harm done by ssi.in obtaining a terminating sanction against ssi,disney did not get away with its own misconduct.the demise of ssi lawsuit has one cause only the deliberate and egregious misconduct of ssi itself,making any sanction other than dismissal inadequate to ensure a fair trial.
disposition 
the judgment order of dismissal with prejudice is affirmed.disney is awarded its costs on appeal.

during this lawsuit,ssi has been represented by at least ten law firms.when sands was hired,ssi was represented by two firms morgan,wenzel mcnicholas the firm associated with marshall morgan,and girardi keese.these firms represented ssi from march until may.thereafter,ssi was represented by manatt,phelps phillips,llp to,mccaimbridge,deixler marmaro,llp,proskauer rose llp,greenberg glusker fields claman machtinger kinsella llp to,jones day through,hancock,rothert bunshoft,llp and cochran,cherry,givens smith,through dismissal of ssi case in,and howard,rice,nemerovksi,canady,falk rabkin may through present.
