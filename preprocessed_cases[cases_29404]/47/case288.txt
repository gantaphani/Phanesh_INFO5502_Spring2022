this appeal is primarily governed by the standard of review.we directly address a challenge to the appropriate standard for reviewing a district court findings of substantial similarity in copyright law cases.we adopt the standard from the majority of other circuits and review the district court fact findings concerning substantial similarity for clear error.
in this copyright infringement action,taylor corporation taylor,a greeting card manufacturer,claims four seasons greetings,llc four seasons,a competing greeting card company,infringed taylor copyrights in six greeting card designs.following a bifurcated trial,the district court concluded taylor owns the copyrights in the six greeting card designs at issue,and four seasons card designs infringe taylor copyrights.the district court issued a permanent injunction against four seasons,directing four seasons to stop copying,selling,or distributing the six greeting card designs.four seasons appeals,arguing the district court erred in holding four seasons liable for copyright infringement,and in issuing a permanent injunction.we affirm.
background 
this case involves claims of illegal copying of six holiday greeting card designs.creative card company creative card employed frank stockmal stockmal,bernard granger granger,michael shelton shelton,and aleta brunettin brunettin to design greeting cards.while working for creative card,these artists created the six card designs disputed in this case colored presents,ribbon of flags around globe,three worlds of thanks globe ornament,pencil sketch farm,thanksgiving cart,and wreath with verse.because the artists were employed by creative card when the artists created the card designs,creative card is considered the author and the original copyright owner of the six designs at the time creative card authored the six card designs,creative card was a wholly owned subsidiary of ap p manufacturing,ap p.
in,creative card president left creative card and formed four seasons.three of creative card,shelton,and from creative card and went to work for four seasons.while employed by four seasons,stockmal,shelton,and brunettin created six card designs taylor contends are similar to six card designs the artists and granger previously created for creative card.
ap p later filed for bankruptcy.in april,ap p and taylor entered into an asset purchase agreement agreement,in which ap p agreed to sell certain assets to taylor,including ap p assets used in the operation of ap p business.the agreement defines business as the business of designing and publishing greeting cards,as currently conducted by the creative card division of ap p.ap p also agreed to transfer to taylor a ll intellectual property of the business,including copyrights,artwork,designs and other intangible property of the business,including without limitation the intellectual property listed in schedule d.schedule d identifies hundreds of greeting card designs,including the six card designs authored by creative card.on april,the united states bankruptcy court for the district of delaware approved the sale of ap p assets to taylor.
in june and august,taylor registered the six card designs at issue in this case with the united states copyright office.the original copyright registrations misidentified taylor as the author of each card design.in august,taylor filed supplementary registrations correctly identifying creative card as the author of each work.the supplementary registrations listed taylor as the copyright claimant.the registration form requires the copyright claimant,if different from the author,to give a brief explanation as to how the claimant obtained ownership of the copyright.in response to that direction,each supplementary registration contains the statement bill of sale and assignment from ap p to taylor dated may.
taylor sued four seasons for copyright infringement under the copyright act,for copying,manufacturing,producing,publishing,selling,promoting advertising greeting cards bearing designs substantially similar to taylor works.the district court preliminarily enjoined four seasons from further sale or distribution of the six cards in question.this court affirmed the preliminary injunction.taylor four seasons greetings,llc,cir taylor i.
before trial,four seasons stipulated it earned a profit of from sales of the six card designs.despite four seasons stipulation of damages,taylor filed a notice of election of remedies and withdrawal of jury demand,wherein taylor sought only injunctive relief at trial.the district court bifurcated taylor action into two separate trials.first,the parties tried taylor infringement claim to the court and to an advisory jury.the advisory jury unanimously found four seasons cards infringed taylor copyrights.second,the parties tried taylor claim that it owns the copyrights at issue to the district court,which concluded taylor is the legal owner of the copyrights pertaining to the six card designs.after deciding four seasons infringed taylor copyrights,the district court entered judgment in favor of taylor and issued a permanent injunction against four seasons,prohibiting four seasons from any further copying,manufacture,production,reproduction,publication,display,distribution,promotion,sale or offering for sale of the six four seasons designs.
four seasons challenges the district court judgment,contending the district court erred in concluding taylor owns the copyrights in the six card designs in failing to identify what constituent elements of the taylor cards were original,protectable expression that was copied by four seasons in failing to find four seasons cards were independently created in granting injunctive relief after taylor elected not to accept monetary damages and in depriving four seasons of its right to a jury in the ownership phase of the trial.
ii.discussion 
copyright infringement 
copyright law grants the copyright owner a limited monopoly to exploit his creation.this limited monopoly is intended to motivate the creative activity of authors and inventors by the provision of a special reward,and to allow the public access to the products of their genius after the limited period of exclusive control has expired.sony of am.universal city studios,d.to prevail on its copyright infringement claim,taylor must prove ownership of a valid copyright and copying of original elements of the work.mulcahy cheetah learning,llc,cir.
on appeal,four seasons claims taylor failed to prove copyright infringement.first,four seasons argues taylor failed to prove it owns the copyrights in the six card designs.second,four seasons contends taylor failed to prove four seasons copied any original,protectable elements of taylor card designs.finally,four seasons maintains it independently created its card designs.
copyrights,like other property rights,may be transferred from the owner to another entity.see d.the copyright act sets forth the requirements of a transfer a transfer of copyright ownership,other than by operation of law,is not valid unless an instrument of conveyance,or a note or memorandum of the transfer,is in writing and signed by the owner of the rights conveyed or such owner duly authorized agent.a.
it is uncontested creative card,the author of the card designs,originally owned the copyrights.the parties further agree creative card did not execute a writing expressly transferring or assigning its copyrights to ap p or to taylor.however,taylor contends the bankruptcy court order effected the transfer of creative card copyrights to taylor.accordingly,the question is whether taylor proved a transfer of copyright ownership by operation of law.
section a of the copyright act does not define the phrase by operation of law,and sparse case law addresses the transfer of copyright by operation of law.brooks bates.in brooks,one of the few cases to address the meaning of by operation of law,the court relied on the late professor melville nimmer renowned copyright treatise to interpret by operation of law to mean transfers by bequest,bankruptcy,mortgage foreclosures,and the like.id.at citing melville nimmer david nimmer,nimmer on copyright a at.the court then concluded,t he lessons to be drawn from professor nimmer are that transfers of copyrights by operation of law are limited in number,and depend upon circumstances which establish the author express or implied consent.id.one example of a transfer by operation of law is a transfer of ownership pursuant to proceedings in bankruptcy,since in such cases the author,by his overt conduct in filing in bankruptcy,has consented to such a transfer.id.quoting supra,a.although the brooks court found the copyrights in that case had not been transferred by operation of law,the court noted,t his is not a case of a corporate owner of a copyright merging with another or dissolving,so that its copyrights passed to the shareholders by operation of law.id.at.
other courts similarly have held corporate mergers and dissolutions transfer copyright ownership by operation of law.see lone ranger television,program radio,cir holding where copyright was transferred to corporation,corporation merged into another corporation,and surviving corporation then transferred copyright to subsidiary,subsidiary could maintain infringement action,because with every change in ownership parties recorded transfers fantasy,fogerty,holding where assets were transferred from dissolving corporation to its sole shareholder,sole shareholder succeeded to ownership of copyright by operation of law,aff,cir,rev on other grounds,d.
we conclude the bankruptcy court order approving ap p and taylor agreement constituted a transfer of the copyrights by operation of law.the agreement explicitly states ap p sold to taylor the business of designing and publishing greeting cards,as currently conducted by the creative card division.the agreement further transferred from ap p to taylor a ll intellectual property of the business,and schedule d identifies the card designs at issue in this case.we agree with the district court that the bankruptcy court april,order approving ap p and taylor agreement vested taylor with ownership in the copyrights in creative card card designs 
the second element required to show copyright infringement is copying.taylor presented no direct evidence of copying.in the absence of direct evidence,taylor may establish copying by proving four seasons had access to the copyrighted card designs and substantial similarity between the card designs.hartman hallmark cards,cir.four seasons does not contest it had access to taylor designs.however,four seasons vigorously maintains any similarities between its and taylor card designs are not sufficiently substantial to trigger liability.
standard of review 
four seasons substantial similarity argument raises a threshold,and potentially controlling,issue regarding our standard of review.in taylor i,we assumed the district court findings of substantial similarity were subject to review for clear error.taylor i,at the district court findings of substantial similarity between all six original cards and their allegedly infringing counterparts were not clearly erroneous.we now address four season challenge to the appropriate standard for reviewing a district court determination of substantial similarity in copyright law cases.
four seasons cites a line of cases from the second circuit for the proposition that appellate review of substantial similarity determinations in copyright law cases is de novo.in boisson and folio impressions,the second circuit rejected a clearly erroneous standard of review in favor of a de novo standard of review.boisson banian,cir folio impressions,byer,cir.the second circuit reasoned it could review de novo a district court finding of substantial similarity,because what is required is only a visual comparison of the works,rather than credibility,which we are in as good a position to decide as was the district court.folio impressions,at see boisson,at applying de novo review,because credibility is not at stake and all that is required is a visual comparison of the task we may perform as well as the district court.however,in yurman design,paj,cir,the second circuit recognized it has never decided the standard of review applicable to jury findings of substantial similarity where credibility is not at issue.the second circuit thus concluded,a lthough a jury factual findings are subject to independent review where such review is constitutionally required,we think that in copyright cases the constitution dictates a more deferential standard.id.at citation omitted.
we are unpersuaded by the second circuit reasoning supporting de novo review of findings of substantial similarity in copyright law cases.federal rule of civil procedure a specifically states i n all actions tried upon the facts without a jury or with an advisory jury,the court shall find the facts.emphasis added.rule a then describes our appellate review findings of fact,whether based on oral or documentary evidence,shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous.emphasis added.thus,neither an advisory jury nor findings of fact resting solely on documentary evidence changes this rule of deference to the district court fact findings.see anderson bessemer city,d.rule a requires even greater deference to the trial court findings when those findings are based on witness credibility determinations.id.at.the function of appellate courts is not to decide fact issues de novo,and as a reviewing court,we may not reverse the district court fact findings simply because we are convinced we would have decided the case differently.id.at.
the majority of circuit courts adhere to a clearly erroneous review of findings of substantial similarity in copyright law cases.see,hennon kirkland,wl,at cir,unpublished per curiam stating t he district court determination of similarity of expression depended on its factual analysis of the figurines,and we review for clear error the district court factual findings for substantial similarity wildlife express carol wright sales,cir saying,i n this circuit,when reviewing the products in issue for substantial similarity,we permit comparison,and an ocular comparison,of the works being analyzed for similarity,but follow the clearly erroneous standard in reviewing the district court conclusions.citations omitted,leadership software,cir holding issue of substantial similarity is a finding of fact and consequently is reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard data east usa,epyx,cir holding issue of substantial similarity is finding of fact reviewable for clear error whelan,jaslow dental,cir applying clearly erroneous standard of review to question of substantial similarity original appalachian artworks,toy loft,cir same.
we find additional support for our conclusion in case law construing substantial similarity in actions involving alleged patent infringement.see sony of,at.stating it is appropriate to refer to patent law in copyright law cases,because of the historic kinship between patent law and copyright law.in horton manufacturing,cir,a patent holder filed suit against an alleged infringer,asserting breach of a settlement agreement.according to the settlement agreement,the alleged infringer agreed to cease producing any products with a configuration that includes any of a number of identifiers listed on attachment hereto.id.at alterations in original.the district court found the alleged infringer had violated the settlement agreement by manufacturing products that were substantially similar to those made by the patent holder.id.on appeal,we reviewed the district court finding of substantial similarity under the clearly erroneous standard,because a district court determination of substantial similarity is a finding of fact.id.at.
having determined the appropriate standard of review,we next consider whether the district court clearly erred in finding taylor and four seasons card designs are substantially similar.
substantial similarity 
the eighth circuit applies a extrinsic test and an intrinsic determine substantial similarity 
first,similarity of ideas is analyzed extrinsically,focusing on objective similarities in the details of the works.second,if there is substantial similarity in ideas,similarity of expression is evaluated using an intrinsic test depe
