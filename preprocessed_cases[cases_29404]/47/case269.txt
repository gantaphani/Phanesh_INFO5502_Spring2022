backgrounda.
harbor and arnell are competing automobile dealerships located in northwest indiana.from to,harbor conducted more than a dozen tent sales in the parking lot of a superk store in portage,indiana to advertise its tent sales,harbor principally relied on newspaper advertising,particularly sunday ads published in the newspaper.the design of the ads is disputed and is sketched in brief here.
harbor explains that its ads were designed by gino burelli,one of its and operators,with assistance from david lawson,harbor other coowner.burelli designed the ads by hand on a piece of paper,then met with karen johnson of lighthouse media,harbor advertising agency.burelli directed johnson to adapt his designs to a format.johnson did so using computer software and then delivered the proofs to burelli for editing before they were submitted to the newspaper for publication.for each tent sale,burelli took harbor previous tent sale advertisement and made changes to the text and design.all the ads were similar to one another each successive ad was tweaked to improve upon the earlier ads,although the overall look of the ads was preserved.at.
arnell and the,however,claim that johnson,and not burelli,is the designer of the advertisements specifically,for each tent sale,burelli would take the ad harbor used for the last sale and draw changes to the preexisting design.he would then give the ideas to johnson,who would use computer software to create an advertisement from burelli ideas and rough sketches.
in,harbor conducted a tent sale from june and advertised the sale in the post tribune the week of sunday,june.although burelli did not copyright the advertisement at the time,harbor did register the copyright for the june advertisement on august.
arnell also held a tent sale at the same superk location on july.thomas tenhove,arnell sales manager,contacted peg bryan,the sales representative who handled arnell advertising,and asked her to duplicate harbor ad.bryan,however,told tenhove that she could not make an exact copy of the harbor ad and that changes would have to be made to the ad before it could be published as an arnell ad.bryan testified at trial that she thought the changes were necessary to ensure she was covering herself and the newspaper while at the same time doing the job that arnell wanted.id.at.
bryan then gave a copy of the harbor with tenhove handwritten kim piazza,the newspaper graphic designer,and told her that arnell wanted its ad to look like the harbor copy.using the harbor ad,piazza created a layout for the arnell version.this layout was a copy of the harbor ad,with the following major changes arnell logo instead of harbor appeared at the top information stating that sales would benefit the boys girls club of porter county was moved from the middle of the advertisement to the bottom of the page and a notation was added that there would be a free carnival cruise with purchase.the ad ran in the sunday edition on july.
burelli saw arnell ad in the.at first glance,he thought that the ad was harbor own for an upcoming july tent sale,and he called johnson to complain that the ad had been run on the wrong day.after burelli and johnson discovered that the ad was for arnell,johnson called bryan and other employees and demanded that the newspaper discontinue the ad.bryan and piazza then created a new and different ad for arnell to advertise its tent sales.
harbor held another tent sale in july.it claims that,even though it conducted the sale in the same manner as its prior sales,it sold approximately sixteen fewer cars than it had averaged in previous sales,with a resulting loss of approximately 
harbor filed suit in late,claiming that arnell and the infringed upon its copyright,in violation of and and that arnell intentionally interfered with its prospective business advantage,a tort under indiana law.
during pretrial proceedings,arnell tendered an offer of judgment to harbor for,and the tendered a separate offer of judgment for.harbor did not accept either offer.arnell and the then tendered a joint offer of judgment to harbor for,an unapportioned offer that did not specify how much of the offer applied to each defendant.the offer provided that the total amount of this offer of judgment was to be collective against both defendants,and not to be construed as entitling harbor to the lump sum stated herein against one defendant or the other individually,at.the offer further specified that the was to be inclusive of attorneys fees and costs up to the date of acceptance of this offer and that acceptance would preclude any subsequent claim for costs or attorney s fees by plaintiff.id.at.harbor rejected this joint offer,and the case was tried to a jury.
at the close of harbor,both arnell and the moved for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure a.they argued that harbor did not own the copyright in the advertisement and that they had not willfully infringed harbor copyright.arnell also moved for judgment as a matter of law on the intentional interference with business advantage claim.
the district court granted arnell motion on the claim and granted both the and arnell motions with respect to willful infringement the court also dismissed the from the case entirely,ruling that 
i must confess to you in complete i am well aware that the first amendment has not been argued here.it is a rare newspaper case that that is argued,but it has been.
but there are some values involved that i think are implicit in the way in which newspapers should or are supposed to granted that they,like many other of the powerful forces in our society,are far from have a lot of i am going to lay this out with great have a great deal of problem,especially with the one witness,of imposing an obligation on this newspaper under the circumstances of this case to hold them responsible for any improper dealing with regard to the copyright involved.
i am going to let them out.i am going to grant their motion for directed verdict 
so i am not going am excusing the newspaper on different grounds than the validity of the copyright.
the jury subsequently returned a verdict in harbor favor against arnell on harbor copyright claim and awarded harbor statutory damages of.each party then filed motions to recover costs and attorney fees the district court referred the motions to a magistrate judge.the magistrate judge recommended that the be awarded over in costs and attorney fees as a prevailing party under the copyright act that arnell be awarded more than in costs and attorney fees,finding that federal rule of civil procedure required it to do so because harbor judgment against arnell was less than the joint offer of judgment and that harbor request for costs and attorney fees as the prevailing party be denied.the district court adopted the magistrate judge recommendation in its entirety,and harbor now appeals.
analysisa.judgment as a matter of law for the 
harbor contends that the district court erroneously granted the motion for judgment as a matter of law because it improperly determined that the first amendment shielded the newspaper from liability.the,in contrast,argues that harbor only sued the for contributory,and not direct,infringement,and a prima facie case of contributory infringement was not made out and that the district court did not base its ruling on first amendment grounds.
we first must determine the cause of action on appeal.despite the assertion to the contrary in its brief,we believe that all parties proceeded in the district court under a direct infringement claim.in both its motion for summary judgment and its trial brief,for example,the centered its analysis on a direct infringement claim and made no mention of contributory infringement.likewise,the did not refer to contributory infringement in its motion for judgment as a matter of law.harbor also based its pleadings on a direct infringement claim in paragraph one of its complaint,it alleged copyright infringement under,all relating to direct infringement the points to various pieces of the district court language in an effort to support its theory that the court granted its motion on a contributory infringement basis,but we are not persuaded by those citations.the cited references do not relate to contributory infringement but instead are taken from the court discussion of arnell motion on the willful infringement claim.accordingly,we shall examine the elements of direct infringement to determine whether the case should have been submitted to the jury.
to make out a prima facie claim of direct infringement,harbor must show that it owned a valid copyright in the advertisement and that the copied constituent elements of the work that were original.see wildlife express carol wright sales,cir quoting feist publ ns,rural.serv,d see also melville nimmer,nimmer on copyright,a,at.harbor contends that it made out a prima facie case against the,evidenced by the jury decision in favor of harbor against arnell on the same evidence.we agree.
as an initial matter,we review de novo a district court grant of judgment as a matter of law.see bruso united airlines,cir.we ask whether the evidence presented,combined with the reasonable inferences permissibly drawn therefrom,is sufficient to support the verdict when viewed in the light most favorable to the party against whom the motion is directed.see lane hardee food,cir.we shall reverse the judgment only if enough evidence exists that might sustain a verdict for the nonmoving party.id.quoting continental bank modansky,cir.in deciding this question,we may not substitute our view of contested evidence for the jury.see place abbott,cir,cert.denied,d.
we conclude that the district court decision to grant the motion for judgment as a matter of law was in error.the court in granting the motion indicated only that it did not believe that liability could be imposed on the consistent with the first amendment because there are some values involved that i think are implicit in the way in which newspapers should or are supposed to act.at the court explained that it had the private feeling that this is not the kind of case that the copyright act was really all about.id.at.nowhere in its ruling did the district court articulate a basis,grounded in the copyright act,for granting the motion for judgment as a matter of law.it simply noted that it was excusing the newspaper on different grounds than the validity of the copyright.id.
in our view,the evidence,viewed in the light most favorable to harbor,could support a verdict in its favor on direct infringement grounds.first,the jury verdict against arnell demonstrates that harbor owned a valid copyright in the advertisement and that arnell infringed harbor copyright.harbor asserts the same ownership rights in the copyright against the and appears to have an even stronger case because it was the newspaper that copied the advertisement.the own ad representative and graphic designer created the offending ad,and the paper published it.because enough evidence exists to sustain a verdict for harbor,we conclude that the district court erred in granting judgment as a matter of law to the on a direct infringement claim.
therefore,the judgment as a matter of law in favor of the is reversed.the order granting the costs and attorney fees as a prevailing party is likewise reversed 
prevailing party 
arnell and the made a joint offer of judgment to harbor in the amount of.harbor rejected the offer and,at trial,obtained a judgment against arnell for.the district court then permitted arnell to recover its fees and costs pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure,a decision harbor contends was in error.specifically,because arnell was not a prevailing party under the copyright act,harbor claims that arnell could not receive the fees under rule mandatory provision.arnell argues in response that it was not required to be a prevailing party to recover its attorney fees.
rule permits a defendant to serve on a plaintiff an offer to allow judgment to be taken against the defendant for the money or property or to the effect specified in the offer.if the plaintiff does not accept the offer of judgment within ten days and then obtains a judgment against the defendant that is less favorable than the offer,the plaintiff must pay the costs incurred after the making of the offer.id.thus,the plaintiff is precluded from recovering his costs incurred after the making of the offer.see marek chesny,d rule also requires the plaintiff to pay any costs the defendant incurs after making the offer if the plaintiff judgment is less favorable than the offer.see gavoni dobbs house,cir.we review the district court underlying factual findings for clear error,but to the extent a party entitlement to costs rests on an interpretation of rule,we review the district court legal conclusions de novo.see id.
although rule by its terms only applies to costs,the supreme court has held that attorney fees are included within the definition of costs for purposes of rule when the underlying statute includes attorney fees in its definition of costs.see marek,at.section of the copyright act defines costs to include attorney fees,but only the prevailing party is entitled to their award.see except as otherwise provided by this title,the court may also award a reasonable attorney fee to the prevailing party as part of the costs.this appeal thus asks us to determine whether arnell must be a prevailing party under the copyright act in order to recover attorney fees pursuant to rule.
courts that have addressed whether a party can nevertheless obtain attorney fees under rule have expressed differing views.in crossman marcoccio,cir,cert.denied,d,the first circuit held that a losing defendant could not recover attorney fees because it was not the prevailing party.see crossman,at.although appellants attorney fees were properly awardable costs under section,appellees attorney fees were not.the statute awards costs only to a prevailing party.emphasis in original see also city of greers ferry,cir 
the first circuit in crossman rejected the same argument that arnell makes here,explaining that the effort to dismiss the prevailing party language in marek 
distorts the law governing the relationship between rule and the substantive statute by ignoring the two crucial words that serve to qualify the holding of the marek case.marek states that the term costs in rule was intended to refer to all costs properly awardable under the relevant substantive statute or other authority.the court stresses the importance of the two emphasized words by repeating them in the next sentence of the opinion in other words,all costs properly awardable in an action are to be considered within the scope of rule costs.
crossman,at emphasis in original.
the eleventh circuit,however,has determined that a rule award of costs includes attorney fees even if the defendant is not the prevailing party.see jordan time,cir.there,the court determined that the plaintiff was required to pay the defendant costs incurred after the making of the offer,simply stating that rule costs include attorneys fees when the underlying statute
