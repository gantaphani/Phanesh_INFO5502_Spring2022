in this copyright infringement action,we address whether an arkansas retailer is subject to personal jurisdiction in washington when its only relevant contact with the state is a claim that it willfully violated a copyright held by a washington corporation.the district court for the western district of washington dismissed washington shoe company washington shoe action against a z sporting goods,a z for lack of personal jurisdiction.we reverse.
facts and procedural history 
washington shoe is a washington corporation that has done business in the state of washington for over years.washington shoe,as its name suggests,manufactures a variety of foot apparel for men,women,and children.a z is an arkansas corporation that operates a single retail store in alma,arkansas,where it sells goods related to hunting,fishing,and outdoor activities.according to a z,it does not sell products over the internet and does not have an interactive website that allows customers to order its products,although a different a z entity,with some common management,does sell some products over ebay.
between and,a z purchased a number of items from washington shoe.washington shoe salesman jesse james regularly visited the a z store in arkansas to determine what additional orders a z needed.james provided a z with brochures and catalogs containing washington shoe products and copyright notifications.
during one of his visits to a z,james noticed that ditsy dots and spider boots two of washington shoe popular children rain boots were on display.james knew that a z had never purchased these particular styles from him.james purchased a pair of the suspicious boots and sent them to washington shoe,who confirmed that they were infringing copies.a z admits that the boots in dispute were purchased from china and not from washington shoe,but claims that the boots had no name on them or other indication that they were subject to copyright.
on april,washington shoe counsel in seattle sent a z a letter notifying a z that its boot designs were copyrighted and that a z infringing boots are clearly illegal.he demanded that all sales of the infringing boots stop and asked for an accounting of past sales.on may,counsel sent a letter,again warning a z that it was violating washington shoe copyright and might be liable for actual and statutory damages.he requested written assurance that a z had ceased importing or selling the infringing rain boots.after receiving these letters,a z removed the offending boots from its store,but sold its remaining inventory to a thrift store,whose representative traveled to arkansas to purchase the boots.
washington shoe filed a complaint in the district court for the western district of washington,alleging copyright infringement,trade dress infringement,and unfair competition.a z moved to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction or,in the alternative,on forum non conveniens grounds.after initial briefing,the district court allowed jurisdictional discovery to test a z claim that it has never sold any goods,of any kind,to any person,business or entity in the state of washington.the court initially denied a z motion to dismiss,relying on our decision in brayton purcell llp recordon recordon brayton purcell i,cir.that decision was withdrawn and superceded by brayton purcell llp recordon recordon brayton purcell ii,cir,prompting the district court to issue an order to show cause,and eventually to grant a z motion to dismiss.because of the confusion generated by the different brayton purcell opinions,the district court denied a z request for attorneys fees under washington revised code.washington shoe appeals the dismissal,and a z the denial of attorneys fees.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
a district court determination of whether personal jurisdiction may be properly exercised is a question of law that we review de novo.see brayton purcell ii,at.although the burden is on the plaintiff to show that the court has jurisdiction over the defendant,in the absence of an evidentiary hearing,the plaintiff need only make a prima facie showing of jurisdictional facts to withstand the motion to dismiss.pebble beach caddy,cir internal quotation marks omitted.additionally,the court resolves all disputed facts in favor of the plaintiff,in this case,washington shoe.see id.
because there is no applicable federal statute governing personal jurisdiction in this case,we apply the law of the state of washington.see schwarzenegger fred martin motor,cir panavision int l,toeppen,cir.washington statute extends jurisdiction over a defendant to the fullest extent permitted by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.see.shute carnival cruise lines.the relevant question,therefore,is whether the requirements of due process are satisfied by the exercise of personal jurisdiction over a z in washington.
due process 
due process requires that to exercise jurisdiction over a defendant,the defendant have certain minimum contacts with the forum such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.int l shoe washington.we employ a test to determine if a defendant has sufficient minimum contacts to be subject to specific personal 
the defendant must purposefully direct his activities or consummate some transaction with the forum or resident thereof or perform some act by which he purposefully avails himself of the privilege of conducting activities in the forum,thereby invoking the benefits and protections of its laws 
the claim must be one which arises out of or relates to the defendant activities and 
the exercise of jurisdiction must comport with fair play and substantial justice,it must be reasonable.
brayton purcell ii,at quoting schwarzenegger,at internal quotation marks omitted.as washington shoe bears the burden of establishing the district court jurisdiction over a z,it must satisfy the first two prongs.if it does so,then a z must come forward with a compelling case that the exercise of jurisdiction would not be reasonable.collegesource,academyone,cir quoting burger king rudzewicz,d.
only the first prong is at issue in this case.the plaintiff may satisfy this prong by demonstrating that the defendant either purposefully availed itself of the privilege of conducting activities in the forum,or purposefully directed its activities at the forum.we have explained that although we have sometimes used these two terms in shorthand fashion as a single concept,they are,in fact,two distinct concepts.schwarzenegger,at.we have further explained that a purposeful availment analysis is most often used in suits sounding in contract.see also burger king,at,hanson denckla,d.by contrast,i n tort cases,we typically inquire whether a defendant purposefully direct s his activities at the forum state,applying an effects test that focuses on the forum in which the defendant actions were felt,whether or not the actions themselves occurred within the forum.la ligue contre le racisme,cir en banc 
the purposeful direction or effects test is based on calder jones,d.it requires that the defendant have committed an intentional act,expressly aimed at the forum state,causing harm that the defendant knows is likely to be suffered in the forum state.mavrix photo,at internal quotation marks omitted.thus,courts may exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant who engages in an intentional act that causes harm in the forum state,even if that act takes place outside of the forum state.see,at panavision,at it is not required that a defendant be physically present or have physical contacts with the forum,so long as his efforts are purposefully directed toward forum residents.
we are going to consider each of these elements in turn.our discussion,however,is limited to washington shoe willful infringement claim,because that is its strongest basis for the exercise of jurisdiction in washington.if washington has jurisdiction over this claim,it may exercise jurisdiction over the remaining claims,which are related.see action embroidery atl.embroidery,cir adopting the doctrine of pendent personal jurisdiction,which allows a court to exercise jurisdiction over a defendant with respect to a claim for which there is no independent basis of personal jurisdiction so long as it arises out of a common nucleus of operative facts with a claim in the same suit over which the court does have personal jurisdiction see also a providing district courts with supplemental subject matter jurisdiction for claims so related that they form part of the same case or controversy.
intentional act 
first,we address whether a z committed an intentional act when it,allegedly,willfully infringed washington shoe copyright.see brayton purcell ii,at.although the issue is not a difficult one in this case,we wish to be careful not to confuse the intentional act prong of the calder test with the allegation that a z acted willfully.intentional act has a specialized meaning in the context of the calder effects test.schwarzenegger,at.we have defined an act as denot ing an external manifestation of the actor will not includ ing any of its results,even the most direct,immediate,and intended.id.thus,if the actor,having pointed a pistol at another,pulls the trigger,the act is the pulling of the trigger and not the impingement of the bullet upon the other person.quoting restatement second of torts cmt.c.further,w e construe intent as referring to an intent to perform an actual,physical act in the real world,rather than an intent to accomplish a result or consequence of that act.id.accordingly,an intentional act is an external manifestation of the actor intent to perform an actual,physical act in the real world,not including any of its actual or intended results.
according to washington shoe allegations,a z purchased the boots at issue from china and the infringing boots were sold in the same arkansas store as washington shoe footwear.subsequently,after receiving notice of the alleged copyright infringement through letters,a z sold the infringing boots to a thrift store.we have little difficulty finding that by intentionally engaging in the actual,physical acts of purchasing and selling the allegedly infringing boots,a z has clearly committed an intentional act within the meaning of the calder test.
expressly aimed 
determining whether a z conduct was expressly aimed at the state of washington is a more difficult question that,in this case,depends to a great degree on the allegations of a willful copyright violation.to establish a prima facie case of copyright infringement,a plaintiff must demonstrate ownership of a valid copyright,and copying of constituent elements of the work that are original.range.music,coast foods,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the copyright act provides an additional damage remedy if the plaintiff can show that the violation was willful.see u.c.we have explained that a finding of willfulness in the copyright context can be based on either intentional behavior,or merely reckless behavior,barboza new form,in re barboza,cir,and that t o prove willfulness under the copyright act,the plaintiff must show that the defendant was actually aware of the infringing activity,or that the defendant actions were the result of reckless disregard for,or willful blindness to,the copyright holder rights,louis vuitton malletier,akanoc solutions,cir quoting island software computer,microsoft,cir see also arclightz films video palace,d,to prove willfulness,plaintiffs must show that the infringer had actual or constructive knowledge that it was infringing the plaintiffs copyrights or else acted in reckless disregard of the high probability that it was infringing plaintiffs copyrights.e vidence that notice had been accorded to the alleged infringer is perhaps the most persuasive evidence of willfulness.chi boy music charlie club,cir quotation marks omitted.we have characterized copyright infringement as a tort,brayton purcell ii,at,and suggested that willful infringement is an intentional tort,columbia pictures television krypton broad.of birmingham,cir,rev on other grounds sub nom.feltner columbia pictures television,d.
according to washington shoe allegations,there was an ongoing relationship between a z and washington shoe,during which a z received catalogs or brochures that included rain boots,allegedly including the copyrighted boots in this case,thus making a z aware of both the existence of the ditsy dot and spider boots and washington shoe copyright.washington shoe further alleged that a z purchased the boots at issue from china,and that the infringing boots were sold in the same arkansas store as washington shoe footwear,thus placing the infringing items in direct competition with washington shoe copyrighted boots.once washington shoe discovered that az was selling infringing boots,it advised a z of the copyright infringement through letters and requested proof that a z was no longer violating its copyright.after receiving the letters,a z sold the infringing boots to a thrift store.these facts,if sustained,likely constitute a willful violation of washington shoe copyright based upon a z actual awareness of its infringing activity.
we have held that calder can not stand for the broad proposition that a foreign act with foreseeable effects in the forum state always gives rise to specific jurisdiction.bancroft masters,augusta,cir.we noted that our previous cases said that there must be something more,see panavision,at,and we held that that something more is what the supreme court described as express aiming at the forum state.bancroft masters,at.we have repeatedly stated that the express aiming requirement is satisfied,and specific jurisdiction exists,when the defendant is alleged to have engaged in wrongful conduct targeted at a plaintiff whom the defendant knows to be a resident of the forum state.dole food watts,cir quoting bancroft masters,at see also bancroft masters,at e xpress aiming encompasses wrongful conduct individually targeting a known forum resident.
we have observed that t he express aiming analysis depends,to a significant degree,on the specific type of tort or other wrongful conduct at issue.schwarzenegger,at.calder,we explained,was not a case of untargeted negligence,id.quoting calder,at,but was intentional behavior directed at jones in california,id.even though directed entirely within florida,the intentional acts in calder the writing and editing of an allegedly libelous article were expressly aimed at california because the petitioners knew the article would have a potentially devastating impact upon respondent who they knew lived and worked in california.see calder,at emphasis added.thus,the respective directions of the intentional act and the known impact need not coincide for the express aiming requirement to be satisfied.particularly in the case of a willful copyright infringement,the intentional act constituting the violation may occur solely within one state while the known impact of that copyright infringement is directed at another state.
we have been more clear and found jurisdiction in the plaintiff home forum when we have determined that the tort is an intentional one,because in such cases the acts are performed for the very purpose of having their consequences felt in the forum state.brainerd governors of the of,cir see also licciardello lovelady,cir s tates have a special interest in exercising jurisdiction over those who commit intentional torts causing injury to their residents.so,for example,in columbia pictures,columbia alleged that feltner,the owner of television stations in the southeast that continued to broadcast shows after failing to pay royalties,willfully infringed copyrights owned by columbia,which,as feltner knew,had its principal place of business in the central district of california.columbia pictures,at.thus,even though the intentional act of broadcasting the shows was directed at the southeastern united states,the impact of that intentional act was expressly aimed at the central district of california because feltner knew the impact of his willful violation would be felt there.we held that t his fact alone is sufficient to satisfy the purposeful availment requirement.id.citing calder,at.
more recently,in brayton purcell ii,we considered the claim brought by brayton pur
