the panel affirmed the district court judgment in favor of the defendants in a copyright case involving the usenet,an international collection of organizations and individuals whose computers connect to one another and exchange messages posted by usenet users.
defendant giganews,owns and operates several usenet servers and provides its subscribers with access to content stored on its own servers as well as content stored on the servers of other usenet providers.defendant livewire services,provides its subscribers with access to the usenet content stored on giganews servers.plaintiff perfect,owns the exclusive copyrights to tens of thousands of adult images,many of which have been illegally distributed over giganews servers.
the panel affirmed the district court partial dismissal and partial grant of summary judgment on perfect direct copyright infringement claim.the panel held that causation,also referred to as volitional conduct,by the defendant is one of the elements of a prima facie case of direct infringement.the panel held that the volitional conduct requirement was not met on perfect theories that the defendants directly infringed its display rights and distribution rights.the panel concluded that the evidence showed only that giganews actions were akin to passively storing material at the direction of users in order to make that material available to other users upon request,or automatically copying,storing,and transmitting materials upon instigation by others.the volitional conduct requirement also was not met as to the claim that giganews directly infringed on perfect right to reproduce by uploading infringing content onto the usenet or giganews servers.
the panel held that giganews was not liable for contributory copyright infringement because perfect failed to raise a triable issue of fact as to whether giganews materially contributed to or induced infringement of perfect copyrights.the panel held that there were no simple measures available that giganews failed to take to remove perfect works from its servers.
the panel affirmed the district court summary judgment on perfect vicarious infringement claim.the panel held that perfect failed to demonstrate a causal link between the infringing activities and a financial benefit to giganews.
the panel affirmed the district court award of attorney fees to the defendants under the copyright act and its denial of defendants request for supplemental fees.the panel also affirmed the district court denial of defendants request to amend the judgment to add a judgment debtor as perfect alter ego.
appellant perfect,perfect or challenges the district court partial dismissal of its direct copyright infringement claim and grant of summary judgment in favor of appellees giganews,giganews and livewire services,livewire as to all remaining claims.perfect also appeals the district court award of attorney fees and costs under the copyright act.on,giganews and livewire contend the district court erred by denying their request for supplemental fees and failing to add perfect sole shareholder and founder,norman zada zada,to the judgment as perfect alter ego.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the district court.
background 
the usenet and appellees operations 
the heart of this complex copyright dispute revolves around the usenet or usenet,an international collection of organizations and individuals known as peers whose computers connect to one another and exchange messages posted by usenet users.ellison robertson,cir.to obtain access to the usenet,a user must gain access through a commercial usenet provider,such as defendant giganews,or an internet service provider.arista records llc,supp.giganews owns and operates several usenet servers and provides its subscribers with access to content that giganews stores on its own servers as well as content stored on the servers of other usenet providers.unlike giganews,livewire does not own any usenet servers,but instead provides its subscribers with access to the usenet content stored on giganews servers.
the usenet content offered through giganews servers is almost exclusively,in that usenet users upload the majority of the content stored on a usenet provider server.this content is posted via articles to online bulletin boards called newsgroups.each article is associated with a unique.giganews and livewire contend that the only way to accurately identify a specific usenet message is with that.although these articles are posted as text files,other types of files such as images,songs,and movies may be encoded into the bodies of the articles as binary files.through giganews browser application,known as mimo,or the mimo reader,users can open the binary files,which are then decoded and displayed in their original format.
by using a peering process,messages posted on one usenet server can automatically propagate to other usenet servers,which then propagate the messages to another usenet server,and so on.more specifically,
when an individual user with access to a usenet server posts a message to a newsgroup,the message is automatically forwarded to all adjacent usenet servers that furnish access to the newsgroup,and it is then propagated to the servers adjacent to those servers.the messages are temporarily stored on each receiving server,where they are available for review and response by individual users.the messages are automatically and periodically purged from each system after a time to make room for new messages.responses to messages,like the original messages,are automatically distributed to all other computers receiving the newsgroup or forwarded to a moderator in the case of a moderated newsgroup.the dissemination of messages to usenet servers around the world is an automated process that does not require direct human intervention or review.
am.civil liberties union reno,supp.this peering process only occurs after two usenet access providers enter into peering agreements to accept materials from each other.the servers are then able to synchronize their information so their content mirrors one another.thus,only after giganews engages in a peering agreement can its servers exercise any control over the messages copied from other servers.however,this control is minimal.
as the district court explained,for example,giganews servers compare the unique of messages on peer servers to ensure that giganews does not copy duplicate articles to its servers.perfect,giganews,no.shx,wl,at cal.similarly,if a peer server contains an article with a that giganews has already deleted from its servers,the giganews servers will not then copy that article.id.in addition,because giganews is a member of the internet watch foundation,which tracks individual articles by or entire newsgroups that contain child pornography,certain articles and newsgroups may automatically be deleted or blocked from peering from giganews servers.id.
other than setting those basic parameters,giganews does not select any of the content available on its servers.id.indeed,giganews itself did not post any of the articles at issue in this action to any usenet server,and all such articles were posted by usenet users.nor does giganews tell any third parties what to upload to the usenet,including giganews s usenet servers.id.internal citations omitted.similarly,because livewire merely contracts with giganews for access to its servers,livewire also has no control over the uploaded,downloaded,transmitted,or stored content on giganews servers.id.and livewire itself has neither uploaded material onto the usenet nor directed anyone else to do so.
perfect images on the usenet 
perfect owns the exclusive copyrights to tens of thousands of adult images,many of which have been illegally distributed over giganews servers.upon locating infringing materials on those servers,perfect sent giganews numerous letters fashioned as takedown notices pursuant to the digital millennium copyright act dmca,et.while some of these notices merely instructed giganews to locate all of the infringing messages and images by doing a mimo search for a particular term,others attached screen shots of the mimo application that displayed posts in which perfect copyrighted images were distributed.when perfect sent giganews,giganews quickly removed those messages from its servers.when perfect faxed giganews notices containing illegible,giganews responded with a letter asking perfect to provide the in a legible,format.perfect repeatedly declined to do so.
procedural history 
on april,perfect brought suit against giganews and livewire in the district court for the central district of california,alleging direct and indirect copyright infringement claims as well as trademark and state law claims.only the copyright infringement claims are the subject of this appeal.
on march,the district court denied motion to dismiss perfect indirect copyright infringement claims against giganews and granted their motion to dismiss those claims against livewire with leave to amend.the district court also granted the motion to dismiss the direct copyright infringement claims against both giganews and livewire with leave to amend,explaining that direct infringement requires volitional conduct and finding that perfect had not alleged that appellees were the direct cause of,or actively engaged in,such infringement.perfect giganews,no.ahm shx,wl,at cal.
on july,the district court granted in part and denied in part appellees motion to dismiss perfect first amended complaint fac.while the district court allowed perfect to move forward on its direct infringement claim against livewire and on its direct infringement claim against giganews on the theory that giganews violated perfect exclusive right to reproduce its copyrighted works by itself uploading infringing content,the court dismissed perfect indirect infringement claims against livewire.
the parties filed eight separate motions for partial summary judgment.in three separate orders,the district court granted appellees motions for summary judgment as to the direct and indirect copyright infringement claims and denied perfect motions as moot.in an earlier order,the district court denied perfect motion for summary judgment in which it argued,among other things,that its takedown notices complied with the dmca and appellees were ineligible for safe harbor protection under the dmca.
on march,upon entering a judgment in favor of appellees,the district court ordered perfect to pay in attorney fees and in nontaxable costs.subsequently,the district court denied appellees motion to amend the judgment to add zada as an additional judgment debtor and for a supplemental award of attorney fees.perfect timely appealed.

discussion 
direct infringement 
perfect argues the district court erred in concluding that neither giganews nor livewire directly infringed perfect copyrights.we disagree.
elements of a direct infringement claim 
to establish a prima facie case of direct infringement,a plaintiff must show ownership of the allegedly infringed material and demonstrate that the alleged infringers violated at least one exclusive right granted to copyright holders under.records,napster,cir.in addition,direct infringement requires the plaintiff to show causation also referred to as volitional conduct by the defendant.see fox broad,dish network,cir.
we wish to emphasize that the word volition in this context does not really mean an act of willing or choosing or an act of deciding,which is how the dictionary defines the term.volition,webster third new international dictionary.rather,as used by the court in religious tech.ctr.netcom commc,supp,cal,it simply stands for the unremarkable proposition that proximate causation historically underlines copyright infringement liability no less than other torts.melville nimmer david nimmer,nimmer on copyright,c matthew bender,ed.see also dallas bullard,note,the revolution was not televised examining copyright doctrine after aereo,berkeley tech,while most courts have focused on the language of volitional conduct,the key analytical weight is best derived from causation,because where it is clear that infringement has occurred,courts must determine who is close enough to the infringing event to be considered the most important cause.as the district court cogently explained 
t he volition element of direct infringement is not a element of intent or knowledge it is a basic requirement of causation.as its name suggests,direct liability must be premised on conduct that can reasonably be described as the direct cause of the infringement.
perfect,wl at emphasis in original.
contrary to perfect contention,this requirement of causation remains an element of a direct infringement claim.in fox broadcasting,we explained that i nfringement of the reproduction right requires copying by the defendant,which comprises a requirement that the defendant cause the copying.at internal citation and quotation marks omitted.in using this language,we indicated that causation is an element of a direct infringement claim.
in his dissent in american broadcasting,aereo,justice scalia construed our decision in fox broadcasting as adopting the requirement,noting that the supreme court cases are fully consistent with such a requirement,scalia,dissenting id.at scalia,dissenting every court of appeals to have considered an provider direct liability for copyright infringement has adopted the requirement.citing fox,at.district courts interpreting fox broadcasting have reached the same conclusion.see fox broad.dish network llc,supp,cal.gardner cafepress,wl,at cal,there are three elements to a prima facie case of direct infringement ownership of the allegedly infringed material,violation of at least one exclusive right granted to copyright holders under,and volitional conduct by the defendant.emphasis added.other circuits have adopted the volitional conduct requirement as well.see cartoon network lp csc holdings,cir.v olitional conduct is an important element of direct liability costar group,loopnet,cir.t he copyright act requires conduct by a person who causes in some meaningful way an infringement.emphasis in original parker google,app x,cir.per curiam t o state a direct copyright infringement claim,a plaintiff must allege volitional conduct on the part of the defendant.
the requirement is consistent with the aereo majority opinion,in which the supreme court held that aereo,a service that streamed broadcast television programming to subscribers over the internet,perform ed publicly as defined by the transmit clause.at.first,the aereo court did not expressly address the requirement for direct liability under the copyright act,nor did it directly dispute or comment on justice scalia explanation of the doctrine.thus,as one court in the central district of california subsequently opined,because t he volitional conduct doctrine is a significant and rule,adopted by all courts of appeal to have considered it,it would be folly to presume that aereo categorically jettisoned it by implication.fox,supp.at.
second,the aereo court analysis can be reconciled with the requirement.indeed,the court distinguished between an entity that engages in activities like aereo,and one that merely supplies equipment that allows others to perform or transmit.aereo,at.further,although the court held that aereo was not just an equipment supplier and that aereo perform s,it also noted that i n other cases involving different kinds of service or technology providers,a user involvement in the operation of the provider equipment and selection of the content transmitted may well bear on whether the provider performs within the meaning of the act.id.at.thus,the distinction between active and passive participation remains a central part of the analysis of an alleged infringement.fox,supp.at.because aereo did not expressly address the requirement and the court analysis can be reconciled with it,we conclude that the requirement was left intact and that the district court did not err in requiring perfect to satisfy it.
perfect direct infringement claim 
only one theory of direct liability as to giganews survived the pleadings stage.in its july,order on appellees motion to dismiss the fac,the district court rejected perfect theories that giganews directly infringed perfect display rights and distribution rights,concluding that the requirement was not met.however,the district court denied appellees motion as to the claim that giganews directly infringed on perfect right to reproduce by uploading infringing content onto the usenet or giganews servers.subsequently,the district court granted summary judgment on the direct infringement claim,concluding perfect failed to prove volitional conduct with respect to either giganews or livewire.on appeal,perfect challenges the district court motion to dismiss and summary judgment orders.
display rights 
under the copyright act,the owner of a copyright has the exclusive right to display its work.d isplay means to show a copy of a work,either directly or by means of a film,slide,television image,or any other device or process.id.relying primarily on perfect,cir,perfect claims giganews is directly liable for displaying perfect images and thumbnails via the mimo reader.specifically,perfect asserts its evidence showed giganews was not merely a passive host,but rather directly caused the display of perfect images by making copies of those images and displaying them using its mimo reader.
as a preliminary matter,we note that the district court concluded perfect display direct infringement claim failed at the pleadings stage.thus,perfect argument on appeal that the district court ignored evidence is irrelevant.instead,the pertinent question is whether the fac alleged enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.bell atl.twombly.as the district court correctly concluded,the allegation that giganews directly infringes perfect display rights through the giganews mimo reader does not state a claim because the fact that users may use giganews reader to display infringing images does not constitute volitional conduct by giganews.perfect,giganews,no.abc shx,wl,at cal.july.this is because mimo is just a reader,a piece of software that allows a user to view an image,and therefore,t o the extent that mimo is used to view infringing images,this is done by the user.id.
moreover,even if we were to consider perfect evidence,the claim would still fail.the sole evidence perfect points to in support of its argument that giganews was not merely a passive host shows only that images and thumbnails were accessed through the giganews platform.the evidence does not demonstrate that giganews as opposed to the user who called up the images caused the images to be displayed.
further,our decision in amazon does not render giganews liable for direct infringement of perfect display rights.in amazon,there was no dispute that google computers store d thumbnail versions of perfect copyrighted images and communicate d copies of those thumbnails to google users.amazon,at.we concluded perfect established a prima facie case that google communication of its stored thumbnails directly infringe d perfect display right.id.however,citing costar,we also noted that b ecause google initiates and controls the storage and communication of these thumbnail images,we do not address whether an entity that merely passively owns and manages an internet bulletin board or similar system violates a copyright owner display and distribution rights when the users of the bulletin board or similar system post infringing works.id.at.
this case falls into the category of cases we declined to address in amazon.the evidence before us shows only that giganews actions were akin to passively storing material at the direction of users in order to make that material available to other users upon request,or automatically copying,storing,and transmitting materials upon instigation by others.costar,at.
accordingly,we affirm the district court dismissal of perfect display direct infringement claim.
ii.distribution rights 
perfect also contends giganews and livewire directly violated its exclusive distribution rights under,emphasizing that its evidence showed that,at the request of their subscribers,giganews and livewire delivered content to download,including copies of perfect images.
as with perfect display theory of direct liability,the district court concluded perfect distribution theory as to giganews failed at the pleadings stage.again,the proper inquiry is whether perfect complaint alleged enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.twombly,at.as the district court correctly held,the allegation that giganews directly distributes perfect images when a user requests images from giganews servers does not state a claim,because this distribution happens automatically,meaning that giganews has not engaged in volitional conduct by which it causes the distribution.perfect,wl,at.
however,even if we were to consider the evidence with respect to giganews,we would still conclude there was no direct infringement of perfect distribution rights because perfect failed to show that the distribution does not happen automatically.indeed,an analysis of perfect evidence shows only that users uploaded infringing content onto giganews servers,not that giganews played any sort of active role in causing the distribution.
with respect to livewire,we similarly conclude there was no evidence that livewire had any direct role in any act of infringement,let alone any act of infringement relating to perfect copyrighted works.perfect,wl,at.first,the evidence perfect cites the same evidence cited in support of its distribution claim against giganews does not demonstrate any volitional conduct by livewire.again,there is no indication that the distribution does not happen automatically.second,we are unpersuaded by perfect argument that livewire engaged in volitional conduct because it sold access to giganews servers,including infringing perfect images,for a monthly fee.as the district court concluded,the undisputed evidence affirmatively shows livewire sells access to all the content available on giganews servers.there is no evidence that livewire sells any of perfect copyrighted material.id.emphasis in original.
contrary to perfect assertion,new york times,tasini,does not establish that giganews or livewire directly violated perfect distribution rights by selling access to infringing images on giganews servers.as the district court noted,the question is not whether posting content online is a distribution but rather,even assuming there was a distribution,whether the defendants can be regarded as having committed the distribution,as opposed to,or in addition to,the third party users who actually uploaded the infringing content onto usenet.perfect,wl,at see also aereo,at scalia,dissenting tasini dealt with the question whether the defendants copying was permissible,not whether the defendants were the ones who made the copies.
accordingly,we affirm the district court rejection of perfect distribution direct infringement claim.
iii.reproduction rights 
with respect to the final purported basis for direct infringement,the district court correctly held that giganews did not infringe perfect exclusive reproduction rights under.as the fourth circuit held,agreeing with the reasoning of netcom,automatic copying,storage,and transmission of copyrighted materials,when instigated by others,does not render an internet service provider strictly liable for copyright infringement.costar,at see also netcom,supp.at netcom act of designing or implementing a system that automatically and uniformly creates temporary copies of all data sent through it is not unlike that of the owner of a copying machine who lets the public make copies with it.although some of the people using the machine may directly infringe copyrights,courts analyze the machine owner liability under the rubric of contributory infringement,not direct infringement.
here,perfect argues it satisfied the requirement because giganews itself instigated the copying,storage,and distribution of perfect images.we disagree.the evidence perfect cites does not demonstrate copying by giganews.fox,at see also id.o perating a system used to make copies at the user command does not mean that the system operator,rather than the user,caused copies to made.perfect provides no evidence showing giganews exercised control other than by general operation of a usenet service selected any material for upload,download,transmission,or storage or instigated any copying,storage,or distribution.accordingly,the district court correctly held there was no triable issue of material fact as to perfect claim that giganews directly infringed perfect reproduction rights.
in sum,the district court correctly rejected perfect direct infringement claim because giganews was not the proximate cause of any infringement in this case.we affirm the district court motion to dismiss and summary judgment rulings in favor of appellees as to the direct infringement claim.
contributory infringement 
perfect also claims giganews is liable for contributory copyright infringement,a form of secondary liability with roots in the concepts of enterprise liability and imputed intent.perfect,visa int l,ass n,cir.o ne contributorily infringes when he has knowledge of another infringement and either a materially contributes to or b induces that infringement.id.at.because the district court held that giganews did not know of the alleged infringement at issue in this case,it concluded that giganews was not liable for contributorily infringing perfect copyrights without addressing the second prong of the test.
we decline to reach the issue of whether the district court erred in finding that giganews lacked actual knowledge,because we find that perfect failed to establish that giganews materially contributed to or induced infringement of perfect copyrights.see summers teichert son,cir.the district court grant of summary judgment may be affirmed if it is supported by any ground in the record,whether or not the district court relied upon that ground.
material contribution to or inducement of infringing activities 
as the district court held that giganews lacked actual knowledge of infringement,it declined to address whether giganews materially contributed to or induced the infringement at issue.because we find the issues of material contribution and inducement to be dispositive,it is unnecessary to determine whether the district court correctly found that giganews lacked knowledge.even assuming that perfect takedown notices were sufficient to confer actual knowledge on giganews,perfect failed to raise a triable issue of fact as to whether giganews materially contributed to or induced infringement.
material contribution 
in the online context,we have held that a computer system operator is liable under a material contribution theory of infringement if it has actual knowledge that specific infringing material is available using its system,and can take simple measures to prevent further damage to copyrighted works,yet continues to provide access to infringing works.amazon,at internal citations and quotation marks omitted.
according to perfect,giganews could have used search terms that perfect recommended in several of its takedown notices to extract in mere seconds and remove the infringing material.perfect also claims that other usenet operators processed perfect takedown notices that were essentially the same as those sent to giganews in as little as one day.according to giganews,however,absent,there were no simple measures available to remove infringing material.giganews also disputes whether other usenet operators were able to take such simple measures based on the takedown notices provided by perfect,and cites the district court conclusion that the evidence is undisputed that the only method for consistently identifying a specific usenet message that giganews could promptly remove is the post.perfect,giganews,no.ab shx,wl,at cal.
reviewing this issue de novo,we hold that there were no simple measures available that giganews failed to take to remove perfect works from its servers.giganews presented sufficient evidence that perfect proposed method for locating infringing messages was onerous and unreasonably complicated.indeed,giganews spent more than hours processing from perfect because they were not.giganews calculates that perfect method would therefore require hours of manual work for every million the number of that giganews receives every month.moreover,the record is clear that when giganews did receive,it immediately processed them and subsequently removed the messages from its servers.
perfect asserts that its evidence demonstrates the simplicity of its proposed method and that perfect only learned of the automated feature after sending its takedown notices.perfect does not dispute,however,that giganews can easily remove infringing content if it is provided with automated,and perfect evidence only appears to relate to its argument that,by providing search results and search terms,giganews could have searched for and found.yet,as giganews argues and the district court agreed,this method is unreliable and burdensome and therefore is not a reasonable and feasible means of prevent ing further damage to perfect copyrighted works.amazon,at.
accordingly,although the district court did not address the issue,we conclude that giganews was not able to take simple measures to remove infringing materials from its servers.we therefore reject perfect first theory of contributory infringement liability.
ii.inducement 
perfect has also failed to demonstrate that giganews induced any infringement of perfect copyrighted works.with respect to this alternate theory of contributory infringement liability,the supreme court has held that one who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright,as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement,is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties.studios grokster.we have described the inducement theory as having four elements the distribution of a device or product,acts of infringement,an object of promoting its use to infringe copyright,and causation.columbia pictures,fung,cir.based on the record,no reasonable juror could conclude giganews distributed its product with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright.grokster,at.
perfect points to entirely inconclusive evidence of any such objective to infringe copyrights.for example,perfect identifies giganews advertising materials,which state that its product has and file locators that search all giganews newsgroups for music,pictures,and movies without having to download millions of messages.perfect also points to a web page where a giganews advertisement appears next to text written by another entity,which states that giganews provide s an uncensored news feed with up to ssl encrypted connection and over days worth of retention.that is over a years sic worth of access to downloadable music,movies and games.however,neither of these advertisements nor any other evidence in the record indicates that giganews itself promoted its product with the object of infringing copyright.
perfect further argues that giganews has the object of promoting infringement because it offers terabytes of copyrighted materials without permission,continues to commercially exploit the content of known repeat infringers,and advertises that it does not keep track of subscriber downloads,effectively encouraging infringement.even if true,none of this conduct suggests that giganews clearly expressed an intent to promote infringement or took affirmative steps to foster infringement.grokster,at.
for the foregoing reasons,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of giganews as to perfect contributory infringement claim.
vicarious infringement 
perfect also argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to giganews on perfect vicarious infringement claim by applying an incorrect legal standard as to financial benefit,and concluding there was insufficient evidence to find giganews vicariously liable.we hold that the district court applied the correct legal standard and properly granted summary judgment on the vicarious infringement claim in favor of giganews.
to prevail on a claim for vicarious infringement,a plaintiff must prove the defendant has the right and ability to supervise the infringing conduct and a direct financial interest in the infringing activity.visa,at footnote omitted.with respect to the second element the only element the district court addressed we have explained that a f inancial benefit exists where the availability of infringing material acts as a draw for customers.ellison,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.further,as the district court correctly stated,t he size of the draw relative to a defendant overall business is immaterial.perfect,wl,at.indeed,t he essential aspect of the direct financial benefit inquiry is whether there is a causal relationship between the infringing activity and any financial benefit a defendant reaps,regardless of how substantial the benefit is in proportion to a defendant overall profits.ellison,at.
therefore,perfect must demonstrate a causal link between the infringing activities and a financial benefit to giganews.as the district court noted,t his action is a specific lawsuit by a specific plaintiff against a specific defendant about specific copyrighted images it is not a lawsuit against copyright infringement in general on the usenet.perfect,wl,at.thus,the direct financial benefit prong of the vicarious infringement test demands more than evidence that customers were drawn to giganews to obtain access to infringing material in general.id.
in ellison,we rejected a plaintiff vicarious copyright infringement claim based on the uploading of copyrighted material to a usenet newsgroup because the plaintiff failed to show the defendant received a direct financial benefit from the infringement in this case.ellison,at.the district court correctly interpreted the references to the infringing activity and the infringement in this case,id.emphasis added,to mean infringement of the plaintiff copyrighted material,rather than general infringement.this interpretation is supported not only by our repeated use of the definite article the infringing activity in ellison,but also by our analysis in that decision.in ellison,after receiving the plaintiff complaint,aol blocked access to the specific newsgroup that contained the infringing material at issue in the complaint.id.at.in our discussion of the direct financial benefit prong,we concluded t he record lacks evidence that aol attracted or retained subscriptions because of the infringement or lost subscriptions because of aol eventual obstruction of the infringement.id.at.particularly given aol actions upon receipt of the plaintiff complaint blocking access to the newsgroup at issue the phrase aol eventual obstruction of the infringement logically refers to the infringement of the plaintiff material,rather than to general copyright infringement.therefore,contrary to perfect suggestion,ellison does not compel the court to hold a defendant vicariously liable regardless of whether there is any causal link between the infringement of the plaintiff own copyrighted works and any profit to the service provider.
perfect view of vicarious infringement is not only inconsistent with ellison,but also difficult to reconcile with article iii standing requirements.standing under article iii requires that a plaintiff have suffered an injury in fact,that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant,and that is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.spokeo,robins.
here,perfect argues for a rule that would allow a court to hold giganews liable under a theory of vicarious liability by showing only that giganews benefits financially from the infringement of another works,regardless of whether giganews received any financial benefit from the specific infringement alleged.such a rule would allow cases to be built on the rights of owners and the actions of users not before the court.at the very least,perfect proposed rule is in significant tension with article iii standing requirement.at most,perfect view runs counter to the requirement that there be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of.lujan defs.of wildlife.
accordingly,we reject perfect formulation of the direct financial benefit inquiry and hold that perfect was required to provide evidence that customers were drawn to giganews services because of the infringing perfect material at issue.we also conclude that there was no evidence indicating that anyone subscribed to giganews because of infringing perfect material.see ellison,at.indeed,perfect provides evidence that suggests only that some subscribers joined giganews to access infringing material generally perfect does not proffer evidence showing that giganews attracted subscriptions because of the infringing perfect material.as the district court noted,t hat a giganews customer may have posted or accessed copyrighted perfect material as an added benefit to a subscription is insufficient.perfect,wl,at see ellison,at there are cases in which customers value a service that does not act as a draw.t he central question of the direct financial benefit inquiry is whether the infringing activity constitutes a draw for subscribers,not just an added benefit.
because the district court did not err in finding that giganews did not receive a direct financial benefit from the infringement in this case,we need not address whether giganews had the right and ability to supervise the infringing conduct.ellison,at.
perfect apparently does not appeal the dismissal of its vicarious infringement claim against livewire at the pleadings stage.indeed,perfect does not mention livewire in the sections of its brief devoted to its vicarious infringement claim.nonetheless,to the extent perfect appeals this dismissal and its argument is not waived,we hold that the district court correctly dismissed the vicarious infringement claim against livewire because perfect failed to adequately plead that livewire exercised the requisite control over the infringing activity of its clients.
in its fee award order,the district court concluded that giganews and livewire were the prevailing parties and found that an award of attorney fees would serve the purposes of the copyright act.the district court also awarded attorney fees pursuant to california civil code a because appellees successfully defended against perfect common right of publicity claim.ultimately,the district court awarded giganews and livewire a total of in attorney fees and in nontaxable costs.perfect argues the district court abused its discretion in awarding attorney fees under the copyright act because the fee award was contrary to the purposes of the act,the district court made erroneous findings of fact regarding the factors outlined in fogerty fantasy,fogerty i,and the total award was not reasonable.we reject these arguments and affirm the fee award.
the copyright act provides that,in a copyright action,the court in its discretion may allow the recovery of full costs by or against any party other than the united states,including a reasonable attorney fee to the prevailing party as part of the costs.
the supreme court has identified the following nonexclusive list of factors to guide the award or denial of attorney fees frivolousness,motivation,objective unreasonableness both in the factual and in the legal components of the case,and the need in particular circumstances to advance considerations of compensation and deterrence.skyy spirits,cir.quoting fogerty i,at.we have added as additional considerations the degree of success obtained,the purposes of the copyright act,and whether the chilling effect of attorney fees may be t
