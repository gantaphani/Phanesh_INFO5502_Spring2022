under the copyright act of the act,t he legal or beneficial owner of an exclusive right under a copyright is entitled to institute an action for any infringement of that particular right committed while he or she is the owner of it.b.mtm argues that the works warren composed were works made for hire,and warren is therefore not the legal owner and thus lacks standing.warren argues that the contracts do not create a relationship,and that,even if they do,mtm breaches of the agreements entitle warren to rescind the contracts and regain legal ownership of the copyrights.in the alternative,he argues that he is a beneficial owner because he is entitled to royalties and therefore he may sue under b.
it is appropriate to address the question of standing in deciding a motion to dismiss because t he elements of standing are an indispensable part of the plaintiff case,and accordingly must be supported at each stage of litigation in the same manner as any other essential element of the case.cent.delta water agency united states,cir quoting lujan defenders of wildlife,d.further,if warren lacks standing to assert his federal copyright claims,the district court did not have subject matter jurisdiction and dismissal was appropriate.see.b scott pasadena unified sch,cir.however,at this stage of the pleading,warren need only show that the facts alleged,if proved,would confer standing upon him.see steel citizens for a better environment,d.
the act provides that copyright ownership vests initially in the author or authors of the work.a.however,if the work is made for hire,the employer or other person for whom the work was prepared is considered the author,and,unless the parties have expressly agreed otherwise in a written instrument signed by them,owns all the rights in the copyright.b.section of the act defines a work made for hire as 
a work prepared by an employee within the scope of his or her employment or a work specially ordered or commissioned for use as a part of a motion picture or other audiovisual work,if the parties expressly agree in a written instrument signed by them that the work shall be considered a work made for hire.
the parties agree that warren was not an employee of mtm,but mtm contends that the agreements signed by the parties illustrate an express agreement that the works in question were specially commissioned as works for hire we agree.
the act confers status on a work where the parties expressly agree in a written instrument signed by them that the work shall be considered a work made for hire.the first agreement,signed on february,states that mtm contracted to employ warren to render services to mtm for the television pilot photoplay now entitled remington steele.it also is clear that the parties agreed that mtm would own all right,title and interest in and to warren services and the results and proceeds thereof,and all other rights granted to mtm in the music employment agreement to the same extent as if mtm were the employer of warren.the music employment agreement provided 
as warren employer for hire,mtm shall own in perpetuity,throughout the universe,solely and exclusively,all rights of every kind and character,in the musical material and all other results and proceeds of the services rendered by warren hereunder and mtm shall be deemed the author thereof for all purposes.
