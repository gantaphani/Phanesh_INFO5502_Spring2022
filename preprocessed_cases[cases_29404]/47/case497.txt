in this appeal from the denial of a motion to strike under code of civil procedure section,the statute,the primary issue is whether the filing of a lawsuit in a foreign country is protected activity under the united states or california constitutions so as to implicate the statute.we conclude that it is not and affirm the order denying the motion.

in,chrome hearts opened its own boutique in paris.in may,chrome hearts sued five bis in the paris court of first instance tribunal de grande instance,alleging infringement of chrome hearts trademarks and seeking to enjoin five bis from using these marks.in opposition,five bis argued that the claims were barred by the parties covenant not to sue.the french court rejected this argument and enjoined five bis from using the chrome hearts marks.five bis appealed,and the paris court of appeals cour de paris affirmed the lower court.five bis appealed this ruling to the french supreme court cour de cassation,and also filed a request for reappraisal in the paris court of appeals.these appeals were still pending at the time of the trial court ruling on the motion to strike at issue here.
in december,chrome hearts filed a second action against five bis in france,alleging infringement of the chrome hearts trademark.that action is still pending in france 
plaintiffs then filed suit in the superior court of los angeles county against chrome hearts for breach of contract and declaratory relief,alleging that the filing of the french actions violated the covenant not to sue.they also sought to permanently enjoin chrome hearts from proceeding with the two trademark infringement actions being prosecuted in france,and from ever filing another lawsuit against plaintiffs anywhere in the world alleging trademark infringement,trade dress infringement,unfair competition,or any similar or related claim,except claims against guessous of misuse of the words chrome hearts.
