the panel affirmed the district court judgment as a matter of law in favor of electronic arts,in a diversity action seeking unpaid royalties pursuant to a contract,arising from alleged copyright infringement.
plaintiff robin antonick developed the computer code for the original john madden football game for the apple ii computer,which was released by electronic arts.electronic arts subsequently released madden games for sega genesis and super nintendo for which plaintiff received no royalties under a contract.
concerning plaintiff sega claims,the panel held that the plaintiff did not provide sufficient evidence of copyright infringement because neither the source code used for apple ii madden nor sega madden was in evidence.the panel also rejected plaintiff argument that electronic arts fed.civ.b motion for judgment as a matter of law regarding the intrinsic test for copyright infringement should not have been considered.
concerning plaintiff super nintendo claims,the panel held that the district court did not err in dismissing plaintiff derivative work claims because the apple ii and super nintendo processors were not in the same microprocessor family,as defined by the parties contract.the panel also affirmed the district court conclusion that the jury could not have determined plaintiff damages from the alleged breach of contract to a reasonable certainty.the panel further held that,even if the district court erred,there was no harm,because plaintiff failure to introduce any source code precluded a finding that super nintendo madden was a derivative work.
finally,the panel held that plaintiff offered no evidence of purported damages arising from plaintiff claim that electronic arts used development aids to create works without seeking a negotiated license.
hurwitz,circuit judge 
in this case,the plaintiff claimed copyright infringement.but the contents of the copyrighted work and the allegedly infringing works were never introduced into evidence.the district court held that the claim failed as a matter of law.we agree,and affirm.
background 
robin antonick developed the computer code for the original john madden football game for the apple ii computer apple ii madden.electronic arts,ea released apple ii madden in.apple ii madden,the first football video game with players on each side,was an instant hit,the best seller of any sports video game of its time.antonick subsequently programmed madden games for the commodore and computers ibm madden.
in,antonick began working for ea on madden games for the nintendo and sega genesis entertainment systems.but in august,ea told him to stop nintendo was becoming obsolete,and ea had decided on a new direction for the sega game,hiring park place productions to create a version with more of an arcade style.in november,ea released its first version of sega madden.in late or early,ea released antonick last madden game,an update of ibm madden.
each year from to,ea released madden games for sega genesis and super nintendo super nintendo madden.the madden games have remained incredibly lucrative,selling millions of copies and even attracting a loyal fan base among professional football players.
antonick contract with ea defined a custom computer software program known as john madden football designed for the apple ii family of computers as the work,and provided that antonick would receive royalties on any derivative work,defined as any computer software program or electronic game which constitutes a derivative work of the work within the meaning of the united states copyright law.antonick received no royalties for sega madden or super nintendo madden,which ea assured him were not derivative works.
in,antonick brought this diversity action against ea,seeking contract damages in the form of unpaid royalties for sega madden and super nintendo madden.the district court bifurcated the trial.in phase i,the jury found that the statute of limitations did not bar antonick claims.phase ii involved the merits of antonick claims.antonick produced evidence that park place was rushed and inadequately staffed,and argued that it copied his code to meet the demanding deadline for the first sega madden.antonick expert,michael barr,opined that sega madden was substantially similar to certain elements of apple ii madden.in particular,barr opined that the games had similar formations,plays,play numberings,and player ratings a similar,disproportionately wide field a similar directional system and similar variable names,including variables that misspelled scrimmage.but neither the source code for apple ii madden the work nor the source code of any allegedly infringing works were introduced into evidence.nor were images of the games at issue introduced 
nonetheless,the jury found that the sega madden games were derivative works under the contract.the district court then granted judgment as a matter of law jmol to ea,holding that antonick had not provided sufficient evidence of copyright infringement,because neither the source code used for apple ii madden nor sega madden was in evidence.
ii.discussion 
a.the sega claims 
although this is a contract case,because royalties are available to antonick under the contract only for a derivative work of apple ii madden within the meaning of the united states copyright law,he had to prove copyright infringement to prevail on his contract claims.antonick was thus required to prove that ea copied protected elements of the work.jada toys,mattel,cir.citations omitted.absent direct evidence of copying,proof of infringement involves showings that the defendant had access to the plaintiff work and that the two works are substantially similar.three boys music bolton,cir.citation omitted.
the ninth circuit employs a test for determining whether one work is substantially similar to another.benay warner.entm t,cir.citation omitted.
a plaintiff must prove both substantial similarity under the extrinsic test and substantial similarity under the intrinsic test.the extrinsic test is an objective comparison of specific expressive elements.the intrinsic test is a subjective comparison that focuses on whether the ordinary,reasonable audience would find the works substantially similar in the total concept and feel of the works.
id.citations and question marks omitted.the district court granted jmol to ea under the intrinsic test because the jury had no evidence of apple ii madden or sega madden as a whole to enable it to make this subjective comparison.
the district court was correct.antonick claims rest on the contention that the source code of the sega madden games infringed on the source code for apple ii madden.but,none of the source code was in evidence.the jury therefore could not compare the works to determine substantial similarity.see seiler lucasfilm,cir.there can be no proof of substantial similarity and thus of copyright infringement unless seiler works are juxtaposed with lucas and their contents compared.applying the best evidence rule in a copyright action id.p roof of the infringement claim consists of the works alleged to be infringed.accord airframe,commc ns,cir.having presented no evidence sufficient to prove the content of its registered source code versions,airframe can not show that any of its registered works is substantially similar to the allegedly infringing program.universal,lee,cir.per curiam without providing its own source code for comparison,gus did not satisfy the requirement that the infringed and infringing work be compared.and,absent evidence of the copyrighted work and the allegedly infringing works,the record is insufficient to allow appellate review of the jury verdict.see,olson broad,cir.granting jmol to copyright defendant because no reasonable jury could have found substantial similarity shaw lindheim,cir.we have frequently affirmed summary judgment in favor of copyright defendants on the issue of substantial similarity.
antonick argues there was no need to introduce the source code or even the games at issue,because park place had access to the apple ii madden code and a motive to copy it,and his expert and others testified to the similarity of the works.these argu
