the copyright act of makes pictorial,graphic,or sculptural features of the design of a useful article eligible for copyright protection as artistic works if those features can be identified separately from,and are capable of existing independently of,the utilitarian aspects of the article.
respondents have more than copyright registrations for designs consisting of various lines,chevrons,and colorful shapes appearing on the surface of the cheerleading uniforms that they design,make,and sell.they sued petitioner,who also markets cheerleading uniforms,for copyright infringement.the district court granted petitioner summary judgment,holding that the designs could not be conceptually or physically separated from the uniforms and were therefore ineligible for copyright protection.in reversing,the sixth circuit concluded that the graphics could be identified separately and were capable of existing independently of the uniforms under.
held a feature incorporated into the design of a useful article is eligible for copyright protection only if the feature can be perceived as a two or work of art separate from the useful article,and would qualify as a protectable pictorial,graphic,or sculptural work either on its own or fixed in some other tangible medium of expression if it were imagined separately from the useful article into which it is incorporated.that test is satisfied here.
a separability analysis is necessary in this case.respondents claim that surface decorations are always separable,even without resorting to a analysis,because they are on a useful article rather than designs of a useful article.but this argument is inconsistent with text.p ictorial and graphic denote features such as pictures,paintings,or drawings.thus,by providing protection for pictorial,graphical,and sculptural works incorporated into the design of a useful article,necessarily contemplates that such a design can include features.this court will not adjudicate in the first instance the government distinct argument against applying separability analysis,which was neither raised below nor advanced here by any party.
b whether a feature incorporated into a useful article can be identified separately from,and is capable of existing independently of,the article utilitarian aspects is a matter of statutory interpretation.mazer stein.
section requirement is met if the decisionmaker is able to look at the useful article and spot some two or element that appears to have pictorial,graphic,or sculptural qualities.to satisfy the requirement,the feature must be able to exist as its own pictorial,graphic,or sculptural work once it is imagined apart from the useful article.if the feature could not exist as a pictorial,graphic,or sculptural work on its own,it is simply one of the article utilitarian aspects.and to qualify as a pictorial,graphic,or sculptural work on its own,the feature can not be a useful article or a n article that is normally a part of a useful article,neither could one claim a copyright in a useful article by creating a replica of it in another medium.
the statute as a whole confirms this interpretation.section,which protects art first fixed in the medium of a useful article,is essentially the mirror image of a,which protects art first fixed in a medium other than a useful article and subsequently applied to a useful article.together,these provisions make clear that copyright protection extends to pictorial,graphic,and sculptural works regardless of whether they were created as freestanding art or as features of useful articles.
this interpretation is also consistent with the copyright act history.in mazer,a case decided under the copyright act,the court held that respondents owned a copyright in a statuette created for use as a lamp base.in so holding,the court approved a copyright office regulation extending protection to works of art that might also serve a useful purpose and held that it was irrelevant to the copyright inquiry whether the statuette was initially created as a freestanding sculpture or as a lamp base.soon after,the copyright office enacted a regulation implementing mazer holding that anticipated the language of,thereby introducing the modern separability test to copyright law.congress essentially lifted the language from those regulations and placed it in of the act.
c applying the proper test here,the surface decorations on the cheerleading uniforms are separable and therefore eligible for copyright protection.first,the decorations can be identified as features having pictorial,graphic,or sculptural qualities.second,if those decorations were separated from the uniforms and applied in another medium,they would qualify as works of art under.imaginatively removing the decorations from the uniforms and applying them in another medium also would not replicate the uniform itself.
the dissent argues that the decorations are ineligible for copyright protection because,when imaginatively extracted,they form a picture of a cheerleading uniform.petitioner similarly claims that the decorations can not be copyrighted because,even when extracted from the useful article,they retain the outline of a cheerleading uniform.but this is not a bar to copyright.just as fine art correlates to the shape of the canvas on which it is painted,applied art correlates to the contours of the article on which it is applied.the only feature of respondents cheerleading uniform eligible for a copyright is the applied art on the surface of the uniforms.respondents may prohibit the reproduction only of the surface designs on a uniform or in any other medium of expression.respondents have no right to prevent anyone from manufacturing a cheerleading uniform that is identical in shape,cut,or dimensions to the uniforms at issue here.
d none of the objections raised by petitioner or the government is meritorious.
petitioner and the government focus on the relative utility of the plain white uniform that would remain if the designs were physically removed from the uniform.but the separability inquiry focuses on the extracted feature and not on any aspects of the useful article remaining after the imaginary extraction.the statute does not require the imagined remainder to be a fully functioning useful article at all.nor can an artistic feature that would be eligible for copyright protection on its own lose that protection simply because it was first created as a feature of the design of a useful article,even if it makes that article more useful.this has been the rule since mazer,and it is consistent with the statute explicit protection of applied art.in rejecting petitioner view,the court necessarily abandons the distinction between physical and conceptual separability adopted by some courts and commentators.
petitioner also suggests incorporating two objective components into the test one requiring consideration of evidence of the creator design methods,purposes,and reasons,and one looking to the feature marketability.the court declines to incorporate these components because neither is grounded in the statute text.
finally,petitioner claims that protecting surface decorations is inconsistent with congress intent to entirely exclude industrial design from copyright.but congress has given limited copyright protection to certain features of industrial design.approaching the statute with presumptive hostility toward protection for industrial design would undermine that choice.in any event,the test adopted here does not render the underlying uniform eligible for copyright protection.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit 
justice thomas delivered the opinion of the court.
congress has provided copyright protection for original works of art,but not for industrial designs.the line between art and industrial design,however,is often difficult to draw.this is particularly true when an industrial design incorporates artistic elements.congress has afforded limited protection for these artistic elements by providing that pictorial,graphic,or sculptural features of the design of a useful article are eligible for copyright protection as artistic works if those features can be identified separately from,and are capable of existing independently of,the utilitarian aspects of the article.
we granted certiorari to resolve widespread disagreement over the proper test for implementing separateidentification and requirements.we hold that a feature incorporated into the design of a useful article is eligible for copyright protection only if the feature can be perceived as a two or work of art separate from the useful article and would qualify as a protectable pictorial,graphic,or sculptural work either on its own or fixed in some other tangible medium of expression if it were imagined separately from the useful article into which it is incorporated.because that test is satisfied in this case,we affirm.
respondents varsity brands,varsity spirit corporation,and varsity spirit fashions supplies,design,make,and sell cheerleading uniforms.respondents have obtained or acquired more than copyright registrations for designs appearing on the surface of their uniforms and other garments.these designs are primarily combinations,positionings,and arrangements of elements that include chevrons,lines,curves,stripes,angles,diagonals,inverted chevrons,coloring,and shapes.app.at issue in this case are designs,and.see appendix,infra.
petitioner star athletica,also markets and sells cheerleading uniforms.respondents sued petitioner for infringing their copyrights in the five designs.the district court entered summary judgment for petitioner on respondents copyright claims on the ground that the designs did not qualify as protectable pictorial,graphic,or sculptural works.it reasoned that the designs served the useful,or utilitarian,function of identifying the garments as cheerleading uniforms and therefore could not be physically or conceptually separated under from the utilitarian function of the uniform.wl,wd.
the court of appeals for the sixth circuit reversed.in its view,the graphic designs were separately identifiable because the designs and a blank cheerleading uniform can appear side by side one as a graphic design,and one as a cheerleading uniform.at quoting compendium of copyright office practices b ed.compendium.and it determined that the designs were capable of existing independently because they could be incorporated onto the surface of different types of garments,or hung on the wall and framed as,at.
judge mckeague dissented.he would have held that,because identifying the wearer as a cheerleader is a utilitarian function of a cheerleading uniform and the surface designs were integral to achieving that function,the designs were inseparable from the uniforms,at.
the first element of a claim is ownership of a valid copyright.feist publications,rural telephone service.a valid copyright extends only to copyrightable subject matter.see nimmer nimmer,copyright a nimmer.the copyright act of defines copyrightable subject matter as original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression.a.
works of authorship include pictorial,graphic,and sculptural works,a,which the statute defines to include and works of fine,graphic,and applied art,photographs,prints and art reproductions,maps,globes,charts,diagrams,models,and technical drawings,including architectural plans,and a work of authorship is fixed in a tangible medium of expression when it is embodi ed in a material objec t from which the work can be perceived,reproduced,or otherwise communicated.ibid.definitions of fixed and copies 
the copyright act also establishes a special rule for copyrighting a pictorial,graphic,or sculptural work incorporated into a useful article,which is defined as an article having an intrinsic utilitarian function that is not merely to portray the appearance of the article or to convey information.ibid.the statute does not protect useful articles as such.rather,the design of a useful article is considered a pictorial,graphical,or sculptural work only if,and only to the extent that,such design incorporates pictorial,graphic,or sculptural features that can be identified separately from,and are capable of existing independently of,the utilitarian aspects of the article.ibid.
courts,the copyright office,and commentators have described the analysis undertaken to determine whether a feature can be separately identified from,and exist independently of,a useful article as separability.in this case,our task is to determine whether the arrangements of lines,chevrons,and colorful shapes appearing on the surface of respondents cheerleading uniforms are eligible for copyright protection as separable features of the design of those cheerleading uniforms.
as an initial matter,we must address whether separability analysis is necessary in this case.
respondents argue that s eparability is only implicated when a pictorial,graphic,or sculptural work is the design of a useful article.brief for respondents.they contend that the surface decorations in this case are graphic designs that appear on useful articles,but are not themselves designs of useful articles,at.consequently,the surface decorations are protected works of graphic art without regard to any separability analysis under.see patry,copyright,patry courts looking at design claims should not apply the separability analysis regardless of the form that design is embodied in under this theory,artistic features on the surface of useful articles are inherently separable.brief for respondents.
this argument is inconsistent with the text of.the statute requires separability analysis for any pictorial,graphic,or sculptural features incorporated into the design of a useful article.design refers here to the combination of details or features that go to make up the useful article.oxford english dictionary def,first listing oed.furthermore,the words pictorial and graphic include,in this context,features such as pictures,paintings,or drawings.see,at defining g raphic to mean o f or pertaining to drawing or painting at defining p ictorial to mean of or pertaining to painting or drawing and the statute expressly defines p ictorial,graphical,and sculptural works to include works of art.the statute thus provides that the design of a useful article can include pictorial and graphic features,and separability analysis applies to those features just as it does to sculptural features.
the united states makes a related but distinct argument against applying separability analysis in this case,which respondents do not and have not advanced.as part of their copyright registrations for the designs in this case,respondents deposited with the copyright office drawings and photographs depicting the designs incorporated onto cheerleading uniforms.app.appendix,infra.the government argues that,assuming the other statutory requirements were met,respondents obtained a copyright in the deposited drawings and photographs and have simply reproduced those copyrighted works on the surface of a useful article,as they would have the exclusive right to do under the copyright act.see brief for united states as amicus curiae.accordingly,the government urges,separability analysis is unnecessary on the record in this case.we generally do not entertain arguments that were not raised below and that are not advanced in this court by any party,burwell hobby lobby stores,because i t is not the court usual practice to adjudicate either legal or predicate factual questions in the first instance,crst van expedited,eeoc,slip,at.we decline to depart from our usual practice here.
we must now decide when a feature incorporated into a useful article can be identified separately from and is capable of existing independently of the utilitarian aspects of the article.this is not a search for the best copyright policy,but rather depends solely on statutory interpretation.mazer stein.the controlling principle in this case is the basic and unexceptional rule that courts must give effect to the clear meaning of statutes as written.estate of cowart nicklos drilling.we thus begin and end our inquiry with the text,giving each word its ordinary,contemporary,common meaning.walters metropolitan ed.enterprises,internal quotation marks omitted.we do not,however,limit this inquiry to the text of in isolation.i nterpretation of a phrase of uncertain reach is not confined to a single sentence when the text of the whole statute gives instruction as to its meaning.maracich spears,slip,at.we thus look to the provisions of the whole law to determine meaning.united states heirs of boisdoré,how.
the statute provides that a pictorial,graphic,or sculptural featur e incorporated into the design of a useful article is eligible for copyright protection if it can be identified separately from,and is capable of existing independently of,the utilitarian aspects of the article.the first requirement separate identification is not onerous.the decisionmaker need only be able to look at the useful article and spot some two or element that appears to have pictorial,graphic,or sculptural qualities.see patry,at to.
the requirement is ordinarily more difficult to satisfy.the decisionmaker must determine that the separately identified feature has the capacity to exist apart from the utilitarian aspects of the article.see oed def.defining c apable of as h aving the needful capacity,power,or fitness for in other words,the feature must be able to exist as its own pictorial,graphic,or sculptural work as defined in once it is imagined apart from the useful article.if the feature is not capable of existing as a pictorial,graphic,or sculptural work once separated from the useful article,then it was not a pictorial,graphic,or sculptural feature of that article,but rather one of its utilitarian aspects.
of course,to qualify as a pictorial,graphic,or sculptural work on its own,the feature can not itself be a useful article or a n article that is normally a part of a useful article which is itself considered a useful article.nor could someone claim a copyright in a useful article merely by creating a replica of that article in some other medium for example,a cardboard model of a car.although the replica could itself be copyrightable,it would not give rise to any rights in the useful article that inspired it.
the statute as a whole confirms our interpretation.the copyright act provides the owner of a copyright with the exclusive righ t to reproduce the copyrighted work in copies.the statute clarifies that this right includes the right to reproduce the copyrighted work in or on any kind of article,whether useful or otherwise.a.section is,in essence,the mirror image of a.whereas a protects a work of authorship first fixed in some tangible medium other than a useful article and subsequently applied to a useful article,protects art first fixed in the medium of a useful article.the two provisions make clear that copyright protection extends to pictorial,graphic,and sculptural works regardless of whether they were created as freestanding art or as features of useful articles.the ultimate separability question,then,is whether the feature for which copyright protection is claimed would have been eligible for copyright protection as a pictorial,graphic,or sculptural work had it originally been fixed in some tangible medium other than a useful article before being applied to a useful article.
this interpretation is also consistent with the history of the copyright act.in mazer,a case decided under the copyright act,the respondents copyrighted a statuette depicting a dancer.the statuette was intended for use as a lamp base,with electric wiring,sockets and lamp shades attached.at.copies of the statuette were sold both as lamp bases and separately as statuettes,at.the petitioners copied the statuette and sold lamps with the statuette as the base.they defended against the respondents infringement suit by arguing that the respondents did not have a copyright in a statuette intended for use as a lamp base,at.
two of mazer holdings are relevant here.first,the court held that the respondents owned a copyright in the statuette even though it was intended for use as a lamp base.see,at.in doing so,the court approved the copyright office regulation extending copyright protection to works of art that might also serve a useful purpose.see ibid.approving cfr a protecting works of artistic craftsmanship,in so far as their form but not their mechanical or utilitarian aspects are concerned 
second,the court held that it was irrelevant to the copyright inquiry whether the statuette was initially created as a freestanding sculpture or as a lamp base,at nor do we think the subsequent registration of a work of art published as an element in a manufactured article,is a misuse of copyright.this is not different from the registration of a statuette and its later embodiment in an industrial article mazer thus interpreted the act consistently with the rule discussed above if a design would have been copyrightable as a standalone pictorial,graphic,or sculptural work,it is copyrightable if created first as part of a useful article.
shortly thereafter,the copyright office enacted a regulation implementing the holdings of mazer.see nimmer b b.as amended,the regulation introduced the modern separability test to copyright law 
if the sole intrinsic function of an article is its utility,the fact that the article is unique and attractively shaped will not qualify it as a work of art.however,if the shape of a utilitarian article incorporates features,such as artistic sculpture,carving,or pictorial representation,which can be identified separately and are capable of existing independently as a work of art,such features will be eligible for registration.cfr c punctuation altered.
congress essentially lifted the language governing protection for the design of a useful article directly from the regulations and placed it into of the act.consistent with mazer,the approach we outline today interprets and in a way that would afford copyright protection to the statuette in mazer regardless of whether it was first created as a standalone sculptural work or as the base of the lamp.see,at.
in sum,a feature of the design of a useful article is eligible for copyright if,when identified and imagined apart from the useful article,it would qualify as a pictorial,graphic,or sculptural work either on its own or when fixed in some other tangible medium.
applying this test to the surface decorations on the cheerleading uniforms is straightforward.first,one can identify the decorations as features having pictorial,graphic,or sculptural qualities.second,if the arrangement of colors,shapes,stripes,and chevrons on the surface of the cheerleading uniforms were separated from the uniform and applied in another medium for example,on a painter canvas they would qualify as works of art,and imaginatively removing the surface decorations from the uniforms and applying them in another medium would not replicate the uniform itself.indeed,respondents have applied the designs in this case to other media of expression different types of clothing without replicating the uniform.see app.the decorations are therefore separable from the uniforms and eligible for copyright protection 
the dissent argues that the designs are not separable because imaginatively removing them from the uniforms and placing them in some other medium of expression a canvas,for example would create pictures of cheerleader uniforms.post,at opinion of breyer.petitioner similarly argues that the decorations can not be copyrighted because,even when extracted from the useful article,they retain the outline of a cheerleading uniform.brief for petitioner.
this is not a bar to copyright.just as fine art corresponds to the shape of the canvas on which it is painted,applied art correlates to the contours of the article on which it is applied.a fresco painted on a wall,ceiling panel,or dome would not lose copyright protection,for example,simply because it was designed to track the dimensions of the surface on which it was painted.or consider,for example,a design etched or painted on the surface of a guitar.if that entire design is imaginatively removed from the guitar surface and placed on an album cover,it would still resemble the shape of a guitar.but the image on the cover does not replicate the guitar as a useful article.rather,the design is a work of art that corresponds to the shape of the useful article to which it was applied.the statute protects that work of art whether it is first drawn on the album cover and then applied to the guitar surface,or vice versa.failing to protect that art would create an anomaly it would extend protection to designs that cover a part of a useful article but would not protect the same design if it covered the entire article.the statute does not support that distinction,nor can it be reconciled with the dissent recognition that artwork printed on a could be protected.post,at internal quotation marks omitted.
to be clear,the only feature of the cheerleading uniform eligible for a copyright in this case is the work of art fixed in the tangible medium of the uniform fabric.even if respondents ultimately succeed in establishing a valid copyright in the surface decorations at issue here,respondents have no right to prohibit any person from manufacturing a cheerleading uniform of identical shape,cut,and dimensions to the ones on which the decorations in this case appear.they may prohibit only the reproduction of the surface designs in any tangible medium of expression a uniform or otherwise 
petitioner and the government raise several objections to the approach we announce today.none is meritorious.
petitioner first argues that our reading of the statute is missing an important step.it contends that a feature may exist independently only if it can stand alone as a copyrightable work and if the useful article from which it was extracted would remain equally useful.in other words,copyright extends only to solely artistic features of useful articles.brief for petitioner.according to petitioner,if a feature of a useful article advance s the utility of the article,at,then it is categorically beyond the scope of copyright,at.the designs here are not protected,it argues,because they are necessary to two of the uniforms inherent,essential,or natural functions identifying the wearer as a cheerleader and enhancing the wearer physical appearance,at,reply brief.because the uniforms would not be equally useful without the designs,petitioner contends that the designs are inseparable from the utilitarian aspects of the uniform.brief for petitioner.
the government raises a similar argument,although it reaches a different result.it suggests that the appropriate test is whether the useful article with the artistic feature removed would remai n similarly useful.brief for united states as amicus curiae emphasis added.in the view of the united states,however,a plain white cheerleading uniform is similarly useful to uniforms with respondents designs,at.
the debate over the relative utility of a plain white cheerleading uniform is unnecessary.the focus of the separability inquiry is on the extracted feature and not on any aspects of the useful article that remain after the imaginary extraction.the statute does not require the decisionmaker to imagine a fully functioning useful article without the artistic feature.instead,it requires that the separated feature qualify as a nonuseful pictorial,graphic,or sculptural work on its own.
of course,because the removed feature may not be a useful article as it would then not qualify as a pictorial,graphic,or sculptural work there necessarily would be some aspects of the original useful article left behind if the feature were conceptually removed.but the statute does not require the imagined remainder to be a fully functioning useful article at all,much less an equally useful one.indeed,such a requirement would deprive the mazer statuette of protection had it been created first as a lamp base rather than as a statuette.without the base,the lamp would be just a shade,bulb,and wires.the statute does not require that we imagine a nonartistic replacement for the removed feature to determine whether that feature is capable of an independent existence.
petitioner argument follows from its flawed view that the statute protects only solely artistic features that have no effect whatsoever on a useful article utilitarian function.this view is inconsistent with the statutory text.the statute expressly protects two and applied art.applied art is art employed in the decoration,design,or execution of useful objects,webster third new international dictionary emphasis added,or those arts or crafts that have a primarily utilitarian function,or the designs and decorations used in these arts,random house dictionary emphasis added see also oed ed.defining applied as p ut to practical use an artistic feature that would be eligible for copyright protection on its own can not lose that protection simply because it was first created as a feature of the design of a useful article,even if it makes that article more useful.
indeed,this has been the rule since mazer.in holding that the statuette was protected,the court emphasized that the act abandoned any distinctions between purely aesthetic articles and useful works of art.at.congress did not enact such a distinction in the act.were we to accept petitioner argument that the only protectable features are those that play absolutely no role in an article function,we would effectively abrogate the rule of mazer and read applied art out of the statute.
because we reject the view that a useful article must remain after the artistic feature has been imaginatively separated from the article,we necessarily abandon the distinction between physical and conceptual separability,which some courts and commentators have adopted based on the copyright act legislative history.see.according to this view,a feature is physically separable from the underlying useful article if it can be physically separated from the article by ordinary means while leaving the utilitarian aspects of the article completely intact.compendium a see also chosun int l,chrisha creations.conceptual separability applies if the feature physically could not be removed from the useful article by ordinary means.see compendium b but see goldstein,copyright,ed.explaining that the lower courts have been unable to agree on a single conceptual separability test patry surveying the various approaches in the lower courts.
the statutory text indicates that separability is a conceptual undertaking.because separability does not require the underlying useful article to remain,the distinction is unnecessary.
petitioner next argues that we should incorporate two objective components,reply brief,into our test to provide guidance to the lower courts whether the design elements can be identified as reflecting the designer artistic judgment exercised independently of functional influence,brief for petitioner emphasis deleted and internal quotation marks omitted,and whether there is a substantial likelihood that the pictorial,graphic,or sculptural feature would still be marketable to some significant segment of the community without its utilitarian function,at emphasis deleted and internal quotation marks omitted.
we reject this argument because neither consideration is grounded in the text of the statute.the first would require the decisionmaker to consider evidence of the creator design methods,purposes,and reasons,at.the statute text makes clear,however,that our inquiry is limited to how the article and feature are perceived,not how or why they were designed.see brandir int l,cascade pacific lumber,winter,concurring in part and dissenting in part the statute expressly states that the legal test is how the final article is perceived,not how it was developed through various stages 
the same is true of marketability.nothing in the statute suggests that copyrightability depends on market surveys.moreover,asking whether some segment of the market would be interested in a given work threatens to prize popular art over other forms,or to substitute judicial aesthetic preferences for the policy choices embodied in the copyright act.see bleistein donaldson lithographing,it would be a dangerous undertaking for persons trained only to the law to constitute themselves final judges of the worth of pictorial illustrations,outside of the narrowest and most obvious limits 
finally,petitioner argues that allowing the surface decorations to qualify as a work of authorship is inconsistent with congress intent to entirely exclude industrial design from copyright.petitioner notes that congress refused to pass a provision that would have provided limited copyright protection for industrial designs,including clothing,when it enacted the act,see,at citing,tit.ii,cong.rec,and that it has enacted laws protecting designs for specific useful articles semiconductor chips and boat hulls,see,while declining to enact other industrial design statutes,brief for petitioner.from this history of failed legislation petitioner reasons that congress intends to channel intellectual property claims for industrial design into design patents.it therefore urges us to approach this question with a presumption against copyrightability,at.
we do not share petitioner concern.as an initial matter,c ongressional inaction lacks persuasive significance in most circumstances.pension benefit guaranty corporation ltv,internal quotation marks omitted.moreover,we have long held that design patent and copyright are not mutually exclusive.see mazer,at.congress has provided for limited copyright protection for certain features of industrial design,and approaching the statute with presumptive hostility toward protection for industrial design would undermine congress choice.in any event,as explained above,our test does not render the shape,cut,and physical dimensions of the cheerleading uniforms eligible for copyright protection.
we hold that an artistic feature of the design of a useful article is eligible for copyright protection if the feature can be perceived as a two or work of art separate from the useful article and would qualify as a protectable pictorial,graphic,or sculptural work either on its own or in some other medium if imagined separately from the useful article.because the designs on the surface of respondents cheerleading uniforms in this case satisfy these requirements,the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.
it is so ordered.

i concur in the court judgment but not in its opinion.unlike the majority,i would not take up in this case the separability test appropriate under consideration of that test is unwarranted because the designs at issue are not designs of useful articles.instead,the designs are themselves copyrightable pictorial or graphic works reproduced on useful articles

justice breyer,with whom justice kennedy joins,dissenting.
i agree with much in the court opinion.but i do not agree that the designs that varsity brands,submitted to the copyright office are eligible for copyright protection.even applying the majority test,the designs can not be perceived as two or work s of art separate from the useful article.ante,at.
look at the designs that varsity submitted to the copyright office.see appendix to opinion of the court,ante.you will see only pictures of cheerleader uniforms.and cheerleader uniforms are useful articles.a picture of the relevant design features,whether separately perceived on paper or in the imagination,is a picture of,and thereby replicate s,the underlying useful article of which they are a part.ante,at.hence the design features that varsity seeks to protect are not capable of existing independently o f the utilitarian aspects of the article.
the relevant statutory provision says that the design of a useful article is copyrightable only if,and only to the extent that,such design incorporates pictorial,graphic,or sculptural features that can be identified separately from,and are capable of existing independently of,the utilitarian aspects of the article.ibid.but what,we must ask,do the words identified separately mean just when is a design separate from the utilitarian aspect of the useful article the most direct,helpful aspect of the court opinion answers this question by stating 
nor could someone claim a copyright in a useful article merely by creating a replica of that article in some other medium for example,a cardboard model of a car.although the replica could itself be copyrightable,it would not give rise to any rights in the useful article that inspired it.ante,at.
exactly so.these words help explain the court statement that a copyrightable work of art must be perceived as a two or work of art separate from the useful article.ante,at.they help clarify the concept of separateness.nimmer nimmer,nimmer on copyright a nimmer describing courts difficulty in applying that concept.they are consistent with congress own expressed intent.and they reflect long held views of the copyright office.see compendium of copyright office practices b ed,online at as last visited,compendium.
consider,for example,the explanation that the house report for the copyright act of provides.it says 
unless the shape of an automobile,airplane,ladies dress,food processor,television set,or any other industrial product contains some element that,physically or conceptually,can be identified as separable from the utilitarian aspects of that article,the design would not be copyrighted at emphasis added.
these words suggest two exercises,one physical,one mental.can the design features the picture,the graphic,the sculpture be physically removed from the article and considered separately,all the while leaving the fully functioning utilitarian object in place if not,can one nonetheless conceive of the design features separately without replicating a picture of the utilitarian object if the answer to either of these questions is yes,then the design is eligible for copyright protection.otherwise,it is not.the abstract nature of these questions makes them sound difficult to apply.but with the court words in mind,the difficulty tends to disappear.
an example will help.imagine a lamp with a circular marble base,a vertical tall brass rod containing wires inserted off center on the base,a light bulb fixture emerging from the top of the brass rod,and a lampshade sitting on top.in front of the brass rod a porcelain siamese cat sits on the base facing outward.obviously,the siamese cat is physically separate from the lamp,as it could be easily removed while leaving both cat and lamp intact.and,assuming it otherwise qualifies,the designed cat is eligible for copyright protection.
now suppose there is no long brass rod instead the cat sits in the middle of the base and the wires run up through the cat to the bulbs.the cat is not physically separate from the lamp,as the reality of the lamp construction is such that an effort to physically separate the cat and lamp will destroy both cat and lamp.the two are integrated into a single functional object,like the similar configuration of the ballet dancer statuettes that formed the lamp bases at issue in mazer stein.but we can easily imagine the cat on its own,as did congress when conceptualizing the ballet dancer.see,at the statuette in mazer was incorporated into a product without losing its ability to exist independently as a work of art in doing so,we do not create a mental picture of a lamp or,in the court words,a replica of the lamp,which is a useful article.we simply perceive the cat separately,as a small cat figurine that could be a copyrightable design work standing alone that does not replicate the lamp.hence the cat is conceptually separate from the utilitarian article that is the lamp.the pair of lamps pictured at figures and in the appendix to this opinion illustrate this principle.
case law,particularly case law that congress and the copyright office have considered,reflects the same approach.congress cited examples of copyrightable design works,including a carving on the back of a chair and a floral relief design on silver flatware.at.copyright office guidance on copyrightable designs in useful articles include an engraving on a vase,a rtwork printed on a,a colorful pattern decorating the surface of a shopping bag,a drawing on the surface of wallpaper,and a floral relief decorating the handle of a spoon.compendium b.courts have found copyrightable matter in a plaster ballet dancer statuette encasing the lamp electric cords and forming its base,see mazer,supra,as well as carvings engraved onto furniture,see universal furniture int l,collezione europa usa,per curiam,and designs on laminated floor tiles,see home leg end,llc mannington mills.see generally brief for intellectual property professors as amici curiae.
by way of contrast,van gogh painting of a pair of old shoes,though beautifully executed and copyrightable as a painting,would not qualify for a shoe design copyright.see appendix,infra a b.courts have similarly denied copyright protection to objects that begin as designs,such as measuring spoons shaped like arrows,bonazoli int l,supp,ri candleholders shaped like sailboats,design ideas,yankee candle,supp,cd and wire spokes on a wheel cover,norris industries,international.none of these designs could qualify for copyright protection that would prevent others from selling spoons,candleholders,or wheel covers with the same design.why not because in each case the design is not separable from the utilitarian aspects of the object to which it relates.the designs can not be physically separated because they themselves make up the shape of the spoon,candleholders,or wheel covers of which they are a part.and spoons,candleholders,and wheel covers are useful objects,as are the old shoes depicted in van gogh painting.more importantly,one can not easily imagine or otherwise conceptualize the design of the spoons or the candleholders or the shoes without that picture,or image,or replica being a picture of spoons,or candleholders,or wheel covers,or shoes.the designs necessarily bring along the underlying utilitarian object.hence each design is not conceptually separable from the physical useful object.
the upshot is that one could copyright the floral design on a soupspoon but one could not copyright the shape of the spoon itself,no matter how beautiful,artistic,or esthetically pleasing that shape might be a picture of the shape of the spoon is also a picture of a spoon the picture of a floral design is not.see compendium b.
to repeat a separable design feature must be capable of existing independently of the useful article as a separate artistic work that is not itself the useful article.if the claimed feature could be extracted without replicating the useful article of which it is a part,and the result would be a copyrightable artistic work standing alone,then there is a separable design.but if extracting the claimed features would necessarily bring along the underlying useful article,the design is not separable from the useful article.in many or most cases,to decide whether a design or artistic feature of a useful article is conceptually separate from the article itself,it is enough to imagine the feature on its own and ask,have i created a picture of a useful part of a useful article if so,the design is not separable from the useful article.if not,it is.
in referring to imagined pictures and the like,i am not speaking technically.i am simply trying to explain an intuitive idea of what separation is about,as well as how i understand the majority opinion.so understood,the opinion puts design copyrights in their rightful place.the law has long recognized that drawings or photographs of real world objects are copyrightable as drawings or photographs,but the copyright does not give protection against others making the underlying useful objects.see,lithographic sarony.that is why a copyright on van gogh painting would prevent others from reproducing that painting,but it would not prevent others from reproducing and selling the comfortable old shoes that the painting depicts.indeed,the purpose of b was to ensure that copyright in a pictorial,graphic,or sculptural work,portraying a useful article as such,does not extend to the manufacture of the useful article itself.at.
to ask this kind of simple question does the design picture the useful article will not provide an answer in every case,for there will be cases where it is difficult to say whether a picture of the design is,or is not,also a picture of the useful article.but the question will avoid courts focusing primarily upon what i believe is an unhelpful feature of the inquiry,namely,whether the design can be imagined as a two or work of art.ante,at.that is because virtually any industrial design can be thought of separately as a work of art just imagine a frame surrounding the design,or its being placed in a gallery.consider marcel duchamp readymades series,the functional objects he designated as art.see appendix,infra.what is there in the world that,viewed through an esthetic lens,can not be seen as a good,bad,or indifferent work of art what design features could not be imaginatively reproduced on a painter canvas indeed,great industrial design may well include design that is inseparable from the useful article where,as frank lloyd wright put it,form and function are one.wright,an autobiography reprint.where they are one,the designer may be able to obtain years of protection through a design patent,see also mckenna strandburg,progress and competition in design,stan.tech.but,if they are one,congress did not intend a century or more of copyright protection.
the conceptual approach that i have described reflects congress answer to a problem that is primarily practical and economic.years ago lord macaulay drew attention to the problem when he described copyright in books as a tax on readers for the purpose of giving a bounty to writers.parl.deb.ser.he called attention to the main benefit of copyright protection,which is to provide an incentive to produce copyrightable works and thereby promote the progress of science and useful arts.art.i,cl.but macaulay also made clear that copyright protection imposes costs.those costs include the higher prices that can accompany the grant of a copyright monopoly.they also can include for those wishing to display,sell,or perform a design,film,work of art,or piece of music,for example the costs of discovering whether there are previous copyrights,of contacting copyright holders,and of securing permission to copy.eldred ashcroft,breyer,dissenting.sometimes,as thomas jefferson wrote to james madison,costs can outweigh the benefit even of limited monopolies.letter from thomas jefferson to james madison july,in papers of thomas jefferson boyd ed.jefferson letter.and that is particularly true in light of the fact that congress has extended the limited times of protection,art.i,cl,from the years of jefferson day to potentially more than a century today.jefferson letter see also eldred,supra,at opinion of breyer.
the constitution grants congress primary responsibility for assessing comparative costs and benefits and drawing copyright statutory lines.courts must respect those lines and not grant copyright protection where congress has decided not to do so.and it is clear that congress has not extended broad copyright protection to the fashion design industry.see,nimmer h c describing how congress rejected proposals for fashion design protection within the act and has rejected every proposed bill to this effect since then esquire,ringer,cadc observing that at the time of the copyright act,congress had rejected every one of the approximately design protection bills that had been introduced since,to amend title,united states code,to provide protection for fashion design introduced,unenacted.congress has left statutory protection largely unavailable for dress designs.nimmer h a raustiala sprigman,the piracy paradox innovation and intellectual property in fashion design.
congress decision not to grant full copyright protection to the fashion industry has not left the industry without protection.patent design protection is available.a maker of clothing can obtain trademark protection under the lanham act for signature features of the clothing.et.and a designer who creates an original textile design can receive copyright protection for that pattern as placed,for example,on a bolt of cloth,or anything made with that cloth,compendium a.t his type of claim is generally made by the fabric producer rather than the garment or costume designer,and is ordinarily made when the design is applied to the textile fabric and before the garment is cut from the fabric.fed.reg.
the fashion industry has thrived against this backdrop,and designers have contributed immeasurably to artistic and personal through clothing.but a decision by this court to grant protection to the design of a garment would grant the designer protection that congress refused to provide.it would risk increased prices and unforeseeable disruption in the clothing industry,which in the united states alone encompasses nearly billion in annual spending and million jobs.brief for council of fashion designers of america,as amicus curiae citing congress,joint economic committee,the new economy of fashion.that is why i believe it important to emphasize those parts of the court opinion that limit the scope of its interpretation.that language,as i have said,makes clear that one may not claim a copyright in a useful article merely by creating a replica of that article in some other medium,which would not give rise to any rights in the useful article that inspired it.ante,at.
if we ask the separateness question correctly,the answer here is not difficult to find.the majority opinion,in its appendix,depicts the cheerleader dress designs that varsity submitted to the copyright office.can the design features in varsity pictures exist separately from the utilitarian aspects of a dress can we extract those features as copyrightable design works standing alone,without bringing along,via picture or design,the dresses of which they constitute a part 
consider designs,and.they certainly look like cheerleader uniforms.that is to say,they look like pictures of cheerleader uniforms,just like van gogh old shoes look like shoes.i do not see how one could see them otherwise.designs and present slightly closer questions.they omit some of the dresslike context that the other designs possess.but the necklines,the sleeves,and the cut of the skirt suggest that they too are pictures of dresses.looking at all five of varsity pictures,i do not see how one could conceptualize the design features in a way that does not picture,not just artistic designs,but dresses as well.
were i to accept the majority invitation to imaginatively remov e the chevrons and stripes as they are arranged on the neckline,waistline,sleeves,and skirt of each uniform,and apply them on a painter canvas,ante,at,that painting would be of a cheerleader dress.the esthetic elements on which varsity seeks protection exist only as part of the uniform design there is nothing to separate out but for lines that replicate the cut and style of the uniforms.hence,each design is not physically separate,nor is it conceptually separate,from the useful article it depicts,namely,a cheerleader dress.they can not be copyrighted.
varsity,of course,could have sought a design patent for its designs.or,it could have sought a copyright on a textile design,even one with a similar theme of chevrons and lines.
but that is not the nature of varsity copyright claim.it has instead claimed ownership of the particular treatment and arrangement of the chevrons and lines of the design as they appear at the neckline,waist,skirt,sleeves,and overall cut of each uniform.brief for respondents.the majority imagines that varsity submitted something different that is,only the surface decorations of chevrons and stripes,as in a textile design.as the majority sees it,varsity copyright claim would be the same had it submitted a plain rectangular space depicting chevrons and stripes,like swaths from a bolt of fabric.but considered on their own,the simple stripes are plainly unoriginal.varsity,then,seeks to do indirectly what it can not do directly bring along the design and cut of the dresses by seeking to protect surface decorations whose treatment and arrangement are coextensive with that design and cut.as varsity would have it,it would prevent its competitors from making useful cheerleader uniforms by submitting plainly unoriginal chevrons and stripes as cut and arranged on a useful article.but with that cut and arrangement,the resulting pictures on which varsity seeks protection do not simply depict designs.they depict clothing.they depict the useful articles of which the designs are inextricable parts.and varsity can not obtain copyright protection that would give them the power to prevent others from making those useful uniforms,any more than van gogh can copyright comfortable old shoes by painting their likeness.
i fear that,in looking past the design inherent in varsity claim by treating it as if it were no more than a design for a bolt of cloth,the majority has lost sight of its own important limiting principle.one may not claim a copyright in a useful article merely by creating a replica of that article in some other medium,such as in a picture.ante,at.that is to say,one can not obtain a copyright that would give its holder any rights in the useful article that inspired it.ante,at.
with respect,i dissent.
we do not today hold that the surface decorations are copyrightable.we express no opinion on whether these works are sufficiently original to qualify for copyright protection,see feist publications,rural telephone service,or on whether any other prerequisite of a valid copyright has been satisfied.
the dissent suggests that our test would lead to the copyrighting of shovels.post,at appendix to opinion of breyer,post.but a shovel,like a cheerleading uniform,even if displayed in an art gallery,is an article having an intrinsic utilitarian function that is not merely to portray the appearance of the article or to convey information.it therefore can not be copyrighted.a drawing of a shovel could,of course,be copyrighted.and,if the shovel included any artistic features that could be perceived as art apart from the shovel,and which would qualify as protectable pictorial,graphic,or sculptural works on their own or in another medium,they too could be copyrighted.but a shovel as a shovel can not.
