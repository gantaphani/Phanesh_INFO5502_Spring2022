we must decide whether a sequence of yoga poses and two breathing exercises developed by bikram choudhury and described in his book,bikram beginning yoga class,is entitled to copyright protection.this question implicates a fundamental principle underlying constitutional and statutory copyright protection the dichotomy.because copyright protection is limited to the expression of ideas,and does not extend to the ideas themselves,the bikram yoga sequence is not a proper subject of copyright protection.
factual and procedural history 
the indian practice and philosophy of yoga date back thousands of years.see linda sparrowe,yoga.derived from ancient hindu scriptures,including the bhagavad gita,the practice of yoga teaches students to attain spiritual fulfillment through control of the mind and body.see stefanie syman,the subtle body the story of yoga in america.yoga has evolved into a diverse set of spiritual,philosophical,and physical disciplines.some students practice yoga to transcend the physical body and unite with divine powers others focus on improving strength,flexibility,and overall physical fitness.
the history of yoga in the united states reflects its appeal.some of yoga first american adherents included transcendentalists,such as henry david thoreau and ralph waldo emerson,who were fascinated by yoga approach to achieving enlightenment.in the early twentieth century,yoga grew more popular as scientists and physicians began to study the physical benefits of the practice.these physical benefits caught the attention of hollywood celebrities,including gloria swanson,greta garbo,and marilyn monroe,who embraced yoga as a tool to fight illness and aging.see pankaj mishra,posing as fitness,times,july,by the,americans increasingly turned to yoga as a,decidedly unspiritual form of physical exercise.sparrowe,supra,at.
in,bikram choudhury,the yogi to the stars,id.at,arrived in beverly hills,california.he soon became a central figure in the growing popularity of yoga in the united states.born and raised in calcutta,india,choudhury began studying yoga at age four and learned hundreds of traditional hatha yoga asanas,or individual poses.hatha yoga places particular emphasis on the physical components of yoga.choudhury developed a sequence of asanas and two breathing exercises,arranged in a particular order,which he calls the sequence.see bikram choudhury,bikram beginning yoga class.choudhury opened his own studio,where he began offering bikram yoga classes.in a bikram yoga class,the sequence is practiced over the course of ninety minutes,to a series of instructions the dialogue,in a room heated to degrees fahrenheit to simulate choudhury native indian climate.
choudhury popularized the sequence by marketing the many health and fitness benefits it provides.choudhury informs prospective students that his system of hatha yoga is capable of helping you avoid,correct,cure,heal,or at least alleviate the symptoms of almost any illness or injury.he claims that he developed the sequence after many of years of research and verification using modern medical measurement techniques.he tells reporters that he extended the careers of professional athletes,including kareem abdul jabbar and john mcenroe.this message has resonated with an american audience as the complaint in this action explains,p ublic demand for bikram yoga classes grew steadily once bikram yoga participants realized that bikram unique yoga style and method offered them tremendous physical,mental and other benefits.
in,choudhury published the book bikram beginning yoga class,which includes descriptions,photographs,and drawings of the sequence poses and two breathing exercises.choudhury registered the book with the copyright office in.in,he also registered the compilation of exercises contained in the book,using a supplementary registration form that referenced back to the book 
in,choudhury introduced the bikram yoga teacher training course.in and,respectively,mark drost and zefea samson enrolled in and successfully completed the bikram yoga teacher training course.in,drost and samson founded evolation yoga,llc.evolation yoga offers several types and styles of yoga,including hot yoga,which is similar to bikram basic yoga system.evolation acknowledges that hot yoga includes postures and two breathing exercises and is done for minutes,accompanied by a series of oral instructions,in a room heated to approximately degrees fahrenheit.
on july,choudhury and bikram yoga college of india,choudhury filed a complaint in the central district of california alleging,inter alia,that defendants evolation yoga,llc,mark drost,and zefea samson evolation infringed bikram copyrighted works through substantial use of bikram copyrighted works in and as part of defendants offering of yoga classes.on november,evolation moved for partial summary judgment as to choudhury claim of copyright infringement of the sequence.the district court granted evolation motion,ruling that the sequence is a collection of facts and ideas that is not entitled to copyright protection.the parties settled all remaining claims against each other,and choudhury timely appealed as to the sequence.

iii.discussion 
though choudhury emphasizes the aesthetic attributes of the sequence graceful flow,at bottom,the sequence is an idea,process,or system designed to improve health.copyright protects only the expression of this idea the words and pictures used to describe the sequence and not the idea of the sequence itself.because the sequence is an unprotectible idea,it is also ineligible for copyright protection as a compilation or choreographic work.the district court properly granted partial summary judgment in favor of evolation because the sequence is not a proper subject of copyright.
a.the sequence is an unprotectible idea.
section a of the copyright act of sets forth the proper subjects of copyright protection.a.section b expressly excludes protection for any idea,procedure,process,system,method of operation,concept,principle,or discovery,regardless of the form in which it is described,explained,illustrated,or embodied in such work.id.b.section b codifies the dichotomy,under which every idea,theory,and fact in a copyrighted work becomes instantly available for public exploitation at the moment of publication.golan holder,quoting eldred ashcroft,see also frybarger int l bus.machs,cir explaining that section b expressly codified this principle,at explaining that the purpose of section b is to restate that the basic dichotomy between expression and idea remains unchanged.
the dichotomy has two constitutional foundations the copyright clause and the first amendment.under the copyright clause,t he primary objective of copyright is not to reward the labor of authors,but t o promote the progress of science and useful arts.feist publ ns,rural.serv,quoting const.art.i,cl.thus,t he constitutional command is that congress,to the extent it enacts copyright laws at all,create a system that promote s the progress of science.eldred,at quoting graham john deere of kansas city.to this end,copyright assures authors the right to their original expression,but encourages others to build freely upon the ideas and information conveyed by a work.feist,at.at the same time,the dichotomy strike s a definitional balance between the first amendment and the copyright act by permitting free communication of facts while still protecting an author expression.harper row publishers nation,see also eldred,at describing the dichotomy as a first amendment accommodation news serv.tullo,cir copyright law incorporates first amendment goals by ensuring that copyright protection extends only to the forms in which ideas and information are expressed and not to the ideas and information themselves.melville nimmer david nimmer,nimmer on copyright b f ree access to ideas is vital not only for copyright law but also for the maintenance of the democratic dialogue.
in baker selden,the supreme court addressed the protection copyright law provided to a book,a classic subject of copyright protection,explaining a system of.id.at.the court held that the book expression of the system was protected,but the system of itself was not entitled to copyright protection.id.at.the court explained 
the description of the art in a book,though entitled to the benefit of copyright,lays no foundation for an exclusive claim to the art itself.the object of the one is explanation the object of the other is use.the former may be secured by copyright.the latter can only be secured,if it can be secured at all,by.
following baker,and recognizing this vital distinction between ideas and expression,courts have routinely held that the copyright for a work describing how to perform a process does not extend to the process itself.in palmer braun,cir,for example,the eleventh circuit held that meditation exercises described in a copyrighted manual on exploring the consciousness were a process unentitled to copyright protection.id.at.the court explained that the exercises,while undoubtedly the product of much time and effort,are,at bottom,simply a process for achieving increased consciousness.such processes,even if original,can not be protected by copyright.id.similarly,in publications international,meredith,cir,the seventh circuit held that recipes contained in a copyrighted cookbook are not entitled to copyright protection,for they merely describe a procedure by which the reader may produce many dishes,and there can be no monopoly in the copyright sense in the ideas for producing certain foodstuffs.id.at.finally,in seltzer sunbrock,which predates the copyright act of but applies baker,the court held that the copyright in a manual describing how to organize races does not extend to the rules for the races themselves.id.at.the court explained,w hat the author really composed was a description of a system for conducting races on roller skates.a system,as such,can never be copyrighted.if it finds any protection,it must come from the patent laws.id.citing baker.
here,we must similarly determine not the validity of a copyright but rather its scope does choudhury copyright protection for his book extend to the sequence itself under the fundamental tenets of copyright law and consistent with the precedents discussed above,the answer is no.
as choudhury describes it,the sequence is a system or a method designed to systematically work every part of the body,to give all internal organs,all the veins,all the ligaments,and all the muscles everything they need to maintain optimum health and maximum function.in bikram beginning yoga class,choudhury explains that he arrived at the sequence of postures after researching the diseases and the postures and after many years of research and verification using modern medical measurement techniques.the book tells readers that bikram exercises systematically move fresh,oxygenated blood to one hundred percent of your body,to each organ and fiber,restoring all systems to healthy working order,just as nature intended.bonnie jones reynolds,introduction to bikram beginning yoga class,at xi.this text promises readers that choudhury system of hatha yoga is capable of helping you avoid,correct,cure,heal,or at least alleviate the symptoms of almost any illness or injury.
also illuminating is choudhury spoken dialogue,which accompanies the sequence.before the sequence first breathing exercise,for example,the instructor tells students,the exercise is good for the lungs and respiratory system.this exercise expands your lungs to their maximum expansion capacity.and it improves the elasticity of your lungs.before the twelfth pose,the instructor explains 
every exercise in the world you do,you burn like driving a car burns gas.the tank is empty,you need to fill it up again.hatha yoga class is a gas station,it is the only place in the world where you gain energy instead of burning energy.asana is the only natural physical activity in the world because it is scientific and with the help of science,we can explain nature.
an essential element of this system is the order in which the yoga poses and breathing exercises are arranged.bikram beginning yoga class instructs readers,do the poses in the strict order given in this book.nothing about bikram beginning yoga class is haphazard.it is designed to scientifically warm and stretch muscles,ligaments,and tendons in the order in which they should be stretched.bikram beginning yoga class,supra,at xi.for instance,choudhury explains,camel pose ustrasana stretches the abdomen and compresses the spine so for the next posture,i chose the rabbit pose sasangasana,which does the converse stretches the back and compresses the abdomen.one yoga journal article explains that a ccording to bikram,each posture in his series forms the perfect basis for the next,warming and stretching the appropriate muscles,ligaments and tendons.loraine despres,yoga bad boy bikram choudhury,yoga,
choudhury thus attempts to secure copyright protection for a healing art a system designed to yield physical benefits and a sense of.simply put,this attempt is precluded by copyright dichotomy,codified by section b.as the supreme court explained in baker,certain mixtures are found to be of great value in the healing art.if the discoverer writes and publishes a book on the subject as regular physicians generally do,he gains no exclusive right to the manufacture and sale of the medicine he gives that to the public.at.thus,for example,the copyright for a book describing how to perform a complicated surgery does not give the holder the exclusive right to perform the surgery.like the series of movements a surgeon makes,the sequence is,as choudhury tells readers,a method designed to cure,heal,or at least alleviate physical injuries and illness.monopoly protection for such a method can only be secured,if it can be secured at all,by.id.at see also sega enters.accolade,cir,as amended,in order to enjoy a lawful monopoly over the idea or functional principle underlying a work,the creator of the work must satisfy the more stringent standards imposed by the patent laws.in light of baker and its progeny,choudhury healing methodology is not eligible for protection by copyright.indeed,if it is entitled to protection at all,that protection is more properly sought through the patent process 
that the sequence may produce spiritual and psychological benefits makes it no less an idea,system,or process and no more amenable to copyright protection.choudhury personal declaration explains that the sequence offers spiritual benefits to his students and lead s to a general sense of peace and that is undoubtedly of benefit to all of us.like the meditation exercises designed to achieve greater consciousness in braun,at,the sequence sets forth a method to attain identifiable,if spiritual and psychological,results a sense of and boundless energy.bikram beginning yoga class,supra,at xi as such,it falls within the copyright act definition of an idea,process,or system excluded from copyright protection.see b.
choudhury contends that the sequence arrangement of postures is particularly beautiful and graceful.but beauty is not a basis for copyright protection.the performance of many ideas,systems,or processes may be beautiful a surgeon intricate movements,a careful notations,or a baker kneading might each possess a certain grace for at least some viewers.indeed,from vermeer milkmaid to lewis hine power house mechanic,the individual engrossed in a process has long attracted artistic attention.but the beauty of the process does not permit one who describes it to gain,through copyright,the monopolistic power to exclude all others from practicing it.this is true even where,as here,the process was conceived with at least some aesthetic considerations in mind.just as some steps in a recipe may reflect no more than the author belief that a particular ingredient is beautiful or that a particular cooking technique is impressive to watch and empowering to practice,some elements in choudhury sequence may reflect his aesthetic preferences.yet just like the recipe,the sequence remains unprotectible as a process the design of which primarily reflects function,not expression.
in drawing the difficult line between idea and expression in this case,we are mindful of the guiding consideration of the dichotomy the preservation of the balance between competition and protection reflected in the patent and copyright laws.cdn kapes,cir quoting herbert rosenthal jewelry kalpakian,cir.as in baker,the object of the book bikram beginning yoga class is explanation it tells readers how to perform the sequence and encourages them to try it.baker,at.the introduction to bikram beginning yoga class,for example,urges the audience to i turn to the contents page,ii read through the book,iii build gradually,and iv do the poses in the strict order given in this book.bikram beginning yoga class,supra,at.like a book explaining simplified,at,bikram beginning yoga class sets out to communicate to the world the useful knowledge which it contains.id.at.it invites readers to practice the method it describes.but this object would be frustrated if the knowledge could not be used without incurring the guilt of piracy of the book.id.consumers would have little reason to buy choudhury book if choudhury held a monopoly on the practice of the very activity he sought to popularize.rather than stimulat ing artistic creativity for the general public good,copyright protection for the sequence would prevent the public from engaging with choudhury idea and building upon it.mattel,mga entm t,cir quoting twentieth century music aiken.
b.the sequence is not a copyrightable compilation.
choudhury contends that the sequence is entitled to copyright protection as a compilation.specifically,choudhury claims that the sequence qualifies for copyright protection because his selection,coordination,and arrangement of poses and two breathing exercises create a coherent and expressive composition.the district court correctly rejected this argument.
the copyright act identifies compilations as a proper subject of copyright.section of the copyright act provides that t he subject matter of copyright as specified in section includes compilations.a.a compilation is a work formed by the collection and assembling of preexisting materials or of data that are selected,coordinated,or arranged in such a way that the resulting work as a whole constitutes an original work of authorship.id.it essential to recognize,however,that section complements section.thus,while a compilation may be eligible for copyright protection,it must nevertheless satisfy the requirements of section.a compilation must,in other words,represent an original work of authorship,and i n no case may copyright protection extend to any idea,procedure,process,or system.id.the availability of copyright protection for compilations,therefore,does not eliminate section categorical bar on copyright protection for ideas.
the supreme court addressed the relationship between these two propositions that compilations are eligible for copyright but facts and ideas are not in feist.in feist,the court considered whether the collection of names,towns,and telephone numbers in a telephone directory is eligible for copyright protection as a compilation.the court held that a factual compilation is eligible for copyright if it features an original selection or arrangement of facts,but the copyright is limited to the particular selection or arrangement.in no event may copyright extend to the facts themselves.id.at.
by claiming copyright protection for the sequence as a compilation,choudhury misconstrues the scope of copyright protection for compilations.as we have explained,the sequence is an idea,process,or system therefore,it is not eligible for copyright protection.that the sequence may possess many constituent parts does not transform it into a proper subject of copyright protection.virtually any process or system could be dissected in a similar fashion.baker examples of treatises are instructive a treatise on the construction and use of ploughs,or watches,or churns,or on the mode of drawing lines to produce the effect of perspective would likely list the steps necessary to perform the process it describes.u.at.the watchmaking treatise author could not claim a copyright in the process of making a watch,however,by breaking down the process into multiple steps and labeling it a compilation.recipes further illustrate the point a cake recipe could be viewed as a compilation of carefully arranged and selected steps which may,of course,reflect the personal preferences and tastes of the recipe author yet the recipe would remain,in most instances,a process that is not eligible for copyright protection.see meredith,at.likewise,choudhury can not obtain copyright protection for the sequence as a compilation by separately identifying the poses and breathing exercises it contains.
moreover,according to choudhury himself,the medical and functional considerations at the heart of the sequence compel the very selection and arrangement of poses and breathing exercises for which he claims copyright protection.according to bikram beginning yoga class,the strict order of the poses is designed to scientifically warm and stretch muscles,ligaments,and tendons in the order in which they should be stretched.bikram beginning yoga class,supra,at xi.read in the light most favorable to choudhury,the record demonstrates that the overarching reason for the organization of the poses and breathing exercises in the sequence is to further the basic goals of the method to attain p roper weight,muscle tone,glowing complexion,boundless energy,vibrant good health,and a sense of.id.the sequence composition renders it more effective as a process or system,but not any more suitable for copyright protection as an original work of authorship.
it makes no difference that similar results could be achieved through a different organization of yoga poses and breathing exercises.choudhury argues that he could have chosen from hundreds of postures and countless arrangements of these postures in developing the sequence.but the possibility of attaining a particular end through multiple different methods does not render the uncopyrightable a proper subject of copyright.see bellsouth advert.publ g donnelley info.publ g,cir the relevant inquiry under feist is not whether there is some imaginable,although manifestly less useful,method of arranging business telephone listings.see also atc distrib,whatever it takes transmissions parts,cir to be sure,the publisher of a catalog describing a transmission parts numbering system could have arranged the parts information in other ways that were potentially less clear or useful,but this fact alone is insufficient to demonstrate the creativity necessary for copyright protection.though it may be one of many possible yoga sequences capable of attaining similar results,the sequence is nevertheless a process and is therefore ineligible for copyright protection 
c.the sequence is not a copyrightable choreographic work.
the district court properly rejected choudhury argument that the sequence is entitled to copyright protection as a choreographic work the copyright act extended protection to pantomimes and choreographic works,which were previously not copyrightable,stat,codified at a.in,the second circuit observed that e xplicit federal copyright protection for choreography is a fairly recent development,and the scope of that protection is an uncharted area of the law.horgan macmillan,cir.this remains true today.
the parties debate the meaning of the term choreography,which we have not yet defined in the copyright context.nor did congress define the term choreographic work,apparently because its meaning was fairly settled,at.the legislative history does explain,however,that it is not necessary to specify that choreographic works do not include social dance steps and simple routines.id.at.the second circ
