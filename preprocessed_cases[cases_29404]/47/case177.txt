appellants morningside development,llc morningside holdings of satyr hill,llc and neville turner collectively,the defendants appeal a judgment of more than entered against them,jointly and severally,following an october bench trial in the district of maryland.the defendants assert multiple contentions of error however,only their challenge to joint and several liability has merit.as explained below,we otherwise affirm the judgment in favor of nelson salabes,incorporated nsi,but we vacate and remand the district court imposition of joint and several liability against morningside holdings and turner.
in the spring of,the strutt group,incorporated strutt,a real estate development company operating in maryland,sought planning assistance from nsi,an architectural firm,for a proposed assisted living facility in baltimore county,called satyr hill catered living satyr hill or the project.on june,nsi delivered to strutt a proposed letter agreement under which nsi agreed to develop a schematic building footprint for satyr hill although strutt failed to execute this proposed agreement,both nsi and strutt,as the proposed parties thereto,fully performed according to its terms.
during july,strutt and nsi continued to engage in discussions concerning the planning and design of satyr hill.on july,nsi delivered to strutt a second proposed letter agreement outlining architectural services it would perform for strutt in the next phase of development of satyr hill.this proposed letter agreement provided that nsi would render additional architectural services to strutt,that it would develop exterior elevations for the project,and that it would attend a zoning exception hearing before the baltimore county department of permits and development management the zoning board strutt again failed to execute the proposed agreement,but,as with the first proposed agreement,both nsi and strutt performed according to its terms.
nsi thereafter created four architectural drawings depicting the building footprint,the floor plans,and the exterior elevations of satyr hill the nsi drawings.strutt civil engineer then incorporated the nsi drawings into the development plan for satyr hill the development plan,which strutt submitted to the zoning board as part of its application for the special zoning exception the zoning exception.on april,the zoning board granted strutt request for the zoning exception.
on february,while the zoning exception application was pending before the zoning board,nsi delivered a third proposed letter agreement to strutt,by which it offered,inter alia,to create for strutt the design and working drawings for the remaining development of the project.this third proposed agreement,which strutt did not execute,outlined the additional architectural services to be performed by nsi on the project,and it stated that if the above is acceptable,we will prepare a standard aia agreement.thereafter,on september,nsi sent strutt a revised third letter agreement along with a revised aia contract for satyr hill catered living per our recent discussions.the aia contract that nsi,as the architect,delivered to strutt,as the owner,provided in relevant part that 
t he architect drawings,specifications or other documents shall not be used by the owner or others on other projects,for additions to this project,or for completion of this project by others unless the architect is adjudged to be in default under this agreement,except by agreement in writing and with appropriate compensation to the architect 
emphasis added.as with the earlier proposed agreements,strutt did not execute either the revised third letter agreement or the revised aia contract.
on october,strutt advised nsi to cease its architectural work on satyr hill,stating that strutt potential business partner had backed out of the project and that strutt lacked sufficient expertise to go forward with it.strutt then inquired as to whether nsi knew of potential purchasers for the project,and nsi began to solicit potential buyers on behalf of strutt.one such potential buyer was neville turner,the president of an entity known as the morningside group,and the managing agent of both morningside development,llc morningside development and morningside holdings of satyr hill,llc morningside holdings 
turner was interested in being involved in the completion of satyr hill for multiple reasons,including the zoning board had already granted the zoning exception,and the zoning board had already approved the development plan.on november,turner provided strutt with a letter of intent by morningside holdings in connection with its proposed purchase of satyr hill.at that time,turner was aware that the nsi drawings had been incorporated into the development plan,and that nsi asserted that any future use of the nsi drawings required its express consent.morningside holdings subsequently agreed to purchase satyr hill from strutt for the sum of,and the transaction was closed on december.
thereafter,in january,turner and nsi met to discuss nsi future involvement in satyr hill.on that occasion,turner advised nsi that the design of satyr hill needed to conform with a prototype established by morningside development at other assisted living facilities the prototype.turner then informed nsi that it would need to revise the nsi drawings in order to conform to the prototype,and nsi indicated that it was willing to make such revisions.after this january meeting with turner,nsi became concerned that the defendants did not intend to continue to utilize it as the architect for satyr hill.when turner confirmed in a later telephone conversation that he was considering other architects,nsi informed turner that while he could retain and utilize a different architect on the project,he had no authority to utilize the nsi drawings,including the building footprint and exterior elevations which had been incorporated into the development plan.on january,in order to confirm its position,nsi attorney wrote to turner,as president of the morningside group,and advised that the nsi drawings were not to be utilized without nsi express written consent.
turner then decided not to retain nsi for any further architectural services with regard to satyr hill.instead,morningside development entered into what was called a design build contract with hamil commercial,incorporated hamil for the construction of satyr hill,and hamil retained a different architectural firm,edg architects edg thereafter,turner provided hamil with a copy of the nsi drawings,as well as with the development plan approved by the zoning board.in turn,hamil gave these materials to edg.
subsequently,turner met with edg and requested that it satyr hill to conform to the prototype.however,he specifically instructed edg to avoid any modifications to the development plan that would necessitate obtaining a new zoning exception,because doing so would be both and costly.edg then satyr hill according to turner instructions,and edg architectural drawings were incorporated into amended development plans for satyr hill.the defendants submitted these amended development plans to the zoning board,advising the board that the amendments were being made,inter alia,for minor footprint revisions and minor changes to architectural elevations of buildings.the zoning board approved the amended development plans,and morningside development then completed the construction of satyr hill.
in july,nsi filed its complaint against the defendants in the district of maryland.in an amended complaint filed in march,nsi alleged that the defendants had infringed upon nsi in the construction of satyr hill by copying the footprint and exterior elevations from the nsi drawings,in contravention of federal copyright law,a after extensive discovery,this case proceeded to trial before the court in october.after receipt of briefs,the court,by opinion filed on february,ruled in favor of nsi and against the defendants,morningside holdings of satyr hill,opinion,no,wl,the opinion.having found the defendants liable for copyright infringement,the court then analyzed the question of an appropriate damage award,utilizing the provisions of b 
in so doing,the court first denied nsi claim for actual damages because it was speculative.opinion at.the court,however,after deducting the expenses incurred by the defendants in the construction of the project and deducting the defendants profit from the personal property as opposed to the real property connected with satyr hill,concluded that the defendants had realized profits attributable to their infringement in the amount of.id.at.the court therefore entered judgment against the defendants,jointly and severally,in that specific sum,plus costs.the defendants filed a timely notice of appeal from the court adverse rulings,and we possess jurisdiction pursuant to.

the defendants assert that the district court made three principal errors in entering judgment in favor of nsi.first,they contend that the court erred in finding morningside holdings liable for copyright infringement with respect to the nsi drawings.second,the defendants assert that the court erred in concluding that nsi had not granted them an implied nonexclusive license to use the nsi drawings.finally,they maintain that the court improperly imposed joint and several liability on morningside holdings and turner.we review each of these contentions in turn 
the defendants first challenge the district court determination that morningside holdings was liable for infringing nsi copyright.they assert that morningside holdings did not infringe on the nsi drawings that morningside holdings ownership of the project is an insufficient basis to establish copyright infringement and that any of turner conduct which constituted copyright infringement was carried out in his capacity as an employee of morningside development only,and not in connection with his position at morningside holdings.
in order to prove copyright infringement,a plaintiff must show that it owns a valid copyright,and it must establish that the defendant engaged in unauthorized copying of the work protected by the copyright.towler sayles,cir.in this case,it is undisputed that nsi owns a valid copyright for the nsi drawings.see supra note.furthermore,the defendants have not appealed the court determination that morningside development and turner engaged in unauthorized copying of the nsi drawings.at issue,therefore,is the court conclusion that morningside holdings,the owner of the project,is liable for copyright infringement with respect to the nsi drawings.
although morningside holdings may not have directly infringed on nsi copyright,it still can be liable under a theory of vicarious liability by virtue of its relationship with morningside development and turner.the law recognizes that the imposition of liability upon a copyright infringer under a theory of vicarious liability serves an important public prevent s an entity that profits from infringement from hiding behind undercapitalized dummy operations when the copyright owner eventually sues.hard rock cafe licensing concession,cir.in order to establish vicarious liability,a copyright owner must demonstrate that the entity to be held so liable possessed the right and ability to supervise the infringing activity and possessed an obvious and direct financial interest in the exploited copyrighted materials.see,a m records,napster,cir observing that vicarious liability will exist when defendant has right and ability to supervise infringing activity,and has direct financial interest in such activities int l,thomas grayston,cir same hard rock cafe,at same shapiro,bernstein green,cir same.applying these legal principles to this case,and to the findings made by the district court in its opinion,morningside holdings was properly held liable for the infringement of nsi copyright.
in its opinion,the court found,inter alia,that morningside holdings possessed the right and ability to supervise the infringing activity of morningside development,and that morningside holdings had an obvious and direct financial interest in morningside development infringement of nsi copyright.opinion at.under the evidence,morningside holdings owned satyr hill,thereby giving it the right and ability to control construction of the project by morningside development.in that connection,its ownership of satyr hill provided morningside holdings with an obvious and direct financial interest in the infringing activities of morningside development.id.that is,morningside holdings enjoyed the benefit of any increase in the project value resulting from morningside development infringement of the nsi drawings.in light of the evidence,we are unable to conclude that these findings are clearly erroneous,and we affirm the court determination that morningside holdings is liable to nsi for the infringement of nsi copyright.
the defendants next assert that they can not be held liable for copyright infringement because they enjoyed an implied nonexclusive license to use the nsi drawings.they maintain that the district court erred in concluding to the contrary.opinion at.an implied nonexclusive license,as its designation suggests,is not a written license and can be given either orally or implied from conduct,shaver,cir.such an implied license does not transfer the ownership of a copyright rather,it simply permits the use of a copyrighted work in a particular manner.id.the existence of an implied nonexclusive license,however,constitutes an affirmative defense to an allegation of copyright infringement.in this situation,the defendants maintain that the totality of nsi conduct implies the existence of such a license.they particularly rely upon nsi failure to contractually prohibit the use of the nsi drawings in its dealings with strutt,despite knowing that strutt would sell the project if it could not obtain financing.as such,the defendants assert that,as a matter of law,they did not infringe upon nsi copyright 
although this court has not heretofore specifically addressed the question of what circumstances might create an implied nonexclusive license,several of our sister circuits have examined the issue.in so doing,they have utilized versions of the test created by the ninth circuit in its decision in effects associates,cohen,cir.under the effects associates test,an implied nonexclusive license for use of an otherwise copyright protected work is created when a person the licensee requests the creation of a work,the creator the licensor makes that particular work and delivers it to the licensee who requested it,and the licensor intends that the licensee copy and distribute his work.shaver,at citing effects,at.although effects associates did not deal with architectural drawings,the framework of its test has been applied in several relevant subsequent decisions.foad consulting group,azzalino,cir johnson jones,cir shaver,at.those courts have interpreted the copy and distribute prong of the effects associates test to mean that the creator of a protected work must intend that its copyrighted drawings be used on the project for which they were created,independent of the creator involvement.foad consulting,at johnson,at shaver,at.
applying the effects associates test in this case,it is clear that the potential licensee strutt had requested that the creator nsi develop architectural plans for the project the nsi drawings,and that nsi had proceeded to develop the nsi drawings and deliver them to strutt.as such,the first two prongs of the effects associates test are satisfied.therefore,the determinative question is whether nsi intended that strutt utilize the nsi drawings in constructing satyr
