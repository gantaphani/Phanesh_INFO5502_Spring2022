this appeal by chosun international,chosun poses the question of whether halloween costumes,in their entirety or in their individual design elements,are eligible for copyright protection under federal law.the district court wood,held that they were not.the court ruled that halloween costumes were useful articles and hence not copyrightable under the copyright act,et.accordingly,the court dismissed chosun suit for failure to state a viable copyright infringement claim.see.b.because the district court failed to conduct a separability analysis prior to dismissing chosun complaint,we vacate the district court judgment and remand for further proceedings.
background 
chosun is a designer and manufacturer of halloween costumes.many of these are children costumes,including a line of plush sculpture costumes,each of which consists of a bodysuit and a sculpted hood.chosun describes its costumes as follows the plush sculpture attached to the hood of the costume takes the form of a arrangement of small plush stuffed animal head features,which look like they might be a part of a plush stuffed toy animal.in addition,at the ends of the sleeves of the bodysuit,elements which may be seen as hands or claws are associated with a number of the costumes,being connected to the cuffs of the costume adjacent the hands and feet of a person wearing the costume.three such animal costumes are at issue in this appeal.chrisha creations,chrisha is a competing costume manufacturer.it also distributes a line of plush halloween costumes.according to chosun,chrisha slavishly copied its costumes from chosun plush costume designs.
on october,chosun filed suit in the southern district of new york against chrisha for copyright infringement.chosun alleged that chrisha costumes infringed chosun registered copyrights in its lion,orangutan,and ladybug costume designs.the complaint sought monetary damages and equitable relief,including the recall of chrisha assertedly infringing products.
on october,the district court wood,held a hearing on chosun request for a temporary restraining order,permanent injunction,and order of recall.at that hearing,the district court viewed the products sold by chosun and by chrisha.based on that viewing,the court determined that chrisha had likely copied chosun costume designs.the district court issued a temporary restraining order on october,which enjoined chrisha from manufacturing or selling its allegedly infringing costumes.
up to this point,chrisha had not responded in any substantial fashion to chosun allegations.but soon after,chrisha attorneys brought to the court attention several cases that called into question the copyrightability,under,of halloween costumes.see whimsicality,rubie costumes,whimsicality i holding ornamental costumes to be ineligible for copyright,vacated in part and aff in part on other grounds,cir whimsicality ii invalidating plaintiff copyright registration forms for fraud on the copyright office,and therefore never discussing the issue of whether costumes are copyrightable whimsicality,battat,d,whimsicality iii holding in the alternative that costumes are not eligible for copyright see also funrise canada zauder,civ,wl at july,approvingly citing whimsicality i and whimsicality iii in a footnote.on october,after chosun and chrisha reached a stipulation,under which chosun request for a permanent injunction was voluntarily withdrawn without prejudice,the temporary restraining order lapsed.
on march,the district court dismissed chosun complaint for failure to state a claim.see.b.it did so because it concluded that,as a matter of law,halloween costumes were not eligible for protection under the copyright act.that act excludes useful articles from the scope of copyrightable items.see.according to the district court,halloween costumes fall within the act conception of useful articles as a result,no valid copyright infringement could arise from the unauthorized reproduction of chosun costumes.
despite this conclusion,the district court recognized that individual design elements of useful articles are afforded some level of protection under the copyright act,so long as those design elements are physically or conceptually separable from the article itself.see,brandir int l,cascade pacific lumber,cir carol barnhart economy cover,cir accessories by pearl,cir.and the court noted that the copyright office,in its internal regulations governing the registration of copyrightable materials,had interpreted the copyright act so as to protect the physically and conceptually separable elements of costumes.see united states copyright office policy decision registrability of costume designs,finding that fanciful costumes,as opposed to garment designs,are useful articles,and therefore taken as a whole,but that elements of fanciful costumes may themselves be copyrighted,so long as those elements meet the requirements of physical or conceptual separability.
but the district court did not,at any point in its order,determine whether elements of chosun costumes were physically or conceptually separable from their overall design.instead,the court said that our circuit tests for physical and conceptual separability were too inconsistent to afford meaningful guidance,and concluded that no elements of the costumes could possibly be separated from their utilitarian function as devices with which to masquerade.in the district court words 
attempting to judge the copyrightability of halloween costumes reveals the incoherence of these separability tests.a costume utility is in allowing the wearer to pretend to be something a caricature of something it is the artistic choices made in designing the costume that determine its saleability.it is impossible to say whether the utilitarian predominates over the artistic,or vice versa.until a more coherent distinction is drawn by congress,district courts can do little more than attempt to be consistent with precedent.
three courts in this district have concluded that halloween costumes are not copyrightable citing whimsicality i,whimsicality iii,and funrise following the precedents cited above,the court holds that halloween costumes may not be copyrighted.plaintiffs claim of copyright infringement is dismissed.
in a subsequent order read from the bench,the court denied chrisha request,as a prevailing party under the copyright act,for attorneys fees this appeal,and,followed.
ii.discussion 
we review de novo a district court dismissal for failure to state a claim,accepting the plaintiff factual allegations as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff favor.see,united states city of new york,cir.a complaint should only be dismissed where it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can present no set of facts entitling him to relief.see conley gibson,d.see also wynder mcmahon,cir the rule is that a court should not grant a rule b motion to dismiss unless it appears certain that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.emphasis added citation and internal quote omitted.at this stage of the proceedings,then,our charge is not to weigh the evidence that might be presented at a trial but merely to determine whether the complaint itself is legally sufficient.goldman belden,cir.
the copyright act establishes that the broad category of pictorial,graphic,or sculptural works are eligible for copyright protection,provided,of course,that such works satisfy the act other requirements.see.the act,however,excludes any useful article defined as an article having an intrinsic utilitarian function that is not merely to portray the appearance of the article or to convey information from copyright eligibility.see see also,notes of committee on the judiciary,house report stating that works of artistic craftsmanship are not protected by the act,insofar as their utilitarian aspects are concerned.this limitation is in keeping with the notion that functional items are not eligible for the relatively protections of copyright,as opposed to the more temporary rights provided by the patent act,et 
but while useful articles,taken as a whole,are not eligible for copyright prote
