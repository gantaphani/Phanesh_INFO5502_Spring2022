this appeal concerns issues of common law copyright under new york law.the allegedly infringing works are restorations of sound recordings of important classical performances originally recorded in england in the.capitol records,capitol appeals from the judgment of the district court for the southern district of new york robert sweet,district judge dismissing its suit against naxos of america,naxos.we conclude that the appeal raises unsettled issues of state law that are appropriate for certification to the new york court of appeals.
background 
the original recordings and the artists contracts.the recordings at issue the original recordings are yehudi menuhin performance of edward elgar violin concerto in b minor,opus,recorded on july and,and menuhin performance of max bruch violin concerto in g minor,opus,recorded on november,pablo casals performances of the bach cello suites recorded between november and june and edwin fischer performance of bach the well tempered clavier,book i,recorded between april and august,and fischer performance of bach the well tempered clavier,book ii,recorded between february and june.the parties are in agreement that all of the original recordings were made in the united kingdom.
on march,menuhin signed a contract with the gramophone company limited gramophone,now known as emi records limited emi,stating that gramophone would be the absolute owner of all rights in the artiste personal performance and all rights of any nature whatsoever in respect of the records made by the artiste for the company that the artiste shall at any time possess in any country of the world where the british copyright act is not in force.on november,fischer signed a contract with gramophone that contained identical language.on november,casals signed a contract with gramophone stating that gramophone would be entitled to the sole right of production,reproduction,sale,use and performance including broadcasting throughout the world by any and every means whatsoever of the records of the works performed by the artiste under this agreement.
yale correspondence.on december,richard warren,curator of historical sound recordings at the yale university library,wrote to dewdney,manager of emi copyright department in england,to inquire about setting up a procedure to handle the many requests that the library received to copy historical emi recordings.in the letter,warren,while stating that he was not a legal expert,set out his understanding of the state of copyright law for historical recordings.he wrote that recordings made before were covered by state copyright laws,which seem to provide unlimited and retroactive protection to all recordings without provision for registration.he identified three categories of requests for copies of recordings that his library had received copies for personal use,copies for broadcast,and copies for reissue.
dewdney replied ten days later.explicitly cautioning that he was not conversant with american copyright law,he explained that in the united kingdom a copyright exists in a recording for years from the end of the year in which the recording was made.dewdney stated that,within that term,must be used for personal use and not for public performance or broadcasting,and no further copies can be made without the written permission of the owners of the rights in the recording.beyond the term,no permission would be necessary for the three categories of uses identified in warren letter,so long as the musical content is public domain.
on september,warren wrote to locantro,manager of licensing and repertoire exploitation for emi,summarizing his correspondence with dewdney.locantro replied that he fully agree d with the exchange of correspondence between warren and dewdney in that it correctly set out the legal situation pertaining to public domain recordings.
emi licenses.emi also does business as emi records,according to a declaration of richard lyttelton,president for classics and jazz of emi recorded music,a division of emi.in april,emi records and emi music international services limited emimis entered into a matrix exchange agreement emimis matrix agreement,under which emi records granted to emimis an exclusive license to exploit the original recordings in the united states.at the same time,emimis and capitol also entered into a matrix exchange agreement capitol matrix agreement,under which emimis exclusively licensed the same rights to capitol.
the naxos restorations and the lawsuit.in,naxos began to sell restorations of the original recordings the naxos restorations in competition with capitol restorations.in october,capitol sued naxos for unfair competition,misappropriation of property,unjust enrichment,and common law copyright infringement.naxos moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.naxos submitted multiple declarations with its motion papers.capitol responded by moving for partial summary judgment on liability,a permanent injunction,and an accounting.capitol submitted its own set of supporting declarations and documents.naxos responded with still more documents.
district court opinions.the district court issued two opinions in this case.the principal opinion,capitol records,naxos of america,d capitol i,granted naxos motion for summary judgment,but gave capitol time to submit additional factual material.see id.at.after receipt of capitol submission,the court issued a second opinion,capitol records,naxos of america,d capitol ii,which adhered to its prior ruling and expanded on some of the court reasoning.
in capitol i,the court first converted naxos motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment in view of the factual record in the case and because both parties had had ample opportunity to present relevant materials to the court.d at.the court then noted the parties agreement that the original recordings are not protected by federal copyright law because they are sound recordings fixed before february.id.at internal quotation marks omitted however,the court recognized that the recordings would be covered by any applicable state common law protections until federal preemption occurs on february.see c.
rejecting all of capitol claims,the court concluded that naxos was entitled to summary judgment.some aspects of the court ruling are not entirely clear.initially,the court viewed capitol as asserting a hybrid copyright,unfair competition cause of action,id.at,a designation that appeared to import the elements of an unfair competition claim into capitol claim of common law copyright infringement.moreover,the court at no point stated that capitol did not have a common law copyright in the original recordings.but it did rule that the facts are inadequate to support capitol claim of intellectual property rights in the original recordings,id.at,and then separately considered and rejected capitol claim of unfair competition,id.at.
in support of the conclusion that capitol lacked intellectual property rights in the recordings,the court gave both definitive and tentative reasons.first,the court noted that the copyrights have long since expired,id.at,apparently reflecting the court view that this fact alone defeated capitol claim for common law copyright infringement.the court then stated that there is ambiguity concerning capitol chain of title and the agreement with casals.id.emphasis added.the ambiguity in capitol chain of title,as explained in capitol ii,derived from the fact that the emimis matrix agreement was executed after the expiration of english copyrights in the original recordings,see d at,and the fact that the first of capitol licenses to distribute emi recordings in the united states contained no reference to the transfer of rights from emi to emisis,capitol alleged licensor,id.the ambiguity in the agreement with casals was based on the assertion that in the agreement there is no identified uk copyright holder because there is no specific mention of the ownership of the plate.capitol i,d at.the court asserted that under copyright law the owner of any copyright interest in a sound recording depends upon ownership of the plate.copyright act,t he person who was the owner of such original plate at the time when such plate was made shall be deemed to be the author of the work.id.after consideration of a submission by a lawyer familiar with recording industry practice,the court acknowledged that a factual question precluded resolution on summary judgment of the ambiguity in the casals agreement,but concluded that this issue was not dispositive.see capitol ii,d at.
in capitol i,the court also stated that capitol appears to have waived or abandoned any interests it had in the original recordings.d at emphasis added.after stating this last point tentatively,the court then ruled that waiver and abandonment had occurred.waiver was predicated on emi correspondence with the yale library.see id.abandonment was predicated on the alleged fact that emi own restorations of the original recordings claim copyright solely in the restorations,not the underlying original works,the yale library correspondence,capitol failure to pursue other companies selling restorations of the original recordings,and the lack of clarity as to when and how consistently royalties had been paid.see id.at.
turning to the claim of unfair competition in its first opinion,the court initially rejected the claim on the ground that capitol had no rights in the original recordings.see capitol i,d at.in addition,the court pointed out that naxos had not claimed that its restorations were a substitute for or an imitation or duplicate of the original recordings.see id.in the court view,naxos had create d an entirely new and commercially viable product,id.at,in contrast to the original recordings,which were marred by numerous sound imperfections,id.and could be played only on machines that had become obsolete and unavailable to most consumers,id.the court also noted that public policy concerns,which had favored the plaintiff in new york cases such as metropolitan opera ass recorder,misc,favored naxos.t he naxos restorations would not discourage,but rather encourage the preservation and dissemination of fine performances,capitol i,d at quoting metropolitan opera,misc.at,at,and might have revived the relevant market in historic classical performances to capitol benefit,id.finally,the court stated that naxos had not shown the bad faith necessary for a common law claim of unfair competition.see id.
the court subsequent opinion elaborated on the waiver and abandonment rulings,but concluded with a repetition of the tentative nature of its view on these points capitol appears to have waived or abandoned any interests it had in the original recordings.capitol ii,d at emphasis added.
discussion 
common law copyright 
the district court properly ruled,and the parties do not dispute,that,because the original recordings were fixed before february,they are neither protected nor preempted by federal copyright law,and capitol copyright claim therefore depends on state law protection until federal preemption occurs on february,see c.the district court and the parties have assumed,correctly in our view,that the relevant state law is that of new york,the jurisdiction where the alleged infringement occurred.see russian news agency russian kurier,cir.since no new york statute provides a civil remedy for infringement of the copyright in a sound recording the availability of such a remedy depends on the scope of a common law copyright under new york common law.
in looking to new york common law,we need to make clear that the phrase common law copyright has a broader meaning as applied to sound recordings than it has as applied to most other forms of intellectual property.for most forms of intellectual property,a common law copyright was generally said to refer to an author property right in his creation before publication.see nimmer on copyright nimmer,at protection after publication was provided by federal statute id.however,when the supreme court considered the scope of state law authority over copying of sound recordings which were not protected by federal statute until,see act of,stat,the court made clear that state authority was not limited to protection.see goldstein california,d as the court explained,federal law makes the concept of publication relevant only to federal copyright law,and states can determine for themselves whether publication has any relevance to copyright protection for works,such as sound recordings,to which congress has not extended the federal copyright statute and,as we have noted,the preemption provision of the act explicitly preserved until state law authority over sound recordings fixed before february.see c.
thus,as a result of goldstein and section c,it is entirely up to new york to determine the scope of its common law copyright with respect to sound recordings.as to such recordings,common law copyright does not have only its traditional meaning of protection,but means protection against copying without regard to publication.see nimmer b,at until,state law protection via common law copyright or otherwise for such sound recordings is not precluded by federal preemption under the current act,regardless of whether or not such sound recordings have been published.footnote omitted.as far as federal law is concerned,a state court can develop protection for sound recordings 
in the pending case,the district court ruling on common law copyright raises at least one and likely three issues on which the parties disagree and on which we are in doubt.the first and most issue is whether the expiration of capitol copyright under law precludes any claim under new york common law of copyright.the second issue is whether copyright infringement under new york common law requires some or all of the elements of the tort of unfair competition.the third issue is whether a claim of copyright infringement under new york common law is defeated by showing that the allegedly infringing work is a new product,either as a general matter or at least under the circumstances of this case.
a expiration of copyright.the united kingdom copyrights in the original recordings expired years from the making of the original plate,copyright act,geo,and,as the district court ruled,all of the recordings have therefore entered the public domain in the.the district court apparently assumed that the expiration of the copyrights precluded any enforceable copyrights in the united states.that is not necessarily so.if we were dealing with works protected by the berne convention or the universal copyright convention,that assumption would likely have been supported by the rule of the shorter term.see nimmer a,at.however,neither the berne convention nor the applies to sound recordings.see nimmer a,at.such works are within the scope of the phonogram convention,see the convention for the protection of producers of phonograms against unauthorized duplication of their phonograms phonogram convention,but that convention lacks a shorter term provision and,in any event,does not apply to phonograms fixed prior to the date the convention entered into force in a contracting state,see id.for the united states,that date was march.see nimmer app,at.
naxos contends that the expiration of the copyrights precludes enforceable copyrights in the united states by virtue of the uruguay round agreements act uraa,stat.particularly the provision of that act that amends the copyrights act,see.section restores copyright protection for certain works of foreign origin that lack copyright protection in the united states,including sound recordings fixed prior to february.however,the restoration of copyright does not apply to works that were in the public domain in their source country prior to january.see id.h b.naxos contends that,because the restoration applies to works that are not in the public domain in the source country,works still protected by copyright in the source country,section reflects a congressional policy of denying protection to works in the united states where such protection is denied in the country where the works originated.br.for at.
the naxos argument is an example of the logical fallacy of assuming that the inverse of a proposition is true see raymond mccall,basic logic ed.an inverse statement of a proposition is possibly but not necessarily true.see id.that a work protected by a foreign copyright can have its united states copyright restored does not necessarily mean that a work unprotected by a foreign copyright can not receive any protection in the united states.indeed,it is highly unlikely that congress would have impliedly repealed the state common law protection for sound recordings fixed prior to february,preserved by section c,by adopting section.nothing in the legislative history of the uraa suggests such an outcome,and repeals by implication are disfavored.see branch smith,d morton mancari,d.the restoration provision of section extends federal protection to otherwise unprotected works within its coverage it does not deny protection to works protected by common law copyright.
thus,nothing in federal law denies capitol enforceable rights in the original recordings simply because the copyrights have expired.by virtue of section c,the extent of capitol copyrights,if any,depends entirely on the protection provided by new york common law copyright.
no new york court has ruled whether a rule of the shorter term would end a new york common law copyright for a work created in a foreign country after the work has entered that country public domain by reason of the expiration of the term of the foreign copyright.we have ruled that federal copyright law protects a work that enjoys no protection in the country where the work was created.see hasbro bradley,sparkle toys,cir toy design,unprotected in country of origin,entitled to protection under united states law against infringement occurring in the united states.new york might choose to follow the principle of hasbro and provide common law protection despite lack of united kingdom protection,but it might also rule that common law protection ends in new york when protection ends in the country of creation.this latter view might regard hasbro,even if analogous to new york common law,as applying only to protection for a work never entitled to protection in the country of creation,as distinguished from protection for a work whose term of protection in the country of creation has expired.such a view might also be predicated directly on a new york common law version of the rule of the shorter term.
lacking any guidance from the new york courts on the question whether a common law copyright remains available for a work that has entered the public domain in the country of creation,we will certify the question to the new york court of appeals.
b copyright infringement and unfair competition.if new york common law does not terminate the copyright in a foreign sound recording upon expiration of the foreign copyright term,the next question concerns the elements of copyright infringement under new york common law.capitol contends that infringement requires only the same elements needed for a federal copyright claim ownership of a valid copyright and copying.see feist publications,rural telephone service,d.naxos contends that more is required,and appears to contend that the elements of unfair competition must be shown.new york common law does not even recognize a cause of action for misappropriation of intangible rights unless such a claim is paired with a claim for unfair competition.br.for at citing ippolito lennon,dep t.
the district court appears to have substantially accepted naxos view of new york common law,referring to capitol common law claim as a hybrid copyright,unfair competition cause of action.capitol i,d at.
in the absence of an authoritative ruling from the new york court of appeals,we are in substantial doubt whether new york would import elements of unfair competition into a cause of action for infringement of a common law copyright.our certification will therefore include this question as well.
c can a new product infringe a common law copyright in the course of rejecting capitol cause of action for unfair competition,the district court stated that capitol original recordings are not even salable because shellacs are marred by numerous sound imperfections,and the types of machines which can extract sound from sound shellacs became obsolete many years ago and are unavailable to the majority of consumers.capitol i,d at.the court also ruled that naxos created and marketed a new product relying on its own labor,skill,and reputation.id.
although the court new product analysis was included in its rejection of capitol unfair competition claim,the court linkage of that claim to capitol copyright infringement claim implies,if not states,that the court did not believe that a new product could infringe a common law copyright,at least where the allegedly protected work has little if any current market.
if federal copyright law applied,the court new product analysis would not defeat an infringement claim.as long as a defendant work incorporates protectable elements of a plaintiff work,the plaintiff is entitled to relief.see durham industries tomy,cir.nor would the lack of a market for the protected work matter.for example,the proprietor of a copyright in a silent movie would have a viable infringement claim against a defendant who used an original screenplay of the silent movie during the term of the movie copyright to remake the movie into a modern film with sound.
however,lacking guidance as to the contours of common law copyright infringement in new york,we can not be certain whether the district court new product analysis would defeat a claim for common law copyright infringement,at least under the circumstances of this case.our certification will therefore also include this question.
ii.unfair competition 
having linked capitol common law copyright claim to unfair competition,the district court ruled that naxos was entitled to summary judgment on capitol claim of unfair competition.capitol i,d at.this ruling was based not only on capitol lack of a protectable interest,resulting,in the court view,from the expiration of the copyright,but also on the absence of bad faith on the part of naxos the fact that naxos never falsely advertised its restored product as a duplicate of the original,and did not take advantage of the commercial qualities and salable properties of the original,id.at quoting fonotipia bradley,and the court view that capitol original recordings were not salable and naxos had created a new product.
we agree that capitol can not prevail on a cause of action for unfair competition,unrelated to any copyright claim under state law.in affirming on this claim,we need go no further than to agree with the district court that capitol has not provided evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact concerning bad faith on the part of naxos.see saratoga vichy spring lehman,cir central to an unfair competition claim is some element of bad faith.
iii.waiver and abandonment.
the district court view of the naxos claim that capitol has waived or abandoned its rights in the original recordings is unclear.in the initial opinion,the court stated that capitol appears to have waived or abandoned its interests capitol i,d at emphasis added,and also stated that capitol waived and abandoned its rights,id.in the second opinion,the court stated that emi had expressly disclaimed its interests,capitol ii,d at,and then concluded that capitol appears to have waived or abandoned its interests,id.at.
waiver.the waiver rulings,whether tentative or definitive,are based entirely on the two letters from emi officials dewdney and locantro to a curator at the yale library.these letters,however,do not establish waiver.dewdney specifically stated that he was not conversant with american copyright law.under new york law,a claim of waiver requires proof of an intentional relinquishment of a known right with both knowledge of its existence and an intention to relinquish it.airco alloys division,airco niagara mohawk power,dep t internal quotation marks omitted.since dewdney was unaware of the nature of emi rights under law federal or state in the united states,he could not have intended to relinquish a known right.locantro letter also gives no indication that it
