b emphases added.the smithsonian argued that it is within the term the united states as used in b.
in support of this contention,the smithsonian submitted the sworn declaration of its general counsel describing its status and operations,along with a memorandum of law describing,inter alia,judicial treatment of the smithsonian under other federal statutes.the general counsel declaration stated,in pertinent part,as follows 
the smithsonian institution is a trust instrumentality of the united states established by act of congress in,et.
as such,the smithsonian institution reports annually to congress on its budget and receives appropriations from congress.approximately of the smithsonian institution annual operating budget is derived from federal appropriations,with the balance provided by trust funds.
in addition,whenever legal actions are brought against the smithsonian institution,we are represented by lawyers from the united states department of justice.to the extent that monetary judgments are awarded against the united states for conduct of the smithsonian institution,those judgments are paid from the united states judgment fund.
the workforce of the smithsonian institution is largely made up of federal employees.indeed,as of september,the smithsonian institution employed federal employees,which comprise approximately of the smithsonian institution work force.
the smithsonian institution press is an operating unit of the smithsonian institution and is by the smithsonian institution.the smithsonian institution press is not a separate and distinct legal entity independent of the smithsonian institution.
sworn declaration of john huerta dated september,huerta decl.
the smithsonian memorandum of law noted that the smithsonian had been created by congress in order to comply with the terms of a bequest to the united states see smithsonian memorandum of law in support of the defendant motion to dismiss smithsonian memorandum at,citing note,and stated that 
all three branches of the federal government have a significant role in the operations of the smithsonian institution.eight of the seventeen regents of the smithsonian institution acquire their positions by virtue of holding high federal government office,and the remaining regents are appointed by joint resolution of congress.
smithsonian memorandum at.although noting that no circuit court had considered whether the smithsonian was within the term united states as used in b,the smithsonian memorandum cited one district court decision that had summarily answered that question in the affirmative,see brundin united states,wl,at,and a number of circuit court opinions that had found the smithsonian to be the united states or a federal agency for purposes of other federal statutes,see part.below.pointing out that t he united states,as sovereign,is immune from suit except to the extent that it has consented to be sued smithsonian memorandum at,citing united states sherwood,the smithsonian noted that the united states has,in b,expressly waived its sovereign immunity from suit for copyright infringement only to the extent that such a suit may be brought in the court of claims.the smithsonian argued that the district court thus lacked subject matter jurisdiction of the present action id.at.
in opposition to the motion,did not dispute any of the factual assertions in the huerta declaration.rather,he argued that b is inapplicable because the smithsonian is not a corporation owned or controlled by the united states,or a contractor,subcontractor,person,firm,or corporation acting for the government,terms that are used in b and he cited dong smithsonian institution,cert.denied,d,and cotton heyman,for the proposition that the smithsonian is not a federal agency.see memorandum of law in opposition to the defendant s motion to dismiss the complaint memorandum,at unnumbered pages.pointed out that the smithsonian was created as an independent establishment of the united states,citing,and that b does not mention establishments,or trust instrumentalities,of the united states.see memorandum at unnumbered page.
in an opinion reported at d,the district court granted the smithsonian motion to dismiss.the court found interpretation of b untenable because it would effectively read out of the statute the phrase the united states.d at.noting that the only question before the court was whether the smithsonian was within b term the united states because d efendants do not contend that they fall within any other category mentioned in that section,d at,the district court answered that question in the affirmative.it reasoned that 
the phrase the united states should be interpreted broadly for purposes of section b.the language of the statute suggests congress intent to grant the court of federal claims exclusive jurisdiction over all copyright claims in which the united states has a sufficiently strong interest,or in which the united states was involved in the alleged infringement.
d at.the court noted that most of the smithsonian workforce is made up of federal employees,that in litigation the smithsonian is represented by attorneys from the united states department of justice,and that money judgments against the smithsonian are paid out of the federal fisc.see id.at.the court also noted that other courts had recognized the close relationship between the united states and the smithsonian,including substantial federal funding and the important supervisory role played by government officials,id.at internal quotation marks omitted,and had concluded that the smithsonian was a federal agency within the meaning of such statutes as the tucker act,a,and the federal tort claims act,b,ftca.see d at.the district court concluded that the smithsonian should be considered to be within the phrase the united states in b and that the court of claims thus had exclusive jurisdiction over claim.
accordingly,judgment was entered dismissing the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,and this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,who did not dispute the factual allegations in the huerta declaration,does not contend that there were any issues of fact to be tried with respect to jurisdiction.rather,he contends principally that the smithsonian should not be considered the united states within the meaning of b because a it is a trust instrumentality and trust instrumentalities are not mentioned in that section b the smithsonian,which describes itself as independent of the government,see official guide to the smithsonian at,has been held not to be a government agency for purposes of the freedom of information act,foia,and the privacy act,and c in certain statutes,congress has expressly included the smithsonian,from which infers that it is not covered by statutes that do not expressly mention it.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that the district court correctly ruled that the smithsonian is within the term the united states as used in b.
a.the purpose of b 
the reports of the judiciary committees of both the senate and the house of representatives on the bill that led to the enactment of b noted that i t has long been an established principle that the federal government should not appropriate private property without making just compensation to the owner thereof,at,senate report,reprinted in,quoting.july,house report.thus,
w hen the government deliberately publishes a copyrighted article without obtaining the prior consent of the copyright proprietor,the general assumption would be that the holder,pursuant to the principles of just compensation under the fifth amendment of our constitution,should be entitled to an action against the government for infringement.
senate report at,reprinted in at quoting house report.
prior to,however,the united states had not waived its sovereign immunity from suits for copyright infringement,and the result was,inequitabl y,that government could not claim sovereign personally liable for copyright infringement that the employees had done for the benefit of the government,reprinted in at quoting house report other internal quotation marks omitted.finding it proper that the government should assume responsibility for such acts,reprinted in at quoting house report,congress enacted b to provide a limited waiver of sovereign immunity,allowing the united states to be sued in the court of claims for copyright infringement in those cases in which the infringement was made with the authorization or consent of the government.id.at,reprinted in at.
neither b itself nor its legislative history expressly mentions the smithsonian.as discussed below,however,the smithsonian creation,governance,and the facts that congress appropriates funds expressly for the smithsonian preparation and publication of books and that judgments against the smithsonian are paid from the united states ample indicia that congress intended b reference to the united states to encompass the smithsonian.
b.the establishment and operation of the smithsonian 
the smithsonian has its origin in an bequest by the englishman james smithson,contingent on certain events that later came to pass,of his estate to the united states of america.stat,ch,the act preamble,codified at,note.the purpose of the bequest was the creation of an establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge.see generally currie,the smithsonian,chi,http.in,congress authorized the president to pursue the bequest and to collect all such sum or sums of money,or other funds,as may or shall be decreed or adjudged to the united states for,or on account of,said legacy.stat,ch,july,act.the act provided that the treasurer of the united states is hereby authorized and required to keep safely all sums of money or other funds which may be received by him in virtue of the said bequest,and to account therefor separately from all other accounts of his office,and subject to such further disposal thereof as may be hereafter provided by congress.id.the act pledged the faith of the united states to the application of those funds and moneys toward the purposes described in the bequest.id.
in the act,congress established the smithsonian for the pursuit of those purposes,the increase and dissemination of knowledge.see stat.at preamble.ensuring governmental oversight,the act provided that the persons who would constitute the smithsonian institution,be its members,would include government officials,ex officio,to wit,the president,vice president,and chief justice of the united states,the secretaries of state,the treasury,war,and the navy,the,the,the commissioner of the patent office,and the mayor of the city of washington.act,stat.at.the current codification similarly provides that those constitut ing the smithsonian are t he president,the vice president,the chief justice,and the heads of executive departments.see generally defining e xecutive departments,including the departments of state,the treasury,commerce,and education making the department of homeland security an executive department.meetings of the members of the smithsonian must be presided over by the president of the united states or,in his absence,the vice president.see.
the affairs of the smithsonian are conducted by its board of regents,see id.a,eight members of which constitute a quorum for the conduct of business,see id.eight of the regents are united states officials the vice president and the chief justice of the united states,see id.a,three united states senators appointed by the president of the senate,see id.a,and three members of the united states house of representatives appointed by the speaker of the house,see id.a.the remaining nine regents are persons other than members of congress,id.a,who are appointed by joint resolution of congress,see id.regents are allowed reimbursement for their expenses in connection with attendance at meetings,but they receive no remuneration for their service as regents.see id.each member of the board service as regent shall be gratuitous.the operations of the smithsonian are supervised by a salaried secretary chosen by the board of regents.id.more than of the smithsonian workforce of some persons are employees of the federal government.see huerta decl.
in furtherance of its purpose of increasing and disseminating knowledge,the smithsonian operations include the publication of books.the smithsonian operates its own publishing arm,the smithsonian institution press,which is a part of the smithsonian institution,rather than a separate legal entity.see huerta decl.operation of the press is designed to ensure that publications are well written,of exceptional scholarly quality,and accessible to general readers.smithsonian institution budget request to congress for fiscal year,at,available at http smithsonian budget request to congress.congress has authorized appropriations for,inter alia,the smithsonian preparation of manuscripts for publications.
in light of a the united states pledge of faith in the act to create the smithsonian with a view to increasing the dissemination of knowledge,and b congress appropriations to fund the smithsonian preparation and publication of manuscripts,we regard the smithsonian publishing activity as both authorized by the government and benefiting the government.given congress enactment of b for the purpose of allowing copyright suits exclusively against the united states with respect to alleged infringements by works published with the authorization or consent of the government or for the benefit of the government,the inference is strong that congress intended b to include the smithsonian within the term the united states.
that inference is further supported by the fact that most of the smithsonian operational expenses,and the judgments against it,are funded from the united states treasury.the moneys bequeathed to the united states by smithson,totaling,were placed in the united states treasury.see act,stat.at.smithsonian operations were to be financed not from principal but from income on the bequeathed funds.see id.currently,some of the smithsonian annual operating budget is derived from federal appropriations.see huerta decl.smithsonian budget request to congress,at,requesting more than million in federal appropriations,including more than million
