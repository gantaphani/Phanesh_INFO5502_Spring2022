background 
factual background 
blizzard,a california corporation and subsidiary of vivendi,creates and sells software games for personal computers.this appeal concerns the particular blizzard games starcraft,starcraft brood war,warcraft ii edition,diablo,and diablo ii lord of destruction.combs and crittenden are computer programmers,jung is a systems administrator,and internet gateway is an internet service provider based in peters,missouri.jung is also the president,and operator of internet gateway.
in january,blizzard officially launched,a service available exclusively to purchasers of its computer games.the service has nearly million active users who spend more that million hours online per day.blizzard holds valid copyright registrations covering and each of its computer games at issue in this litigation.is a free service that allows owners of blizzard games to play each other on their personal computers via the internet.mode allows users to create and join games that can be accessed across the internet,to chat with other potential players,to record wins and losses and save advancements in an individual game account,and to participate with others in tournament play featuring elimination rounds players can set up private chat channels and private games on to allow players to determine with whom they wish to interact online.these mode features are only accessible from within the games.
like most computer software,blizzard games can be easily copied and distributed over the internet.blizzard has taken steps to avoid piracy by designing to restrict access and use of the mode feature of the game.each time a user logs onto,a server examines the user version of the game software.if a blizzard game does not have the latest software upgrades and fixes,the service updates the customer game before allowing the game to play in mode.
with the exception of diablo,each authorized version of a blizzard game comes with a cd key.a cd key is a unique sequence of alphanumeric characters printed on a sticker attached to the case in which the was packaged to log on to and access mode,the game initiates an authentication sequence or secret handshake between the game and the server in order to play the blizzard game contained on a,a user must first install the game onto a computer and agree to the terms of the end user license agreement eula and terms of use tou both of which prohibit reverse engineering.at the end of both the eula and tou,blizzard includes a button with the text,i agree in it,which the user must select in order to proceed with the installation.users are also required to enter a name and the cd key during installation of and blizzard games.
the outside packaging of all blizzard games,except for diablo,contains a statement that use of the game is subject to the eula and that use of is subject to the terms of the tou.the terms of neither the eula nor the tou appear on the outside packaging.if the user does not agree to these terms,the game may be returned for a full refund of the purchase price within thirty days of the original purchase.combs,crittenden,and jung installed blizzard games and agreed to the terms of the eula.crittenden and jung logged onto and agreed to the tou.
the users of have occasionally experienced difficulties with the service to address their frustrations with,a group of volunteer game hobbyists,programmers,and other individuals formed a group called the bnetd project.the bnetd project developed a program called the server that emulates the service and permits users to play online without use of.the bnetd project is a volunteer effort and the project has always offered the bnetd program for free to anyone.combs,crittenden,and jung were lead developers for the bnetd project.
the bnetd project was organized and managed over the internet through a website,that was made available to the public through equipment provided by internet gateway.the emulator provides a server that allows gamers unable or unwilling to connect to to experience the features of blizzard games.the emulator also provides matchmaking services for users of blizzard games who want to play those games in a environment without using.attempted to mirror all of the features of,including online discussion forums and information about the bnetd project,as well as access to the program computer code for others to copy and modify.
to serve as a functional alternative to,had to be compatible with blizzard software.in particular,compatibility required that speak the same protocol language that the speaks.by speaking the same protocol language,the bnetd programs would be interoperable with blizzard games.once game play starts,a user perceives no difference between and the.
by necessity,appellants used reverse engineering to learn blizzard protocol language and to ensure that worked with blizzard games.combs used reverse engineering to develop the server,including a program called tcpdump to log communications between blizzard games and the server.crittenden used reverse engineering to develop the server,including using a program called nextray.crittenden also used a program called ripper to take blizzard client files that were compiled together in one file and break them into their component parts.crittenden used the ripper program to determine how blizzard games displayed ad banners so that could display ad banners to users in the format that blizzard uses on the service.combs tried to disassemble a blizzard game to figure out how to implement a feature that allowed to protect the password that a user enters when creating an account in mode.crittenden made an unauthorized copy of a blizzard game in order to test the interoperability of the server with multiple games.
blizzard designed its games to connect only to servers.to enable a blizzard game to connect to a server instead of a server,bnetd had to modify the computer file that contained the internet address of the servers.as part of the bnetd project,combs participated in the development of a utility program called bns to allow blizzard games to connect to servers more easily.through the bns program,the game sends the server information about its cd key.an individual can thus play one of the blizzard games at issue over the internet via rather than.according to blizzard,the eulas and tous prohibit this activity.
has important operational differences from when receives the cd key information,unlike,it does not determine whether the cd key is valid or currently in use by another player.the server computer code always sends the game an okay reply regardless of whether the cd key is valid or currently in use by another player.the bnetd.org emulator always allows the blizzard games to access mode features even if the user does not have a valid or unique cd key.blizzard did not disclose the methods it used to generate cd keys or to confirm the validity of cd keys.
combs,crittenden,and jung used blizzard games to log into bnetd.org.crittenden was aware that unauthorized versions of blizzard games were played on.jung knew that the emulator did not require that blizzard games provide valid cd keys.combs suspected that the emulator would not know the difference between a real game and a pirated game.combs and crittenden either sent portions of the bnetd software to jung to place on the website for download or put the software on the website themselves.combs made the bnetd software available on his website located at.also distributed was the bns utility program which allowed blizzard games to connect to.the source code was made available as an open source application,meaning that others were free to copy the source code and distribute it with or without modifications.because the source code was freely available,others developed additional emulators based on the source code.binary versions of the were distributed which made it more convenient for users to set up and access the emulator program.internet gateway has donated space on its computers for use by the bnetd project.internet gateway also hosted a server that anyone on the internet could access and use to play blizzard games in mode.
procedural background 
blizzard and vivendi brought suit in the united states district court for the eastern district of missouri.the second amended complaint alleged copyright infringement in violation of circumvention of copyright protection systems and trafficking in circumvention technology in violation of a federal trademark infringement in violation of federal false designation of origin in violation of c common law trademark infringement and unfair competition claims and breach of the eula and tou.appellants counterclaimed,requesting declaratory relief as to under,of copyright under a,the unconstitutionality of a,and unenforceability of blizzard eula and tou.
the district court entered a consent decree and permanent injunction which constituted the full and complete relief on the claims of copyright infringement,federal trademark infringement,federal false designation,and trademark and infringement.the consent decree also provided complete relief on the counterclaim for declaratory judgment for and unconstitutionality of a.the consent decree resolved all claims except for the claims of circumvention of copyright protection systems and trafficking in circumvention technology under a,breach of the eula and tou,and the counterclaims for declaratory relief for and unenforceability of the eula and tou.
both sides motioned for summary judgment.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of blizzard and vivendi and determined that blizzard software license and terms of usage agreements were enforceable contracts appellants waived any fair use defense the agreements did not constitute misuse of copyright and appellants violated the dmca and provisions of the dmca.appellants brought this appeal,disputing violations of the dmca,and now argue that the state claims were preempted by federal copyright law.
ii.discussion 
we review the grant or denial of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standard as the district court and may affirm on grounds supported by the record.bechtold city of rosemount,cir.summary judgment is appropriate where the record shows that no genuine issue as to any material fact exists and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.dorsey pinnacle automation,cir.a plaintiff may not merely point to unsupported allegations,but must substantiate allegations with sufficient probative evidence that would permit a finding in the plaintiff favor.wilson int l bus.mach,cir.the mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the plaintiff position will be insufficient there must be evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the plaintiff.anderson liberty lobby,d.only disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment.id.at.
preemption 
the copyright act provides the exclusive source of protection for all legal and equitable rights that are equivalent to any of the exclusive rights within the general scope of copyright as specified by of the copyright act.see a.the copyright act preempts state laws that attempt to protect rights exclusively protected by federal law.see car rental,computer assocs,cir.conversely,the copyright act does not preempt state law from enforcing legal or equitable rights.id.a state cause of action is statutorily or expressly preempted if the work at issue is within the subject matter of copyright as defined in and of the copyright act,and the right is equivalent to any of the exclusive rights within the general scope of copyright as specified in.id.at citing harper row,nation,cir.express preemption is no longer at issue in this case 
this case concerns conflict preemption.conflict preemption applies when there is no express preemption but it is impossible to comply with both the state and federal law or when the state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.pacific gas energy res.conservation and dev.com n,d jones rath packing,d.appellants,relying upon vault quaid software,cir,argue that the federal copyright act preempts blizzard state law claims.we disagree.
in vault,plaintiffs challenged the louisiana software license enforcement act,which permitted a software producer to impose contractual terms upon software purchasers provided that the terms were set forth in a license agreement comporting with the statute.id.at.enforceable terms under the louisiana statute include the prohibition of any copying of the program for any purpose and modifying adapting the program in any way,including adaptation by reverse engineering,decompilation or disassembly.id.at citation omitted.the louisiana statute defined reverse engineering,decompiling or disassembling as any process by which computer software is converted from one form to another form which is more readily understandable to human beings,including without limitation any decoding or decrypting of any computer program which has been encoded or encrypted in any manner.id.citation omitted.the fifth circuit held that the louisiana statute conflicted with the rights of computer program owners under the copyright act,specifically,which permits a computer program owner to make an adaptation of a program provided that the adaption is either created as an essential step in the utilization of the computer program in conjunction with a machine or is for archival purpose only.id.at.
unlike in vault,the state law at issue here neither conflicts with the interoperability exception under f nor restricts rights given under federal law.appellants contractually accepted restrictions on their ability to reverse engineer by their agreement to the terms of the tou and eula.p rivate parties are free to contractually forego the limited ability to reverse engineer a software product under the exemptions of the copyright act,bowers baystate techs,and a state can permit parties to contract away a fair use defense or to agree not to engage in uses of copyrighted material that are permitted by the copyright law if the contract is freely negotiated.id.at dyk,dissenting.see also car rental,at holding that the copyright act does not preempt a breach of contract action based on prohibited use of software contained in a license agreement.while bowers and car rental were express preemption cases rather than conflict preemption,their reasoning applies here with equal force.by signing the tous and eulas,appellants expressly relinquished their rights to reverse engineer.summary judgment on this issue was properly granted in favor of blizzard and vivendi.
dmca claims and interoperability exception 
congress enacted the dmca in to implement the world intellectual property organization copyright treaty wipo treaty.wipo requires contracting nations to provide adequate legal protection and effective legal remedies against the circumvention of effective technological measures that are used by authors in connection with the exercise of their rights under this treaty or the berne convention and that restrict acts,in respect of their works,which are not authorized by the authors concerned or permitted by law.wipo treaty,treaty doc,available at wl the dmca contains three provisions targeted at the circumvention of technological protections.
the first is a,the provision.this provision prohibits a person from circumven
