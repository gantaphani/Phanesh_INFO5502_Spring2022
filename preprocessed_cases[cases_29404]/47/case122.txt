this appeal concerns the scope of copyright protection afforded artistic concert posters reproduced in reduced size in a biography of the musical group the grateful dead.asserted copyright holder bill graham archives,llc bga or appellant appeals from a judgment of the district court for the southern district of new york dismissing,on motion for summary judgment,its copyright infringement action against dorling kindersley limited,dorling kindersley publishing,and donnelley sons company collectively dk or appellees.we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,and we agree with the court that dk reproduction of bga images is protected by the fair use exception to copyright infringement.
background 
in october of,dk published grateful dead the illustrated trip illustrated trip,in collaboration with grateful dead productions,intended as a cultural history of the grateful dead.the resulting coffee table book tells the story of the grateful dead along a timeline running continuously through the book,chronologically combining over images representing dates in the grateful dead history with explanatory text.a typical page of the book features a collage of images,text,and graphic art designed to simultaneously capture the eye and inform the reader.plaintiff bga claims to own the copyright to seven images displayed in illustrated trip,which dk reproduced without bga permission.
initially,dk sought permission from bga to reproduce the images.in may of,the ceo of grateful dead productions sent a letter to bga seeking permission for dk to publish the images.bga responded by offering permission in exchange for grateful dead productions grant of permission to bga to make cds and dvds out of concert footage in bga archives.next,dk directly contacted bga seeking to negotiate a license agreement,but the parties disagreed as to an appropriate license fee.nevertheless,dk proceeded with publication of illustrated trip without entering a license fee agreement with bga.specifically,dk reproduced seven artistic images originally depicted on grateful dead event posters and tickets bga seven images are displayed in significantly reduced form and are accompanied by captions describing the concerts they represent.
when dk refused to meet bga license fee demands,bga filed suit for copyright infringement.bga sought to enjoin further publication of illustrated trip,the destruction of all unsold books,and actual and statutory damages.the parties for summary judgment,with the primary issue before the district court being whether dk use of bga images constituted fair use under the copyright act of,et.copyright act.after applying the statutory fair use balancing test,the district court determined that dk reproduction of the images was fair use and granted dk motion for summary judgment.
discussion 
section of the copyright act grants copyright holders a bundle of exclusive rights,including the right to reproduce the copyrighted work in copies,and the right to prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work.for purposes of the motion,the district court assumed plaintiff possessed these rights in the contested images and there is no dispute that copying the images was not authorized by plaintiff.the issue before us on appeal,as it was in the district court,is whether dk unauthorized use of bga copyrighted images is fair use.
the fair use doctrine is a statutory exception to copyright infringement.section of the copyright act permits the unauthorized use or reproduction of copyrighted work if it is for purposes such as criticism,comment,news reporting,teaching,scholarship,or research.whether such fair use exists involves a determination using four,statutorily provided factors in light of the purposes of copyright.harper row,publishers,nation,d.the factors are the purpose and character of the use the nature of the copyrighted work the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole and the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.the ultimate test of fair use is whether the copyright law goal of promoting the progress of science and useful arts would be better served by allowing the use than by preventing it.castle rock entm t,carol publ g group,cir internal citations and quotation marks omitted.
in this case,the district court concluded that the balance of fair use factors weighs in favor of dk.although the issue of fair use is a mixed question of law and fact,the court may resolve issues of fair use at the summary judgment stage where there are no genuine issues of material fact as to such issues.wright warner books,cir.as there are no genuine issues of material fact here,we review the district court legal conclusions de novo.new era publ ns int l,aps carol publ g group,cir.we agree with the district court that dk use of the copyrighted images is protected as fair use.
purpose and character of use 
we first address the purpose and character of the use,including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes.most important to the court analysis of the first factor is the transformative nature of the work.see pierre leval,toward a fair use standard,harv.the question is whether the new work merely supersede s the objects of the original creation,or instead adds something new,with a further purpose or different character,altering the first with new expression,meaning,or message.campbell music,d internal citations and quotation marks omitted alteration in original.
here,the district court determined that illustrated trip is a biographical work,and the original images are not,and therefore accorded a strong presumption in favor of dk use.in particular,the district court concluded that dk use of images placed in chronological order on a timeline is transformatively different from the mere expressive use of images on concert posters or tickets.because the works are displayed to commemorate historic events,arranged in a creative fashion,and displayed in significantly reduced form,the district court held that the first fair use factor weighs heavily in favor of dk.
appellant challenges the district court strong presumption in favor of fair use based on the biographical nature of illustrated trip.appellant argues that based on this purported error the district court failed to examine dk justification for its use of each of the images.moreover,appellant argues that as a matter of law merely placing poster images along a timeline is not a transformative use.appellant asserts that each reproduced image should have been accompanied by comment or criticism related to the artistic nature of the image.
we disagree with appellant limited interpretation of transformative use and we agree with the district court that dk actual use of each image is transformatively different from the original expressive purpose.preliminarily,we recognize,as the district court did,that illustrated trip is a biographical work documenting the history of the grateful dead.while there are no categories of presumptively fair use,see campbell music,at,courts have frequently afforded fair use protection to the use of copyrighted material in biographies,recognizing such works as forms of historic scholarship,criticism,and comment that require incorporation of original source material for optimum treatment of their subjects.see stating that fair use of a copyrighted work for purposes such as criticism,comment or scholarship is not an infringement of copyright am.geophysical union texaco,cir jacobs,dissenting noting that m uch of our fair use case law has been generated by the use of quotation in biographies,a practice that fits comfortably within the statutory categories of uses illustrative of uses that can be fair internal quotation marks omitted alteration in original salinger random house,cir holding that quotation of salinger letters in a biography could be considered criticism,scholarship,and research,which are among the illustrative statutory categories of fair use enumerated in.no less a recognition of biographical value is warranted in this case simply because the subject made a mark in pop culture rather than some other area of human endeavor.see twin peaks,publ ns int l,cir noting that a work that comments about pop culture is not removed from the scope of section simply because it is not erudite.
in the instant case,dk purpose in using the copyrighted images at issue in its biography of the grateful dead is plainly different from the original purpose for which they were created.originally,each of bga images fulfilled the dual purposes of artistic expression and promotion.the posters were apparently widely distributed to generate public interest in the grateful dead and to convey information to a large number people about the band forthcoming concerts.in contrast,dk used each of bga images as historical artifacts to document and represent the actual occurrence of grateful dead concert events featured on illustrated trip timeline.
in some instances,it is readily apparent that dk image display enhances the reader understanding of the biographical text in other instances,the link between image and text is less obvious nevertheless,the images still serve as historical artifacts graphically representing the fact of significant grateful dead concert events selected by the illustrated trip author for inclusion in the book timeline we conclude that both types of uses fulfill dk transformative purpose of enhancing the biographical information in illustrated trip,a purpose separate and distinct from the original artistic and promotional purpose for which the images were created.see elvis presley,passport video,cir finding the use of television clips to be transformative where the clips play for only a few seconds and are used for reference purposes while a narrator talks over them or interviewees explain their context in elvis career,but not to be transformative where the clips play without much interruption,and t he purpose of showing these clips likely goes beyond merely making a reference for a biography,but instead serves the same intrinsic entertainment value that is protected by plaintiffs copyrights see also hofheinz v.a e television networks,d,ruling that unauthorized inclusion of copyrighted film clips in actor biographical film was protected fair use because the biography was not shown to recreate the creative expression reposing in plaintiff copyrighted film,but for the transformative purpose of enabling the viewer to understand the actor modest beginnings in the film business.in sum,because dk use of the disputed images is transformative both when accompanied by referencing commentary and when standing alone,we agree with the district court that dk was not required to discuss the artistic merits of the images to satisfy this first factor of fair use analysis.
this conclusion is strengthened by the manner in which dk displayed the images.first,dk significantly reduced the size of the reproductions.see kelly arriba soft,cir finding online search engine use of images to be highly transformative.while the small size is sufficient to permit readers to recognize the historical significance of the posters,it is inadequate to offer more than a glimpse of their expressive value.in short,dk used the minimal image size necessary to accomplish its transformative purpose.
second,dk minimized the expressive value of the reproduced images by combining them with a prominent timeline,textual material,and original graphical artwork,to create a collage of text and images on each page of the book.to further this collage effect,the images are displayed at angles and the original graphical artwork is designed to blend with the images and text.overall,dk layout ensures that the images at issue are employed only to enrich the presentation of the cultural history of the grateful dead,not to exploit copyrighted artwork for commercial gain.see hofheinz.at.
third,bga images constitute an inconsequential portion of illustrated trip.the extent to which unlicensed material is used in the challenged work can be a factor in determining whether a biographer use of original materials has been sufficiently transformative to constitute fair use.see craft kobler,leval,finding biography of stravinsky to be unfair in part because the takings were numerous and were the liveliest and most entertaining part of the biography.although our circuit has counseled against considering the percentage the allegedly infringing work comprises of the copyrighted work in conducting fair use analysis,see nxivm ross,cir,several courts have done so,see,harper,at.finding the fact that quotes from president ford unpublished memoirs played a central role in the allegedly infringing magazine article,constituting of that article,weighed against a finding of fair use salinger,at finding the fact that letters are quoted or paraphrased on approximately of the book pages weighs against fair use.we find this inquiry more relevant in the context of fair use analysis.
in the instant case,the book is pages long,while the bga images appear on only seven pages.although the original posters range in size from x to more than x,the largest reproduction of a bga image in illustrated trip is less than x,less than the size of the original.and no bga image takes up more than of a page in a book or is given more prominence than any other image on the page.in total,the images account for less than of one percent of the book.this stands in stark contrast to the wholesale takings in cases such as those described above,and we are aware of no case where such an insignificant taking was found to be an unfair use of original materials.
finally,as to this first factor,we briefly address the commercial nature of illustrated trip.see harper,at.stating that the fact that the purpose of a new use is commercial weighs against finding fair use.even though illustrated trip is a commercial venture,we recognize that nearly all of the illustrative uses listed in the preamble paragraph of are generally conducted for profit campbell,at.internal quotation marks omitted.moreover,t he crux of the distinction is not whether the sole motive of the use is monetary gain but whether the user stands to profit from exploitation of the copyrighted material without paying the customary price.harper,at.here,illustrated trip does not exploit the use of bga images as such for commercial gain.significantly,dk has not used any of bga images in its commercial advertising or in any other way to promote the sale of the book.illustrated trip merely uses pictures and text to describe the life of the grateful dead.by design,the use of bga images is incidental to the commercial biographical value of the book.
accordingly,we conclude that the first fair use factor weighs in favor of dk because dk use of bga images is transformatively different from the images original expressive purpose and dk does not seek to exploit the images expressive value for commercial gain.
ii.nature of the copyrighted work 
the second factor in a fair use determination is the nature of the copyrighted work.to resolve this inquiry the court considers the protection of the reasonable expectations of one who engages in the kinds of that the copyright seeks to encourage.leval,supra,at.c reative expression for public dissemination falls within the core of the copyright protective purposes.campbell,at.
the district court determined that the second factor weighs against dk because the images are creative artworks,which are traditionally the core of intended copyright protection.nevertheless,the court limited the weight it placed on this factor because the posters have been published extensively.appellant agrees that the district court properly weighed the second factor against dk,although it questions the lesser protection given to published works.appellees counter that because the images are mixed factual and creative works and have been long and extensively published,the second factor tilts toward fair use.
we agree with the district court that the creative nature of artistic images typically weighs in favor of the copyright holder.we recognize,however,that the second factor may be of limited usefulness where the creative work of art is being used
