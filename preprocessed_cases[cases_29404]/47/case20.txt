after prevailing at trial in this copyright infringement case,the plaintiff sought and recovered substantial attorneys fees.the defendants contest the fee award.concluding that the district court acted within the realm of its discretion,we affirm.
background 
the relevant facts are easily catalogued.on august,jason spooner filed a complaint in the district court alleging that a gaggle of defendants dan egan,een,egan media production company the ski resort,and its hierarchs had engaged in blatant and unauthorized use of the plaintiff protected musical composition,in violation of the copyright act.the use occurred when een included a song composed,copyrighted,and performed by the plaintiff in a commercial advertisement prepared for television and internet display on behalf of sugarloaf.the plaintiff had not authorized this use.
dismayed by the infringement of his copyright,he sought an injunction,statutory damages,and costs including attorneys fees under the copyright act.what followed was the litigation equivalent of combat.
it would serve no useful purpose to recite book and verse.it suffices to say that the parties engaged in frenetic motions practice,conducted extensive discovery,and squabbled over a plethora of issues large and small.during this pretrial period,the protagonists struggled to reach a global settlement.that effort proved unavailing but,in october of,the plaintiff settled with the sugarloaf defendants for,dismissing the claims against those parties.see.a a ii.shortly thereafter,egan and een hereinafter,the defendants made a offer of judgment under federal rule of civil procedure.this offer encompassed both damages and costs including attorneys fees.the plaintiff rejected it.
at a meeting held on november,the defendants offered the sum of in full settlement.this second offer,which was not tendered under the aegis of rule,went unrequited.
after settlement negotiations fizzled,the case was tried to the court.the plaintiff prevailed the court found that the defendants had willfully infringed the protected work and that egan had failed to act celeritously in response to the plaintiff request to retire the sugarloaf commercial.spooner een,spooner i,cv,wl,at.may.accordingly,the court granted the plaintiff both injunctive relief and statutory damages in the amount of.id.at.because all of the parties originally sued were jointly and severally liable for the statutory damages,the court set off the amount paid in the sugarloaf settlement,leaving the plaintiff with a net additional recovery of in statutory damages.id.at.finally,the court determined that the plaintiff should recover attorneys fees pursuant to.id.at.

ii.analysis 
we review a district court award of attorneys fees for abuse of discretion.hutchinson ex rel.julien patrick,cir.under this rubric,we will set aside a fee award only if it clearly appears that the trial court ignored a factor deserving significant weight,relied upon an improper factor,or evaluated all the proper factors and no improper ones,but made a serious mistake in weighing them.gay officers action league.puerto rico,cir see latin am.music am.soc y of composers,authors publishers,cir,slip op.at.in all events,a material error of law constitutes an abuse of discretion.torres rivera cancel,cir.
in the american justice system,the parties customarily bear the responsibility for paying their own lawyers.alyeska pipeline serv.wilderness soc y.but this general rule,like virtually every general rule,admits of exceptions.the copyright act creates such an exception it authorizes a district court in its discretion to award a reasonable attorney fee to the prevailing party in a copyright action see fogerty fantasy.a prevailing party is one who has prevailed on the merits of at least some of his claims.buckhannon bd.care home.dep t of health human,quoting hanrahan hampton,per curiam.this definition applies in the precincts patrolled by section.see torres negrón j n records,llc,cir.
the defendants acknowledge as they must that the plaintiff is a prevailing party.they nonetheless challenge the fee award for two reasons.first,they argue that the plaintiff fee request was so excessive that the district court ought not to have awarded any fees at all.second,they argue that,even if an award was warranted,the court should have limited it to work performed prior to november,the date on which the plaintiff rejected the defendants settlement offer.after pausing to clear away a jurisdictional obstacle,we discuss these claims sequentially.
a.the jurisdictional obstacle.
there is a jurisdictional question in this case.although the defendants notice of appeal was directed exclusively at the order granting an award of attorneys fees,the plaintiff request for other costs remained pending in the district court.as a general rule,a fee award is treated as distinct from an award of costs and,therefore,the fee award may be appealed even if the question of costs is unresolved.see.d see also marek chesny.
copyright cases,however,require the use of a different template.the copyright act authorizes a court to award a reasonable attorney fee to the prevailing party as part of the costs.emphasis supplied.when a statute specifies that attorneys fees are a part of costs in a particular class of cases,an inquiring court must honor that directive.see marek,at.this taxonomy has practical consequences,one of which is that as long as the overall question of costs remains unresolved,an award of attorneys a component of the total recoverable not constitute a final and appealable order.see u.see also garcía goyco law envtl.consultants,cir explaining,in case where district court denied section request for fees without prejudice,that an initial order granting plaintiff a specific period within which to refile is typically not considered final.
a court is to notice,and act upon,defects in its subject matter jurisdiction sua sponte.mcculloch vélez,cir.thus,even though the parties had not questioned appellate jurisdiction,we raised the point at oral argument.
jurisdictional defects sometimes can be remedied by corrective measures even after an appeal is filed.see kossler crisanti,cir en banc explaining that parties cured initial jurisdictional defect caused by lack of final judgment by stipulating to entry of judgment on all claims that remained open in the district court see also grupo dataflux atlas global.mindful of this possibility,we informally stayed the proceedings while the parties attended to this jurisdictional defect.in rapid sequence,the parties stipulated to the amount of the recoverable costs other than attorneys fees,the district court entered an appropriate order taxing those costs against the defendants in the amount of,and the clerk of the district court certified that result to us.this corrective action left nothing open in the district court.consequently,it cured the jurisdictional defect and rendered the fee award final and appealable.
b.the fee request.
the defendants principal claim is that the plaintiff request for fees reflects such a degree of extravagance that the only appropriate response to it was an outright denial of any fees.to put this claim into perspective,we first describe the conventional framework that courts use in fashioning fee awards the lodestar method see,perdue kenny ex rel.winn,lipsett blanco,cir.this approach requires the district court to ascertain the number of hours productively expended and multiply that time by reasonable hourly rates.hensley eckerhart,gay officers action league,at.the obligation to support both the time and rate components rests with the party seeking the award,hensley,at,but the opposing party may proffer countervailing evidence,see foley city of lowell,cir.appropriate supporting documentation includes counsel contemporaneous time and billing records and information establishing the usual and customary rates in the marketplace for comparably credentialed counsel.gay officers action league,at see united states v.one star class sloop sailboat,cir.
once the parties have made their submissions,the court determines how much compensable time counsel spent on the case,deleting any duplicative,unproductive,or excessive hours.gay officers action league,at.the court then applies prevailing rates in the community to arrive at the lodestar.id.although the lodestar amount represents a presumptively reasonable fee,lipsett,at,the court may adjust it up or down for other factors,say,a significant gap between the relief requested and the result obtained.see,de jesús nazario morris rodríguez,cir.
in this instance,the district court faithfully followed the lodestar method.the plaintiff requested fees totaling.the court noted the defendants argument that this request was so exorbitant that it warranted an outright denial of fees,spooner ii,wl,at,but chose not to go down that road.instead,it undertook a methodical appraisal of the fee request.
the court observed approvingly that the plaintiff had pared down his fee request before filing it,writing off more than hours.id.at.it trimmed the request even further,winnowing out hours that it deemed readily attributable to the plaintiff claims against the sugarloaf defendants.id.similarly,it deleted hours relating to the plaintiff quixotic endeavor to secure a pretrial attachment of egan property.id.it then adjusted the time spent to reflect the plaintiff unsuccessful attempt to split his infringement claim into two pieces one relating to composition and the other to recording,deducting time attributable to that failed initiative.id.at.
with respect to rates,the court reported that the defendants had offered nothing to show that the rates proposed by the plaintiff were unreasonable.id.at.noting that these rates were lower than those awarded for work done by the same lawyers in a recent case in the district of maine,the court pronounced them reasonable.id.it proceeded to multiply the reduced hours by the approved rates to fashion the lodestar.id.at.
the court freely acknowledged that this dollar figure far exceeded both the statutory damages that the plaintiff had recovered and the lesser amount that he stood to collect after setting off the sugarloaf settlement.id.at.but the court explained that the defendants had willfully infringed the plaintiff copyright and,moreover,that the plaintiff had secured a permanent injunction,which may have more value than the statutory damage award.id.at.discerning no reason to make further adjustments to the lodestar,the court awarded the plaintiff attorneys fees of.id.at.
against this backdrop,we turn to the defendants plaint that the amount of the fee request was so excessive that the court should have refused to award any fees at all it is obvious that the amount of fees requested by the plaintiff is quite large in relation to the statutory damages recovered whether those damages are viewed before or after the sugarloaf.the law,however,does not demand strict proportionality between fees and damages.see city of riverside rivera,plurality op.hensley,at explaining that t here is no precise rule or formula for calculating the impact of plaintiff degree of success on the amount of a reasonable fee award.
this rule makes eminently good sense a strict proportionality requirement would overlook entirely the value of other important litigation goals.that kind of rigidity would frustrate the core purpose that underlies many statutes,which are designed to afford private parties the opportunity to vindicate rights that serve some broad public good.see city of riverside,at.copyright cases are a prime example of a situation in which obtaining relief or establishing a principle may be worth considerably more than the damages recovered.
the defendants assert that this case does not involve any issues of significant societal importance.that assertion rings hollow.attorneys fees are made available to prevailing parties in copyright cases in order to vindicat e the overriding purpose of the copyright act to encourage the production of original literary,artistic,and musical expression for the public good.mag jewelry cherokee,cir alteration in original quoting lotus dev.borland int l,cir.the plaintiff suit serves precisely this purpose.
we do not mean to imply that,once a party prevails in a case that falls within the compass of a federal statute,the sky is the limit with respect to a request for attorneys fees.if the requested fees are gluttonously high,a court has discretion to deny fees entirely.see first state ins.grp.nationwide mut.ins,cir per curiam fair hous.council of greater landow,cir lewis kendrick,cir.that is especially true in a copyright infringement action,where winning in itself does not automatically entitle the prevailing party to an award of attorneys fees.see,fogerty,u.at see also note,supra.
be that as it may,denying fees altogether because of an overly ambitious fee request is a drastic step.such a step is powerful medicine,to be administered sparingly and in only the most egregious cases.see lewis,at.should a court find that a fee request has been outrageously inflated or that an attorney is logging unnecessary hours in order to capitalize on prevailing party status,it might well consider such a step.but more often,a court that is faced with a fee request that seems inordinately high can do justice between the parties by the simple expedient of shrinking the request down to an appropriate size.see foley,at often,when the amount sought is large but the actual recovery is small,fees may be reduced somewhat.
of course,the trial court is in the best position to gauge the bona fides of a request for fees.where,as here,the trial court makes manifest that it understands the extent of its discretion,yet decides not to deny attorneys fees completely to a prevailing plaintiff on the basis of an excessive request,it is hard to imagine that an appellate court will interfere.latin am.music,at slip op.at noting the exceptional degree of deference that courts of appeals afford district courts determinations fee awards in copyright cases lipsett,at similar.
the facts of this case do not remotely suggest a need for us to usurp the district court province.after all,the plaintiff voluntarily surrendered some hours before submitting his fee request,and the district court had no apparent difficulty in separating wheat from chaff with respect to the remainder.the court skillfully adjusted the number of hours downward and carefully explained its reasoning for each reduction.as to the time allowed,the defendants have not shown indeed,they have made no effort to show that any particular hours were improvidently included.by the same token,they have not shown indeed,they have made no effort to show that the rates requested were esurient.these failures are a testament to the fairness of the district court tamisage.see hutchinson,at remarking that defendants failure to submit evidence opposing fee request undercut their argument that the district court abused its discretion in awarding plaintiffs the full amount sought.and,finally,the amount of fees requested does not seem grossly disproportionate to the intrinsic value of the relief obtained.
the short of it is that the district court determined,at least implicitly,that the plaintiff request for fees,though high,was not so outrageous as to call for a total denial.the defendants have not come within a country mile of showing that this determination constituted an abuse of discretion.the defendants first claim of error is,therefore,unavailing.
c.the settlement offer.
the defendants next argue that even if the plaintiff was entitled to a fee award,the district court should have limited that award to work performed prior to november,when the plaintiff rejected the defendants settlement offer.in support,the defendants cite french corporate receivables,cir.their reliance on french is misplaced.
