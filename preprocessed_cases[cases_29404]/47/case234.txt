louis kohus kohus appeals the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants john mariol,james mariol,and jvm innovation design defendants,on kohus claims for copyright infringement.kohus argues that the district court applied the wrong legal standard,and that the court erred by refusing to consider expert testimony.having concluded that the sixth circuit does not have a settled legal standard in this area,we set out a standard below and remand so the district court may apply that standard.
statement of facts 
kohus invents and designs consumer products,including children items.in he formed,kmi with john mariol mariol.they developed a number of products,including product,a portable children playyard,which included drawings for a latch that would lock the upper rails in place for use.this latch the latch was unlike others on the market in that it had two flippers,or hinges,instead of one,and this gave it a function that could make it safer than comparable latches.
by august of a serious disagreement had developed between kmi shareholders,and kohus and kmi sued mariol and his father james who was also an inventor,and worked with kohus in ohio court.the lawsuit remained unresolved for some six years,though the court did order that in the interim james should maintain control of all kmi products and assets.the parties parted ways,and mariol acted as his father agent in handling kmi products and assets.
in november of the kmi litigation finally ended in a settlement.paragraph two of the settlement agreement provided that james mariol hereby assigns to kohus all rights,title and interest,whether known or unknown,that he may now have or hereafter acquire in those products identified in exhibit b,including without limitation any design drawings.exhibit b included product.consequently,after november of mariol no longer had the right to develop or market the latch.
in february of mariol,who was consulting with evenflo juvenile furniture evenflo on a project to develop a collapsible playyard,faxed evenflo a latch drawing entitled joint version.kohus alleges that this drawing is substantially similar to the latch.
in january of mariol became a contractor for kolcraft enterprises,where he was assigned to assist another engineer in developing a collapsible playyard.mariol and his subsequently obtained two patents from the united states patent and trademark office pto on playyards they developed at kolcraft patent the patent,and patent the patent.both of the patent documents present identical drawings of a latch that kohus alleges was derived from,and substantially similar to,the latch.in kohus discovered the and patents while conducting patent searches on the internet,and he then applied for and received a certificate of registration on the latch.
mariol had,in his patent applications,attempted to establish a claim for the allegedly infringing latch,but the patent examiner had not allowed this and had required him to file that claim separately.mariol subsequently did so,though he amended the patent application with a supplemental information disclosure statement in which he explained to the pto that kohus had filed suit against him.in the supplemental disclosure mariol included the original drawings of the latch,though he had not asked kohus permission.the pto nevertheless rejected the claims in the patent application,finding that they were anticipated by the original drawings of the latch.
kohus filed this lawsuit on october,contending inter alia that three of mariol version,the patent drawing,and the identical patent substantially similar to the latch drawing,and that these three drawings violated his right to create derivatives of the latch drawing.the defendants subsequently filed for summary judgment,arguing that even if the drawings were substantially similar,kohus claims should fail because the defendants did not have access to the latch drawing.after the district court found that they did have access and rejected this motion,the defendants filed another motion for summary judgment,this time arguing that their drawings were not substantially similar to the latch drawing.the district court compared the drawings,and refused to consider the conflicting testimony of experts proffered by each side.it concluded that no reasonable trier of fact could find that the defendants drawings were substantially similar to the latch drawing,and held that since kohus substantial similarity argument failed,his derivative copying argument should also fail.kohus now appeals.
whether the latches depicted in the defendants drawings are substantially similar to the latch in kohus copyrighted drawinga.the applicable legal standard 
summary judgment is proper if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.in copyright infringement cases granting summary judgment,particularly in favor of a defendant,is a practice to be used sparingly,but a court may compare the two works and render a judgment for the defendant on the ground that as a matter of law a trier of fact would not be permitted to find substantial similarity.wickham knoxville int l energy exposition,cir citations omitted see also hoehling universal city studios,cir because substantial similarity is customarily an extremely close question of fact,summary judgment has traditionally been frowned upon in copyright litigation.citing arnstein porter,cir.
to succeed in a copyright infringement action,a plaintiff must establish that he or she owns the copyrighted creation,and that the defendant copied it.wickham,at.in the present case kohus ownership of the latch drawing is not disputed,and copying is the sole issue.
not all copying is actionable,however it is a constitutional requirement that a plaintiff bringing an infringement claim must prove copying of constituent elements of the work that are original.feist publ ns,rural.serv,d emphasis added see also id.at.originality remains the sine qua non of copyright accordingly,copyright protection may extend only to those components of a work that are original to the author.id.at.original means only that the work was independently created by the author as opposed to copied from other works,and that it possesses at least some minimal degree of creativity.consequently,before comparing similarities between two works a court should first identify and eliminate those elements that are unoriginal and therefore unprotected.this was the method used by the court in feist,in which a telephone company sued a publishing company that had reprinted some of its directory listings.the court noted that where factual compilations such as telephone books are involved,the only original elements are in selection and arrangement,id.at,and concluded that because the copied listings were taken from a white pages directory,devoid of even the slightest trace of creativity,they were not original and were not entitled to copyright protection.id.at.in sum,the court filtered out the unoriginal,unprotected elements,and then determined that there was nothing original to be protected.
in feist it was a given that the defendant had copied the plaintiff work.for cases like the one before us here,where there is no direct evidence of copying,a plaintiff may establish an inference of copying by showing access to the work by the defendant s and a substantial similarity between the two works at issue.ellis diffie,cir.in this case access has been established,and only substantial similarity is at issue.
courts have established various tests for the substantial similarity finding.the traditional approach is the ordinary observer or audience test,which requires the trier of fact to gauge the similarities of the two works solely on the basis of his net impression and without relying on expert analysis or dissection.id.at citation omitted see also melville nimmer david nimmer,nimmer on copyright e hereinafter nimmer.there are a number of difficulties with this approach,see nimmer e,and courts have undertaken various,by adding a prior step that does allow expert testimony and analytic dissection.see arnstein,at distinguishing two essential elements in a substantial similarity suit a that defendant copied from plaintiff copyrighted work and b that the copying assuming it to be proved went so far as to constitute improper appropriation and holding that expert testimony is appropriate under the first prong,but not under the second because the determination is to be made from the viewpoint of the ordinary observer sid marty krofft television,mcdonald,cir creating an alternate test the extrinsic test,in which expert testimony and analytic dissection may be employed to help the jury determine whether there has been copying of the expression of an idea rather than just the idea itself and the intrinsic test,in which expert testimony is not appropriate because the trier of fact must determine substantial similarity from the viewpoint of the ordinary reasonable person.
the sixth circuit has thus far not adopted a specific test for determining substantial similarity in copyright infringement cases,ellis,at,and this case presents an opportunity to do so.our criteria in establishing a test are faithfulness to the feist,and to our prior caselaw insofar as it is consistent with workability.
feist,as we have seen,favors an approach that involves reducing the comparison to elements that are original.the case does not mention the ordinary observer or audience test and it is not necessarily hostile to that test,nimmer requires that courts ask this question does the audience test give content to the court definition of infringing conduct as copying of constituent elements of the work that are original nimmer e b.we agree with nimmer conclusion to the extent that the audience test frustrates that goal,it must be discarded,limited,or tailored to meet the supreme court formulation.id.
though the sixth circuit has not adopted a specific test for substantial similarity,the case monogram models,industro motive,cir,obliquely endorsed a test,similar to that in arnstein the first step allows expert evidence and dissection,and the second requires the trier of fact to evaluate similarity from the viewpoint of the ordinary observer.the case implied the first step when it approved the use of expert testimony in determining practice that would be inappropriate if only the traditional ordinary observer test were involved.see id.at we find no error in permitting such expert testimony.see also nimmer e citing,inter alia,monogram models,to substantiate the claim that u nder the arnstein doctrine resort may properly be made to expert analysis.it endorsed the second step,the ordinary observer test,more overtly the question of infringement was dependent upon whether the ordinary reasonable person would fail to differentiate between the two works.monogram models,at quoting williams kaag,cir.
a approach that reconciles feist and monogram models is found in sturdza united arab emirates,the first step requires identifying which aspects of the artist work,if any,are protectible by copyright,id.at the second involves determining whether the allegedly infringing work is substantially similar to protectible elements of the artist work,id.at.we approve this method,and adopt it.
the essence of the first step is to filter out the unoriginal,unprotectible that were not independently created by the inventor,and that possess no minimal degree of creativity,see feist,at.a variety of analyses.it is axiomatic,to begin with,that mere abstract ideas are not protectible,but the expression of an idea is.see mazer stein.unlike a patent,a copyright gives no exclusive right to the art disclosed protection is given only to the expression of the the idea itself.b in no case does copyright protection for an original work of authorship extend to any idea.often helpful in distinguishing between the two is judge learned hand famous abstractions test,formulated in a case discussing plays 
upon any work,and especially upon a play,a great number of patterns of increasing generality will fit equally well,as more and more of the incident is left out.the last may perhaps be no more than the most general statement of what the play is about,and at times might consist only of its title but there is a point in this series of abstractions where they are no longer protected,since otherwise the playwright could prevent the use of his ideas,to which,apart from their expression,his property is never extended.
nichols universal pictures,cir.this test of course does not identify the dividing line in individual cases,but rather constitutes a methodological tool courts can use to identify the spectrum of options.in the present case we do not presume to establish a scheme of abstractions,and we leave that issue for the parties to develop before the district court.nevertheless,by way of example,an initial description of the latch would likely be quite hinge employing two flippers that cross over one another and share a common pivot point like scissors,each flipper fitting into a notch on the rail,and so on.in successive abstractions details like the shape of the steel enclosure would fall away,leaving the essentials,particularly the feature,intact.
next,in cases like this one,that involve a functional object rather than a creative work,it is necessary to eliminate those elements dictated by efficiency.see baker selden.w here the art that a science book teaches can not be used without employing the methods and diagrams used to illustrate the book,or such as are similar to them,such methods and diagrams are to be considered as necessary incidents to the art.emphasis added.to this end,the merger doctrine establishes that w hen there is essentially only one way to express an idea,the idea and its expression are inseparable,they merge,and copyright is no bar to copying that expression.concrete mach.classic lawn ornaments,cir.in the present case expert testimony will likely be required to establish what elements,if any,are necessary to the function of any latch designed for the upper arm of a collapsible playyard.
it is also important to filter out scenes a faire those elements that follow naturally from the work theme,rather than from the author creativity,nimmer f,or elements that are dictated by external factors such as particular business practices,computer mgmt.assistance robert decastro,cir.in the present case,possible external considerations could include standard industry practices for constructing latches,or safety standards established by organizations like the american society for testing materials and the juvenile products manufacturer association.
once the unprotectible elements have been filtered out,the second step is to determine whether the allegedly infringing work is substantially similar to the protectible elements of the original.we noted above that our monogram models case establishes that this determination should be based on the judgment of the ordinary reasonable person,the ordinary lay observer.see at.this standard,however,is in need of modification.
the ordinary observer test is based on the economic incentive view of copyright law,that the purpose of the copyright laws is to provid e creators with a financial incentive to create for the ultimate benefit of the public.dawson hinshaw music,cir see also mazer,at.the economic philosophy behind the clause empowering congress to grant patents and copyrights is the conviction that encouragement of individual effort by personal gain is the best way to advance public welfare through the talents of authors and inventors in science and useful arts.the test was designed for cases where the lay audience purchases the product at issue,and where the lay audience untutored judgment determines whether the product will sell.see arnstein,at the question,therefore,is whether defendant took from plaintiff works so much of what is pleasing to the ears of lay listeners,who comprise the audience for whom such popular music is composed,that defendant wrongfully appropriated something which belongs to the plaintiff.dawson,at noting that in arnstein t he lay listener reaction is r
