escape media group escape operates an internet service called grooveshark through which users may upload and retrieve digital music files.umg recordings,owns an extensive music catalog that includes songs by such artists as buddy holly,the jackson,marvin gaye,and the who.in,umg sued escape in the supreme court of the state of new york,alleging escape infringed on copyrights afforded by new york common law by reproducing,copyrighted sound recordings,storing them on its servers,and distributing copies to other users,to its own profit.escape denied liability,asserting its conduct was permissible under federal copyright law.
digital music news digital publishes the online newsletter digital music news,which focuses on the digital music industry.in,digital music news reported that a music artist unaffiliated with umg had also accused escape of copyright infringement.
the article was followed by approximately reader comments,two of which are of interest here.in them,a reader identified only as visitor represented he or she was an escape employee and routinely received direct orders from the top to upload music to its servers,where it was stored and made available to third party users and never removed,even if artists or music labels complained.
under the auspices of the supreme court of the state of new york,county of new york,escape served a subpoena on digital which is not a party to the litigation between umg and escape,seeking visitor identity.when digital refused to comply,escape petitioned the los angeles superior court pursuant to the interstate and international depositions and discovery act,code of civil procedure section,et,for enforcement.the court ordered digital to comply with the subpoena,from which order digital now appeals.
digital argues information identifying visitor will not reasonably lead to the discovery of admissible evidence in the new york lawsuit and is protected by visitor right to privacy.we agree with both contentions,and will therefore issue a writ of mandate directing the trial court to vacate its order enforcing escape subpoena.
statement of facts 
the new york lawsuit 
grooveshark enables third party users to upload,share,download and stream files containing audio recordings.on january,umg sued escape in new york state court for state common law copyright infringement and unfair competition,alleging escape enabled and encouraged grooveshark users to upload unauthorized copies of umg recordings to grooveshark,which escape then copied to its servers and subsequently distributed to other grooveshark users.umg recordings escape media group supreme.new york county.
escape denied the allegations and asserted a number of affirmative defenses and counterclaims.among other defenses,escape claimed immunity under the digital millennium copyright act dmca,which shields from federal copyright infringement liability an internet service provider that hosts solely third party user materials,so long as it promptly removes copyrighted materials when it becomes aware of the infringement a c.on april,this defense was ordered stricken by the appellate division of the supreme court of new york on the ground that dmca affords immunity only against federal copyright claims,not state common law claims.umg,escape media group.dep t.in its answer,escape also asserted counterclaims for interference with escape contracts,interference with its business relations,and conduct,alleging umg caused other companies to end their business relationships with escape 
in october,digital music news reported on an email exchange between escape executives and a member of a rock band who had complained that grooveshark illegally hosted the band copyrighted recordings and refused to take them down.in the comments section of this article,visitor claimed to work for grooveshark and stated the administration required employees to upload files to the grooveshark database,which contradicted escape claim that it hosted solely third party recordings as permitted by the dmca.the next day,visitor commented that although grooveshark administrators purported to remove copyrighted music when record labels and artists complained,the music was not actually deleted but merely put on backup,to be made available at a later time,when the complaining party attention turned elsewhere.visitor stated the music was in fact never deleted t o confirm the fears of complaining musicians,there is no way in hell you can get your stuff down.
the subpoena and enforcement 
on january,escape served digital with a subpoena in the new york action for the production of business records,seeking information concerning visitor identity and communications between digital and umg concerning,or documents relating to,escape,grooveshark,or the october digital music news article.digital objected to the subpoena and notified escape that any information about visitor identity had been deleted as part of digital routine business practice of periodically overwriting data.
on march,escape petitioned the los angeles county superior court to enforce the subpoena under the interstate and international depositions and discovery act,code of civil procedure section et digital opposed the petition,arguing the subpoena was moot because any information that would identify visitor had been overwritten,enforcement of the subpoena would infringe on the first amendment rights of digital and visitor,and disclosure would violate california journalist shield law cal,art.i,subd.b,in reply,escape argued digital had no basis for refusing to comply with the subpoena because the first amendment does not protect false and defamatory anonymous speech.
although digital denied any discoverable material remained on its servers,the trial court found a possibility existed that fragmented data identifying visitor might yet be retrieved.the court also found escape established a prima facie case that visitor comments were libelous,and thus unprotected by the first amendment.the court concluded visitor identity was therefore discoverable and ordered digital to comply with the subpoena 
the trial court subsequently issued a supplemental order addressing the compliance process.the court ordered escape to purchase and provide digital with a backup server,and ordered digital to preserve a virtual machine image of its server on the backup server and make the image available to a third party forensic examiner under court supervision.the examiner would first indicate to digital whether any identifying information was present and then reveal such information to escape if directed to do so by the court.escape would pay all expenses related to the data preservation and inspection.once the inspection was complete,the backup server would be expunged of any material 
digital timely appealed both orders and we issued a writ of supersedeas staying discovery.pursuant to our request,the parties submitted supplemental letter briefs addressing whether section and the california constitution right of privacy preclude discovery of visitor identity.

standard of review 
pursuant to the interstate and international depositions and discovery act,a party to a proceeding in a foreign jurisdiction may obtain discovery in california by retaining a local attorney to issue a subpoena.if a dispute arises relating to the subpoena,any party may petition the superior court where the discovery is to be conducted for a protective order or an order enforcing,quashing,or modifying the subpoena.such an order may be reviewed only by petition to the court of appeal for an extraordinary writ,subd.a.although digital filed an appeal here,we deem the appeal to be a writ petition.

the facts of consequence in the new york lawsuit between umg and escape may be found in umg complaint and escape affirmative defenses and counterclaims.
in the new york lawsuit,umg alleges escape infringed on its common law copyrights and engaged in unfair competition.a copyright infringement cause of action in new york consists of two elements the existence of a valid copyright and unauthorized reproduction of the work protected by the copyright.capitol records,naxos of.a cause of action for unfair competition predicated on copyright infringement,in addition to unauthorized copying and distribution requires competition in the marketplace or similar actions designed for commercial benefit citations,or deception of the public citation.id.at.umg alleges escape enables and encourages its users to upload digital copies of umg recordings to grooveshark,then copies those recordings to its servers and distributes them to other users.by doing so,escape infringes on umg copyrights and unfairly competes with umg for commercial benefit.
in its answer,escape denies the allegations and contends its conduct is permitted under the dmca.title ii of that act provides in pertinent part a service provider shall not be liable for infringement of copyright by reason of transmission or storage of transitory digital information so long as the transmission or storage is done at the direction of a person other than the service provider,is carried out through an automatic technical process without selection of the material by the service provider,and does not result in copies of the material being maintained on the system or network for a longer period than is reasonably necessary for the transmission.a b.to enjoy this immunity,a service provider who becomes aware of infringing material on its network must respond expeditiously to remove,or disable access to,the material.c c.as stated above,escape dmca defense was ordered stricken by the appellate division of the new york supreme court.
escape also counterclaims for interference with its contracts and business relations and conduct.under new york law,t o sustain a claim for tortious interference with a contract,it must be established that a valid contract existed which a third party knew about,the third party intentionally and improperly procured the breach of the contract,and the breach resulted in damage to the plaintiff.ullmannglass oneida.where there has been no breach of an existing contract,but only interference with prospective contract rights,the plaintiff must show the defendant conduct amounted to a crime or an independent tort.carvel noonan.escape alleges umg has engaged in a legal jihad in which it coerces third party companies to breach their contracts with escape and terminate beneficial relationships,the goal being to destroy escape by cutting off its sources of revenue.
it was not readily apparent to us how the identity of visitor,who,similar to umg,claimed escape routinely violated copyrights on sound recordings,would lead to admissible evidence refuting umg allegations or supporting escape defenses or counterclaims.we therefore asked escape to explain in a supplemental brief how discovery of visitor identity was reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
escape first states without elaboration that visitor identity is most assuredly relevant to escape dmca defense.this is a conclusion,not an explanation,much less a showing of specific facts demonstrating discovery of visitor identity is reasonably calculated to lead to admissible evidence.to establish its dmca defense escape would have had to prove,among other things,that it removes copyrighted material when informed of an infringement.escape fails to explain how the identity of visitor who claims the opposite would lead to evidence supporting the defense.
in any event,escape dmca defense was ordered stricken by the appellate division of the new york state supreme court,which held the defense immunizes a service provider only from federal copyright claims,not state common law claims such as those at issue here.the defense therefore raises no currently disputed fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action,rendering visitor comments irrelevant.
escape insists that the viability of its dmca defense is far from resolved with either finality or certainty,because in capitol records vimeo.lexis vimeo,the united states district court for the southern district of new york certified an interlocutory appeal on the dmca immunity issue to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit.but this merely establishes the possibility that escape dmca defense might someday be reinstated assuming the second circuit accepts the vimeo appeal,and rules dmca immunity applies to state common law claims,and escape moves on that basis to reinstate its dmca defense,and the new york supreme court grants the motion.speculation about a possibility does not constitute reasonable calculation that discovery will lead to evidence concerning a fact currently in dispute.
escape next argues visitor comments are relevant to any claim by umg that escape may be secondarily liable for infringement of umg copyrights.escape argues it must identify visitor as a predicate to exposing the anonymous comments as false,which will refute any allegation that escape knew about or supervised direct infringement of umg copyrights by escape employees.
the argument is meritless.first,umg makes no allegation pertaining to secondary liability based on the conduct of escape employees.rather,it alleges escape enables grooveshark users to upload music,which is then copied,stored,and distributed to other users.relevant evidence means evidence having any tendency in reason to prove or disprove any disputed fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action,italics added.escape operation of grooveshark in the manner umg alleges is not in dispute,as escape expressly admitted the practice in its answer.the only issue is whether the practice violates umg copyrights,which is a question of law,not fact.although escape contends visitor comments are untrue,that quarrel is of no consequence to the determination of umg lawsuit 
even if umg had alleged perhaps in response to escape dmca defense that escape employees personally uploaded copyrighted music to grooveshark database and refused to take it down when asked,e
