neil gaiman brought suit under the copyright act against todd mcfarlane and corporations controlled by him that we can ignore,seeking a declaration that he gaiman owns copyrights jointly with mcfarlane in certain characters.merchant levy,cir zuill shanahan,cir shapiro,bernstein jerry vogel music,cir.he sought additional relief under the act,other provisions of federal law,and state law,as well.the case was tried to a jury,which brought in a verdict for gaiman.the judge entered a judgment that declared gaiman to be the of the characters in question,ordered mcfarlane to so designate gaiman on undistributed copies in which these characters appear,provided modest monetary relief in respect of gaiman supplemental claim for damages for breach of his right of publicity,and ordered an accounting of the profits that mcfarlane has obtained that are rightfully gaiman.the accounting is not yet complete,and so the judgment is not final mcfarlane appeal is therefore limited to the injunction requiring him to acknowledge gaiman.
mcfarlane contends that a reasonable jury would not have rejected his statute of limitations defense and that in any event two of the characters at issue are not copyrightable.the parties agree that the alternative defense,the defense of uncopyrightability,is strictly an issue for the court.we have found only a handful of appellate cases addressing the issue,and they are split.matthew bender west publishing,cir,and north coast industries jason maxwell,cir,hold that copyrightability is a mixed question of law and fact,at least when it depends as it usually does on originality,and that it is therefore an issue for the jury or other factfinder.but yankee candle bridgewater candle,cir,and our own publications int l,meredith,cir,along with a number of district court cases,collezione europa,hillsdale house,d,newton diamond,d,hold that copyrightability is always an issue of law.whether a particular work is copyrightable is,which argues against treating the question as one of law,but tugging the other way is the concern that property rights not be placed at the mercy of a jury.a nice issue,but this is not an apt occasion on which to reexamine our resolution of it in publications int 
gaiman,in which he is joined by a company controlled by him,is from the dismissal of his auxiliary claim for breach of contract.the is contingent on our reversing the copyright judgment,since gaiman seeks no additional relief on his contract claim it just a backstop to his copyright claim.
we need to do some stage setting.gaiman and mcfarlane are both celebrated figures in the world of comic books,but they play different though overlapping roles.gaiman just writes scripts mcfarlane writes scripts too,but he also illustrates and publishes the comic books.in,shortly after forming his own publishing house,mcfarlane began publishing a series of comic books entitled spawn,which at first he wrote and illustrated himself.spawn,more precisely hellspawn,are officers in an army of the damned commanded by a devil named malebolgia,who hopes one day to launch his army against heaven.the leading character in the series is a man named al simmons,who is dead but has returned to the world of the living as a hellspawn.
al story is an affecting one.born in a quiet neighborhood outside of pittsburgh,he was recruited by the cia and eventually became a member of an elite military unit that guards the president.he saved the president from an assassin bullet and was rewarded with a promotion to lieutenant colonel.he was placed under the command of jason wynn,who became his mentor and inducted him into the sinister inner recesses of the intelligence community.when al began to question wynn motives,wynn sent two agents,significantly named chapel and priest,to kill al with laser weapons,and they did,burning him beyond recognition.al was buried with great fanfare in arlington national cemetery.
now al had always had an achilles heel,namely that he loved his wife beyond bearing and so,dying,he vowed that he would do anything to see her again.malebolgia took him at his word would do anything and returned al to earth.but a deal with the devil is always a faustian pact.al discovered that he was now one of malebolgia handpicked hellspawn and had been remade a full makeover,as we see and infused with energy.
returned to earth in his new persona,al discovers that his wife has remarried his best friend,who was able to give her the child he never could.he absorbs the blow but thirsts for revenge against jason wynn.he bides his time,living with homeless people and pondering the unhappy fact that once he exhausts his energy he will be returned to malebolgia domain and become a slave in an army of the damned with no hope of redemption.he must try somehow to break his pact with the devil.
the early issues in the series were criticized for bad writing,so mcfarlane decided to invite four top writers each to write the script for one issue of spawn.one of those invited was gaiman.he accepted the invitation and wrote the script for spawn issue.their contract,made in,was oral.there was no mention of copyright,nor,for that matter,of how gaiman would be compensated for his work,beyond mcfarlane assuring gaiman that he would treat him better than the big guys did.the reference was to the two leading comic book publishers,marvel comics not to be confused with gaiman company,marvels and miracles and dc comics,for which gaiman and other writers write on a work made for hire basis.this means that the publishers own the copyrights on their work.b.
it might seem that when mcfarlane told gaiman that he would treat gaiman better than the big guys did,he just meant he compensate him more generously for work made for hire.but mcfarlane rightly does not argue this.gaiman work for him was not work made for hire.it was neither work created by an employee within the scope of his employment nor a work specially ordered or commissioned for use as a contribution to a collective work,as a part of a motion picture or other audiovisual work,as a translation,as a supplementary work,as a compilation,as an instructional text,as a test,as answer material for a test,or as an atlas,if the parties expressly agree in a written instrument signed by them that the work shall be considered a work made for hire.there was no written agreement between gaiman and mcfarlane,and gaiman was not an employee of mcfarlane.
now it is true that a commissioned work not falling under may be deemed a work for hire under if,for example,the commissioning party pays the author a monthly stipend,pays health and other fringe benefits during the time the author works on the project,and exercises overall though not necessarily daily supervision.see community for creative reid,d saenger organization,nationwide ins.licensing associates,cir.the work for hire concept is limited to formal employment because a functionally identical relationship can be created by skillful drafting of contracts that purport to treat the de facto employee as an independent contractor.the work for hire provision is not unique in sensibly forgoing a definition of employee or employment and by doing so empowering the courts to define these terms from case to case on a practical rather than formal basis,using the principles of agency law to prevent evasion of the statutory purpose,clackamas gastroenterology associates,wells,d eeoc sidley austin brown wood,cir.but there is nothing to suggest that gaiman ever became a de facto employee of mcfarlane.and while gaiman could have assigned to mcfarlane his copyright in any work he did under the oral contract,copyright assignments must be in writing,a schiller schmidt,nordisco,cir,and there was no written assignment.
in his script for spawn,gaiman introduced three new spawn as he was later called by had not named it and in the issue he is just referred to as a spawn,with no further identifier,angela no last name,and count nicholas cogliostro.gaiman described,named,and wrote the dialogue for them,but mcfarlane drew them.gaiman contends that he and mcfarlane are joint owners of the copyrights on the three characters by reason of their respective contributions to joint indivisible work.seshadri kasraian,cir erickson trinity theatre,cir thomson larson,cir.mcfarlane concedes gaiman joint ownership of angela,but not of the other two we postpone our consideration of the issue until we have disposed of the statute of limitations defense,to which we now turn.evaluation of the defense requires us to consider a chain of events running from the contract was made and spawn,which states on its inside cover that it is copyrighted by mcfarlane actually by one of his companies,but that is immaterial,was.
spawn was a huge success,selling more than a million copies.mcfarlane paid gaiman for his work on it.gaiman testified that this was about what he would have expected to receive from dc comics had he written the script of spawn for that company as a work made for hire.
because angela was a big hit with spawn readers,mcfarlane asked gaiman to do a of three issues starring her,which he did.he also wrote several pages for spawn to form a bridge to the angela series because angela had appeared in spawn through,gaiman was concerned that readers would not realize that angela was an offshoot of spawn.mcfarlane paid gaiman for his contribution to spawn and more than the exact amount is not in the record for the angela series.only one of these four issues the second angela contains a copyright notice the notice is similar to the one in spawn.
the angela series was first published in.the following year,having created a toy company to manufacture statuettes action figures of spawn characters,one a statuette of medieval spawn,mcfarlane mailed gaiman a check for designated as royalties,presumably on sales of the statuette,though the record is unclear.
mcfarlane subsequently licensed the publication of paperback books that reprinted the comic books to which gaiman had contributed.the books carry a copyright notice similar to the one in spawn and angela except that it adds that all related characters are also copyrighted by mcfarlane.besides inserting the copyright notices that we mentioned,mcfarlane applied to the register of copyrights for,and received,copyright registrations on these issues and books.
in,learning that mcfarlane might sell his enterprise,gaiman decided that he needed the protection of a written contract and he asked mcfarlane for one.mcfarlane agreed to give him a written contract and also to pay him royalties for a statuette of angela that mcfarlane toy company had manufactured and sold.
after desultory negotiations,gaiman lawyer wrote a letter to mcfarlane negotiator stating that gaiman had created the characters of medieval spawn,angela,and cogliostro not as work for hire but pursuant to the terms of an oral agreement under which mcfarlane agreed that gaiman would be compensated on the same terms as set forth in gaiman dc comics agreements dated august.this was a surprising interpretation of the oral agreement,since in it mcfarlane had promised to treat gaiman better than dc comics treated him but as nothing turns on this interpretation we ignore it.the letter goes on to demand that mcfarlane immediately forward all monies which are currently owed to gaiman in accordance with the terms of the dc agreement.we call this the demand letter.
direct negotiations between gaiman and mcfarlane ensued.a tentative agreement was reached that mcfarlane would pay royalties on the statuettes on the same terms as gaiman would have gotten from dc comics but that gaiman would exchange his rights in medieval spawn and cogliostro for mcfarlane rights in another comic book character,miracleman.once the exchange was made,gaiman would no longer receive royalties on medieval spawn and cogliostro.
for the rest of and,mcfarlane sent gaiman royalty checks totaling about,presumably on account of the statuettes and the paperback books,together with royalty reports that referred to gaiman as a of medieval spawn,angela,and cogliostro.on february,however,gaiman received a letter from mcfarlane announcing that mcfarlane was officially rescind ing any previous offers i have placed on the table.the letter offered gaiman the following deal on a basis gaiman would relinquish all rights to angela in exchange for all rights to miracle man,and all rights to medieval spawn and cogliostro shall continue to be owned by todd mcfarlane productions.
the statement all rights to medieval spawn and cogliostro shall continue to be owned by todd mcfarlane productions was an unambiguous denial of gaiman copyright interest and therefore is the last date on which his claim could have accrued and the copyright statute of limitations,b,thus have begun to run.this suit was brought in january of month short of three years after gaiman receipt of mcfarlane letter.by the time of trial,spawn was up to issue and had spawned a large number of derivative works,including posters,trading cards,clothing,the statuettes,an animated series on hbo,video games,and a motion picture.many of these derivative works include all three characters to which gaiman contributed,so that the financial stakes in the case are considerable.
a minor wrinkle concerning the statute of limitations defense is that gaiman suit is not a suit for infringement.gaiman concedes that mcfarlane also owns copyright in the characters in issue.the claim rejected by mcfarlane is that gaiman is a,along with mcfarlane.a.as a,mcfarlane was not violating the copyright act by unilaterally publishing the jointly owned work,but,as in any other case of conversion or misappropriation,he would have to account to the other joint owner for the latter share of the profits.zuill shanahan,supra,at.when is conceded and the only issue therefore is the contractual,or in the absence of contract the equitable,division of the profits from the copyrighted work,there is no issue of copyright law and the suit for an accounting of profits therefore arises under state rather than federal law.goodman lee,cir oddo ries,and cir mountain states properties,robinson.it is just like a suit to enforce a copyright license,which arises under state law rather than under the copyright act.saturday evening post rumbleseat press,cir harms eliscu,cir friendly,international armor limousine moloney coachbuilders,cir.and in that event the applicable statute of limitations would be state rather than federal.
but more is involved in this case.as in zuill shanahan,supra,at,and also merchant levy,supra,at,and goodman lee,cir,gaiman seeks a declaration that he is a,which depends on whether his contribution to the characters in question gave him a copyright interest.that question,on the answer to which his entitlement to an accounting and other relief depends,can not be answered without reference to the copyright act,and it therefore arises under the act.smith kansas city title trust.as we said in saturday evening post rumbleseat press,supra,at,the principle that disputes over the terms of copyright licenses do not arise under federal law has an exception for cases where establishing the plaintiff right will require interpreting federal law.one can imagine,if barely,a case in which,though federal jurisdiction would lie because a copyright issue was unavoidable,the heart of the case lay elsewhere and a more suitable statute of limitations than the one in the copyright act could be found.but this is not such a case.the question whether gaiman has a copyright is central,and the act statute of limitations,which applies to any suit arising under the act,and not just to a suit for infringement for section b reads no civil action shall be maintained under the provisions of this title unless it is commenced within three years after the claim accrued,is therefore,as the parties agree,clearly applicable to this case.
the parties also rightly agree that the copyright statute of limitations starts to run when the plaintiff learns,or should as a reasonable person have learned,that the defendant was violating his rights,taylor meirick,cir,in this case by repudiating gaiman ownership of copyright.aalmuhammed lee,cir merchant levy,supra,at,zuill shanahan,supra,at.mcfarlane claims that gaiman knew,or certainly should have known,no later than when gaiman lawyer wrote the demand letter from which we quoted,that mcfarlane was denying that gaiman had any copyright interest in the three mcfarlane had in effect appropriated gaiman copyright interest.actually mcfarlane thinks that gaiman copyright claim accrued a lot when spawn was published with a copyright notice that did not mention gaiman.it does matter if gaiman claim accrued before february,the suit is untimely.
mcfarlane argument,however,reflects a misunderstanding of both the function of copyright notice and the nature of the copyright in a compilation.the function of copyright notice is to warn off copiers,d,b,a fantastic fakes,pickwick international,cir fleischer studios,ralph freundlich,cir,not to start the statute of limitations running.there may be situations in which the notice just happens to put a copyright owner on notice that someone is acting in derogation of his rights.remember that a claim inconsistent with the copyright holder interest sets the statute running,and in particular circumstances a notice indicating that the defendant was the sole copyright holder might amount to such a claim.saenger organization,nationwide ins.licensing associates,supra,at.but not when the work is a compilation,as spawn plainly is.for it contains,besides gaiman contributions and goodness knows who else,a column containing a number of signed letters from fans plus art work contributed by fans.as mcfarlane concedes,the copyrights on those letters and on the art work are owned by the fans and his copyrighting the issue is not a claim to own their copyrights.
the creator of a compilation is entitled to copyright it as long as it a work formed by the collection and assembling of preexisting materials or of data that are selected,coordinated,or arranged in such a way that the resulting work as a whole constitutes an original work of authorship.see also.the compiler copyright entitles him to reprint the contents of the compilation in future editions of the compilation.c new york times tasini,d.but all the other rights of copyright remain in the authors of the contributions,provided the contributions satisfy the criteria of copyrightability.therefore the compiler copyright notice is not adverse to the contributors copyrights and so does not put them on notice that their rights are being challenged.on the contrary,a single copyright notice applicable to the collective work as a whole serves to indicate protection for all the contributions in the collective work,except for advertisements,regardless of the ownership of copyright in the individual contributions and whether they have been published previously.united states copyright office,circular copyright notice see sanga music,emi blackwood music,cir abend mca,cir,aff under the name stewart abend,d.
there is a close analogy to the doctrine of adverse possession in the law of physical property.that doctrine extinguishes the paper title if the property is occupied under an adverse claim of right for the statutory period.if the claim is not adverse,as where a tenant occupies the owner,even more to the point,where a cotenant occupies property,because a joint copyright owner is a cotenant,zuill shanahan,supra,at childress taylor,cir the statute of limitations does not begin to run.howell bradford,so d,per curiam fantasia schmuck,per curiam evans covington,chicago,peoria louis ry.tice.no more does it begin to run when the claim to the copyright is a compiler claim,because such a claim is not adverse to the contributor copyright.
the copyright notices in the paperback books,that claim copyright for mcfarlane in all related characters might seem to be an example of our earlier point that there may be cases in which a copyright notice denies a contributor copyright.but unless there is a duty of authors to read the copyright pages of works containing their copyrighted there is since as we said the purpose of copyright notice is not to affect the time within which the victim of an infringement can sue which is why there is no duty of authors to study copyright notices,the notice can affect the accrual of the cause of action only if the victim reads it.the jury was entitled to believe gaiman testimony that he had never seen the paperback books in which the suspicious notices appeared.
in addition to the copyright notices,mcfarlane registered copyright on the issues and the books.but to suppose that by doing so he provided notice to gaiman of his exclusive claim to the characters is again untenable.authors do consult the records of the copyright office to see whether someone has asserted copyright in their works and anyway mcfarlane registrations no more revealed an intent to claim copyright in gaiman contributions,as distinct from mcfarlane own contributions as compiler and illustrator,than the copyright notices did.the significance of registration is that it is a prerequisite to a suit to enforce a copyright.more precisely,an application to register must be filed,and either granted or refused,before suit can be brought.a.there is an interesting question,left open in our recent decision in chicago bd.of education substance,cir,and unnecessary to decide in this case either,whether if registration is granted by mistake the registrant may nonetheless sue.all that is important in this case is that it is no more the purpose of registration to start statutes of limitations running than it is the purpose of the copyright notice itself to do so.
we are therefore led to question the suggestion in saenger organization,nationwide ins.licensing associates,supra,at,that registration provides constructive notice of a claim of ownership.that would not,to repeat,matter in a case such as this in which the registered work is a compilation.but it probably would matter in any case.we further note that there was actual as well as constructive notice in saenger.for one thing,the court was wrong to say that registration gives constructive notice.what the act actually says is that recording a document in the copyright office gives constructive notice of the facts in the document if the document identifies a registered work.c.the purpose is to establish priority in the event of disputes,in bankruptcy court or elsewhere,over creditors rights.in re world auxiliary power,cir broadcast music,hirsch,cir melville nimmer david nimmer,nimmer on copyright.a creditor who wants to know whether he can seize a debtor copyright consults the register a does not.
there is also nothing in the demand letter that gaiman lawyer wrote mcfarlane to indicate that gaiman believed mcfarlane was denying gaiman joint ownership of the copyrights on the three characters.the issue of copyright ownership is distinct from that of the copyright owner entitlement to royalties when,as in this case,he is not the publisher of the copyrighted work.the fact that the author owns the copyright does determine how he and the publisher will divide the income from the sale of copies of the work.that is a matter of contract.sometimes author and publisher disagree over the meaning of their contract and it is the contract that will specify the division of income or whether the publisher is adhering to the contract in good faith.disagreement was especially likely here,where the parties contract not only was oral but failed to specify the division of income beyond what could be inferred from mcfarlane promise to treat gaiman better than the big guys in particular,it seems,dc comics treated gaiman.
the existence of a dispute over the terms of a publication contract does not alert the author to a challenge to his copyright.quite the contrary,it presumes that he owns the copyright.if his work is in the public domain,the publisher could publish it without the author permission,so would hardly be likely to have promised to pay him for the right to publish would already have along with the rest of the world the right to publish it.sending the kind of demand letter that gaiman lawyer sent no more suggests doubt about the legal basis for the demand than sending a collection letter,of which the demand letter was a variant,suggests doubt that the writer is entitled to the debt that he is seeking to collect.
there was other evidence that right up until mcfarlane letter,receipt of which clearly did start the statute of limitations running,he acknowledged or at least did deny gaiman ownership of copyrights in the three characters.there was the reference in the royalty reports to gaiman being the of the characters,the fact that mcfarlane let pass without comment gaiman claim in the demand letter to have created the characters,and the payment to gaiman of royalties on the statuettes,payment that would make most sense if they were derivative works of copyrighted gaiman the joint owner of the copyrights.mcfarlane argues that he could have given gaiman these royalties pursuant to contract,and he points out that under gaiman work for hire agreement with dc comics gaiman received payments denominated as royalties even though he had no copyrights.but mcfarlane also contends that dc comics would not have paid gaiman royalties on the statuettes,so what would have been gaiman entitlement to such royalties from him unless gaiman had a copyright interest 
we have referred to statements and actions by mcfarlane that seem positively to acknowledge gaiman copyrights,and these sort of lulling comments might seem to suggest an alternative basis for rejecting mcfarlane statute of limitations doctrine of equitable estoppel.hentosh herman finch university of health chicago medical school,cir singletary continental illinois national bank trust,cir buttry general signal,cir.but that is a tolling doctrine,not an accrual doctrine,and tolling doctrines do not automatically give a person the full statutory period for suit.cada baxter healthcare,cir.suppose the claim accrued in year and the statute of limitations is three years,but because of lulling comments by the violator the victim does learn of his claim until year.he can not just sit on his haunches until year,because his claim did not accrue in year he must sue as soon as it is feasible to do so.
or so,at least,some cases hold.shropshear corporation counsel,cir products american home products,cir illinois law butler mayer,brown platt,d.others,distinguishing equitable estoppel,where the defendant is responsible for the plaintiff delay,from equitable tolling,where he is not,hold that in the former case though not the latter the plaintiff can subtract the entire period of the delay induced by the defendant,or in other words can extend the statutory period by the full amount of the delay.doe blue cross blue shield united of wisconsin,cir ott,cir.at least one case takes a middle position the plaintiff is presumptively entitled to subtract the entire period.buttry general signal,supra,at.
we need try to untangle this knot.for while gaiman waited the full statutory period minus a month to sue,without an excuse that would entitle him to invoke a tolling doctrine that requires due diligence,he does need an excuse because the jury found that his claim did not accrue more than three years before he sued.
the case for rejecting the statute of limitations defense was not open and shut.gaiman was an experienced author,and may have smelled a rat early on.the jury could have disbelieved his denial that he saw the related characters copyright notices in the paperback books.and the fact that he was content with compensation no greater than what he received from dc comics for work made for hire allows an inference that the real deal between him and mcfarlane was that mcfarlane would own the copyrights but pay gaiman as well as or better than dc comics,which also owned the copyrights on gaiman work,did.if better,then maybe paying him royalties on the statuettes was mcfarlane method of treating gaiman better than dc comics did.but all this is just to say that it was a close case.we can not say that the jury was unreasonable to find that not until february of was gaiman placed on notice that mcfarlane was denying that gaiman had copyrights on the three characters,and thus to reject the statute of limitations defense.
but we must consider mcfarlane alternative ground for medieval spawn and cogliostro are not copyrightable.partial reversal,actually,because mcfarlane concedes that gaiman is a joint owner of angela.this ground may seem inconsistent with mcfarlane contention that the all related characters copyright notice established that he,not gaiman,owned the copyrights on medieval spawn and cogliostro.if they were not copyrightable,mcfarlane had no copyright in them.in fact,it became apparent at argument that mcfarlane thinks that he owns copyright on them but that gaiman does.his theory seems to be that they became copyrightable,after spawn was published,as a result of further work done on them by him.we think they were copyrightable from the start,and that gaiman owns the copyrights jointly with mcfarlane.to explain this we must say more about the characters,black and white pictures of whom we append to this opinion.a detailed description of the characters may be found,along with color pictures,at http.
mcfarlane original spawn,al simmons,was a tall figure clad in what looks like spandex it is actually a neural parasite beneath a huge cloak,making him a kind of malevolent superman figure,although actually rather weak and stupid.his face is a shiny plastic oval with eyeholes but no other features.gaiman decided to begin spawn with a different spawn,whom he called olden days spawn.he explained to mcfarlane that olden days spawn rides up on a huge horse.he wearing a kind of spawn suit and mask,although the actual costume under the cloak is reminiscent of a suit of armour.mcfarlane drew olden days spawn as in the words of his brief essentially spawn,only he dressed him as a knight from the middle ages with a shield bearing the spawn logo.to make him credibly medieval,gaiman in his script has olden days spawn say to a damsel in apparent distress,good day,sweet maiden.the damsel is none other than angela,a maiden only in the sense of making her maiden appearance in spawn.angela is in fact a warrior angel and villain who,scantily clad in a dominatrix outfit,quickly dispatches the unsuspecting olden days spawn with her lance.
we learn that this event occurred in the thirteenth century,and the scene now shifts to the present day.angela is dressed as a modern professional woman.the al simmons spawn is lurking about in an alley and it is here that we meet count cogliostro for the first time.mcfarlane had wanted a character who would be basically the wisened sic sage that could sort of come down and give all the information and assimilate it.gaiman interpreted this as an instruction to create a character who can talk to spawn and tell him a little bit more about what going on in the background and can move the story along.so he created an old man,who starts talking to spawn and then telling him all these sort of things about spawn super powers that spawn could have known.and when you first meet him cogliostro in the alley you think he a drunken bum with the rest of them,and then we realize no,he not.he some kind of mysterious stranger who knows things.
gaiman further described cogliostro in a draft of spawn as a really old bum,a skinny,balding old man,with a grubby beard,like a skinny santa claus.he calls himself count nicholas cagliostro later spelled cogliostro.in a brief scene,cogliostro,drawn by mcfarlane as an old man with a long grey beard who faintly resembles had been dissatisfied with gaiman verbal description,which made cogliostro sound like a to some of the powers of hellspawn of which simmons is unaware.cogliostro displays his mysterious wisdom by calling him simmons,to the latter could cogliostro have known angela then appears in her dominatrix costume,there is another duel,and she vanquishes simmons whose powers are in fact unimpressive,but does not kill him.he then blows himself up by accidentally pushing the wrong button on angela lance,which she had left behind.happily he is not it seems translated into another will reappear in subsequent issues of spawn.
mcfarlane makes two arguments for why gaiman does not have copyright in medieval spawn the name that mcfarlane settled on for olden days spawn or cogliostro.the first is that all that gaiman contributed was the idea for the characters,and ideas are not copyrightable,only expression is and the expression was due to mcfarlane drawing of the characters.it is true that people who contribute merely nonexpressive elements to a work are not copyright owners.as we said in seshadri kasraian,supra,at,the assistance that a research assistant or secretary or draftsman or helpfully commenting colleague provides in the preparation of a scholarly paper does not entitle the helper to claim the status of a joint author.there has to be some original expression contributed by anyone who claims to be a,and the rule we consider an exception momentarily is that his contribution must be independently copyrightable,erickson trinity theatre,supra,at aalmuhammed lee,supra,at william patry,copyright law and practice.had someone merely remarked to mcfarlane one day,you need a medieval spawn or you need an old guy to move the story forward,and mcfarlane had carried it from there,and if later a copyeditor had made some helpful editorial changes,neither the suggester nor the editor would be a joint owner.erickson trinity theatre,supra,at.otherwise almost every expressive work would be a jointly authored work,and copyright would explode.
but where two or more people set out to create a character jointly in such mixed media as comic books and motion pictures and succeed in creating a copyrightable character,it would be paradoxical if though the result of their joint labors had more than enough originality and creativity to be copyrightable,no one could claim copyright.that would be peeling the onion until it disappeared.the decisions that say,rightly in the generality of cases,that each contributor to a joint work must make a contribution that if it stood alone would be copyrightable were thinking of the case in which it could stand alone because of the nature of the particular creative process that had produced it.
here is a typical case from academe.one professor has brilliant ideas but ca write another is an excellent writer,but his ideas are commonplace.so they collaborate on an academic article,one contributing the ideas,which are not copyrightable,and the other the prose envelope,and unlike the situation in the superficially similar case of balkin wilson,they sign as coauthors.their intent to be the joint owners of the copyright in the article would be plain,and that should be enough to constitute them joint authors within the meaning of a.this is the valid core of the nimmers heretical suggestion that if authors a and b work in collaboration,but a contribution is limited to plot ideas that standing alone would not be copyrightable,and b weaves the ideas into a completed literary expression,it would seem that a and b are joint authors of the resulting work.nimmer nimmer,supra,see also patry,supra,at.
the contents of a comic book are typically the joint work of four writer,the penciler who creates the art work mcfarlane,the inker also mcfarlane,in the case of spawn,but it would often be a different person from the penciler who makes a black and white plate of the art work,and the colorist who colors it.the finished product is copyrightable,yet one can imagine cases in which none of the separate contributions of the four collaborating artists would be.the writer might have contributed merely a stock character not copyrightable,as we about to see that achieved the distinctiveness required for copyrightability only by the combined contributions of the penciler,the inker,and the colorist,with each contributing too little to have by his contribution alone carried the stock character over the line into copyright land.
mcfarlane second argument against the copyrightability of medieval spawn and cogliostro appeals to the confusingly named doctrine of scènes à faire literally scenes for action,a theatrical term meaning the climactic scene in a play or opera,which is not the legal meaning.related to the fundamental dichotomy that we already mentioned,the doctrine teaches that a copyright owner ca prove infringement by pointing to features of his work that are found in the defendant work as well but that are so rudimentary,commonplace,standard,or unavoidable that they do not serve to distinguish one work within a class of works from another.bucklew hawkins,ash,baptie,cir see also turtle wax,cir atari,north american philips consumer electronics,cir williams crichton,cir.if standard features could be used to prove infringement,not only would there be great confusion because it would be hard to know whether the alleged infringer had copied the feature from a copyrighted work or from the public domain,but the net of liability would be cast too wide authors would find it impossible to write without obtaining a myriad of copyright permissions.
