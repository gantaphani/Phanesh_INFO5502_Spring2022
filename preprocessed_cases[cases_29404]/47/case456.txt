buc filed suit against six defendants mls,iyc,william pazos,the florida yacht brokers association fyba,bradford yacht sales,and barbara tierney.buc primarily claimed that the six defendants had directly,vicariously,contributorily infringed upon its copyright in the selection,order,and arrangement of information contained in buc used boat price guide buc guide contained a centralized directory of recreational boat and yacht listings that potential buyers could access through a software application called the buc marine sales charter network 
several weeks before trial,buc entered into confidential settlement agreements with bradford,fyba,and tierney.the agreement with bradford was dated february,and required bradford to pay to buc in exchange for dismissal with prejudice of the lawsuit filed against it.the agreement with fyba and tierney was dated march,and required fyba and tierney to pay in total to buc through their respective insurance carriers for dismissal with prejudice of the lawsuit filed against them.on march,buc proceeded to trial against mls,iyc,and pazos on its copyright claims,and on april,the jury found mls and iyc liable for buc actual damages of or,alternatively,its statutory damages of.mls and iyc elected to recover actual damages,and the district court entered final judgment in that amount on april.
pursuant to the confidential settlement agreements,buc and the settling defendants filed their notices of dismissal on april,and may.the district court dismissed the settling defendants on may.on june,mls filed a motion to stay execution of the final judgment,which was later denied.the penultimate paragraph of the motion,however,stated that mls intended to file a motion pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b to reduce the damages award by that amount already satisfied by the confidential settlements.the paragraph further stated mls belief that the confidential settlement amounts totaled between and.mls and iyc ultimately filed their rule b motions for relief from the judgment on november,and december,respectively.the district court denied both motions on september,and mls and iyc now appeal.
discussion 
although mls and iyc originally moved the district court for partial relief from the judgment against them pursuant to several provisions of federal rule of civil procedure b,they appeal from the denial of their challenges under only subsections and.in part,rule b allows a court to relieve a party from a final judgment if the judgment has been satisfied,released,or discharged.rule b allows the same remedy for any other reason that justifies relief.other courts have found rule b to be an appropriate vehicle through which to seek credit against all or part of a judgment for the amount paid by a settling.see municipality of yauco,cir kassman am,noting that a motion for a credit on a judgment should be treated as a rule b motion for relief from a judgment which has been satisfied,released or discharged sunderland city of philadelphia,cir.we agree that motions seeking credit for settlement amounts obtained against joint tortfeasors are appropriately brought under rule b 
we review the district court denial of relief under rule b for an abuse of discretion,waddell hendry county sheriff office,cir,bearing in mind that a n error of law constitutes an abuse of discretion.wexler lepore,cir.before reaching the merits,however,we address buc claim that mls and iyc rule b challenges were untimely.
whether mls and iyc filed their rule b motions within a reasonable time 
motions filed pursuant to rule b must be made within a reasonable time.c.buc argues that mls and iyc delayed in filing their rule b motions and that we should therefore decline to consider the arguments raised in those motions now.
although the eleventh circuit has not yet given substance to this limitation in the context of rule b,we agree with most courts that we must consider the circumstances of each case to determine whether the parties have been prejudiced by the delay and whether a good reason has been presented for failing to take action sooner.united states boch oldsmobile,cir see also in re pac.far lines,cir planet sullivan,cir considering,among other related factors,prejudice and the reason given for the delay harduvel dynamics.
the earliest date that mls and iyc could have become aware of a potential settlement between buc and the settling defendants was march,when all counsel,except counsel for the settling defendants,appeared before the district court before the first day of trial,which was scheduled for march.the settlements were confidential,however,so mls and iyc still did not know their terms,including whether they involved any payments and,if so,the amounts of those payments.at the latest,mls and iyc learned of the settlements on april,and may,when buc and the settling defendants filed notices of dismissal.even then,the terms remained confidential.mls and iyc informally attempted to discover the settlement amounts by requesting,in letters dated june,and july,that buc and the settling defendants waive the confidentiality provisions of the agreements.the settling defendants agreed,but buc refused,asserting that mls and iyc had waived any claim to credit for the settlement amounts.during that same period of time,on june,mls filed a motion to stay execution of the judgment,alluding to its intention to file shortly thereafter a rule b motion claiming credit for the settlement amounts.
on july,mls initiated proceedings in bankruptcy court and served buc,apparently on october,with a request to produce the confidential settlement agreements.buc initially refused but ultimately complied on november,when the bankruptcy court denied its motion for a protective order.by that time,iyc had moved the district court,as part of its rule b motion of november,to compel buc to disclose the terms of the settlement agreements.on december,mls filed its rule b motion.
we find that the delay in this case was not unreasonable in light of the difficulty that mls and iyc encountered in attempting to discover the terms of the confidential settlement agreements.although mls and iyc waited approximately six and seven months,respectively,from the date of the second notice of dismissal to file their motions,mls did notify the district court of its intention to do so within two months of the second notice of dismissal,and both mls and iyc attempted to ascertain the terms of the settlements in the interim.furthermore,buc does not allege any prejudice in its briefing,and we see none.we therefore reject buc challenge to the timeliness of the rule b motions and proceed to the merits.
whether the rule applies to infringement claims 
mls and iyc argue on appeal that they are entitled to credit against the award against them for the settlement total by the settling defendants.mls and iyc predicate their request on the rule,which has its roots in elementary principles of tort law.see kassman,at.the rule generally provides that a plaintiff is entitled to only one satisfaction for a single injury,such that amounts received in settlement from an alleged tortfeasor are credited against judgments for the same injury against tortfeasors.see page keeton,prosser keeton on the law of torts,at,ed.mcdermott,amclyde,d.
in rejecting the request,the district court likened the attempt to claim credit for the settlements to a claim for contribution,which would only exist under the copyright act if either congress created such a right,expressly or implicitly,or the courts cre
