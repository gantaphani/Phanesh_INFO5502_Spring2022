software license agreement,ja.
the dealer agreement also states that it i supersedes all prior agreements between thoroughbred and dice with respect to the same subject matter,and fully sets forth our understanding with respect to the subject matter hereof and ii shall not be modified,except by written agreement dealer agreement vii,ja.dice maintains that,prior to and during the dealer agreement,the parties had a verbal agreement that allowed dice to install an entire software license,but pay only for the modules that it or its customers used.
in the fall of,an apparently disgruntled former dice employee informed thoroughbred that dice possessed a crack or lock pick program that allowed it to copy thoroughbred software and install it without obtaining authorization codes from thoroughbred.thoroughbred software,d at.dice maintains that one of its employees developed the program on his own time,and that the program purpose was to ensure that dice would have a steady supply of thoroughbred software in the event that thoroughbred bankruptcy reorganization was unsuccessful,and that some employees used the crack program to save time when activating legally purchased software packages at customer locations instead of using thoroughbred website to obtain an authorization code.id.
the discovery of the crack program prompted thoroughbred to conduct an audit of dice computers,records of installations,and licenses sold to it by thoroughbred.id.besides finding that dice possessed software that was properly authorized and paid for,yet was not installed on any computer,the audit showed that dice had unauthorized installations of software,plus an additional five customers running unlicensed modules,and unauthorized installations of openworkshop software,which were all installed on computers.id.although dice disputed the method by which the audit was conducted,the district court accepted the results of the audit.id.at.
after a bench trial held on april and,the district court found that dice exceeded the scope of its license and violated the copyright act,id.at,by copying thoroughbred software,which resulted in unauthorized installations of software,plus an additional five customers running unlicensed modules,and unauthorized installations of openworkshop software.id.at.the district court held that the parties dealer agreement superceded any prior verbal agreement that may have existed,finding that 
t he court must reject the testimony of the defendants that a special arrangement was made with thoroughbred that allowed the installation of software outside the dealer a greement.although this arrangement may have existed in the past,the parties intention expressed in the dealer a greement set forth the terms of the arrangement going forward.
id.consequently,the district court rejected dice reliance on the prior verbal agreement that the parties allegedly had,and stated that dice claim that prior practice allowed it to load unauthorized versions of protected software onto the computers used by its customers,which constituted copying the copyrighted work,is untenable.id.at.the district court also found dice vicariously liable.id.
the district court further found that unauthorized copies of the software were being used by dice customers.id.at.conversely,the court found that unauthorized copies of the software and unauthorized installations of openworkshop software were not being used by either dice or their customers,and that thoroughbred had not rebutted dice assertion that the customers could not access the unused software,due to a security program that dice had developed to prevent access without paying.id.
the district court awarded actual damages for the used software,and denied actual damages for the unused software.the court also declined to award thoroughbred recovery for profits that dice made from the infringement.in addition,the district court declined to award attorney fees to either party on the ground that no party constituted a prevailing party under the relevant statute.on july,thoroughbred appealed the district court denial of recovery for actual damages for the unused infringing software,dice profits from the infringing software,and attorney fees.dice does not appeal the issue of liability.
ii.standard of review 
both the issues of whether thoroughbred is entitled to recover actual damages for the unused infringing software and whether it is entitled to recover dice profits from the infringement are subject to de novo review as they involve mixed questions of law and fact.williams mehra,cir.
the issue of whether attorney fees should be awarded is reviewed for abuse of discretion.bridgeport music diamond time,cir.discretion is abused when a district court relies on clearly erroneous factual findings,improperly applies the law,or uses an erroneous legal standard.id.at.
iii.law and analysis 
actual damages for unused infringing copies of software 
a plaintiff may seek either actual damages or statutory damages for copyright infringement.thoroughbred seeks actual damages under b,which provides,in pertinent part 
the copyright owner is entitled to recover the actual damages suffered by him or her as a result of the infringement,and any profits of the infringer that are attributable to the infringement and are not taken into account in computing the actual damages.
a plaintiff seeking actual damages must prove the existence of a causal connection between the alleged infringement and some loss of anticipated revenue.quinn city of detroit,d.neither party disputes the district court finding that the proper measure of actual damages in the instant case is the amount thoroughbred would have received but for dice unlawful copying of the software.thoroughbred software,d at.further,the parties do not challenge the amount of actual damages that the district court awarded to thoroughbred for the used software.
the issue is whether thoroughbred can prove that it was damaged by the unused copies that the district court found to be infringing.dice argues that thoroughbred can not show that it was damaged as a result of dice having made unused copies because thoroughbred can not show that it sold less software as a result of dice infringements.in fact,dice contends that it would not have bought the infringing copies if it had been required to pay a license fee for all of the modules regardless of whether dice customers needed or used them.the district court agreed with dice,finding that thoroughbred had failed to show a causal connection for the unused copies because the lack of use cast considerable doubt on the proposition that thoroughbred would have made these sales to dice absent the infringing conduct.id.at.the district court determination that there was little possibility that thoroughbred would suffer a financial loss by the copying activity was based on dice testimony that it made the extra copies simply as a matter of convenience in case a customer later wanted to activate a feature,at which point dice would purportedly contact thoroughbred for authorization and payment.id.however,this reasoning conflicts with the district court finding that the dealer agreement superceded any verbal side agreement between the parties.furthermore,the dealer agreement does not mention any arrangement that would allow dice to make copies of licensed software,or to install licenses without prior payment to and approval from thoroughbred.dealer agreement,ja.the software license agreement explicitly prohibits copy ing or otherwise reproduc ing any part of the contents of this package except that you may make one backup copy of the software and you may load the software into a computer software license agreement,ja.
in facts similar to the instant case,the second circuit has held that a copyright owner actual damages may include in appropriate cases the reasonable license fee on which a willing buyer and a willing seller would have agreed for the use taken by the infringer.davis gap,cir.davis involved an eyeglasses designer who sued a retail store,the gap,for using the plaintiff product in an ad campaign without permission or payment.id.at.in reversing the district court,the second circuit held that the license fee that the plaintiff could have received from the defendant was sufficient to constitute actual damages,even without a showing of lost sales 
t he defendant has surreptitiously taken a valuable right,for which plaintiff could have charged a reasonable fee.plaintiff revenue is thus smaller than it would have been if defendant had paid for what he took.on the other hand,plaintiff revenue is no less than it would have been if the defendant had refrained from the taking.in our view,as between leaving the victim of the illegal taking with nothing,and charging the illegal taker with the reasonable cost of what he took,the latter,at least in some circumstances,is the preferable solution.
in the instant case,the dealer agreement provides that a license fee is due for each copy of software purchased,and that the licensee can not make additional copies.accordingly,the causal connection between the unused infringing software and thoroughbred actual damages is that,under the dealer agreement,dice should have paid thoroughbred a license fee for each copy of the software.thus,dice is liable for the unpaid license fees for all the unauthorized copies it made,regardless of whether these copies were accessible to or used by dice customers consequently,the district court finding that there were no actual damages for the copies that were unused inaccessible to dice customers was erroneous.therefore,we reverse the district court and award actual damages for the unused infringing software.
the lost license fee that the district court used to measure actual damages for the used software copies is also the proper measure of actual damages for the unused copies.see thoroughbred software,d at.it is undisputed that these amounts,as determined by the district court opinion,are for the unused infringing installations and for the unused infringing openworkshop installations.id.at.therefore,judgment for thoroughbred in the amount of should be entered by the district court on remand.
