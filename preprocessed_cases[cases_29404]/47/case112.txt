this is an appeal from an order of the united states district court for the southern district of new york richard owen,judge granting summary judgment to the appellees thomas steinbeck and blake smyle based on the court conclusion that a notice of termination given in that purported to terminate,pursuant to the copyright act,c and d,the grant of copyright licenses by the author john steinbeck,was valid.we consider on appeal whether an agreement entered into in between steinbeck widow and the publisher terminated and superseded the agreement,and,if so,whether the termination notice is therefore ineffective.because the termination right provided by section d pursuant to which the termination notice was issued applies only to grants of transfers or licenses of copyright,and because the agreement left intact no grant for the works in question,we conclude that the notice of termination is ineffective.the agreement remains in effect.
background 
grants of licenses of copyright 
on september,the author john steinbeck executed an agreement with the viking press the agreement that established the terms for the latter publication of some of steinbeck works,including the long valley,cup of gold,the pastures of heaven,to a god unknown,tortilla flat,in dubious battle,and of mice and men,in all of which steinbeck held the copyright.in,the agreement was extended to apply to four later works,including the grapes of wrath,through the operation of an option clause in the agreement.the rights granted by the agreement were later assigned by viking to penguin group usa penguin,and the duties thereunder assumed by penguin.the agreement provided to the publisher,who agreed to take out copyrights in the covered works in steinbeck name,the sole and exclusive right to publish the works in the united states and canada,with steinbeck receiving royalties based on net sales.the agreement would terminate if any of the covered works were not kept in print.the agreement was binding upon john steinbeck heirs,executors,administrators or assigns.
during his lifetime,steinbeck renewed the copyrights in the works covered by the agreement so that they enjoyed protection under both of the consecutive copyright terms provided for by the version of the copyright act in effect at the time.when steinbeck died in,he bequeathed his interest in these copyrights to his widow,elaine steinbeck.his sons by a previous marriage,thomas and john iv,each received a bequest of in a trust arrangement.
on october,elaine steinbeck and penguin entered into a new agreement for continued publication the agreement.it addressed the publication by penguin of all works that were covered by the agreement.it added several other early steinbeck works,some of his posthumous works,and some of elaine steinbeck own works.it also changed the economic terms of the agreement,mostly to elaine steinbeck benefit,by requiring penguin to provide a far larger annual guaranteed advance,and royalties of between ten and fifteen percent of retail rather than wholesale sales.the agreement further stated that when signed by author and publisher,it will cancel and supersede the previous agreements,as amended,for the works covered hereunder.
elaine steinbeck died in april,bequeathing her copyright interests in the steinbeck works at issue,as well as proceeds from the agreement,to various testamentary heirs including her children and grandchildren from a previous marriage,but she specifically excluded thomas steinbeck,john steinbeck iv,and their heirs.her statutory termination rights expired upon her death.
on june,john steinbeck surviving son thomas,and blake smyle,the sole surviving child of steinbeck other son,the deceased john iv,collectively the steinbeck descendants served what purported to be a notice of termination the notice of termination on penguin terminating the grants made by the agreement to penguin viking.
statutory background 
the copyright act gives to authors and certain enumerated family members the power to terminate prior grants of transfers or licenses of copyright.this power is based on congressional recognition that young authors frequently enter into contracts with publishers when their bargaining power is weak and their prospects for success uncertain,and discover increased leverage only when they later achieve commercial success.indeed,in an effort to balance the interests of publishers and authors,congress enacted provisions in the copyright act that attempted to give the author a second chance to control and benefit from his work and to secure to the author family the opportunity to exploit the work if the author died.stewart abend,d.congress permitted a publisher the opportunity to reap the initial rewards of an early investment in young talent,but it allowed authors to revisit the terms of earlier grants of rights once the success of their works became apparent.see id.
when john steinbeck entered into the agreement with viking press,the copyright act of was in effect.under that version of the act,authors were entitled to a copyright in their works for an initial year period beginning on the date of a work publication.after this period expired,the author had the right to renew the copyright for a second year term.the purpose of providing this renewal term was to permit the author,originally in a poor bargaining position,to renegotiate the terms of the grant once the value of the work ha d been tested.stewart,at.accord marvel characters,simon,cir quoting stewart.publishers could,and often did,thwart the purpose of this statutory scheme,however,by requiring authors to assign both their initial and renewal rights to the publisher at the same time and before the value of an author work could be ascertained.this practice received the legal imprimatur of the supreme court in fred fisher music witmark sons,which held that renewal rights could be assigned by an author during a work initial copyright term and before the vesting of the renewal right.id.at.see also marvel,at.
the amendments to the copyright act,which took effect in,abandoned this framework.in order to revitalize the ability of authors to revisit the terms of earlier grants of rights,the amended act replaced the two consecutive year terms with a single copyright term of increased duration and it created for authors or their statutory heirs,with respect to transfers or licenses of copyright effected prior to,an inalienable right to terminate the grant of a transfer or license.c.the section provides,in pertinent part 
in the case of any copyright subsisting in either its first or renewal term on january,the exclusive or nonexclusive grant of a transfer or license of the renewal copyright or any right under it,executed before january,by the author or the author heirs as specified at section a c,otherwise than by will,is subject to termination under the following conditions 
in the case of a grant executed by one or more of the authors of the work,termination of the grant may be effected by the author who executed it or,if such author is dead,by the person or persons who,under clause of this subsection,own and are entitled to exercise a total of more than of that author termination interest.where an author is dead,his or her termination interest is owned,and may be exercised,as follows 
b the author surviving children,and the surviving children of any dead child of the author,own the author entire termination interest unless there is a widow or widower,in which case the ownership of of the author interest is divided among them.
termination of the grant may be effected at any time during a period of five years beginning at the end of years from the date copyright was originally secured,or beginning on january,whichever is later.
termination of the grant may be effected notwithstanding any agreement to the contrary,including an agreement to make a will or to make any future grant.
this termination right provides authors or their statutory heirs with an opportunity to recapture some of the additional value produced by the lengthened copyright term.see,at.code.it is worth noting that section c,by its terms,does not apply to grants of a transfer or license of the renewal copyright made on or after january.such grants are subject to the slightly different termination right provided at,which,among other distinctions,applies only to grants made by the author rather than to grants made by either the author or other parties.
section c also provides only a limited window of time beginning at the end of years from the date copyright was originally secured,or beginning on january,whichever is later,c,during which termination rights may be exercised.if the termination right is not exercised during this window,the original grant remains in effect.so,for cup of gold,the earliest work included in the agreement,the termination right under section c expired on august,and for the grapes of wrath,the latest work,the right expired on april.it is undisputed,however,that no termination right under section c was ever exercised with respect to the copyrights covered by the agreement.
when the length of the copyright term was extended in,congress provided an additional window of time corresponding to this extension,during which the same termination right could be,had it not already been,exercised.see d.for grants whose section c termination right,as of october,had expired without being exercised,termination could be effected at any time during a period of years beginning at the end of years from the date copyright was originally secured.id.section d otherwise incorporated the conditions specified in section c including the statutory heirs of an author termination right.see d.the notice of termination issued in by the steinbeck descendants purported to terminate the grants of copyright licenses within each work section d termination period.
district court proceedings 
upon receiving the termination notice,penguin filed a complaint in the united states district court for the southern district of new york seeking a declaratory judgment against thomas steinbeck and blake smyle that the notice is invalid.penguin argued that the agreement,to which elaine steinbeck was a party,superseded and itself terminated the agreement,and that there was therefore no grant of a transfer or license of the renewal copyright to which section d could be applied.
in a related action,initiated by the steinbeck descendants,the estate and heirs of elaine steinbeck filed counterclaims seeking an equivalent declaration.the district court consolidated the two actions for the purposes of the summary judgment motions.
in an order issued june,and amended july,the district court disagreed,granting summary judgment against penguin and elaine steinbeck heirs and,among other things,upholding the validity of the termination notice served by the steinbeck descendants in.steinbeck mcintosh otis,d.the court rejected penguin argument that the agreement extinguished the section d termination right,observing that the agreement explicitly contemplated the future exercise of termination rights and that it did not grant penguin rights that were any greater or lesser than those granted by the agreement.id.the court also concluded that to the extent that the agreement would strip the steinbeck descendants of their inalienable termination rights in the grants,it is void as an agreement to the contrary pursuant to c.id.at footnote omitted.in the district court view,a ny interpretation of the agreement having the effect of disinheriting the statutory heirs to the termination interest the steinbeck descendants in favor of elaine heirs must be set aside as contrary to the very purpose of the termination statute id.at.
penguin,and the estate and heirs of elaine steinbeck,appeal from the portion of the district court judgment addressing the validity of the termination notice as to those works covered by the agreement.

ii.whether the agreement terminated and superseded the agreement 
the copyright act provides a termination right for the grant of a transfer or license of copyright made by parties other than the author only if the grant was made prior to january.d.our first inquiry,then,is whether the agreement terminated and superseded the agreement.we conclude that it did,leaving in effect no grants to which the termination rights provided by section d could be applied.
the language of the agreement makes clear that the parties intended that the agreement be terminated.under new york law parties to an agreement can mutually agree to terminate it by expressly assenting to its rescission while simultaneously entering into a new agreement dealing with the same subject matter.jones trice,dep t.once terminated and superseded,the new contract provides all of the parties obligations and remedies for breach.see northville indus.fort neck oil terminals,dep t w here the parties have clearly expressed or manifested their intention that a subsequent agreement supersede or substitute for an old agreement,the subsequent agreement extinguishes the old one and the remedy for any breach thereof is to sue on the superseding agreement.internal quotation marks omitted.the agreement states that t his agreement,when signed by author and publisher,will cancel and supercede the previous agreements,as amended,for the works including those works governed by the agreement covered hereunder.we see no valid reason to disregard this language and to regard the agreement as surviving the agreement.
contrary to the district court observation that a t no point did penguin lose or gain any rights other than those originally granted to it under the agreement,steinbeck,d at,the agreement obligated penguin to pay larger guaranteed advance payments and royalties calculated from the invoiced retail price of every copy sold by the publisher,rather than the amount which the publishers charge for all copies sold.the agreement also modifies the geographic limits of the publication rights as to the covered works and imposes a requirement on penguin to keep a greater number of steinbeck works in print.
the district court correctly observed that the agreement,by its terms,was to continue for as long as the publishers keep the works in print and for sale,steinbeck,d at,but this has little relevance to our analysis.a contract that remains in force may still be terminated and renegotiated in exchange for,among other things,one party forbearance of her legal right,such as a statutory right to terminate a previous grant of a copyright transfer or license.see,marine star trading marine,cir f orbearance to assert a valid claim,if bargained for,is sufficient consideration to support a contract.
it is of similarly little relevance that the agreement might have intended that earlier created termination rights survive it,for our central inquiry is not the parties intent to preserve these are granted by statute,not rather their intent to terminate the agreement.the availability of termination rights under the copyright act is not dependent on the intent of the parties but on,among other things,the date that a grant of rights was executed and the relationship to the author of those seeking to exercise the termination right.so,even if we accept that the agreement explicitly carries forward possible future termination,steinbeck,d at,it does not matter inasmuch as the grant of rights no longer existed.to the extent that the agreement might also have contemplated the potential preservation of termination rights,it does not abrogate the agreement clear expression of intent to terminate all prior grants of a transfer or license in the subject copyrights.
we also reject the suggestion that,notwithstanding the plain language of the agreement,there was no effective termination of the agreement because the agreement provided no moment of freedom for those holding the termination right to renegotiate the terms of the grant.appellees draw support for this theory primarily from nimmer on copyright ed,referring to c d.that statutory provision reads 
a further grant,or agreement to make a further grant,of any rig
