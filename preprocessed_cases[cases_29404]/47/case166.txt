rci technology corporation appeals from an order entered in the district of maryland affirming the bankruptcy court ruling in favor of sunterra corporation.rcc tech.sunterra,rci contends that the district court erred in ruling that sunterra,as the chapter debtor in possession,was entitled to assume a nonexclusive license of copyrighted software on appeal,we are called upon to decide whether,pursuant to c,such a debtor in possession may assume,over the licensor objection,a nonexclusive software license.in so deciding,we must resolve the issue of whether the disjunctive term or,as used in the assume or assign language of c,should be construed in the conjunctive as and.because we are unable to so construe c,sunterra was precluded from assuming the nonexclusive software license,and we reverse and remand.
at all times material to this appeal,rci conducted business as a software development company for the resort and hospitality industry.rci software products were used by entities in this industry,such as sunterra,for functions such as recording reservations,managing resort properties,and marketing and financing timeshares sunterra owns or controls more than subsidiaries and related entities,constituting one of the world largest resort management businesses.
in the,sunterra launched a program called club sunterra.membership in the club allowed timeshare owners at sunterra resorts to trade their timeshare rights for such rights at other sunterra resorts.because tens of thousands of timeshare owners and units were involved in the club,sunterra needed to develop an integrated computer system to assist its management of the club.for this purpose,sunterra decided to acquire rci premier and modify it into a unique computer program,the sword system.
in,rci and sunterra entered into a software license agreement the agreement,pursuant to which rci granted sunterra a nonexclusive license to use premier software the software.under the agreement,effective december,rci was required to provide sunterra a,worldwide,perpetual,irrevocable,license to use,copy,modify,and distribute the software the license.agreement.sunterra paid rci million for the license.because the software,as marketed,did not meet sunterra requirements,the agreement authorized sunterra to utilize the software to develop its own software system.under the agreement,sunterra owned any enhancements it made to the software the sunterra enhancements.id.sunterra,in turn,granted rci a license to use the sunterra enhancements.id.sunterra thereafter invested approximately million in developing the sword system.
on may,sunterra filed a chapter bankruptcy petition in the district of maryland.two years later,on june,the bankruptcy court confirmed sunterra plan of reorganization,effective july.prior to the plan confirmation,on march,rci filed a motion to have the court deem the agreement rejected the motion.rci claimed that the agreement was an executory contract and that sunterra,as debtor in possession,was precluded by c hereinafter c or the statute from assuming the agreement without rci consent rci maintained that,because it had refused to consent to assumption of the agreement,the court was required by law to deem the agreement rejected.
sunterra opposed the motion,asserting that the statute was inapplicable because the agreement was not an executory contract sunterra also maintained that it was not precluded from assuming the agreement because the statute should be interpreted as prohibiting a debtor in possession from assuming and assigning a contract,and it intended only to to assign.finally,sunterra contended that the statute did not prohibit assumption of the agreement because rci had agreed to permit reasonable assignments thereof.
on june,the bankruptcy court relied on lubrizol enterprises,richmond metal finishers,cir,and held,in a bench ruling,that the statute did not prohibit sunterra,as debtor in possession,from assuming the agreement.it decided that the agreement was not an executory contract and that,if it were,the statute did not preclude assumption because sunterra did not intend to assign the agreement.the court concluded that prohibiting sunterra from assuming the agreement was nonsensical because rci would not be damaged if sunterra,as debtor in possession,assumed the very contract rights it had possessed prior to bankruptcy.the following day,on june,the court entered an order denying the motion.in re sunterra.
on june,rci appealed the bankruptcy court decision to the district court,which,on january,affirmed.rcc tech.sunterra,the opinion.the district court disagreed with the bankruptcy court finding that the agreement was not executory,but concluded that the statute did not preclude sunterra,as debtor in possession,from assuming it.
in its opinion,the district court acknowledged that the statute,read literally,precluded sunterra,as debtor in possession,from assuming the agreement because copyright law excused rci from accepting performance from a party other than sunterra and rci did not consent to sunterra assumption of the agreement.id.at.in explaining its ruling,the court recognized the existence of a circuit split on the issue of whether the statute should be applied literally.it acknowledged that at least three circuits,the third,ninth,and eleventh,as well as several bankruptcy courts,have followed a literal test generally called the hypothetical test in applying the statute to the assumption of executory contracts see in re west,cir characterizing c a as posing a hypothetical question in re catapult entm t,cir same in re james cable partners,cir same in re catron,same,aff without,cir.on the other hand,the first circuit,along with a majority of the bankruptcy courts,have applied the actual test in such circumstances see institut pasteur cambridge biotech,cir rejecting the literal test in favor of the actual test see also in re catapult,at collecting bankruptcy court decisions adopting actual test.
in its opinion,the district court recognized that resolution of the dispute turned on which of the two tests applied.if the literal test applied,sunterra could not assume the agreement because rci was excused,pursuant to applicable copyright law,from accepting performance from a hypothetical third party.on the other hand,if the actual test applied,sunterra,as debtor in possession,was entitled to assume the agreement because it did not intend to assign,and rci would not actually be forced to accept performance from a party other than sunterra.the court then adopted the actual test,interpreting the disjunctive or in the conjunctive as and,and holding that,because rci would not,in the circumstances,be forced to accept performance from a party other than sunterra,the statute did not preclude it from assuming the agreement 
finally,the district court addressed sunterra contention that,because rci had agreed that it would not unreasonably withhold its consent regarding future assignments of the license by sunterra,rci had impliedly consented for sunterra,as debtor in possession,to assume the agreement.the court deemed unpersuasive sunterra contention that rci consented to assumption of the agreement.it determined,however,that its adoption and application of the actual test rendered the consent issue moot.it thus affirmed the bankruptcy court ruling that the statute did not bar sunterra,as debtor in possession,from assuming the agreement.rci has filed a timely appeal,and we possess jurisdiction pursuant to d.

in its appeal,rci contends that we should reverse for several reasons.first,it maintains that,because the plain meaning of the statute can be applied without producing a result that is patently absurd,the court erred in failing to do so.second,rci contends that general bankruptcy policy can not be relied upon to support the decision not to apply the plain meaning of the statute.third,rci maintains that the statute is unambiguous and that use of legislative history to construe the statute was inappropriate.finally,rci contends that,if legislative history can be utilized,it does not support the opinion.
on the other hand,sunterra maintains that,for multiple reasons,we should affirm.first,it asserts that the statute applies only to executory contracts,and that the agreement was not executory.second,it contends that,if the agreement was executory,we should affirm because courts need not apply the plain meaning of a statute to produce an absurd result or be inconsistent with clearly established legislative intent.on this point,sunterra maintains that the literal the disjunctive or in the statute to mean what it have produced an absurd result and been inconsistent with legislative intent.finally,sunterra contends that the statute does not preclude assumption of an executory contract if the nondebtor party,rci,consents to the assignment,and rci,in section of the agreement,impliedly consented to reasonable assignments.sunterra asserts that assumption was automatically reasonable because it would leave undisturbed the identity of sunterra as the licensee.sunterra contends,therefore,that we should affirm because rci had consented to assumption of the agreement by sunterra as debtor in possession.we address these issues in turn.
first,sunterra contends that the statute does not prohibit assumption of the agreement because the statute applies only to executory contracts and the agreement was not executory in assessing whether a contract is executory,we are obliged,under lubrizol,at,to apply what courts have referred to as the countryman test.under the countryman test,a contract is executory if the obligations of both the bankrupt and the other party to the contract are so far unperformed that the failure of either to complete the performance would constitute a material breach excusing the performance of the other.gloria int l ladies garment workers union,cir quoting countryman,executory contracts in bankruptcy part i.applying the countryman test,the agreement was not executory unless it was executory as to both sunterra and rci when sunterra petitioned for bankruptcy we must therefore assess whether,at the time of the chapter filing,the obligations of both sunterra and rci were so unperformed that the failure of either to complete performance would constitute a material breach of the agreement.
on this point,we agree with the district court that the agreement was executory when sunterra petitioned for bankruptcy.when the bankruptcy petition was filed,each party owed at least one continuing material duty to the other under the each possessed an ongoing obligation to maintain the confidentiality of the source code of the software developed by the other,the software and the sunterra enhancements agreement.
if the agreement was executory,sunterra agrees that a straightforward application of the statute prohibits it from assuming the agreement without rci consent.more specifically,sunterra acknowledges that c is drawn in the disjunctive and,by its plain language,prohibits sunterra from assuming or assigning,rather than from assuming and assigning,the agreement.and as a settled principle,unless there is some ambiguity in the language of a statute,a court analysis must end with the statute plain language hillman,cir citing caminetti united states.the plain meaning rule.
sunterra maintains that the plain meaning rule has no application here,relying on the two narrow exceptions to application of a statute plain language.the first such exception,premised on absurdity,exists when literal application of the statutory language at issue results in an outcome that can truly be characterized as absurd,that is so gross as to shock the general moral or common sense id.quoting sigmon coal apfel,cir internal quotation marks omitted,aff sub nom.barnhart sigmon coal,d.the second exception is premised on legislative intent,and it exists only when literal application of the statutory language at issue produces an outcome that is demonstrably at odds with clearly expressed congressional intent id.a reviewing court may look beyond the plain language of an unambiguous statute only when one of these exceptions is implicated.sigmon coal,at.and we have recognized that the instances in which either of these exceptions to the plain meaning rule apply are,and should be,exceptionally rare.hillman,at quoting sigmon coal,at.
sunterra maintains that we should affirm because,although the plain language of the statute precludes its assumption of the agreement,application of the literal test produces a result that is both absurd and demonstrably at odds with clearly expressed legislative intent.specifically,sunterra contends that we should reject the plain meaning of the statute,and read the disjunctive or as the conjunctive and,for three reasons the plain meaning of c is absurd because it creates internal inconsistencies therein the plain meaning of c is absurd because it is inconsistent with general bankruptcy policy and the plain meaning of c is incompatible with its legislative history.we examine these contentions in turn.
sunterra maintains that adherence to the plain meaning rule produces an absurd result because it sets c at war with itself and its neighboring statutory provisions.specifically,sunterra maintains that a literal reading of c implicates the absurdity exception because it renders inoperative and superfluous f as well as the phrase or the debtor in possession found in c a.sunterra,relying on sutherland statutory construction,contends that we should interpret c to minimize any discord among the provisions of and,if possible,construe c so that none of is inoperative or superfluous.norman singer,sutherland statutory construction ed.a statute should be construed so that effect is given to all its provisions,and so that no part will be inoperative or superfluous.
in support of its inconsistency contention,sunterra first maintains that it is absurd to read c literally because such a reading renders f inoperative and superfluous.the asserted inconsistency between c and f arises from use of the term applicable law in each provision.in re catapult,at.subsection c bars assumption absent consent when applicable law would bar an assignment.and subsection f provides that,contrary provisions in applicable law notwithstanding,executory contracts may be assigned.of course,the assumption of an executory contract is a necessary prerequisite to its assignment under.see f a providing that trustee may assign executory contract only if trustee first assumes such contract in accordance with provisions of.a literal reading of c,therefore,initially appears to render f inoperative or superfluous.
the sixth circuit,in its decision in in re magness,squarely addressed the issue of whether the seemingly warring provisions of c and f are reconcilable.in re magness,cir.in so doing,the court acknowledged that section c,the recognized exception to f,appears at first to resuscitate in full the very applicable law which f nullifies.id.as the court observed,however,the conflict between c and f is illusory,because each subsection recognizes an applicable law of markedly different scope.accord in re james cable,at in re lil things,in re antonelli,aff without,cir.first,f lays out the broad rule a law that,as a general matter,prohibits,restricts,or conditions the assignment of executory contracts is trumped by the provisions of subsection f.in re catapult,at citing in re james cable,at in re magness,at.section c,in contrast,creates a carefully crafted exception to the broad rule,under which applicable law does not merely recite a general ban on assignment,but instead more specifically excuses a party from accepting performance from or rendering performance to an entity different from the one with which the party originally contracted id.therefore,under the broad rule of f,the applicable law is the law prohibiting or restricting assignments as such whereas the applicable law under c embraces legal excuses for refusing to render or accept performance,regardless of the contract status as assignable in re magness,at guy,concurring.
in order to determine whether a law is overridden by f under the foregoing interpretation of f and c,a court must ask why applicable law prohibits assignment.in re catapult,at citing in re magness,at guy,concurring in re antonelli,at.and only applicable law predicated on the rationale that the identity of the contracting party is material to the agreement is resuscitated by c.id.premised on this interpretation,we agree with those circuits that apply c provisions of c are not inevitably set at odds with the provisions of f.in re catapult,at in re james cable,at in re magness,at.
the second pillar of sunterra inconsistency contention is that a literal reading of c creates a conflict within itself.specifically,sunterra contends that c can not be read literally because,when so read,the phrase or the debtor in possession found in c a is rendered inoperative and superfluous.certain bankruptcy courts have agreed with sunterra contention,observing,for example,that,i f the directive of section c is to prohibit assumption whenever applicable law excuses performance relative to any entity other than the debtor,why add the words or debtor in possession the literal test renders this phrase surplusage.in re hartec,accord in re fastrax,in re cardinal.as the ninth circuit has recognized,however,this position is untenable because a close reading of c dispels this notion.in re catapult,at.
by its plain language,c addresses both assumption and assignment.id.an assumption and an assignment are two conceptually distinct events,and the nondebtor must consent to each independently.id.under the plain language of c,therefore,two independent events must occur before a chapter debtor in possession is entitled to assign an executory contract.the debtor in possession must first obtain the nondebtor consent to assume the contract,and it must thereafter obtain the nondebtor consent to assign the contract.therefore,where a nondebtor consents to the assumption of an executory contract,c will have to be applied a second time if the debtor in possession wishes to assign the contract in question.id.and in the second application of c,the issue is whether applicable law excuses a party from accepting performance from or rendering performance to an entity other than the debtor in possession.c a emphasis added.we agree,therefore,that the phrase debtor in possession,far from being rendered inoperative or superfluous by a literal reading of subsection c,dovetails neatly with the disjunctive language therein the trustee may not assume or assign c emphasis added see in re catapult,at.
in light of the foregoing,sunterra inconsistency contention also lacks statute may be read literally without creating an irreconcilable conflict within itself or with its neighboring statutory provisions.
sunterra next maintains that the bankruptcy court and the district court properly declined to read the statute literally,correctly concluding that to do so would produce a result that is inconsistent with general bankruptcy policy.those courts declined to adhere to the plain meaning rule because they concluded that a literal reading of the statute conflicts with general bankruptcy policy,implicating the absurdity and intent exceptions to the rule.indeed,the district court decided that the result produced by the plain language of the statute was quite unreasonable.opinion at.we turn to sunterra contention that the intent and absurdity exceptions apply here.
we first assess whether a conflict between the statute and general bankruptcy policy implicates the absurdity exception to the plain meaning rule.the district court refused to read c literally because it viewed the result produced by such a reading to be quite unreasonable.in assessing whether a plain reading of a statute implicates the absurdity exception,however,the issue is not whether the result would be unreasonable,or even quite unreasonable,but whether the result would be absurd.see maryland state dep t of 
educ.dep t of veterans affairs,cir.
sunterra maintains that reading c literally is absurd because such a reading conflicts with the general bankruptcy policy of fostering a successful reorganization and maximizing the value of the debtor assets.rci,on the other hand,asserts that reading c literally is not absurd because congress did not sacrifice every right of a nondebtor party to the reorganization process,and that courts should not assume that sections of the bankruptcy code unfavorable to the debtor were enacted in error.rci observes that the bankruptcy code contains many provisions preserving the rights of parties from its general application the nondebtor provisions.see,b listing exceptions to automatic stay,authorizing nondebtor parties to exercise their nonbankruptcy rights notwithstanding a,protecting rights of nondebtor party under securities contracts,commodities contracts,grain storage contracts,repurchase agreements,and swap agreements,from effects of automatic stay,avoidance powers,and provisions of.in response,sunterra acknowledges that anyone looking at appreciates that the bankruptcy code balances rights with those of a.sunterra maintains,however,that most of the provisions address particular grievances of an identifiable constituency,or were enacted in response to particular court decisions.sunterra contends,therefore,that the mere existence of such provisions does not make it plausible that,in enacting the statute,congress intended to preclude chapter debtors from assuming executory contracts existing prior to the bankruptcy filing.
to the contrary,the existence of the nondebtor provisions makes it plausible that congress meant what it said in the statute.and as judge traxler observed in sigmon coal,if it is plausible that congress intended the result compelled by the plain meaning rule,we must reject an assertion that such an application is absurd.sigmon coal,at holding statute not absurd because,although literal application of statute produced somewhat anomalous result,plausible explanation existed.in these circumstances,application of the plain meaning rule does not produce a result so grossly inconsistent with bankruptcy policy as to be absurd.
we turn next to sunterra contention on the intent exception.affirming the bankruptcy court,the district court decided that the actual test,reading the disjunctive or as the conjunctive and,is far more harmonious with bankruptcy policy than the literal test.opinion at.relying on united states ron pair enterprises,d,the court declined to apply the plain meaning of the statute,declaring that,a lthough the plain meaning of statutes must generally be enforced,there is a competing principle that statutes should not be interpreted to produce results that are unreasonable in light of the drafters intentions.id.the court then ruled that,because the literal test produced a result that conflicted with the goals of chapter,it need not apply the plain meaning of the statute.id.
in its ron pair decision,the supreme court held that a statute plain meaning should be conclusive except in the rare cases in which the literal application of the statute will produce a result demonstrably at odds with the intentions of its drafters.at.quoting griffin oceanic contractors,d emphasis added.under ron pair,therefore,a court is obliged to apply the plain meaning rule unless the party contending otherwise can demonstrate that the result would be contrary to that intended by congress.requiring a demonstration that the plain meaning of a statute is at odds with the intentions of its drafters is a more stringent mandate than requiring a showing that the statute literal application is unreasonable in light of bankruptcy policy.
some bankruptcy commentators maintain that sound bankruptcy policy supports adoption of the actual test.see lawrence king,collier on bankruptcy d iii ed.
