the district court did not abuse its broad discretion in determining the profits for,freeze,and jem sportwear jem.there was sufficient evidence to find freeze willfully infringed plaintiffs rights,because freeze vice president of licensing testified that she knew that plaintiffs had the right to merchandise marley image before freeze began selling similar goods.the seventh amendment does not require that a jury calculate these profits,because juries have not traditionally done so,and a claim for profit disgorgement is equitable in nature.see reebok int,marnatech,cir.

facts procedural history 
bob marley transcended celebrity roles from pop idol to muse,championing social change and diffusing his music and message to an audience.even now more than thirty years after his death marley influence continues to resonate,and his iconic image to command millions of dollars each year in merchandising revenue.the primacy of rights to marley image forms the basis of the instant case.
plaintiff hope road is an entity owned by marley children,formed for the purpose of acquiring and exploiting assets,rights,and commercial interests in the late bob marley.in,hope road granted zion an exclusive license to design,manufacture,and sell and other merchandise bearing marley image.hope road authorizes zion to use hundreds of different images of marley on its products.
defendants were involved with the sale of competing marley merchandise.publishes and licenses photographs,images,movie posters,and other artwork for use in the retail marketplace.defendant x one x movie archive holds the copyrights to these photographs,images,movie posters,and other artwork and valencia serves as president and ceo of both companies.in,acquired some photos of marley from a photographer named roberto rabanne.after acquiring the marley photographs,began licensing them to defendants jem and freeze as well as entities not a party to this suit for the production of marley and other merchandise.these items were sold at target,walmart,and other large retailers.

discussion 
i.the district court did not err in denying the renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law on plaintiffs false endorsement claim.
this case presents a question that is familiar in our circuit when does the use of a celebrity likeness or persona in connection with a product constitute false endorsement that is actionable under the lanham act we conclude that the evidence presented at trial was sufficient for a jury to find defendants violated the lanham act by using marley likeness.our narrow holding relies on the familiar principles that underlie celebrity false endorsement claims,and we reject defendants contention that the application of those principles results in a federal right of publicity.
section a of the lanham act,a provides in relevant part 
any person who,on or in connection with any goods or services,or any container for goods,uses in commerce any name,symbol,or device,or any combination thereof which is likely to cause confusion,or to cause mistake,or to deceive as to the origin,sponsorship,or approval of his or her goods,services,or commercial activities by another person shall be liable in a civil action by any person who believes that he or she is or is likely to be damaged by such act.
on appeal,defendants raise several potentially salient defenses to challenge the judgment against them on the a claim.however,we will not undo the entirety of the proceedings in the court below and reverse the jury verdict when these defenses were not sufficiently asserted in the district court to preserve them for appeal.see components,at.we express no opinion on the waived defenses applicability to this case or any future case,and address only the reviewable issues below 
hope road has a property right under the lanham act to marley persona.
defendants claim that the a claim fails as a matter of law,because a celebrity persona is too amorphous to constitute a name,symbol,or device under a.this premise is incorrect.our jurisprudence recognizes a a claim for misuse of a celebrity persona.a celebrity whose endorsement of a product is implied through the imitation of a distinctive attribute of the celebrity identity,has standing to sue for false endorsement under section a of the lanham act.waits frito lay,cir,abrogated on other grounds by lexmark int,static control components,see also white,at analyzing the level of recognition of the celebrity persona to determine whether a likelihood of confusion exists under a wendt host int,cir analyzing a claims actors who played characters in cheers brought against the creator of animatronic figures set in airport bars modeled after the cheers set.
b.there was sufficient evidence at trial to support the jury finding that consumers would likely be confused about whether plaintiffs sponsored or approved defendants marley products 
standard of review 
we review de novo the denial of a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law.escriba foster poultry farms,cir.we must sustain the verdict unless the evidence,construed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,permits only one reasonable conclusion,and that conclusion is contrary to the jury verdict.pavao pagay,cir.in determining whether the verdict is supported by sufficient evidence,we do not weigh the evidence.harper city of,cir.instead,we must draw all reasonable inferences in the favor of the,and disregard all evidence favorable to the moving party that the jury is not required to believe.id.
the likelihood of confusion inquiry generally considers whether a reasonably prudent consumer in the marketplace is likely to be confused as to the sponsorship or approval of the goods bearing the marks at issue in the case rearden llc rearden commerce,cir.in celebrity cases,the court generally applies eight factors to determine likelihood of confusion 
t he level of recognition that the celebrity has among the segment of the society for whom the defendant product is intended 
t he relatedness of the fame or success of the celebrity to the defendant product 
t he similarity of the likeness used by the defendant to the actual celebrity 
e vidence of actual confusion 
m arketing channels used 
l ikely degree of purchaser care 
d efendant intent on selecting the celebrity and 
l ikelihood of expansion of the product lines.
downing abercrombie fitch,cir.these factors are not necessarily of equal importance,nor do they necessarily apply to every case.id.at.the list of factors is not a whether a party wins a majority of the factors is not the point.nor should t he factors be rigidly weighed we do not count beans.thane int l,trek bicycle,cir,superseded by statute on other grounds,trademark dilution revision act of,stat.codified at.where the plaintiff is not the celebrity himself,an additional factor becomes relevant the strength of association between the mark and the plaintiff.cairns franklin mint,d,cairns ii.
examining the record as a whole in light of these factors,we can not say that the evidence compels a finding contrary to the jury verdict.see pavao,at.
first,plaintiffs presented undisputed testimony to establish a high level of recognition of marley image among defendants target market.as to the second factor,plaintiffs also introduced testimony that marley image has long been associated with apparel.marley used to sell his own merchandise,and his have continued to do so.no one disputes the third factor used actual photos of marley on its merchandise.
the fourth factor,evidence of actual confusion,draws the most fire from defendants and freeze in the form of objections to the consumer confusion survey.the survey collected data from interviews conducted by professional interviewers with individuals in shopping malls.the survey respondents were divided into a test group and a control group.interviewers showed the test group an actual bearing bob marley image and showed the control group a bearing the image of an unrenowned african american man with dreadlocks.several questions were put to both groups,including who do you think gave their permission or approval for this particular to be made or put out percent of the test group answered that bob person on the shirt or his heirs,estate,or agents gave their permission or approval for the to be made or put out.twenty percent of the control group answered the same.many survey respondents subsequently opined that the law required permission from the person whose image appeared on the shirt.we need not entangle ourselves in lay legal opinion.rather,we look solely at the former set of responses,which indicates actual confusion.the latter responses only answer why some of those surveyed were confused.
defendants and freeze argue that the survey questions were indefinite with respect to endorsement by marley a viable false endorsement claim should have an identifiable person as the putative endorser.offers no precedent showing that it must be a single entity that is falsely attributed as the party that approved the product or that the survey taker must be able to identify the party.thus,identifying marley or whoever holds the rights to his persona in the alternative does not render the survey data useless or irrelevant.see fleischmann distilling maier brewing,cir.rather,the imprecision of the data merely decreases its probative value.drawing all reasonable inferences in plaintiffs favor,harper,at,the survey shows some actual confusion.see thane int,at.accordingly,the jury could rely on the data along with evidence of the other factors to find likelihood of confusion.evidence of actual confusion is relevant to likelihood of confusion but not required in a false endorsement claim.see gracie,at holding that a violation does not require evidence of actual confusion,because only likelihood of confusion is mentioned in the statute 
regarding the fifth factor,marketing channels used,hope road introduced testimony that licensees sold marley products in some of the same retail stores as plaintiffs and plaintiffs licensees wet seal,penney,target,and walmart.
sixth,the likely low degree of purchaser care was also supported by testimony at trial.liza acuna,licensing agent,testified that she did not believe licensed priced and were expensive.kimberly cauley,vice president of licensing at freeze,testified that freeze marley apparel priced to was generally not expensive.jacob goldszer of jgr copa,beach towel licensee,testified that beach towels are impulse item s.heather vogel,buyer for target,testified that graphic priced to were a good value and an impulse purchase.defendants and freeze do not dispute that low prices imply correspondingly low consumer care when purchasing defendants marley products.see cairns ii,d at.
with respect to the seventh factor,the salient inquiry is not whether defendants and freeze knew their actions were unlawful,but whether they intended to confus e consumers concerning the endorsement of their products.white,at internal quotation mark omitted.to that end,plaintiffs showed the jury photographs comparing an to a zion had been selling for ten years.both featured a single,image of marley face with his mouth open slightly,as if speaking.both are black,and overlay rastifarian green,yellow,and red in dithered stripes across marley face.viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiffs,one would infer that defendants sought to associate their product with plaintiffs by intentionally creating similar merchandise 
because the celebrity himself,marley,is not the plaintiff,we must apply the additional strength of the association between marley and the plaintiffs.that carries greater weight where,as here,the evidence introduced to support the downing factors primarily demonstrates that the celebrity himself sponsored or approved the defendants products.under these circumstances,the additional factor and the seventh factor wax in significance,because they link likelihood of confusion to plaintiffs.see cairns ii,d at.
in cairns ii,the court held that princess diana image was only weakly associated with the plaintiffs,largely because princess diana image had not served a trademark function during her life or after her death.see id.p ervasive unauthorized use of a celebrity persona will tend to dull the popular perception that use of that persona signifies an endorsement at all,weakening the initial automatic association between the celebrity and his or her estate.id.alteration in original.the cairns defendants had been selling products bearing princess diana image since before her death,and other parties had been doing the same.id.critical to the analysis,princess diana knew of the vast commercial uses of her image and did nothing to prevent others from using her image while she was alive.id.
here,unlike princess diana,marley sold merchandise bearing his image during his lifetime,and his have continued to do so,implying that his image served and continues to serve a function.there has been significant unauthorized use of marley persona since his death.however,that use was not uncontested as in princess diana situation.plaintiffs introduced uncontroverted evidence that they and their predecessors have sent more than cease and desist letters and filed more than lawsuits.thus,the jury was free to infer that the function of marley persona had not weakened to the extent that there was no likelihood of confusion.
also,plaintiffs introduced evidence that valencia approached rohan marley,one of bob marley sons and an owner of hope road,seeking rights to create bob marley merchandise.these actions imply hope road was known to be associated with bob marley image.additionally,scott holroyd,general manager at balzout a former a.licensee,testified in a video deposition played at trial that it was common understanding in the licensing industry that hope road owned the rights to marley.kimberly cauley,freeze vice president of licensing,also stated that she knew of zion license to marley persona based on market knowledge.
c.the false endorsement claim does not fail for lack of an endorsement.
defendants argue that the a claim fails,because marley image needed to have been used in connection with a separate product or service to constitute an endorsement.as plaintiffs point out,the statute does not mention endorsement.rather,we commonly call a claims false endorsement claims because they often involve likelihood of confusion as to a plaintiff sponsorship or approval of the defendant product.see a a.
rather than the lack of the word endorsement,it is the statutory phrase referring to a defendant use of the mark on any goods,a emphasis added,that requires us to reject defendants argument.the goods in the phrase on any goods refers to the goods consumers may mistakenly think are approved by the owner of the mark.see id.thus,the plain text of the statute establishes that a viable false endorsement claim does not require that the mark be used in connection with separate goods to promote the purchase of those separate goods but may be used directly on the defendant goods.see wendt,at denying defendants summary judgment motion on a a claim arising from the placement of animatronic robots resembling cheers actors in defendants bars to purportedly imply the actors endorsement of defendants bars.
here,the fact that marley image appears directly on defendants merchandise does not preclude relief under a.instead,as in any a claim,the particular use and placement of the mark is probative of likelihood of confusion.as discussed above,the jury found defendants use was likely to confuse,and we may not disturb that finding.
d.the judgment does not overextend the lanham act by creating a federal right of publicity.
defendants and freeze argue that allowing a plaintiff to vindicate a a claim predicated on the use of a deceased celebrity persona essentially creates a federal right of publicity.
assuming congress did not intend the lanham act to protect such rights,the a claim in this case is not tantamount to a federal right of publicity.state publicity right claims protect a plaintiff when the defendant uses the plaintiff identity for commercial advantage,without permission.see,abdul jabbar.motors,cir analyzing california law.however,a claims require an additional element that the use be likely to confuse as to the sponsorship or approval of a defendant goods.see a.we have previously distinguished between publicity right claims and a claims on the basis of this additional element.see abdul jabbar,at cairns franklin mint,cir cairns iii under the law of false endorsement,likelihood of customer confusion is the determinative issue.moreover,the second circuit agrees that this distinction is significant.rogers,at because the right of publicity,unlike the lanham act,has no likelihood of confusion requirement,it is potentially more expansive than the lanham act.
defendants and freeze assert that the lanham act false association claim is essentially a federal right of publicity claim in disguise,because consumers would always associate a deceased celebrity image with that of his or her estate.but a plaintiff must show more than mere association to succeed in a false endorsement claim.see downing,at.as discussed above,we can not disturb the jury finding regarding likelihood of confusion,but the outcome of this case is in part a function of defenses expressly waived by defendants.we are not in the position to assess the defendants litigation strategy.contrary to their assertion,our decision to affirm the jury verdict does not create a federal right of publicity.
to the extent defendants and freeze argue that congress generally did not intend a to cover claims brought by celebrities estates or based on celebrity persona,the legislative history does not demonstrate limitation of such claims.further,this court already treats a celebrity persona as identifiable intellectual property protectable under the lanham act.see white,at.this property exists whether the holder is the celebrity or a successor in interest.thus,the fact of the celebrity death does not preclude a a claim.rather,the determinative issue in any a claim is likelihood of confusion.see cairns iii,at.
ii.the district court did not err in awarding plaintiffs,jem,and freeze total net profits.
a provides 
when a violation of any right of the registrant of a mark registered in the patent and trademark office,a violation under section a or d of this title,or a willful violation under section c of this title,shall have been established in any civil action arising under this chapter,the plaintiff shall be entitled,subject to the provisions of sections and of this title,and subject to the principles of equity,to recover defendant profits,any damages sustained by the plaintiff,and the costs of the action.the court shall assess such profits and damages or cause the same to be assessed under its direction.in assessing profits the plaintiff shall be required to prove defendant sales only defendant must prove all elements of cost or deduction claimed if the court shall find that the amount of the recovery based on profits is either inadequate or excessive the court may in its discretion enter judgment for such sum as the court shall find just,according to the circumstances of the case.such sum shall constitute compensation and not a penalty.
an award of profits is not automatic upon a finding of infringement.lindy pen bic pen,cir,superseded by statute on other grounds,trademark amendments act of,stat.rather,profits must be granted in light of equitable considerations.id.in seeking to achieve equity between the parties,the court must fashion a remedy wherein the defendant may not retain the fruits,if any,of unauthorized trademark use or continue that use and the plaintiff is not given a windfall.bandag,al bolser tire stores.awarding profits is proper only where the defendant is attempting to gain the value of an established name of another.lindy pen,at quoting maier brewing fleischmann distilling,cir.willful infringement carries a connotation of deliberate intent to deceive.id.generally,deliberate,false,misleading,or fraudulent conduct meets this standard.id.internal quotation marks omitted.willfulness require s a connection between a defendant awareness of its competitors and its actions at those competitors expense.id.quoting alpo petfoods,ralston purina.
a.there was sufficient evidence to support the finding of willfulness as to freeze.
freeze claims that there was insufficient evidence to support the jury finding that freeze violated a willfully,requiring reversal of the district court order disgorging freeze profits.freeze is incorrect.
at trial,kim cauley,vice president of licensing for freeze,testified as follows before freeze began selling marley merchandise,cauley received a phone call from doreen crujeiras,a licensing agent for hope road,who notified her that hope road or the marley family owned the rights in bob marley.crujeiras said that did not have the right to use marley name and likeness.cauley also knew that zion had a license to sell bob marley merchandise,and this awareness predated freeze first sales of marley merchandise.thus,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiffs,cauley testimony demonstrates freeze awareness of its competitors and its actions at those competitors expense.lindy pen,at internal quotation marks omitted see also gallo winery consorzio del gallo nero,use of an infringing mark,in the face of warnings about potential infringement,is strong evidence of willful infringement.
b.there is no seventh amendment right to have a jury calculate profits.
a jury found defendants had violated a.over plaintiffs objection,the trial judge calculated,jem,and freeze net profits from marley merchandise based on the evidence the parties submitted.plaintiffs claim that this procedure violated their seventh amendment right to a jury trial,because the seventh amendment necessitates a jury calculation of profits to be disgorged we review the question of entitlement to a jury trial de novo.rind,cir.
the seventh amendment guarantees a litigant right to a jury trial on suits at common law.const.amend.vii.although the thrust of the amendment was to preserve the right to jury trial as it existed in,it has long been settled that the right extends beyond the forms of action recognized at that time.curtis loether.suits at common law include statutory claims that are legal as opposed to equitable.feltner,at.to determine whether a particular claim invokes this right,we must compare the statutory action to the actions brought in the courts of england prior to merger of the courts of law and equity,and must examine the remedy sought and determine whether it is legal or equitable in nature.rind,at quoting tull united states.the second inquiry is more important.id.
if the overall claim belongs in the law category,we then ask whether the particular trial decision must fall to the jury in order to preserve the substance of the right as it existed in when the seventh amendment was ratified.city of monterey del monte dunes at monterey.we consider whether,in,juries typically decided the issue in question or an analogous one.id.at.if history does not provide a clear answer,we look to precedent and functional considerations.id.
in applying this framework,we keep in mind that the narrow seventh amendment right preserve s the basic institution of jury trial in only its most fundamental elements.tull,at quoting galloway united states.accordingly,o nly those incidents which are regarded as fundamental,as inherent in and of the essence of the system of trial by jury,are placed beyond the reach of the legislature.id.
a claim for disgorgement of profits under a is equitable,not legal.litigants filed actions in deceit prior to,but these suits were rare.see mark thurman,ending the seventh amendment confusion a critical analysis of the right to a jury trial in trademark cases.intell.prop.l,only three known cases prior to two in courts of law,one in court of equity.while this historical record illuminates little,the current law recognizes that actions for disgorgement of improper profits are equitable in nature.see chauffeurs,teamsters helpers,local terry,tull,at city of monterey,at equitable monetary remedies focus on what the defendant gained reebok int,at an accounting of profits under a is not synonymous with an award of monetary damages a n accounting for profits is an equitable remedy subject to the principles of equity.internal quotation marks omitted.
contrary to plaintiffs argument,dairy queen,wood,does not broadly hold that a lanham act claim for disgorgement of profits is a legal claim.rather,the supreme court characterizes the dairy queen claim as a legal claim for damages not disgorgement of profits.see feltner,at.
moreover,even if the claim were legal,the specific issue of profit determination can not be said to be traditionally tried to a jury.see city of monterey,at.again,the slim history of pre,cases certainly does not support that notion.turning to current law,language allows judges to determine the amount of profits,which judges regularly do.consequently,the determination of profits under is not fundamental,inherent in and of the essence of the system of trial by jury.tull,at.
c.the district court did not err in calculating profits.
a ny decision concerning the awarding of an accounting of profits remedy should remain within the discretion of the trial court.playboy,baccarat clothing,cir.accordingly,we will not disturb the district court decision unless there is a definite and firm conviction that the court below committed a clear error of judgement in the conclusion it reached upon a weighing of the relevant factors.id.quoting chism.heritage life ins,cir.
the trademark holder has the burden to prove the defendant infringer gross revenue from the infringement.lindy pen,at.then the burden shifts to the defendant infringer to prove expenses that should be deducted from the gross revenue to arrive at the defendant infringer lost profits.see experience hendrix,slip op.at cir.
deductions 
claims that the district court abused its discretion by not allowing deductions reflecting a royalty fee paid to international,which claimed equaled and marketing,travel,overhead,and trade show expenses connected with promoting marley merchandise.not so.acting within its discretion,the district court held that failed to meet its burden to prove these deductions.the royalty fee arrangement was not an arms length transaction.the sole shareholder and employee of international was valencia girlfriend,liza acuna.moreover,the documentary evidence leaves uncertainty as to the amount of royalty fees paid.regarding the other expenses,plaintiffs argue did not produce sufficient documentation to prove the specific amounts.does not attempt to rebut any of these arguments.given these doubts,the district court was within its discretion to deny these deductions.
jem deductions 
first,plaintiffs claim the district court erred by reopening discovery to allow jem to produce proof of its deductible costs after trial,when jem had only produced an unsupported summary document of its costs prior to trial.while plaintiffs might consider this unfair,the district court decision was within its broad discretion.plaintiffs cite no legal support showing otherwise.
second,plaintiffs claim that jem introduced insufficient supporting documentation to sustain its burden to prove that it paid salespersons.the district court did not abuse its discretion by relying on the report by jem controller,linda lyth.lyth testified in her declaration as an expert,and in general,experts need not disclose all underlying documents on which they rely.see.for the same reason,we reject plaintiffs objection to jem gross margin invoice summary register.
third,plaintiffs challenge the deduction for discounts given to retailers.the district court considered jem agreements with retailers showing their respective discounts.the dollar value of retailer discounts was reached by multiplying these rates by the total sales.contrary to plaintiffs argument,jem did not need to submit proof that the retailers used their discounts,when there was no evidence that they did not do so.it would be reasonable to infer that the retailers took advantage of wholesale markdowns when they contracted for them,a matter within the district court discretion.see playboy,at.
finally,plaintiffs argue that jem did not prove that the per garment processing cost jem paid its affiliate jem equipment was competitive.however,the law does not require that an infringer prove its expenses were competitive in addition to proving it actually incurred them.
increased profits 
plaintiffs also argue that the district court abused its discretion by declining to award increased profits.the district court has discretion to increase the profit award above the net profits proven i f the court shall find the amount of the recovery inadequate.a.it must apply principles of equity,and ensure that the defendant may not retain the fruits,if any,of unauthorized trademark use or continue that use and the plaintiff is not given a windfall,bandag,at.the lanham act allows an award of profits only to the extent the award shall constitute compensation and not a penalty,edriver,cir quoting a.
the district court ought to tread lightly when deciding whether to award increased profits,because granting an increase could easily transfigure an compensatory award into an impermissible punitive measure.see skydive,quattrocchi,cir.generally,actual,proven profits will adequately compensate the plaintiff.because the profit disgorgement remedy is measured by the defendant gain,the district court should award actual,proven profits unless the defendant infringer gained more from the infringement than the defendant profits reflect.
plaintiffs have not presented evidence or argument to inspire a definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgement,playboy,at,in declining to award increased profits.while plaintiffs allude to defendants accruing goodwill from their infringement,they cite no supporting evidence.similarly,plaintiffs only cursorily explain how putative sales abroad might fall within the lanham act coverage under ocean garden,marktrade,cir.we will not manufacture arguments on their behalf or pick through the record without further direction.see greenwood faa,cir.nor do we find compelling the evidence plaintiffs cited to show that defendants concealed some of their profits.
given the district court wide scope of discretion in fashioning a remedy,faberge,saxony,cir internal quotation marks omitted,it did not err by denying plaintiffs an increased award of profits.
iii.the district court did not err in ordering defendants to pay attorneys fees.
the court in exceptional cases may award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party.a.we review an attorneys fee award for abuse of discretion,except that the district court legal determination that an action is exceptional under the lanham act we review de novo.secalt wuxi shenxi constr.mach,cir.
prevailing party 
the district court determined that plaintiffs were the prevailing party.a party is a prevailing party for purposes of an attorneys fee award if it achieved a material alteration in the legal relationship of the parties that is judicially sanctioned.klamath siskiyou wildlands,at internal quotation marks omitted the material alteration in the legal relationship of the parties must be relief that the prevailing party sought.id.a party need not succeed in all of its claims to be the prevailing party.san diego police officers ass san diego city emps.ret,cir.because plaintiffs obtained an injunction against all defendants and disgorgement of profits from,jem,and freeze,plaintiffs obtained a material alteration in the legal relationship of the parties that is judicially sanctioned.see klamath siskiyou wildlands,at thus,the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding plaintiffs were the prevailing party.
exceptional case 
the district court also held that the instant action was an exceptional case within the meaning of a as to all defendants.a case is considered exceptional when the infringement is malicious,fraudulent,deliberate,or willful.gracie,at internal quotation marks omitted.egregious conduct is not required,at.nor is bad faith.see earthquake sound bumper,cir.we consider the relief obtained,see,at,and whether the relevant area of law was unclear when the defendant conduct occurred,tamko roofing,ideal roofing,cir.
the district court properly considered the relevant evidence and held that defendants had acted willfully.see id.at.defendants argue that the uncertainty of the law makes infringement not willful.in this case,the uncertainty of the law weighs in defendants favor,but that consideration is only one aspect of the willfulness inquiry.there was significant evidence that defendants were aware their conduct conflicted with plaintiffs rights.rohan marley testified that valencia president and ceo of both and x one x approached him seeking a license to sell marley merchandise,which neither rohan nor hope road granted.roberto rabanne,a photographer who took pictures of bob marley,testified that valencia had convinced him to write a false email to help valencia negotiate with the marley family for a license.the email falsely stated that rabanne had used photographs of marley on merchandise during marley lifetime.rabanne also testified that he refused valencia request to backdate a photograph licensing agreement between them to or.according to rabanne,valencia claimed that backdating the agreement would help him in negotiations.valencia also asked rabanne to delete emails from him and files on his hard drive and said he would flood the market with marley merchandise so that plaintiffs could not use the photographs of marley anymore.liza acuna,licensing agent and valencia girlfriend,testified that she had known since that zion had the license for marley.thus,even considering the uncertainty of the law,this conduct exhibits a subjective belief that defendants conduct infringed plaintiffs intellectual property rights.
defendants also assert that the district court erred in finding the case exceptional,because plaintiffs achieved only limited success,and plaintiffs other awards make infringement unprofitable.we reject these contentions.while it is true that plaintiffs only prevailed on two of their five claims,they successfully enjoined defendants from any future merchandising of marley image and disgorged profits.the five claims were merely different means to that end.
regarding the next issue,whether conduct was rendered unprofitable is inapposite.the attorneys fee award served the separate purpose of encouraging the enforcement of trademark rights by more fully compensating plaintiffs.see id.at.thus,we affirm the district court award of attorneys fees against defendants.
declining to award attorneys fees as to jem and freeze 
plaintiffs claim that the district court abused its discretion by determining the case exceptional as to each defendant but then failing to assess attorneys fees against jem and freeze.however,the plain language of the statute allows the court to choose whether to award fees,even after finding the case exceptional.see a the court in exceptional cases may award fees.the fact that in exceptional cases precedes may means that the case must be exceptional for attorneys fees to be awarded,but in an exceptional case,the district court may or may not award fees.
plaintiffs also argue that the district court decision that the evidence of willfulness was sufficient to support the jury finding and the court statement that the evidence of jem willfulness was weak were in conflict.plaintiffs are wrong,because the sufficiency of the evidence standard is lower than the standard for showing a case is exceptional.see harper,at.thus,the court consistently concluded that evidence of jem willfulness was sufficient,yet too weak to merit an award of attorneys fees as to jem and freeze.
plaintiffs seemingly claim that the district court decision to not grant fees as to jem and freeze was illogical or inconsistent with its decision to grant fees as to defendants.plaintiffs claim that some of the bases on which the district court relied to deny fees as to jem and freeze also existed with respect to defendants prevailing on one lanham act claim,other monetary awards serve different purposes than an award of attorneys fees.however,the mere fact that the district court,after weighting the various considerations,awarded fees as to the a.defendants does not demonstrate that the district court was required to award fees as to the other defendants.on balance,the weightier evidence of defendants willfulness justified an award of fees.moreover,the district court pointed out that the evidence that jem and freeze caused actual damages was comparatively weak.
plaintiffs argument that the district court should not have relied on the award of profits to deny fees as to jem and freeze has some merit.a monetary award should support the decision to assess fees.see,at.however,the district court discussed the weight of the evidence of willfulness and actual damages at length and only mentioned profits briefly,apparently considering the underlying actions of the parties to be the main reason to deny fees as to jem and freeze.consequently,the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying attorneys fees as to jem and freeze.
iv.the district court did not err in granting summary judgment for defendants on plaintiffs nevada right of publicity claim.
the district court granted summary judgment in defendants favor on the basis that plaintiffs knew of a unauthorized commercial use of marley publicity right more than six months before plaintiffs registered this right with the nevada secretary of state.we review the district court interpretation of a state statute de novo.wetzel lou ehlers cadillac group long term disability ins.program,cir.
nevada law establishes a right of publicity in the name,voice,signature,photograph or likeness of every person,which lasts years after the person death.any commercial use by another of the name,voice,signature,photograph or likeness of a person requires the written consent of that person or his or her successor in interest,id,unless the person whose right of publicity is at issue dies and has no successors in interest.id.the right of publicity is freely transferable.id.
a successor in interest of a deceased person may file in the office of the secretary of state a verified application for registration of his or her claim.id.emphasis added.a successor in interest of a deceased person may not assert any right against any unauthorized commercial use of the deceased person name,voice,signature,photograph or likeness that begins before the filing of an application to register his or her claim.id.
a person,firm or corporation seeking to use the name,voice,signature,photograph or likeness of a deceased person for commercial purposes must first make a reasonable effort,in good faith,to discover the identity of any person who qualifies as a successor in interest to the deceased person.a person claiming to be a successor in interest to a deceased person must,within months after the date he or she becomes aware or should reasonably have become aware of an unauthorized commercial use of the deceased person name,voice,signature,photograph or likeness,register a claim with the secretary of state pursuant to subsection.failure to register shall be deemed a waiver of any right of publicity.
id.emphasis added.the district court relied on this last sentence to hold that plaintiffs had waived marley publicity rights as against any defendant for any unauthorized use.plaintiffs became aware of the unauthorized use of marley publicity rights by someone other than defendants,and plaintiffs failed to register their claim within the next six months.plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in its interpretation of the statute,because the registration requirement applies with respect to each unauthorized use,and plaintiffs registered their rights either before or within six months after learning of defendants unauthorized use.
there is no nevada case law interpreting this registration timeliness requirement.thus,we must seek to predict how the nevada high court would resolve the matter.giles motors acceptance,cir.accordingly,we must construe the statute to give effect to the legislature intent,beginning with the plain statutory text,and giving effect to any unambiguous language.richardson,clark cnty.sch.if the statutory language is ambiguous,the panel should examine the statute in the context of the entire statutory scheme,reason,and public policy to effect a construction that reflects the legislature intent.id.
beginning with the text at issue,f ailure to register shall be deemed a waiver of any right of publicity is unambiguous.see.a ny right of publicity indicates that the forfeiture is broad,not limited to the particular unauthorized use a plaintiff became aware of six months or more before.even assuming ambiguity,the context,reason,and public policy align with the district court interpretation.section provides for permissive registration without reference to the successor in interest knowledge of any unauthorized use.the successor in interest may only enforce its rights with respect to unauthorized use that occurred after registration.id.however,upon learning of an unauthorized use,registration becomes mandatory.see id.thus,the permissive and mandatory descriptions are in harmony,as they apply to different situations.read together,they encourage successors in interest to register sooner rather than later.
plaintiffs argue that the legislature only intended to create a system to perfect successor rights in through.if this were so,the difference in language would not make sense.section penalizes failure to register by not allowing the successor to assert any right against unauthorized use that occurred prior to registration.in contrast,penalizes failure to register by deeming a waiver of any right of publicity.if the legislature meant that the successor merely could not assert its right but still retains it,it seems the legislature would have used language parallel to that in.moreover,refers to any right of publicity,implying the right itself,not the right to assert claims based on the right of publicity.
plaintiffs also argue that the purpose of the statute is to bestow rights,not forfeit them.of course this is broadly true.however,the legislature apparently intended to limit a successor right.the successor right extinguishes years after the person death.id.also,living persons enforcing their own rights to publicity do not ever have to register their rights.see id.thus,the registration requirement is in line with the qualified nature of rights allowed successors under the statute.
v.there was sufficient evidence to support the jury verdict on the interference claim.
liability for the tort of intentional interference with prospective economic advantage requires proof of the following elements a prospective contractual relationship between the plaintiff and a third party knowledge by the defendant of the prospective relationship intent to harm the plaintiff by preventing the relationship the absence of privilege or justification by the defendant and actual harm to the plaintiff as a result of the defendant conduct.
wichinsky mosa.
with respect to plaintiffs prospective relationship with walmart,defendants claim there was insufficient evidence to support the fifth element whether plaintiffs were harmed as a result of defendants conduct at trial,doreen crujeiras,a licensing agent for hope road,testified to the following hybrid was an apparel manufacturer and one of hope road marley merchandise licensees that generally sold apparel at k mart,target,and walmart.hybrid lost an order intended for walmart.jem,a licensee of,got the order instead.this order was units of and units of hoodies.the gross sales would have been like million dollar s,and hope road royalty on those sales would have been about.
defendants do not assert that they offered evidence contradicting crujeiras testimony on this point.rather,they argue that they impeached crujeiras testimony.crujeiras admitted she could not remember exactly who told her about the lost order.also,defense counsel asked crujeiras,y ou do have any knowledge that or anybody from the defendants went in and undercut hybrid efforts to sell to walmart crujeiras answered,well,i did have that one conversation with the owner of hybrid.it was a conference call that i participated on.and he was very upset and he did say that,you know,it was a problem for him.crujeiras cryptic answer could give rise to an inference that she had no basis for believing defendants were responsible for the lost order,and that she actively avoided admitting that.however,her answer could also be
