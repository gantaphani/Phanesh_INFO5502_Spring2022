appellants brought this diversity action against abercrombie and fitch abercrombie for publishing a photograph of them,with identification of their names,for abercrombie commercial benefit without the appellants authorization.they allege a violation of california common law and statutory prohibition against misappropriation of a person name and likeness for commercial purposes,a violation of the lanham act for confusion and deception indicating sponsorship of abercrombie goods,and a claim for negligence and defamation.the district court entered summary judgment for abercrombie,holding that their california state claims were foreclosed because abercrombie use of the photograph was protected by the first amendment,and those claims were also preempted by the federal copyright act that hawaii law was the proper choice of law for some of these claims that the lanham act claim was precluded by the first amendment and it was also precluded by the nominative fair use doctrine and that there was insufficient evidence to sustain the negligence or defamation claims.the district court had jurisdiction under,and we have appellate jurisdiction under.we reverse the grant of summary judgment and remand for trial.
background 
factual background 
abercrombie is an outfitter catering to young people.the upscale retailer sells casual apparel for men and women,including shirts,khakis,jeans,and outerwear.in addition to sales in approximately stores nationwide,abercrombie also sells merchandise through its subscription catalog,the abercrombie and fitch quarterly quarterly.
the quarterly is abercrombie largest advertising vehicle.it accounts for approximately of abercrombie overall advertising budget.the primary purpose of the quarterly is to build brand awareness and increase sales.each issue is over pages in length and embraces a theme such as collegiate lifestyle,back to school,or winter wear.the quarterly contains photographs of models wearing abercrombie garments as well as pictures of the clothing displayed for sale.in addition,approximately of each issue is devoted to stories,news and other editorial pieces.
in,michael jeffries,abercrombie ceo,developed a surfing theme for the upcoming quarterly.abercrombie held the photo shoot for the upcoming issue at san onofre beach,california.while at the photo shoot,abercrombie employees sam shahid and savas abadsidis looked through a compilation of surfing photographs by surf photographer leroy grannis.the photo book contained a picture of appellants which grannis had taken at the makaha international surf championship in hawaii.sam shahid purchased the photograph,along with three other photographs from the book,for each.leroy grannis then handwrote the names of appellants at the bottom of the photograph.
subsequently,sam shahid showed appellants photograph to jeffries who decided to use the photograph in the upcoming quarterly.abercrombie did not obtain appellants permission.jeffries also decided to create,exactly like those worn by the appellants in the photograph,for sale in the upcoming issue.abercrombie labeled the final heat tees.the were advertised for sale in the quarterly.
the spring quarterly,spring fever,contains a section entitled surf nekkid.the surf nekkid section includes an article recounting the history of surfing.abercrombie also included a story,entitled your beach should be this cool,describing the history of old man beach at san onofre,california.the following page exhibits the photograph of appellants.the two pages immediately thereafter feature the final heat tees.
the spring fever issue contains other articles about the surfing lifestyle.an article entitled beachcombing documents the efforts of the surfrider foundation,an ecological group founded by surfers.still another article entitled where the wild things are,written by the editor of surfer magazine,describes various surfer types.also contained in the issue is an interview of nat young,former world surfing champion and the first professional surfer.the interview is accompanied by photographs of young and his son wearing abercrombie clothing.
ii.procedural history 
on april,appellants george downing,paul strauch,rick steere,richard buffalo keaulana,and ben aipa filed a complaint in the united states district court for the central district of california.appellants later amended the complaint to add joey cabell and mike doyle.appellants alleged that abercrombie misappropriated their names and likenesses in violation of california statutory and common law protections against commercial misappropriation,that the publication of the photograph in the catalog violated the lanham act and they alleged claims for negligence and defamation.subsequently,appellants and abercrombie both filed motions for summary judgment.the district court entered summary judgment for abercrombie.appellants timely appealed.abercrombie then filed a motion for attorneys fees and other expenses.the district court granted the motion,awarding abercrombie approximately of the attorneys fees that it sought.appellants timely filed a notice of appeal from that order.we consolidated the two appeals.
on appeal,appellants contend abercrombie use of the photograph is not protected under the first amendment the state law publicity claims are not preempted by the copyright act california law is the proper choice of law for the claim under california civil code triable issues of fact exist with regard to the lanham act claims triable issues of fact exist with regard to the defamation claim the district court erred in denying the motion for a continuance the district court erred in awarding attorneys fees and costs to abercrombie 
standard of review 
the district court grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo.botosan paul mcnally realty,cir.we must determine,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,whether there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied the relevant substantive law.lopez smith,cir en banc.
first amendment and right of publicity claims 
the district court concluded that abercrombie use of the photograph containing appellants names and likenesses was proper because it constituted expression protected under the first amendment.we disagree.
california has long recognized a common law right of privacy for protection of a person name and likeness against appropriation by others for their advantage.see eastwood superior court,d.to sustain a common law cause of action for commercial misappropriation,a plaintiff must prove the defendant use of the plaintiff identity the appropriation of plaintiff name or likeness to defendant advantage,commercially or otherwise lack of consent and resulting injury.id.at.
in addition to the common law cause of action,california has provided a statutory remedy for commercial misappropriation under california civil code.the remedies provided for under california civil code complement the common law cause of action they do not replace or codify the common law.see newcombe adolf coors,cir.section provides in relevant part,any person who knowingly uses another name,voice,signature,photograph,or likeness,in any manner for purposes of advertising without such person prior consent shall be liable for any damages sustained by the person.cal.a.under section,a plaintiff must prove all the elements of the common law cause of action.in addition,the plaintiff must allege a knowing use by the defendant as well as a direct connection between the alleged use and the commercial purpose.see eastwood,d at.
under both the common law cause of action and the statutory cause of action no cause of action will lie for the publication of matters in the public interest,which rests on the right of the public to know and the freedom of the press to tell it.montana san jose mercury news,th,d.this first amendment defense extends to almost all reporting of recent events,as well as to publications about people who,by their accomplishments,mode of living,professional standing or calling,create a legitimate and widespread attention to their activities.eastwood,d at.however,the defense is not absolute we must find a proper accommodation between the competing concerns of freedom of speech and the right of publicity.id.
in the instant case,abercrombie defends on the basis of the first amendment arguing that the photograph illustrates an article about surfing,a matter in the public interest.to support its defense,abercrombie relies on dora frontline video,th,d.in dora,the court held that a surfing documentary was in the public interest because it was about a certain time and place in california history and,indeed,in american legend.id.at.dora involved a surfing legend,mickey dora,who sued the producer of a video documentary on surfing claiming common law and statutory appropriation of his name and likeness.see id.at,d.the trial court entered summary judgment for the film producer and the california court of appeal affirmed.see id.in addressing the first amendment issue,the court found that the documentary was about a matter of public interest,specifically surfing,and,therefore,the producer was protected by the defense.see id.at,d.in so concluding the court stated 
surfing is of more than passing interest to some.it has created a that influences speech,behavior,dress,and entertainment,among other things.a phenomenon of such scope has an economic impact,because it affects purchases,travel,and the housing market.surfing has also had a significant influence on the popular culture,and in that way touches many people.it would be difficult to conclude that a surfing documentary does not fall within the category of public affairs.
although the theme of abercrombie catalog was surfing and surf culture,a matter of public interest,the use of appellants names and pictures is quite different from that involved in the dora case.in dora,mickey dora contribution to the development of the surf and his influence on the sport was the point of the program.id.at,d.dora was depicted in the documentary because his identity directly contributed to the story about surfing which came within the protected public interest.
in the current action,there is a tenuous relationship between appellants photograph and the theme presented.abercrombie used appellants photograph essentially as to advance the catalog.the catalog did not explain that appellants were legends of the sport and did not in any way connect appellants with the story preceding it.in fact,the catalog incorrectly identifies where and when the photograph was taken.we conclude that the illustrative use of appellants photograph does not contribute significantly to a matter of the public interest and that abercrombie can not avail itself of the first amendment defense accordingly,we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of abercrombie.
ii.federal copyright preemption 
abercrombie contends that its right to reproduce and publish the photograph of the appellants is governed by the federal copyright act,and that appellants state law claims are preempted by federal copyright law.
w hen acting within constitutional limits,congress is empowered to state law by so stating in express terms.california fed.sav.loan ass guerra,d.under,states are expressly prohibited from legislating in the area of copyright law in order for preemption to occur under the federal copyright act,two conditions must be satisfied.first,the content of the protected right must fall within the subject matter of copyright as described in and.second,the right asserted under state law must be equivalent to the exclusive rights contained in section of the copyright act.see del madera properties rhodes gardner,cir overruled on other grounds.
the subject matter protected by the copyright act is set forth in,which provides in relevant part as follows 
copyright protection subsists in original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression,now known or later developed,from which they can be perceived,reproduced,or otherwise communicated,either directly or with the aid of a machine or device.works of authorship include pictorial,graphic,and sculptural works.
section provides that the subject matter specified in also includes compilations and derivative works,but the copyright in a compilation or derivative work extends only to the material contributed by the author of such works as distinguished from the preexisting material employed in the work.section gives the copyright holder exclusive rights to copy the copyrighted work or derivatives and to distribute it to the public.
the photograph itself,as a pictorial work of authorship,is subject matter protected by the copyright act.see providing that pictorial,graphic,and sculptural works include photographs.however,it is not the publication of the photograph itself,as a creative work of authorship,that is the basis for appellants claims,but rather,it is the use of the appellants likenesses and their names pictured in the published photograph.the nimmer treatise on copyright law states 
t he work that is the subject matter of the right of publicity is the persona,the name and likeness of a celebrity or other individual.a persona can hardly be said to constitute a writing of an author within the meaning of the copyright clause of the constitution.a fortiori it is not a work of authorship under the act.such name or likeness does not become a work of authorship simply because it is embodied in a copyrightable work such as a photograph.
nimmer on copyright b c at.the same point is made in mccarthy treatise on right of publicity and privacy 
the subject matter of a right of publicity claim is not a particular picture or photograph of plaintiff.rather,what is protected by the right of publicity is the very identity or persona of the plaintiff as a human being while copyright in a given photograph may be owned by the person depicted in it,the exact image in that photograph is not the underlying right asserted in a right of publicity case.to argue that the photograph is identical with the person is to confuse illusion and illustration with reality.thus,assertion of infringement of the right of publicity because of defendant unpermitted commercial use of a picture of plaintiff is not assertion of infringement of copyrightable subject matter in one photograph of plaintiff.
mccarthy,rights of publicity and privacy c at.
a recent case in the fifth circuit held that the texas tort of misappropriation,which provides protection from the unauthorized appropriation of one name,image,or likeness was not preempted by the copyright act.see brown ames,cir.the case involved a record company misappropriation of the names and likenesses of individual musicians,song writers,and music producers on the company cd,tapes,catalogs,and posters.see id.at.the court stated that the tort of misappropriation of a name or likeness protects a person persona.a persona does not fall within the subject matter of copyright.id.at.thus,the court held that preemption does not apply.
a similar result was reached in a case decided by a california court of appeal,knb enterprises matthews,th,d.the california court of appeal held that the state law right of publicity claims were not preempted by the copyright act.see id.at,d.the copyright owner of erotic photographs,which had been displayed without authorization and for profit on an internet website,brought suit against the website operator asserting a misappropriation claim under california civil code.see id.at,d.the court applied the test for determining preemption and found that neither condition had been met.see id.at,d.the court found that because a human likeness is not copyrightable,even if captured in a copyrighted photograph,the models section claims against the unauthorized publisher of their photographs are not the equivalent of a copyright infringement claim and are not preempted by federal copyright law.id.at,d.
we agree with the approach taken by the fifth circuit and the reasoning employed in knb enterprises.the subject matter of appellants statutory and common law right of publicity claims is their names and likenesses.see newcombe,at.a person name or likeness is not a work of authorship within the meaning of.this is true notwithstanding the fact that appellants names and likenesses are embodied in a copyrightable photograph.the same concept is specifically embodied in,which provides that the copyright in derivative works extends only to the material contributed by the author as distinguished from preexisting material employed in the work 
the second requirement for copyright preemption as noted above is that the right asserted under state law must be equivalent to the exclusive rights contained in of the copyright act.this requirement also is not met.because the subject matter of the appellants statutory and common law right of publicity claims is their names and likenesses,which are not copyrightable,the claims are not equivalent to the exclusive rights contained in.
iii.choice of law 
we review de novo a district court decision concerning the appropriate choice of law.abogados,cir.in reviewing the factual findings that underlie the choice of law determination,this court must apply the clearly erroneous standard.contact lumber moges shipping,cir.
applying choice of law principles,the district court dismissed appellants statutory misappropriation claim as to the five appellants who reside in hawaii george downing,rick steere,richard keaulana,ben aipa,and joey cabell.we conclude that the district court erred in dismissing these claims.
in a diversity case,federal courts apply the substantive law of the forum in which the court is located,including the forum choice of law rules.insurance of north am.federal express,cir.this action was brought in a district court in california.therefore,we look to the choice of law rules applied in that state.
california applies a governmental interest analysis to questions the court examines the substantive laws of each jurisdiction to determine whether the laws differ as applied to the relevant transaction,if the laws do differ,the court must determine whether a true conflict exists in that each of the relevant jurisdictions has an interest in having its law applied,and if more than one jurisdiction has a legitimate interest the court must identify and apply the law of the state whose interest would be more impaired if its law were not applied.abogados,at liew official receiver liquidator,cir.only if both states have a legitimate but conflicting interest in applying its own law will the court be confronted with a true conflict case.see insurance of north,at.
the california supreme court decision in hurtado superior court,cal d,is the primary case setting forth california choice of law rules and analyzing the approach to be taken in determining the interest of each jurisdiction in enforcing its own law.in that case,a wrongful death action had been brought in california,where the automobile accident causing the death had occurred.the plaintiffs were residents of mexico and the defendants residents of california.mexican law placed a limitation on the amount that could be received in a wrongful death action pesos or whereas california law provided no such limitation.see id.at.the california supreme court stated 
generally speaking the forum will apply its own rule of decision unless a party litigant timely invokes the law of a foreign state.in such event he must demonstrate that the latter rule of decision will further the interest of the foreign state and therefore that it is an appropriate one for the forum to apply to the case before it.in the case at bench,california as the forum should apply its own measure of damages for wrongful death,unless mexico has an interest in having its measure of damages applied.
id.at citations omitted.in assessing the interest of california in applying its law the court stated 
it is manifest that one of the primary purposes of a state in creating a cause of action in the heirs for the wrongful death of the decedent is to deter the kind of conduct within its borders which wrongfully takes life.it is also abundantly clear that a cause of action for wrongful death without any limitation as to the amount of recoverable damages strengthens the deterrent aspect of the civil sanction the sting of unlimited recovery more effectively penalize s the culpable defendant and deter s it and others similarly situated from such future conduct.
id.at internal quotations and citations omitted.the court went on to emphasize that the interest in deterrence of conduct extends to all persons within its borders.id.at.
with regard to the interest mexico had in applying its law,the california supreme court stated that t he interest of a state in a tort rule limiting damages for wrongful death is to protect defendants from excessive financial burdens or exaggerated claims.a state by enacting a limitation on damages is seeking to protect its residents from the imposition of these excessive financial burdens.id.at citations omitted.the california supreme court then summarized its holding 
to recapitulate,we hold that where as here in a california action both this state as the forum and a foreign state or country are potentially concerned in a question of choice of law with respect to an issue in tort and it appears that the foreign state or country has no interest whatsoever in having its own law applied,california as the forum should apply california law.
the california supreme court ruling in the hurtado tort case is directly applicable to this case.abercrombie distributed its spring quarterly in california,and any misappropriation of the names and likenesses of the appellants would have occurred there.as the court stated,one of the primary purposes of creating a cause of action in tort is to deter misconduct within its borders by persons present within its borders.by distributing its catalog within california,abercrombie was operating within its borders.
hawaii,on the other hand,like mexico in hurtado,had no interest in limiting the extent of relief that its residents could obtain for a wrongful act against them in california.it is even more clear in this case because hawaii did not place any limitation on recovery instead it simply did not provide for the extent of relief california does in this type of action.it is pure fancy to believe that hawaii would wish to restrict its residents from recovery that others could obtain in california solely because it had not enacted a statute like california to complement its common law action for the same offense.hawaii had no interest in having its law applied to this action brought in california.
the california supreme court has made it clear that when california has an interest in enforcing its law within its borders and a foreign state in this case hawaii has no interest in having its law applied,then the law of california should be applied.in this case,there is no true conflict of hawaii law with california law,and thus the district court erred when it applied hawaii law to some claims.california law is applicable to all of appellants claims.
iv.lanham act 
appellants contend that the district court erred in denying their claim under section a of the lanham act,a.in relevant part section a a provides 
a ny person who,or in connection with any goods or services,uses any false or misleading representation of fact,which is likely to cause confusion,or to cause mistake,or deceive as to the affiliation,connection or association of such person with another person,or as to the origin,sponsorship,or approval of his or her goods,services,or commercial activities by another person shall be liable in a civil action by any person who believes that he or she is or is likely to be damaged by such act.
in several past cases involving celebrity plaintiffs we have looked to our decision in amf,sleekcraft boats,cir,for the appropriate factors to consider in determining whether there exists a likelihood of confusion.the factors enumerated in amf are 
strength of the plaintiff mark 
relatedness of the goods 
similarity of the marks 
evidence of actual confusion 
marketing channels used 
likely degree of purchaser care 
defendant intent in selecting the mark and 
likelihood of expansion of the product lines.
in our celebrity cases using the amf factors we have adapted these factors so as to be applicable to the ce
