beck,and consulting,llc,both provide consulting services and produce reports used to obtain financing for projects.reports prepared by both beck and have contained sections entitled principal considerations and assumptions used in the projection of operating results,vol.i at report prepared by beck id.at report prepared by.beck sued in the united states district court for the district of colorado because language in that section of an report repeated verbatim much of the language in that section of earlier beck reports that beck had copyrighted.the suit raised a claim for copyright infringement under the federal copyright act,see et,and three claims under colorado law unfair competition,unjust enrichment,and deceptive trade practices.
moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim.see.b.because the motion and beck response referred to materials outside the pleadings,the district court treated the motion as one for summary judgment.see.d.the court then granted summary judgment to on all claims.we have jurisdiction under.
we affirm the judgment on the and claims because they are preempted by the copyright act.we affirm the judgment on the claim because beck can not establish that the alleged deceptive practice significantly impacted the public.as for the copyright claim,first defends the favorable summary judgment by arguing on appeal that most of the language at issue in the copyrighted beck reports is not protected by copyright law because beck took it from a report that predated beck copyrighted reports and that even if the language in beck copyrighted reports was taken from earlier beck reports,the language in those earlier reports was not protected because it had not been copyrighted and had entered the public domain.we reject these grounds for affirmance because beck created genuine disputes of material fact by presenting evidence that beck did not take the language in its copyrighted reports from the report relied upon by and that the copyrighted reports derived their language from earlier beck reports and internal documents that were themselves copyrighted by beck and whose language had not entered the public domain.also defends the copyright summary judgment on the ground that the allegedly copied language can not be protected by copyright law because it serves functional purposes and copyright protects only expression,not ideas.the district court apparently relied in part on this ground in granting summary judgment,but it did so sua sponte had not argued the point below.although argument may be meritorious,we refrain from so deciding on this appeal,believing that beck should be afforded the opportunity to respond to this argument in district court.we therefore reverse the summary judgment on the copyright claim and remand for further proceedings.
beck also contends on appeal that the district court erred in denying its motion under federal rule of civil procedure f to permit more discovery before acting on motion.but because of the grounds for our disposition of the various claims,we need not address the merits of this issue.
background 
beck and are competing firms that provide services in connection with the financing of projects such as the construction of facilities that convert solid waste to energy.in the typical course of business,an investment bank may engage beck or to study a project in need of financing.after analyzing the associated technical,environmental,regulatory and commercial aspects of the project,the consulting firm memorializes its findings and conclusions in an independent engineer report,vol.i at.that report is included in a prospectus presented to potential investors.
this lawsuit arises out of the creation of one such report by in february.two months earlier calyon corporate and investment bank had engaged in connection with the financing of two cogeneration plants owned by windsor financing,llc.memorialized its findings and conclusions with respect to the project in an independent engineer report the windsor report,which was distributed to potential institutional investors.
beck contends that the section in windsor report entitled principal considerations and assumptions used in the projection of operating results,id.at,was copied from similar sections included in beck reports dating back to.beck complaint attached a copy of the relevant section from windsor report certificates of copyright registration for two of its independent engineer report for the sacramento power authority cogeneration project the sacramento report,and the independent engineer report for the orange cogeneration limited partnership project the orange report and the section of its orange report entitled principal considerations and assumptions used in the projection of operating results.id.at.
the opening paragraph of the relevant section in windsor report states 
in the preparation of this report and the opinions that follow,we have made certain considerations and assumptions with respect to conditions that may exist or events that may occur in the future.while we believe these assumptions to be reasonable for the purpose of this report,they are dependent upon future events,and actual conditions may differ from those assumed.in addition,we have used and relied upon certain information provided to us by sources which we believe to be reliable.we believe the use of such information and assumptions is reasonable for the purposes of this report however,actual conditions may vary due to unanticipated events and circumstances.to the extent that future conditions differ from those assumed herein or represented to us by others,the actual results will vary from those forecast.this report summarizes the results of our work through the date of this report,thus,changed conditions occurring or becoming known after such date could affect the material and projections presented.
id.at we have emphasized the language that matches language in beck orange report.the section then lists considerations and assumptions upon which based its conclusions it is followed by the final section of the report,which states conclusions regarding the project.
the opening paragraph of the relevant section in beck orange report provides 
in the preparation of this report and the opinions that follow,we have made certain assumptions with respect to conditions which may exist or events which may occur in the future.while we believe these assumptions to be reasonable for the purpose of this report,they are dependent upon future events,and actual conditions may differ from those assumed.in addition,we have used and relied upon certain information provided to us by sources which we believe to be reliable.however,some assumptions may vary significantly due to unanticipated events and circumstances.to the extent that actual future conditions differ from those assumed herein or provided to us by others,the actual results will vary from those forecast.this report summarizes our work up to the date of the report.thus,changed conditions occurring or becoming known after such date could affect the material presented to the extent of such changes.
id.at emphasis added.the section proceeds to list considerations and assumptions used by beck in reaching its conclusions it is followed by the final section of the report,which,as in the windsor report,states beck conclusions regarding the project.
presented evidence,however,that the language in the sacramento and orange reports was not original to beck.paul plath,now the senior vice president of,was previously employed by beck.according to his declaration in this case,he was involved in the preparation of both the sacramento and orange reports.in beck was hired by the sacramento municipal utility district smud to be the independent engineer in connection with the financing of two power plants.smud and goldman sachs,the lead investment bank for the project,had obtained financing for a similar project the year before.black veatch corporation had been the independent engineer for that project.plath asserts that a representative of goldman sachs gave him a copy of the report that black veatch had prepared and indicated that he wanted beck to follow its form and content.plath further asserts that as primary author of two reports prepared in connection with the smud project,he utilized the black veatch report as a template in preparing the reports,id.at,one of which is the sacramento report.
the black veatch report includes a section entitled assumptions,which resembles the comparable section in both the orange report and the windsor report.id.at.the opening paragraph of that section states 
black veatch has used and relied upon certain information provided by the owner,the developer,smud,and others in this assessment of the project.we believe the information provided is true and correct and reasonable for the purposes of this report.in preparing this report and the opinions presented herein,black veatch has made certain assumptions with respect to conditions which may exist,or events which may occur in the future.we believe that the use of this information and assumptions is reasonable for purposes of this report.however,some events may occur or circumstances change,which can not be foreseen or controlled by black veatch,and which may render our assumptions incorrect.to the extent that actual future conditions differ from those assumed herein or provided to black veatch by others,the actual results will differ from those which have been forecast in this report.this report summarizes black veatch assessment of the project as of the date of this report.
id.as with both the orange report and the windsor report,the section then lists the considerations and assumptions upon which black veatch conclusions are based,and the section is followed by the final section of the report,which lists black veatch conclusions.
regarding the orange report,plath declaration states that in beck was engaged by cs first boston to act as the independent engineer in connection with the financing of the orange cogeneration limited partnership project.plath asserts that before leaving beck in,he was involved in the preparation of the resulting orange report.according to plath,cs first boston requested that beck use the sacramento report as a template for the orange report,and therefore an electronic version of one of the sacramento project reports was used as a template for the orange report to the extent possible.id.at.
beck disputes plath version of events.kenneth marino,a principal and senior director of beck,signed a declaration contending that plath would not have been permitted to copy the black veatch report when preparing the sacramento report.michael gaines,another beck senior director,signed a declaration to the same effect.gaines declaration states that beck created an internal training manual in september the manual t o document the legal,risk management and professional practice issues which had been identified and addressed by it in the previous several decades based on its experience from serving as consulting engineer in the financing of municipal electrical facility projects,vol.ii at.the manual sets forth guidelines for beck employees to follow when performing consulting services and issuing reports.it notes the importance of collecting all of beck principal assumptions and considerations in one location for the use by financial analysts,id.at,and includes a sample introductory paragraph for use in the section on considerations and assumptions.the sample states 
in the preparation of this report and the opinions that follow,we have made certain assumptions with respect to conditions which may occur in the future.while we believe these assumptions are reasonable for the purpose of this report,they are dependent upon future events and actual conditions may differ from those assumed.in addition,we have used and relied upon certain information provided to us by others.while we believe the sources to be reliable,we have not independently verified the information and offer no assurances with respect thereto.to the extent that actual future conditions differ from those assumed herein or provided to us by others,the actual results will vary from those forecast.the principal considerations and assumptions made by us and the principal information provided to us by others include the following 
id.at.the manual then sets forth several sample considerations and assumptions.
gaines declaration further states that in beck incorporated this standard language into a document entitled standards of the practice.id.at.the document directs beck employees to use form language in certain sections of its reports.the sample introduction for the section entitled principal assumptions and considerations,uses language quite similar to that included in the manual.id.at.marino asserts that only qualified reviewers would have had the authority to deviate from the standard language and format set forth in beck manual and standards of the practice and because plath had never achieved the status of qualified reviewer,he would not have been authorized to take language from the black veatch report.
in addition,marino asserts that between and beck prepared a number of reports that included standard language set forth in its manual and standards of the practice.he quotes several such reports,which are attached to his declaration,all of which contain a section on principal considerations and assumptions.the attached reports all predate the black veatch report.
finally,beck presented evidence that it had copyrighted and placed copyright notices on these earlier reports.marino asserts that beck has copyrighted the expression used in its reports since the.id.at.beck internal manual,a copy of which is included in the record,displays a copyright notice from.and a guideline in beck standards of the practice requires that all beck reports be copyrighted and include a copyright notice.although beck standards of the practice was first issued in,after several of its earlier reports were created,gaines declaration states that the document memorialized beck policy and procedure that had been in place since the.id.at.presented no evidence that beck earlier reports had not been copyrighted or that they did not include copyright notices,although no copyright notice appears on the excerpts in the record from beck reports that predate the black veatch report.
ii.discussion 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.pignanelli pueblo sch.dist,cir.summary judgment should only be granted where,taking the facts in the light most favorable to the party,there is no genuine issue of material fact,and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see.c.
copyright infringement 
beck primary contention is that a section in windsor report entitled principal considerations and assumptions used in the projection of operating results,vol.i at,infringes the copyrights in beck sacramento and orange reports because its language is substantially similar to language in identically named sections of those reports.to prevail on its claim beck must establish that it possesses valid copyrights in the sacramento and orange reports,and that copied protected elements of the reports.see country kids n city slicks,sheen,cir.this second element involves two distinct inquiries whether,as a factual matter,copied beck reports,and whether,as a mixed issue of fact and law,those elements that were copied were protected.id.does not dispute that beck possesses a valid copyright in both reports.nor does dispute that it copied the reports as a factual matter.sole contention is that beck reports are almost entirely unprotected.first,it argues that the reports are unprotected because they were derived from earlier works that had been produced by third parties or that had entered the public domain.second,it argues that the allegedly copied language in the reports is unprotected because it is merely functional language conveying ideas that can be expressed in only a few ways.we proceed to explain why we reject these arguments.
unoriginality and public domain 
in district court argument focused on the proposition that all but an inconsequential portion of the language in the relevant sections of beck sacramento and orange reports was not protected by copyright law because it was unoriginal.motion to dismiss asserted that the language relied upon by beck was taken from the black veatch report,and was thus not original to beck.after beck responded with evidence that it had a policy against adopting a competitor language and that the language in the black veatch report had appeared in beck reports and internal documents that predated the black veatch report,argued that it would still follow that the language in the sacramento and orange reports was unoriginal to those reports and hence not protected.in a footnote in reply brief in support of its motion to dismiss,it asserted that beck had failed to provide any evidence that the language in its earlier reports and internal documents had not passed into the public domain,noting that material published before february,ordinarily was deemed to be dedicated to the public if it lacked a copyright notice.see a melville nimmer david nimmer,nimmer on copyright matthew bender,ed.once the unoriginal or publicly dedicated content was eliminated,argued,any remaining similarity between beck sacramento and orange reports and windsor report was de minimis.
perhaps could prevail on its unoriginality argument at trial,but it was not entitled to summary judgment on this basis.although produced evidence that the pertinent language in the sacramento and orange reports had been copied by plath from the black veatch report and was thus unoriginal to beck,beck countered with declarations of two managing employees who asserted that plath would not have been permitted to copy a report.moreover,beck employees authenticated beck reports and internal documents predating the black veatch report that contained essentially the same pertinent language as the sacramento and orange reports.thus,there is a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether that language in the sacramento and orange reports was original to beck.
as for fallback even if the disputed language can be traced back to earlier beck reports and internal documents,the language is not protected because it has entered the public again has some evidence,and the law,on its side.beck produced evidence that it had copyrighted its earlier reports and internal documents and had affixed copyright notices to them.if that evidence is correct and we must assume that it is when considering motion,then the earlier language did not enter the public domain.the statutory language on which relies would deprive a work of copyright protection only if it was published before february,without a copyright notice.see a nimmer on copyright,supra a,at.and if the same party owns a copyright in both a derivative is a work based upon one or more preexisting works,the underlying work that is incorporated in the derivative work,registration of a copyright in the derivative work is sufficient to permit an infringement action on either the preexisting unoriginal material or on any newly contributed material.see christopher phelps,llc galloway,cir streetwise maps,vandam,cir b ecause the plaintiff is the owner of the copyright of both the derivative and work,the registration certificate relating to the derivative work in this circumstance will suffice to permit it to maintain an action for infringement based on defendants infringement of the work.nimmer on copyright,supra b c,at.but oravec sunny isles luxury ventures,cir plaintiff claimed that defendants construction of buildings violated his copyright in a model protected as an architectural work.see a.but copyright registration of model was as a pictorial,graphic,or sculptural work,id.a,and registration did not identify any preexisting architectural work,so claim failed.
thus,if the language in the relevant sections of the sacramento and orange reports originated in beck earlier reports and internal documents,beck registration of copyrights in the sacramento and orange reports would be sufficient to permit an infringement action founded either on the material that had been taken from beck earlier reports and internal documents or on any material newly contributed to the sacramento and orange reports.accordingly,we can not affirm the summary judgment on the copyright claim on the basis of unoriginality and arguments.
protection of ideas functionality and merger doctrines 
argues on appeal that beck claim must fail because it is an attempt to protect ideas rather than expression.relies on b of the copyright act,which states in no case does copyright protection for an original work of authorship extend to any idea,procedure,process,system,method of operation,concept,principle,or discovery,regardless of the form in which it is described,explained,illustrated,or embodied in such work.contends that beck can not protect t he ideas of disclaimer,qualification of assumptions and identification of risk factors that appear in beck reports.aplee.br.at.applying the merger doctrine,argues that because these ideas may only be expressed in a limited number of ways,id.at,the ideas merge with the manner of expression so that the actual words not protected by the copyright act.beck words,says,are merely functional and unprotectable.id.at.
we will briefly discuss the legal concepts on which relies.as will be apparent from that discussion,there is considerable force in argument.nevertheless,we are not persuaded that we should affirm its summary judgment on this ground.in fairness,beck should have an opportunity to respond further in district court.
we begin with functionality.when a work describes how to perform a task a function,there is no copyright protection for the knowledge the useful art thereby conveyed.see pamela samuelson,why copyright law excludes systems and processes from the scope of its protection,discussing congressional intent that b limit the scope of copyright protection in functional works.for example,using a bookkeeping method described in a text does not infringe the text copyright.see baker selden.implicit in baker is a recognition that excluding systems,methods,and useful arts from the scope of copyright protection not only promotes the ongoing progress of science that is,knowledge creation and dissemination,but also promotes ongoing innovation and competition in the marketplace.samuelson,supra,at.protection for progress in the useful arts is through the patent process.see baker,at samuelson,supra,at.what copyright protects is the language that an author uses to explain,describe,or express whatever ideas or useful arts she may have discovered or created,along with the artistic way in which an author draws or illustrates those ideas or useful arts samuelson,supra,at.
the merger doctrine,however,limits even the protection for specific language.as stated in a leading treatise,when a given idea is inseparably tied to a particular expression,the convention is that there is merger between the two.nimmer on copyright,supra b,at.in such instances,rigorously protecting the expression would confer a monopoly over the idea itself,in contravention of the statutory command.id.this court has explained 
the merger doctrine is applied as a prophylactic device to ensure that courts do not unwittingly grant protection to an idea by granting exclusive rights to the only,or one of only a few,means of expressing that idea.if protection were granted to these expressions,it would so increase the cost of creation for others who seek to build on the work that it would impede progress in the arts.such a result is contrary to the goals of copyright as embedded in the constitution.
gates rubber bando chem,cir citation omitted.
as we understand argument,it is combining the notions of functionality and merger to say that beck complaint relates only to an alleged copying of functional elements of its concepts of disclaiming liability,qualifying assumptions,and identifying standard risk factors with respect to the reported findings and conclusions,aplee.br.at,and that there are only so many ways to express a disclaimer of liability,so that beck form of expression is not protected.
we note that other circuits have denied protection to similar writings.see veeck congress int l,cir en banc denying copyright protection to local building code morrissey procter gamble,cir denying copyright protection to rules in a promotional sweepstakes contest.nevertheless,we believe the better course is to decline to rule on whether the language in beck reports is protected.although raises the issue in its appellate brief and the district court ruling devoted a sentence to the issue,see,vol.ii at utilitarian statements disclaiming liability,qualifying assumptions,or identifying risk factors in a consulting engineer report are not protected by copyright,did not make this argument in district court.indeed,motion to dismiss contained one footnote expressly stating that it was not relying on any idea rather than expression argument,vol.i at.and a second footnote stated that some language in the beck reports appeared to be functional but,for the purposes of its motion,presumed that the language was protected.id.at.given statements,beck had no reason to present evidence or argument relevant to this protectability issue in district court.as a general matter,we do not consider issues that were not raised below.see forest guardians forest,cir hoiles alioto,cir court has discretion to affirm on any ground supported by record if doing so is fair to appellant.
causes of action 
beck also contends that conduct subjects it to liability under three colorado causes of action a claim of unfair competition,a claim of unjust enrichment,and a claim of deceptive trade practices prohibited by the colorado consumer protection act ccpa,et.we affirm the judgment in favor of on these claims.beck and claims are preempted by the copyright act,and beck can not establish an essential element of its claim.
unfair competition and unjust enrichment 
moved to dismiss beck and claims on the ground that they were preempted by the copyright act.because provided evidence in support of its motion to dismiss beck complaint as a whole,the district court treated all of the motion to dismiss as a motion for summary judgment.see.d if matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court,the motion must be treated as one for summary judgment under rule.but no evidence was necessary to dispose of beck two state claims.therefore,we will review the dismissal of those claims as we would review a dismissal for failure to state a claim under federal rule of civil procedure b.we review such a dismissal de novo.see christy sports,llc deer valley resort,cir.we note that beck did not seek to amend its complaint in district court.
section of the copyright act describes the extent to which the act preempts state and statutory causes of action.the pertinent provisions state 
a a ll legal or equitable rights that are equivalent to any of the exclusive rights within the general scope of copyright as specified by section in works of authorship that are fixed in a tangible medium of expression and come within the subject matter of copyright as specified by sections and,whether published or unpublished,are governed exclusively by this title.n o person is entitled to any such right or equivalent right in any such work under the common law or statutes of any state.
b nothing in this title annuls or limits any rights or remedies under the common law or statutes of any state with respect to 
subject matter that does not come within the subject matter of copyright as specified by sections and,including works of authorship not fixed in any tangible medium of expression or 
activities violating legal or equitable rights that are not equivalent to any of the exclusive rights within the general scope of copyright as specified by section.
in short,a claim is preempted if the work is within the scope of the subject matter of copyright as specified in and and the rights granted under state law are equivalent to any exclusive rights within the scope of federal copyright as set out in.gates rubber,at internal quotation marks omitted.
we do not read brief as contesting the first requirement.in any event,it appears that it is satisfied.section states that c opyright protection subsists in original literary works and beck reports are literary works.see defining the term literary works as works,other than audiovisual works,expressed in words,regardless of the nature of the material objects in which they are embodied nimmer on copyright,supra a,at the use of the term literary in this context does not connote any criterion of literary merit or qualitative value.internal quotation marks omitted.copyrightable material often contains uncopyrightable elements within it,but section preemption bars state law claims with respect to uncopyrightable as well as copyrightable elements.basketball ass motorola,cir.as the court explained 
the fact that portions of beck reports may consist of uncopyrightable material does not take the work s as a whole outside the subject matter protected by the act.were this not so,states would be free to expand the perimeters of copyright protection to their own liking,on the theory that preemption would be no bar to state protection of material not meeting federal statutory standards.
id.internal quotation marks omitted.
preemption thus turns on whether the rights asserted by beck are equivalent to any of the exclusive rights within the general scope of copyright,as specified in.that section grants to the copyright owner the exclusive rights to reproduce the copyrighted work prepare derivative works distribute copies of the work perform the work publicly and display the work publicly.when a right defined by state law may be abridged by an act which,in and of itself,would infringe one of the exclusive rights,the state law in question must be deemed preempted.ehat tanner,cir internal quotation marks omitted.on the other hand,when a state law violation is predicated upon an act incorporating elements beyond mere reproduction or the like,the rights involved are not equivalent and preemption will not occur.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
a comparison of two of our opinions,gates rubber,and ehat,is instructive.in gates rubber we concluded that the copyright act did not preempt the plaintiff claim for misappropriation under colorado law.at.the elements of the claim were i that the plaintiff possessed a valid trade secret,ii that the trade secret was disclosed or used without consent,and iii that the defendant knew,or should have known,that the trade secret was acquired by improper means.id.at.we held that this third element,proof of a breach of trust or confidence,qualitatively distinguishe d such trade secret causes of action from claims for copyright infringement based solely on copying.id.at.see briarpatch,lp phoenix pictures,cir claims requiring a breach of fiduciary duty add an extra element that makes the claims qualitatively different from a claim of copyright infringement.
on the other hand,in ehat we concluded that the plaintiff and claims were both preempted by the copyright act.at.the plaintiff research materials were secretly removed from a colleague office,copied,and replaced.see id.at.the defendants,who played no role in the removal,obtained an unauthorized copy of the materials,which included quotations that the plaintiff had recorded from original sources,in addition to his own notes and commentary.see id.the defendants blacked out material added by the plaintiff,reprinted the original source material,and sold it to the public.see id.the district court concluded that the plaintiff claims did not fall within the scope of copyright,and thus were not preempted,because they were based on his right in the notes as a physical matter and property.id.at.we disagreed because the plaintiff had not allege d a state law claim of conversion to recover for the physical deprivation of his notes.instead,he sought to recover for damage flowing from their reproduction and distribution.id.we saw no distinction between the state rights asserted in the plaintiff complaint and those exclusive rights encompassed by the federal copyright laws.id.
as in ehat,the state rights asserted by beck are equivalent to the exclusive rights set forth in of the copyright act.beck complaint alleges th
