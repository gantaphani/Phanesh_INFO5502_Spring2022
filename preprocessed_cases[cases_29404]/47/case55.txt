our review of the entry of summary judgment is de novo.suttle caribe,cir see also folio impressions,byer,cir appropriate to review district court evaluation of substantial similarity de novo when only visual comparisons are required.
a.the district court approach 
yankee claims that bridgewater has infringed its copyright on the labels of nine candle fragrances the district court,proceeding in the following manner,concluded that bridgewater labels were as a matter of law.first,applying the doctrines of merger and,the court determined that,to prevail,yankee had to show that bridgewater labels were nearly identical to yankee.yankee i,d at.second,in making this comparison,the district court ignored certain similarities that it viewed as crude,physical elements not entitled to copyright protection,such as the label rectangular shape,its gold border,and the use of a style of photography id.at.third,the court applied the ordinary observer test to the remaining elements of the copyrighted label,ultimately concluding that no reasonable juror could conclude that any of the bridgewater labels were substantially similar to the corresponding yankee label.id.at.
yankee claims that the district court erred by ignoring its proffered evidence of actual copying.as a result,says yankee,the court incorrectly engaged in a comparison of protected elements as opposed to a broader determination based on the total look and feel of the entire label.yankee also argues that the district court was in determining which elements of the labels were not protected,and thus used an improper baseline for its determination of substantial similarity.for purposes of this appeal,we assume that yankee provided sufficient evidence of actual copying to survive summary judgment after applying the relevant law,we conclude that even if bridgewater actually copied yankee labels,the merger doctrine operates so that no reasonable juror could have found bridgewater labels to be substantially similar to those of yankee.we therefore affirm the grant of summary judgment on this basis.
applicable law 
to prevail on a claim of copyright infringement,the plaintiff must show both ownership of a valid copyright and illicit copying.feist,rural.serv,d matthews freedman,cir.there is no dispute here as to the first prong of this test yankee retains valid copyrights on the nine candle labels at issue.the second question is a more complicated one.
this court conducts a test to determine if illicit copying has occurred.first,a plaintiff must prove that the defendant copied the plaintiff copyrighted work,either directly or through indirect evidence.segrets,gillman knitwear,cir.second,the plaintiff must prove that the copying of the copyrighted material was so extensive that it rendered the infringing and copyrighted works substantially similar.see also assocs.continuing legal,even evidence of actual copying may be insufficient,however,if this copying was not substantial.because we assume,for purposes of this appeal,that actual copying has taken place,we move directly to the second prong.
whether there is substantial similarity between copyrightable expressions is determined by the ordinary observer test.concrete mach.classic lawn ornaments,cir.the test is whether the accused work is so similar to the plaintiff work that an ordinary reasonable person would conclude that the defendant unlawfully appropriated the plaintiff protected expression by taking material of substance and value.id.quoting educ.testing servs.katzman,cir.the determination of whether an allegedly infringing label is substantially similar to its alleged model or influence is not so simple a task,however,as a strict visual comparison of the two items.any comparison between the two works must be informed by a key theoretical foundation of copyright law that i deas can not be copyrighted,id.at citing harper row,nation,d,and therefore that a n artist can claim to own only an original manner of expressing ideas,not the ideas themselves,id.quoting cooling flexibles stuart radiator,cir.because of this dichotomy between idea and expression,only the protected expression is relevant to an evaluation of substantial similarity.leigh warner,cir.we must first consider,then,to what extent the yankee labels are protected expression 
in determining what aspects of the yankee labels are protected under copyright law,we follow essentially the same path as did the district court.we first dissect the work to remove those aspects not protected by copyright.despite yankee argument to the contrary,this court has indicated that dissection analysis is an appropriate method of evaluating substantial similarity even when actual copying has occurred.by dissecting the accused work and identifying those features which are protected t he court can also determine those aspects of the work that should be considered in the comparative analysis under the ordinary observer test.concrete,at.second,we apply the doctrines of merger and to determine how substantially similar the copy must be to infringe.id.at for example,the court may find that the idea and expression are so inseparable that copying of the work is not prohibited or that only exact reproduction of the work will justify a finding of infringement.
there may be a qualification to the dissection test of some importance in certain cases.in knitwaves,lollytogs,cir,the second circuit suggested that the dissection test may not fully resolve the legal issues where the copyright holder claims that the copyrighted material is essentially a host of uncopyrightable individual elements that have been arranged in a unique way that qualifies them for copyright protection.feist,at.copyright available for compilations of unprotectible facts.this court,however,has been more enthusiastic than the second circuit about the use of dissection analysis to disaggregate a visual work into its component elements for the purpose of removing the unprotectible elements contained within.compare concrete,at,with knitwaves,at.
at any rate,we do not necessarily reject this qualification but think that it has no direct application here.our reasons for thinking that there is nothing very unique in this combination of elements follows from our discussion of the nature of the unprotected elements,the issue to which we turn shortly.moreover,we are confident that the district court,in removing the crude,physical elements described in parts and,did not the yankee label.the fact that significant copyrightable material remained prior to the application of the merger doctrine is,in our minds,persuasive that the appropriate level of dissection occurred.see leigh,at as long as the analysis is not overly detached and technical,it can adequately assess both the effect of the protected,original elements of the work and the contribution of those elements to the work as a whole.
unprotected elements of the yankee labels 
the district court determined that the rectangular,name plate,the photos,and the use of similarly sized labels,were crude,physical elements that do not enjoy copyright protection,and therefore only evaluated the photographic images on the labels for infringement.yankee i,d at.yankee contends that its choices to use such elements were discretionary,and must be protected by copyright because other choices were possible.we agree with the district court.the discretion claimed by yankee involves i the use of a rectangular title plate with block lettering on a white background ii the imposition of that title plate,centered,on a photographic representation of the candle fragrance and iii a rectangular border around the photograph.this collection of common geometric shapes with a particular photographic technique is not sufficiently original to qualify for copyright protection.see atari games oman,we do not in any way question the register position that simple geometric shapes and coloring alone are per se not copyrightable.kitchens of sara lee,nifty foods,cir circular,rectangular,and octagonal shapes not protected william geiger gigi accessories,civ.jsm,wl,at,plaintiff has no right to copyright a geometric shape.
moreover,the use of a border element is an essentially functional design choice not protected by copyright.see providing copyright protection for works of artistic craftsmanship insofar as their form but not their mechanical or utilitarian aspects cmm cable rep,ocean coast,cir copyright law denies protection to forms of expression directed solely at functional considerations.a border is a common method of separating a photograph from a background the use of gold as the border color is a common method of signifying opulence and quality.see pubs.int l,landoll,cir.likewise,copyright does not provide protection for the particular style of photography chosen by yankee.to do so would impermissibly narrow the possibilities available to other label designers.see designer view,publix super markets,medium of artwork not protected by copyright.
having separated the unprotected title plate,border elements,and style of photography from the photographs themselves,we now turn to the photographs to determine if the bridgewater labels are infringing.the district court found that for six of the nine labels in question,there was only one way to express the idea of these fruits and flowers by depicting their likeness.and although the district court held that the remaining three labels french vanilla,spiced pie,and rolls expressed more subtle ideas open to greater possibilities of representation,even for those depictions the idea merge d with the expression and therefore allowed for few choices of subject matter.as a result,the district court held that,as a matter of law,there could be no infringement unless bridgewater photographs were nearly identical to yankee.yankee i,d at.yankee claims that the merger doctrine does not apply because infinite ways exist to depict a fruit,flower,or common flavor such as french vanilla.again,we agree with the district court approach.
in concrete machinery,we explained the rationale behind the merger doctrine 
some ideas admit of only a limited number of expressions.when there is essentially only one way to express an idea,the idea and its expression are inseparable and copyright is no bar to copying that expression.even w hen the idea and its expression are not completely inseparable,there may still be only a limited number of ways of expressing the idea.
at internal citations omitted.in such cases,the plaintiff has the heavy burden of showing near identity between the works at issue.id.at citing sid marty krofft television mcdonald,cir,and flag fables jean ann country flags crafts.this heightened showing is necessary because,as idea and expression merge,fewer and fewer aspects of a work embody a unique and creative expression of the idea a copyright holder must then prove substantial similarity to those few aspects of the work that are expression not required by the idea.id.at citing universal athletic sales salkeld,cir.
in general,the merger doctrine is most applicable where the idea and the expression are of items found in nature,or are found commonly in everyday life.see,designer view.at.for example,we invoked the merger doctrine in concrete machinery where the idea at issue was a life size deer.at see also leigh,at photograph of statue in public domain herbert rosenthal jewelry kalpakian,cir pin of a jeweled bee.as the district court found,six of the labels at issue were fruits and flowers found in nature the remaining three were representations of common flavors.for the six natural items,there were few associated expressions,of which the most obvious was a realistic representation of the fruit or flower at issue.for the three flavors,the most obvious expression was a realistic representation of a food commonly associated with that flavor because the merger doctrine applies,the copyright on yankee labels does not prevent bridgewater from using the same subject matter on its labels,even if the genesis for bridgewater choice of subject matter was yankee labels.
the merger doctrine does not,however,allow the identical reproduction of photographs of realistic objects when there are sufficient details in those photographs to make them unique.concrete,at finding possibility of infringement of concrete deer based on stylized posture and facial expression.if bridgewater had scanned yankee labels into a computer and reproduced them exactly,it would have certainly infringed yankee copyrights on those labels.even if bridgewater had taken its own photographs,but had arranged the subjects in a nearly identical manner to that of yankee,a jury could have found the requisite showing of substantial similarity to support copyright infringement.moreover,although yankee does not enjoy copyright protection on the subject matter of its photographs because of the merger doctrine,its choices as to lighting,background,angle and positioning are protected.leigh,at rogers koons,cir.we now proceed to compare the specific labels at issue.
e.the labels 
after accounting for the unprotected elements of the yankee label and the constraints of the merger doctrine,the district court closely examined each of the allegedly infringing labels,and concluded that no reasonable juror could conclude that the bridgewater label was substantially similar to the corresponding yankee label.yankee i,d at.although summary judgment is often inappropriate on the question of substantial similarity,hoehling universal city studios,cir,where reasonable minds can not differ,summary judgment is appropriate,segrets,at.our independent review of the labels confirms the district court analysis and holding therefore we affirm the grant of summary judgment to bridgewater on yankee copyright claims.
ii.trade dress claims 
purposes and scope of trade dress protection 
yankee second set of claims,for trade dress infringement,is brought pursuant to a of the lanham act,which provides protection against the use of any word,term,name,symbol,or device that is likely to cause confusion,or to cause mistake,or to deceive as to the source of a product.a.the lanham act extends protection not only to words and symbols,but also to trade dress,defined as the design and appearance of a product together with the elements making up the overall image that serves to identify the product presented to the consumer.chrysler silva,cir quoting too,gemmy indus,cir.the primary purpose of trade dress protection is to protect that which identifies a product source.lund trading aps kohler,cir.courts recognize trade dress claims based both on product packaging and on product.see,stores samara,d.
in order for trade dress to be protected under a,a plaintiff must prove that the dress is i used in commerce ii and iii distinctive.lund,at.distinctiveness may be either inherent,that is,the intrinsic nature of the trade dress serves to identify a particular source,at.citing two pesos,taco cabana,d,or acquired,the trade dress has acquired a secondary meaning whereby the public views its primary significance as identify ing the source of the product rather than the product itself,id.at.quoting inwood,ives,d.finally,to prove infringement of protected trade dress,the plaintiff must show that another use of a similar trade dress is likely to cause confusion among consumers as to the product source.lund,at.
b.the district court analysis 
the district court identified three ways in which yankee claimed that bridgewater had infringed its trade dress i by copying yankee method of shelving and displaying candles in its stores,called the vertical display system ii by copying the overall look and feel of yankee housewarmer line of candles and iii by copying the design of yankee merchandise catalog,specifically its one fragrance per page layout.yankee i,d at.the court first held that the vertical display system was manifestly functional,both in its arrangement of candles by color and in its use of wooden shelving,and concluded that yankee can not invoke the lanham act to appropriate such a conventional method of presenting its wares.id.at.
the court then turned to the look and feel of the housewarmer line of candles and the layout of the yankee catalog.it concluded,with little explanation,that both claims alleged trade dress infringement of a product,rather than infringement of product packaging.in accordance with the supreme court decision in,the district court thus held that neither aspect of yankee trade dress could be inherently distinctive as a matter of law.id.at see,at.holding that product trade dress may never be inherently distinctive.the district court therefore turned to a determination of whether a genuine issue of material fact existed with respect to secondary meaning.yankee i,d at.
as to the housewarmer line of candles,the district court determined that the evidence introduced by yankee had fallen far short of the vigorous evidentiary standard required to show secondary meaning in a product case.id.at citing boston beer.slesar.brewing,cir,and duraco prods.joy plastic,cir.first,yankee had failed to introduce any survey evidence,which this court has described as the preferred manner of demonstrating secondary meaning.see id.at citing boston beer,at.second,yankee had not introduced any circumstantial evidence indicating that the public had made a conscious connection between the trade dress at issue and yankee as the source of that trade dress.id.
as for the catalog,the district court simply concluded that there is no question that bridgewater catalog is indeed bridgewater and not yankee,and that n o fair minded person,looking at bridgewater document,could possibly view it as an attempt to pass off the bridgewater catalogue as the yankee one.id.at.
lastly,although it had not found any of yankee trade dress sufficiently distinctive to qualify for protection,the district court held in the alternative that no reasonable juror could conclude that there is a likelihood of confusion,where clearly marked company names are featured on the face of the products and catalogues.id.at citing squibb,cir,and conopco,may dep t stores.
yankee claims 
on appeal,yankee argues that the district court erred in several ways.first,yankee contends that the district court ignored its combination claim defining its trade dress as the combination of its housewarmer series of labels,its choice of candle sizes and styles,its vertical design system,and its catalog layout.by disaggregating the features of its trade dress,says yankee,the district court failed to analyze the look and feel of the entire yankee product.second,yankee argues that the district court erroneously defined its trade dress as product,and in so doing,proceeded directly to the question of secondary meaning without considering that the dress might be inherently distinctive.third,yankee argues that it introduced sufficient evidence of secondary meaning to survive summary judgment.fourth,yankee argues that it introduced sufficient evidence of likelihood of confusion to survive summary judgment had the district court needed to reach that issue.although we agree with yankee that the district court failed to address its combination claim as such and we entertain the possibility that the court incorrectly analyzed yankee claims under a product rubric,we ultimately reach the same conclusion as the district court and affirm the grant of summary judgment,albeit using a different analysis.burns state police ass of,cir this court may affirm grant of summary judgment on any ground sufficiently indicated by the record.
yankee trade dress 
we begin by sketching yankee claimed trade dress,which we read on appeal as defined in two possible ways.first,yankee suggests that its trade dress is a combination of i the vertical display system ii the catalog,with an emphasis on its one fragrance per page layout iii its candle shapes and sizes iv the quantities of candles it sells as a unit and v the housewarmer labels,specifically their inclusion of a a photograph,b a superimposed title plate with gold edging and lettering on a white background,c a rectangular shape,and d a reflective border alternatively,yankee describes its trade dress as the elements common to its housewarmer labels,of which we have provided greater detail in the copyright section of this opinion.
inherent distinctiveness 
a.the combination claim 
yankee argues that the distinct combination of elements comprising its candle sizes and shapes,quantities sold,labels,vertical design system,and catalog stem from arbitrary choices and are thus inherently distinctive and entitled to trademark protection.see two pesos,at.inherently distinctive marks are entitled to protection.certain types of trade dress,however,can never be inherently distinctive,at.product can not be inherently distinctive qualitex jacobson prods,d color can not be inherently distinctive.we find that yankee combination claim falls under the category of product,and thus yankee must prove that the dress has attained secondary meaning in order for it to be protected under the lanham act,at.
yankee argues that because its products are candles,all the trappings associated with the sale of the,the,the vertical display system,the labels,and the product packaging,or at the very least a tertium quid akin to product packaging,categories of trade dress that may be inherently distinctive.see,at.citing two pesos,at.
although,as we explain below,yankee housewarmer labels are product packaging and thus may be inherently distinctive,when combined with actual candle features,candle containers,the catalog and the display system,the claim is no longer clearly a one.nor can the claim be categorized as product,as that term has generally been defined to be limited to features inherent to the actual physical product here,the candles.see,at.describing cocktail shaker shaped as penguin as a product design lund,at kitchen faucets.we also do not see this claim as akin to the restaurant decor upheld as potentially inherently distinctive in two pesos,which the supreme court later described as a tertium quid that is akin to product packaging,at.see also best cellars grape finds at dupont,d,finding that the overall layout of a wine store could be,and was,inherently distinctive.yankee has not made a claim as to the overall appearance of an entire store,but has instead isolated certain characteristics of its candle display in stores.this strikes us as far closer to the category.the fact that yankee points to particular aspects of the candles themselves,namely their shapes and sizes,only confirms our categorization.
in,the supreme court instructed us how to deal with claims that were at the margin of product to the extent that there are close cases,we believe that courts should err on the side of caution and classify ambiguous trade dress as product design,thereby requiring secondary meaning.at.we follow that advice here.to prevail on its combination claim,yankee must show that its trade dress has acquired secondary meaning.
yankee also claims that unique features of its housewarmer labels constitute an inherently distinctive trade dress.the district court found that the labels were also product,and thus could not be inherently distinctive as a matter of law.yankee i,d at.we disagree.detachable labels are a classic case of product packaging,and therefore may be inherently distinctive.see,too,at.although the district court did not determine whether the housewarmer labels were inherently distinctive,we are convinced that the label elements highlighted by yankee do not meet the inherent distinctiveness test of abercrombie fitch hunting world,cir.we therefore uphold the district court grant of summary judgment on this basis.
under abercrombie,trademarks are divided into five categories generic,descriptive,suggestive,arbitrary,and fanciful.lund,at.if a mark falls into one of the latter three categories,it is deemed to be inherently distinctive.id.because the abercrombie test was first applied to word marks,see abercrombie,at,it may be difficult to apply to visual marks or trade dress,lund,at.the supreme court,however,has endorsed the use of the abercrombie test in the evaluation of visual marks,as well as in the assessment of product packaging trade dress claims.id.citing two pesos,at.
this court,however,has noted that w e do not believe that the supreme court endorsement of the abercrombie test in two pesos requires a strict application of the abercrombie test in all contexts id.at.instead,we have found it appropriate to supplement the somewhat abercrombie categories with the questions asked in seabrook foods,foods.in seabrook,inherent distinctiveness was determined by reference to i whether the design was a common or basic one ii whether it was unique or unusual in the field iii whether it was a refinement of a common form of ornamentation and iv whether it was capable of creating a commercial impression distinct from the accompanying words.wiley am.greetings,cir quoting seabrook,at.in reality the question is whether the dress is so unique,unusual or unexpected in this market that it will automatically be perceived by customers as an indicator of origin.lund,at citing mccarthy,mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition ed see also mckernan burek,d,describing this question as the lund test for inherent distinctiveness.
furthermore,in evaluating the inherent distinctiveness of yankee packaging,we must consider the fact that although yankee housewarmer labels have obvious similarities,they also differ significantly from one another,in that they necessarily display different pictures corresponding to their particular candle fragrance.in other words,yankee seeks to protect features common to a set of labels,as opposed to a specific label common to a host of yankee goods.a trade dress plaintiff seeking to protect a series or line of products faces a particularly difficult challenge,as it must show that the appearance of the several products is sufficiently distinct and unique to merit protection.landscape forms,at jeffrey milstein,greger,lawlor,roth,cir.moreover,trade dress claims across a line of products present special concerns in their ability to artificially limit competition,as such claims are generally broader in scope than claims relating to an individual item.landscape forms,at.
yankee has focused on the arbitrary choices it made in designing its label,and has for this reason introduced into evidence numerous possibilities of alternative label designs.while we appreciate that there are many different potential ways of creating a candle label,we think yankee approach ignores the focus of the inherent distinctiveness inquiry.as we detailed in the copyright section of this opinion,yankee label is essentially a combination of functional and common features.see pubs.int l,at gold coloring is a prime example of aesthetic functionality,because it connotes opulence.although such a combination may be entitled to protection where secondary meaning is shown,lund,at,it is less likely to qualify as inherently distinctive,jeffrey milstein,at.while the particular combination of common features may indeed be arbitrary,we do not think that any reasonable juror could conclude that these elements are so unique and unusual that they are in the absence of secondary meaning.lund,at.
secondary meaning 
having concluded that neither trade dress claim made by yankee qualifies for protection based on its inherent distinctiveness,we next address whether yankee has introduced sufficient evidence to survive summary judgment on the question of secondary meaning.as evidence of secondary meaning yankee points to i its advertising campaign featuring pictures of its products with the claimed trade dress ii its continuous and virtually exclusive use of its trade dress since iii its high sales figures for housewarmer candles iv evidence from bridgewater files indicating that retailers identify a resemblance between bridgewater styles and yankee v testimony by a bridgewater sales agent as to the distinctiveness of the yankee trade dress vi testimony by bridgewater and yankee employees as to the distinctiveness of yankee claimed trade dress vii evidence of actual consumer confusion between bridgewater and yankee products and viii evidence of intentional copying by bridgewater.
this court has said that p roof of secondary meaning entails vigorous evidentiary requirements.boston beer,at quoting perini perini,cir.the only direct evidence probative of secondary meaning is consumer surveys and testimony by individual consumers.id.although survey evidence is not required,it is a valuable method of showing secondary meaning.lund,at.yankee has introduced no survey evidence here yankee also cites no evidence that individual consumers associate the particular features at issue with yankee 
secondary meaning may also be proven through circumstantial evidence,specifically the length and manner of the use of the trade dress,the nature and extent of advertising and promotion of the trade dress,and the efforts made to promote a conscious connection by the public between the trade dress and the product source.see boston beer,at.other factors may include the product established place in the market and proof of intentional copying.lund,at.yankee has introduced substantial evidence that the housewarmer line of candles and corresponding display have been in circulation since,that yankee spends significant resources advertising its housewarmer line,and that sales of housewarmer candles have been extremely successful.see yankee i,d at.however,in concluding that yankee had not made a sufficient evidentiary showing of secondary meaning,the district court focused on the lack of evidence as to advertising of the specific trade dress claimed,as well as the lack of evidence demonstrating a conscious connection by the public between the claimed trade dress and the product source.
we believe the district court emphasized the relevant issues in conducting its analysis of secondary meaning.proof of secondary meaning requires at least some evidence that consumers associate the trade dress with the source.although evidence of the pervasiveness of the trade dress may support the conclusion that a mark has acquired secondary meaning,it can not stand alone.to find otherwise would provide trade dress protection for any successful product,or for the packaging of any successful product.see seabrook,at evidence of sales volume may be relevant to secondary meaning,but is not necessarily indicative.such an open standard hardly comports with the vigorous evidentiary showing required by this court,nor does it comport with the purposes of trade dress protection,namely to protect that which identifies a product source.lund,at.in the absence of any evidence that the claimed trade dress actually does identify a product source,the trade dress should not be entitled to protection.
that being said,yankee argues that,because its advertising contained pictures of its products incorporating the claimed trade dress,it was the type of advertising that can,on its own,support a finding of secondary meaning.see first brands fred meyer,cir.advertising is such that encourages consumers to identify the claimed trade dress with the particular producer.thomas betts panduit,cir.in other words,it is advertising that specifically directs a consumer attention to a particular aspect of the product.to be probative of secondary meaning,the advertising must direct the consumer to those features claimed as trade dress.id.merely featuring the relevant aspect of the product in advertising is no more probative of secondary meaning than are strong sales again,to provide protection based on extensive advertising would extend trade dress protection to the label or to the combination claim without any showing that the consumer associated the dress with the product source.see int l jensen,metrosound,cir while evidence of a manufacturer sales,advertising and promotional activities may be relevant in determining secondary meaning,the true test of secondary meaning is the effectiveness of this effort to create it.emphasis added.the district court found that yankee advertising did not emphasize any particular element of its trade dress,and thus could not be probative of secondary meaning.yankee i,d at.we agree.
we also do not find yankee evidence of intentional copying probative of secondary meaning.first,to the extent yankee seeks to use such evidence as secondary meaning of its combination trade dress,intent plays a particularly minor role in product cases.see,duraco,at a ttempts to copy a product configuration may not be probative because the copier may very well be exploiting a particularly desirable feature,rather than seeking to confuse consumers as to the source of the product.given the highly functional nature of certain elements of yankee claimed combination trade dress,see yankee i,d at,the concern that protection could prevent healthy competition in the scented candle field weighs heavily in this case.
the testimony that bridgewater designers were,at times,told to make the labels look more like yankee is more troubling.see blau plumbing,cir defendant belief that trade dress has acquired secondary meaning provides some evidence that it actually has acquired secondary meaning.however,the relevant intent is not just the intent to copy,but to pass off one goods as those of another.id.given that bridgewater prominently displayed its trade name on its candles,we do not think that the evidence of copying was sufficiently probative of secondary meaning.
in sum,yankee has not introduced any of the direct or consumer used to establish secondary meaning.although it has introduced some of the circumstantial evidence often used to support such a finding,the lack of any evidence that actual consumers associated the claimed trade dress with yankee,as well as the lack of evidence as to confusion on the part of actual consumers renders this circumstantial evidence insufficient for a reasonable juror to find that the trade dress had acquired a secondary meaning.yankee has not made the vigorous evidentiary showing required by this court.the grant of summary judgment on yankee lanham act claim is affirmed.
iii.the evidentiary ruling 
following its grant of summary judgment on the copyright and trade dress claims,the district court granted in substantial part bridgewater motion to limit the scope of trial on the remaining tortious interference count.yankee ii,d at.first,after the text of yankee original complaint,the court concluded that as a pleading matter,the tortious interference count was animated by claims of misrepresentation rather than claims of copyright or trade dress infringement id.at.for that reason,it held that yankee could not use evidence of copyright or trade dress infringement to support its tortious interference claim,because such evidence was irrelevant to claims of misrepresentation.id.second,to the extent that yankee sought to use the evidence to establish improper motive,one element of tortious interference,the court noted that i federal copyright law preempts any tortious interference claim based on copyright infringement ii although the lanham act does not similarly preempt common law trade dress claims,the factual void in the record made such evidence irrelevant and iii any evidence of sharp practices would,at best,be cumulative.id.at.
we begin with the question whether the tortious interference count should be read to incorporate the copyright and trade dress claims.we need not decide whether the liberal approach to reading complaints is inconsistent with the district court conclusion.see.f district court to construe the pleading so as to do substantial justice beacon theatres westover,d pleadings to be liberally construed under federal rules of civil procedure.even if the district court erred in its construction of the complaint,it is beside the point as yankee did not prevail on the copyright or trade dress claims.assuming that those claims should be read as incorporated into the tortious interference count,they have been decided against yankee and we have upheld that decision.
yankee also alleges that their pleadings set forth a complex scheme consisting of actions akin to copyright and trade dress infringement,misrepresentation,misappropriation of goodwill,wrongful use of employees to target particular customers,and wrongful use of scare tactics to pressure customers into switching candle suppliers.our reading of the complaint supports the district court determination that no such scheme was alleged.furthermore,at a march hearing on summary judgment,yankee clearly indicated that it viewed copyright and trade dress infringement as entirely separate methods of supporting a tortious interference count,rather than as aspects of a general misrepresentation scheme.no matter our standard of review of the district court construction of yankee pleading,we believe that it was done correctly in this respect see krouse am.sterilizer,cir court will not read causes of action into a complaint when they are not present rodríguez doral mortgage,cir fundamental purpose of pleading is to afford party fair notice of claims asserted against him and the ground on which those claims rest.
alternatively,yankee argues that the dismissal of the copyright and trademark claims is not dispositive because the underlying evidence may still be pertinent to proof of improper motive,which may in turn be a factor in establishing tortious interference.see restatement second of torts.certainly in principle,evidence relevant to a failed claim might be of independent relevance to a surviving claim resting on different elements.see kattar demoulas.however,the district court did not reject the use of the evidence simply because it supported a failed claim,but rather because of considerations peculiar to this case.
in substance,the district court pointed to the fact that the specific,concrete misrepresentations which were asserted could easily have been the subject of direct evidence at trial if yankee had not thereafter chosen to dismiss the misrepresentation claim in order to gain a prompt appeal on the evidentiary and other rulings.the evidence relating to the alleged copyright and trade dress violations had no bearing on whether the representations had been made.as to motive,any inference from the excluded evidence would prove cumulative at best.the district court could easily have added that the excluded evidence could create substantial confusion and delay,given that the more obvious use of the evidence would be to support the defunct copyright and trade dress claims.see.
in general,we review judgment calls that certain evidence is either irrelevant or cumulative for abuse of discretion.faigin kelly,cir.yankee argues that our review here should be de novo because the district court based its ruling on a theory that evidence relating to a dismissed claim is automatically inadmissible with respect to a claim that proceeds to trial.we do not read the district court opinion as resting on any such per se ground.rather it appears to us to be an amply justified determination by the district court to keep the preserved claim focused on the issue of misrepresentation and to avoid the reintroduction through the back door of evidence whose main thrust was to establish counts already dismissed.

three factors are relevant in making this determination i where the defendant committed the alleged deception ii where plaintiff was deceived and acted upon the deception and iii the situs of plaintiff losses stemming from the deception.clinton hosp.ass corson group,cir.the district court held that the first factor weighed in bridgewater favor,as any misconduct occurred at bridgewater principal place of business,outside massachusetts.yankee ii,d at.in evaluating the second factor,the court evaluated where yankee customers were allegedly deceived,see clinton,at,and concluded that the vast majority of them were outside massachusetts.yankee ii,d at.this factor therefore also weighed in bridgewater favor.finally,the court determined that the third factor weighed in favor of yankee,but that the third factor alone could not be dispositive.id.at citing roche,at.
yankee concedes that the district court determination that the alleged conduct occurred primarily and substantially outside massachusetts is correct unless we reverse the district court evidentiary decision.as we have not done so,the district court grant of summary judgment on the claim is affirmed.
conclusion 
for the reasons stated,the judgments of the district court are affirmed.
the alleged infringing labels are of bridgewater fragrances eucalyptus,cranberry,gardenia,mulberry,peach,raspberry jubilee,french vanilla,cinnamon rolls,and apple pie.yankee i,d at.these correspond to yankee fragrances of the same names,although yankee calls four of the corresponding fragrances fresh peach,raspberry,cinnamon,and spiced apple.id.
a photograph contains no border or visual separation between the photograph and the perimeter of the label.yankee i,d at.
the district court held to the contrary.yankee i,d at.
much of the confusion in this area of the law may be traced to the dual use of the term substantially similar.see matthews,at.first,if there is no evidence of actual copying,as is usually the case,concrete mach.classic lawn ornaments,cir,a plaintiff may prove that copying occurred by showing access and substantial similarity,id.we have described this aspect of substantial similarity as an evidentiary inference.matthews,at.second,once copying has been proven,the plaintiff must show that the alleged infringing work is substantially similar to the protected expression in the copywritten work.id.at.due to our assumption of sufficient evidence of actual copying,only the second use of the term is at issue here.
the extent to which the yankee labels contain protected expression is a matter of law,determined by the court.once this determination is made,the question of whether two works are substantially similar and corresponding application of the ordinary observer test is a matter for the trier of fact unless summary judgment is proper.see,concrete,at.
it is true that more than one food may meet this definition for example,cinnamon can be represented by cinnamon sticks,cinnamon rolls,or cinnamon toast.however,all that is required for application of the merger doctrine is that there be a sharply limited number of choices.we think that in the case of everyday flavors such as french vanilla,cinnamon,and spiced apple,such is the case.
the district court performed an extensive comparison of corresponding labels which need not be repeated here at great length.yankee i,d at.for purposes of illustration,however,we note a few of the significant differences in each set of photographs the bridgewater eucalyptus label shows a eucalyptus plant,photographed from a distance,with thin white and purple flowers and small green leaves.the yankee eucalyptus label is taken from closer up,displays larger,darker green leaves,and both yellow and purple bridgewater cranberry label contains only cranberries.the yankee cranberry label also contains the green leaves of a cranberry plant,and has many fewer cranberries on the district court described the gardenia labels as the most similar of any set.id.at.although both labels contain three flowers arranged in a triangle,the bridgewater flowers are all white,while the yankee flowers have yellow elements.the bridgewater label also includes more green leaves,whereas the flowers themselves fill most of the yankee mulberries in the bridgewater label are much redder than those in the yankee label,which are a dark,almost black,color.the yankee label also includes more leaves,which are the focal point of the yankee raspberry label has many more leaves than the bridgewater raspberry jubilee label,which is almost entirely filled with bridgewater french vanilla photograph has ice cream cones filled with vanilla ice cream.the photograph is taken so that all of the cones are in focus.the yankee french vanilla only features empty cones,with no ice cream.one cone is the focus of the picture the rest are a blurry the bridgewater fragrance cinnamon rolls and the yankee cinnamon display photographs of cinnamon rolls.however,the yankee photograph also includes cinnamon sticks,while the bridgewater rolls highlight the sugary frosting found on a cinnamon the bridgewater apple pie and the yankee spiced apple contain photographs of apple pies.however,the yankee photograph also features a basket and several apple slices.the bridgewater photograph contains several whole apples.also,in the bridgewater photographs,the darkish filling is oozing out of the pies,while the yankee pies are lighter in color and not leaking apple filling.
the district court found that the vertical display system is entirely functional,and therefore not entitled to trade dress protection.yankee i,d at.although we agree as to the functionality of the display,we note that a combination of functional elements may itself be entitled to trade dress protection.lund,at.
we note that yankee has not been entirely consistent in its definition of its trade dress in its appellate brief.at times,it appears that yankee is arguing that individual features of its product line,namely its labels,its catalogues and its vertical display system,deserve trade dress protection.this was the analysis undertaken by the district court.at other points,however,yankee disclaims such an approach.we note that the burden to clearly identify the trade dress at issue is on the plaintiff.see,landscape forms columbia cascade,cir.moreover,at least one federal court has previously criticized yankee for failing in this regard.yankee candle new england candle,d,vacated pursuant to settlement,d.after a careful review of the record,we conclude that yankee has been sufficiently consistent as to these two descriptions of its trade dress for us to evaluate them on appeal.
we note that we are troubled by the inclusion of yankee catalog in its combination trade dress claim.a combination trade dress claim is one that includes a number of different features of a product or its packaging which,taken together,are potentially indicative of source.in this case,although the candles,their labels,and the vertical display system are all seen at the same time,the catalog is a separate item mailed to consumers at their homes.moreover,bridgewater catalog is a wholesale one,sent only to retailers.even if we were willing to accept that yankee catalog may constitute part of its trade dress,and even if bridgewater catalog is eerily similar to yankee,we do not see how that similarity could contribute to any consumer confusion.at any rate,because we conclude that yankee must establish that its combination has acquired secondary meaning,and has not in fact done so,whether the catalog is included or not in the combination claim is ultimately irrelevant.
we note that other circuits may be less willing to apply this glo
