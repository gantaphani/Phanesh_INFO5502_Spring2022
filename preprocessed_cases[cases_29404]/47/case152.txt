opinion of the court 
we consider this case on an expedited appeal from the united states district court for the district of new jersey.the parties to this appeal,dam things from denmark,troll company aps together dam things,and russ berrie and company,russ,are purveyors of,pudgy,plastic dolls with big grins and wild hair.dam things,a danish company,asserts that its copyright in its original troll design,the basic good luck troll,has been restored pursuant to.section is a highly unusual provision which has restored copyright protection in a vast number of foreign works previously in the public domain.dam things brought this action against russ alleging infringement of its restored copyright if restoration is proper under the statute,the key remaining issues are whether there is infringement,and if so,whether the infringing works will be totally prohibited or will be entitled to mandatory licenses under safe harbor for derivative works.
upon application by dam things,the district court granted a preliminary injunction forbidding russ from selling any trolls after february,in its opinion and order,the district court explained that the preliminary injunction was warranted because in all likelihood dam things could establish that the copyright in the good luck troll designs was restored under and that dam things could also prove that russ infringed its restored copyright.
russ attacks the district court grant of the preliminary injunction on two grounds.first,russ argues that the dam things troll,does not qualify for copyright restoration,in part because dam things abandoned its copyright.second,russ contends that even if restoration is proper,the injunction was improvidently granted because the russ trolls at least qualify for the safe harbor protection provides for derivative works.
we believe that the district court properly determined that dam things was likely to establish that copyright qualified for restoration and that this copyright was not abandoned by dam things.we find,however,that the district court subsequent analysis was flawed in two ways.first,the district court conflated the tests for infringement and derivative works,and it therefore did not properly consider the possibility that any of the russ trolls qualified for safe harbor for derivative works.second,the district court did not conduct the proper comparison of each of the allegedly infringing russ trolls against the restored dam things.as we believe that the district court based its grant of the injunction on an incomplete factual and legal analysis,we will vacate the injunction and remand for further consideration by the district court in light of this opinion.
we note that the district court somewhat conclusory treatment of the issues,and trolls,may have been due to the parties lack of clarity as to what troll designs were the subject of their arguments.essentially,the parties label the trolls and group them as suits each party interests.the parties briefs accordingly ask us to rule in sweeping fashion as to the protection,or lack thereof,to be afforded to the various russ and dam things trolls.the district court opinion adopts such a general approach in grouping all of the trolls together,referring to the dam things trolls generally as the good luck troll designs.the court reasoning,however,was based on its determination that the copyright in the original good luck troll,qualified for restoration.furthermore,on appeal dam things has clearly stated that is the only troll in which it seeks restoration.we note at the outset,therefore,that we will limit our analysis to the arguments pertaining to the restoration of pl.
in the,thomas dam,a danish woodcarver,created a troll figure for his daughter out of rubber.he called it the good luck troll,claiming that it had the ability to bring good luck to whomever possessed it.apparently,his creation garnered much attention from the community and dam decided to sell trolls to the public.he first manufactured them in his home,and soon established a factory outside of his home for this purpose.an article from the danish weekly magazine se hqr dated september,features a photograph of thomas dam daughter holding the trolls and tells of the troll rising to sales of trolls each month in denmark alone.in,the trolls began to be produced in pvc instead of rubber,increasing their durability.as the troll success continued,dam began selling his trolls in other countries.according to dam things,the dam trolls were first sold in the united states in.
in,thomas dam applied for a united states design patent for a troll doll,and the patent was issued in.this troll doll was later described by thomas dam as as opposed to the original troll,and certain photographs of the troll submitted with the application reflect that the troll has hair pulled back in a ponytail.dam things filed applications for copyright registration of both the and trolls in and then again in after its initial applications were rejected for improperly designating the copyright holder as denmark.dam things has held and continues to hold a valid danish copyright in the trolls.dam things from denmark russ berrie,d.in,the district court for the district of columbia held that the dam things trolls submitted for patent and copyright protection were in the public domain,because they were published in the united states with improper were marked with denmark and the date or with just the date,instead of with the company name and with no notice at all.scandia house,dam things establishment,hereinafter scandia.
in the early,russell berrie was a manufacturer representative for two companies who sold dam things trolls.berrie started his own company,russ berrie and company,in and began to sell trolls manufactured by dam things licensee,royalty design,using the dam things molds,in.when royalty design went bankrupt,russ then used the dam things molds to manufacture trolls.berrie claims that in his company began to modify the trolls.in,russ sent a dam things troll pencil topper to be used to make a mold and to manufacture trolls in china.in russ also sent to china a photo of a dam things troll from the russ catalog for the purpose of making a mold and manufacturing trolls.in the,russ obtained fifteen copyright registrations for as derivative works of the photographs of the dam things trolls in the russ catalogs.
dam things now claims copyright infringement of its public domain troll.this unusual claim is made possible by an act of congress and is grounded on dam things assertion that its copyright in its original troll has been restored pursuant to.in this legislation,congress declared that a wide range of foreign works previously in the public domain in this country,perhaps for many years,are once again afforded copyright protection.the united states took this action in an effort to comply with agreements it had entered into with foreign governments regarding intellectual property rights.although russ points out the extraordinary windfall dam things will receive,and the extraordinary burden it will bear,if dam things copyright is restored,the legislature purpose in providing these protections for foreign copyright holders was to ensure greater protection for american copyright holders abroad.
this protection results from the united states promise,in the context of the trips annex to the agreement establishing the world trade organization wto,to adhere to the berne convention,which the united states had entered in.melville nimmer david nimmer,nimmer on copyright hereinafter nimmer.in order to comply with the berne convention rule of retroactivity contained in article congress enacted the uruguay round agreements act.id.the act supplanted a previous version of enacted only one year earlier in an effort to comply with the north american free trade agreement nafta,and provided for broad restoration of foreign works.id.section of the copyright act now provides for automatic restoration of copyright,as of january,for an original work of authorship which meets the following requirements 
a is protected under subsection a which provides for a term of protection equal to what the work would have received if the work had never entered the public domain in the united states,and excepts certain works which were ever owned or administered by the alien property custodian 
b is not in the public domain in its source country through expiration of term of protection 
c is in the public domain in the united states due to 
i noncompliance with formalities imposed at any time by united states copyright law,including failure of renewal,lack of proper notice,or failure to comply with any manufacturing requirements 
ii lack of subject matter protection in the case of sound recordings fixed before february,or 
iii lack of national eligibility and 
d has at least one author or rightholder who was,at the time the work was created,a national or domiciliary of an eligible country,and if published,was first published in an eligible country and not published in the united states during the period following publication in such eligible country.
dam things claims that its copyright in its original troll qualifies for automatic restoration in accordance with.if it does,then the copyright shall subsist for the remainder of the term of copyright that the work would have otherwise been granted in the united states if the work never entered the public domain in the united states.a b.
section also provides some relief for reliance parties american authors who copied the restored works while they were in the public domain in the united states.d.section defines reliance party in relevant part as any person who a with respect to a particular work,engages in acts,before the source country of that work becomes an eligible country,which would have violated section if the restored work had been subject to copyright protection,and who,after the source country becomes an eligible country,continues to engage in such acts h a parties who were in fact copying the restored work are given one year to sell the now infringing works after being given a notice of intent to enforce nie by the author of the restored work.d.but,the statute also provides a safe harbor in the form of a mandatory license for authors of derivative works they are allowed to continue manufacturing and selling their work,but must pay the author of the restored work reasonable compensation.d 
dam things filed this copyright infringement suit on august.in its complaint,dam things sets forth six grounds for relief,and seeks thirteen forms of relief,including injunctive relief.on august,the district court entered an order to show cause as to why an order should not be entered for preliminary injunctive relief.both parties filed a series of declarations as well as briefs in support of their respective positions.the district court concluded that dam things had demonstrated a likelihood of success on its copyright infringement claim and on december,it entered a second amended order granting dam things a preliminary injunction and detailing its terms.part of this order instructs that russ will be entirely prohibited from selling its troll dolls as of february,year after the date of the nie the court also ordered dam things to pay a cash or surety bond in the amount of.the case comes before us on an expedited appeal.
as dam things brought this action to enforce an alleged copyright,the district court exercised jurisdiction pursuant to a.we exercise jurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal of the district court issuance of a preliminary injunction pursuant to a.we review the district court issuance of the preliminary injunction for an abuse of discretion.the court of appeals for the second circuit has explained a district court may abuse its discretion by applying an incorrect legal standard or by basing the preliminary injunction on a clearly erroneous finding of fact.waldman publ g landoll,cir.in other words,we will still review the district court legal determinations and its application of the law to the facts de novo.see southco,kanebridge,cir.
the district court applied the established test in order to determine whether to grant dam things a preliminary injunction whether the movant has shown a reasonable probability of success on the merits whether the movant will be irreparably injured by denial of the relief whether granting preliminary relief will result in even greater harm to the nonmoving party and whether granting the preliminary relief will be in the public interest.dam things from denmark russ berrie,d,quoting doe bd.of med.exam rs,cir.as we conclude that the district court committed legal error in the analysis leading to its determination that dam things had a reasonable probability of success on the merits,we will limit our discussion to this first prong,and therefore we will examine the merits of dam things claim under the statute and the district court treatment of it.this requires a inquiry first,does dam things hold a restored copyright,second,did russ infringe dam things copyright,and,third,is russ protected by the safe harbor for creators of derivative works 
eligibility for restoration 
background 
as set forth above,provides essentially four requirements for restoration of a foreign work copyright that are relevant here.first,the copyright has not expired in its source country.second,it is in the public domain in the united states because of failure to comply with formalities.third,the author of the work was a national or domiciliary of an eligible country.fourth,the work was first published in an eligible country not less than thirty days prior to being published in the united states.the first two requirements regarding the continued existence of foreign copyright protection and the reason for the work presence in the public domain were challenged by russ before the district court.however,we believe that they were properly disposed of in the court opinion.as to the third requirement,russ has not challenged the fact that thomas dam is a national of an eligible country.we will therefore limit our discussion,as the parties did their arguments before us,to the place of first publication.
while dam things claims that the troll for which it seeks restoration was first published in denmark,russ contends that it was actually first published in the united states.underlying this argument is the preliminary question in this troll is at issue here dam things has presented one troll to the copyright office,to the district court,and to us as the troll whose copyright has been exhibit pl dam things represents this doll as an original good luck troll.it was reportedly manufactured in,confirmed by the fact that it is made of rubber and later dolls were made of pvc.further,it is shown in a september,magazine being held by thomas dam daughter.the doll was presented to us in a box to protect it,as the rubber doll stuffed with sawdust has become very fragile with age.the short and stout troll appears to have had four fingers and four toes which have been broken with age and are now protected by stockings.it has a cheery smile on its face,a broad nose,large brown circular eyes,large pointy ears,and a mass of shaggy,dark hair.the doll stands erect with its short arms pointing out to the sides.although not required by statute,dam things applied for restoration of the copyright in this troll doll on march.
russ,on the other hand,focuses its attention on what it terms the or public domain troll.this is the troll that was the subject of dam things design patent.dam things has referred to this at various times as a version of and has also applied for a new registration for this troll in as being an adaptation of previously published boy doll.dam things has not agreed that this troll was first published in,and,in fact,on its copyright application it claimed it was first published in.the troll that was the subject of the design patent was presented to the district court and us as plaintiff exhibit.this troll doll appears much like the has four fingers on each hand and four toes on each foot,a large smile,broad nose,and large round eyes.it also stands erect with its arms outstretched,and it has a short,pudgy figure the one difference which has been pointed to and was relied on by the copyright office in considering as a derivative work for copyright registration purposes was its rounded ears in contrast to the pointy ears of.
russ does not contest before us the fact that was first published in denmark.instead,it argues that is the relevant troll because it is really the troll that dam things contends russ infringed.dam things,on the other hand,suggests that is not a distinct work from and therefore if one of them is infringed then the other is as well.neither party argues that all of dam things trolls are identical in appearance,and both seem to concede that restoration of a copyright in a troll must of necessity be linked to a specific troll which was first used in its nation of origin other than the united states.while the standards for judging infringement and derivative works are useful in some copyright analyses,we are confronted with a creature of statute and must decide in exactly what work the copyright was restored.the parties seem to conflate the statutory requirement for restoration,with dam things seeking restoration of its troll,and russ seeking to deny restoration in dam things trolls.however,we can not properly consider this argument framed in this fashion regarding the breadth of the copyright protection,given the fact that the myriad trolls paraded before us by dam things are not identical works,and the statute envisions that one must be able to identify the first publication of a tangible item,a work,in a specific location.here,dam things made clear at oral argument that was the only specific item as to which restoration was sought 
as the other trolls that were created after are not identical works and were first used admittedly at different times and even in different locations than,our holding as to the restoration of does not control as to restoration of any other specific troll.that is not to say that the copyright restored in might not provide protection for the other works based upon the appropriate originality analysis.understandably,and appropriately,on remand the district court will have to determine the extent of the protection provided to other dam things works to the extent that russ argues that its trolls are merely derivative or even copies of dam things works other than 
our holding today as to restoration is therefore limited to,and our discussion of appellant arguments will be limited accordingly.all that we need to decide is whether,as dam things urges,the copyright in was restored.therefore the place where was first published is what matters.
russ contentions 
judicial estoppel 
russ argues that dam things should be estopped from contending now that its trolls were not first published in the united states because it previously represented to the united states patent office and to the court during the scandia litigation that,the troll for which it was seeking design patent protection,was first published in the united states.russ specifically points to two statements made by thomas dam.first,in his patent application filed on september,dam represented that he did not believe that this design was ever known or used before his invention thereof or patented or described in any printed publication in any country before his invention thereof,or more than one year prior to this application.second,in the course of the scandia litigation,before the issues were limited solely to the matter of copyright,thomas dam reaffirmed the truth of this statement and also explained that was vastly different artistically from.
we have held that judicial estoppel is appropriate only where the following factors are met the party to be estopped is asserting a position that is irreconcilably inconsistent with one he or she asserted in a prior proceeding the party changed his or her position in bad faith,in a culpable manner threatening to the court authority or integrity and the use of judicial estoppel is tailored to address the affront to the court authority or integrity.montrose med.group participating sav.plan bulger,cir.
as discussed above,our restoration analysis is limited to.here the threshold requirement of inconsistency is not satisfied because the representations made regarding qualification for a design patent do not pertain to,and,therefore,are not inconsistent with representations regarding date and place of publication.russ points to statements in the patent application and in thomas dam later affidavit that specifically address the requirements for patent protection that the design be unobvious,a,and that the subject of the patent has not been described in a printed publication in this or a foreign country or in public use or on sale in this country,more than one year prior to the date of the application.both of these representations were made with respect to,however,and therefore wholly unrelated to the issue before us.dam made no representations regarding,let alone regarding its date or place of first publication.therefore,dam things position here that was first published in denmark in is not irreconcilably inconsistent with its position before the patent office that was not previously published outside the united states more than a year prior to the date of 
furthermore,we have previously explained that judicial estoppel is appropriately applied in a narrow category of cases because it is an extraordinary remedy that should be employed only when a party inconsistent behavior would otherwise result in a miscarriage of justice.montrose med.group participating sav.plan,at internal quotations omitted.we will not expand our application of judicial estoppel to factual settings where the specific test we have set forth is not satisfied 
abandonment 
russ also contends that dam things abandoned its copyright in.it points specifically to dam things publication of many trolls in the united states in the without proper notice,the fact that it did not appeal the scandia decision,and its admission to scandia that the trolls were in the public domain,as acts constituting abandonment.abandonment occurs only if there is an intent by the copyright proprietor to surrender rights in his work.nimmer.while there is a split of authority as to whether an overt act is necessary to establish abandonment,it is undisputed there must be either an act,or a failure to act,from which we can readily infer an intent to abandon the right.see id.setting forth the conflicting authorities.we agree with the district court that the acts relied upon by russ are insufficient to establish that dam things intended to abandon its united states copyright.in doing so,we do not suggest that,as dam things proposes,abandonment may never be a bar to restoration pursuant to.
conclusion 
the district court concluded that dam things can prove all of the requisite elements of and is therefore likely to succeed on the merits of its restoration claim.dam things from denmark russ berrie,d.we agree with this aspect of the district court ruling,as it appears that dam things will be able to establish that satisfies all four requirements for restoration,including first publication in an eligible country.
copyright infringement 
upon determining that the restoration of the dam things copyright was likely,the district court focused on the merits of dam things likelihood of success on the copyright infringement claim.the district court reasoning was as follows 
the court has carefully examined the dueling trolls at issue here,and is convinced that plaintiff has made a prima facie showing of infringement.a finder of fact who compares russ trolls with dam could not reasonably conclude that the russ trolls sic are original designs or that they comprise original expression of the idea of a troll.in the present case,all of the troll embodiments involved are very similar in appearance.this court believes that,for purposes of copyright law,the designs are too similar to be given individual copyright protection.contrary to defendant contention,plaintiff sic do not claim a copyright on the idea of a troll or a monopoly on trolldom.nor are they entitled to it.but plaintiff is entitled to protect its particular,original,identifiable expression of troll.
russ argues that it has modified dam designs by changing the size of the heads,changing the facial expressions,and changing the shape and size of the dolls bodies,and that these changes are sufficient to constitute original designs.def.surreply br.at.simply because one troll nose is larger or one ears are slightly more pointed,or that a troll mouth is opened or closed,in this court view,does not make these designs sufficiently distinct so as to be afforded independent copyright protection 
in further defense of its trolls,russ maintains that only minimal or slight creativity need be demonstrated in order for a work to be original.see feist publications,d.but as defendant also points out,something more than a merely trivial variation,something recognizably his own is necessary for a showing of originality.alfred bell catalda fine arts,cir.here,the court believes that russ trolls contain only trivial variations from dam original troll,and therefore are not sufficiently original 
as the foregoing analysis makes clear,this court is convinced that all of the dolls in this case involve one basic troll design thomas dam created this design in and in gjol,denmark.his company owns the rights to it,and it is entitled to copyright protection for the original design.
dam things from denmark,d at footnotes omitted.
we believe that the district court analysis was too conclusory,given the complex issues of infringement and originality before it,and particularly in light of the unique challenges presented by.we are specifically concerned with the district court incomplete consideration of russ contention that its trolls would qualify as derivative works.as the united states courts of appeals have yet to provide any guidance as to the application of,and,additionally,as courts often confuse and even conflate the issues of infringement and originality,we will set forth the proper standards and analysis that needs to be conducted by a district court faced with an issue of whether a reliance party work infringes and should be barred,or is a derivative work entitled to licensing.
infringement 
in cases where copyright infringement is at issue,the court should first consider whether there has been infringement by comparing each of the allegedly infringing works against the restored work the test for copyright infringement is.there are two essential elements ownership of copyright,and copying by the defendant.whelan,jaslow dental,cir.copying is proven by showing not only that the defendant had access to a copyrighted work,but also that there are substantial similarities between the two works.see also ford motor summit motor,cir footnote omitted c opying is demonstrated when someone who has access to a copyrighted work uses material substantially similar to the copyrighted work in a manner which interferes with a right protected by.
following the second circuit lead in arnstein porter,cir,we have further subdivided the test for substantial similarity into two considerations.see whelan,at noting our adoption of the arnstein bifurcated substantial similarity test see also sid marty krofft television,mcdonald,cir describing the two considerations as extrinsic and intrinsic.first,the opinions of experts may be called upon in determining whether there is sufficient similarity between the works so as to conclude that the alleged infringer copied the work.whelan,at.second,the is to determine whether a would believe that the copying was of protectible aspects of the copyrighted work.id.one court has described this test as being whether the ordinary observer,unless he set out to detect the disparities,would be disposed to overlook them,and regard their aesthetic appeal as the same.folio impressions,byer california,cir,quoted in boisson banian,cir.
the court of appeals for the second circuit has termed these two considerations as actual copying which focuses on access in conjunction with probative similarity and actionable copying which considers whether there is substantial similarity between the alleged infringing work and protectible elements of the original work boisson,at see also sturdza united arab emirates,dividing the test into the consideration of whether the defendant actually copies and whether it copied protectible aspects of the copyrighted work.the test for actual copying can be established by direct evidence or inferred by evidence of access and similarites that are probative of copying between the works,and expert testimony.see laureyssens,at,quoted in boisson,at.however,the supreme court has explained that n ot all copying is copyright infringement.feist publ ns,rural.serv,d.the trial court therefore must still consider whether the copying is actionable,viewing the item through the lay person eyes,focusing on whether the substantial similarities relate to protectible material boisson,at.
derivative works 
in light of the special provisions in,once a court has found infringement,it must consider whether the safe harbor provision is implicated,namely,whether the infringing works are derivatives of the restored work just as with all other works,originality is a constitutionally mandated prerequisite for copyright protection for derivative works.feist publ ns,at.see also const.art.i.however,all aspects of a work need not be original with the author.an author work can utilize expression from an already existing work created by another author,or even that same author.a new work that utilizes expression from a previously existing work is considered to be derivative of that work.the copyright act defines a derivative work as based upon one or more preexisting works,such as a translation,musical arrangement,dramatization,fictionalization,motion picture version,sound recording,art reproduction,abridgment,condensation,or any other form in which a work may be recast,transformed,or adapted.an author right to protection of the derivative work only extends to the elements that he has added to the work he can not receive protection for the underlying work.furthermore,if the underlying work is itself protected by copyright,then he will receive no protection at all on the contrary,he is a copyright infringer,because in order to create his work he has copied the underlying work.however,section obviously creates an exception to this rule and even though the foreign author has a restored copyright,the creator of the derivative work is given special dispensation and is not considered an infringer,and is instead treated as a licensee.d.
in considering the originality required to qualify for copyright protection as a derivative work,the supreme court has explained to qualify for copyright protection,a work must be original to the author.original,as the term is used in copyright,means only that the work was independently created by the author as opposed to copied from other works,and that it possesses at least some minimal degree of creativity.feist publ ns,at.emphasis added citations omitted.the court went on to explain to be sure,the requisite level of creativity is extremely low even a slight amount will suffice.id.the court of appeals for the second circuit has explained we do follow the school of cases in this circuit and elsewhere supporting the proposition that to support a copyright there must be at least some substantial variation,not merely a trivial variation such as might occur in the translation to a different medium.batlin son,snyder,cir en banc.in batlin,the second circuit considered whether a plastic uncle sam bank based on a cast iron original contained sufficient originality to satisfy the requirements for derivative works.id.the court concluded that differences as to the shape of the satchel,the leaves in the eagle talons,and other such alterations were too minor to support a claim for originality.id.at.by contrast,in litigation over the alleged copying of paddington bear,the second circuit found sufficient variations to constitute originality in the drawing of the bear where changes included the changed proportions of the hat,the elimination of individualized fingers and toes,the overall smoothing of to give the drawing a different,cleaner look.eden toys,florelee undergarment,cir.the court there explained that while the alterations to the new drawing were too minor to entitle the new work to claim a different aesthetic appeal,they are still original and substantial enough to deserve independent copyright protection.id.at.the court of appeals for the seventh circuit has contended that batlin presented a change by the second circuit to a less liberal test requiring that a derivative work be substantially different from the underlying work in order to be copyrightable.gracen bradford,cir the second circuit analysis appears unchanged,however,as that court has reconfirmed its approach in batlin the law requires more than a modicum of originality.this has been interpreted to require a distinguishable variation that is more than merely trivial.waldman publ g landoll,cir citing batlin son,at.
we have similarly applied the originality test set forth in feist that a work must possess at least some minimal degree of creativity.southco,kanebridge,cir quoting feist publ ns,at.in southco,we went on to explain although the court has noted that this is not a stringent standard,it has also held that there is a narrow category of works in which the creative spark is utterly lacking or so trivial as to be virtually nonexistent.id.at.quoting feist publ ns,at.when considering originality,therefore,the court must determine whether the author creativity is enough to overcome a charge of triviality.
district court analysis 
these descriptions of the tests for copyright infringement and for derivative works illustrate the complex task that a court faces in addressing these issues.in this case,the district court did assess the similarity between the trolls,and russ does not challenge the court determination that the russ trolls infringe dam things restored copyright in.we therefore focus our discussion on the derivative works analysis.unfortunately,it is not clear whether the court actually addressed the derivative works issue which requires a determination as to originality,but,if so,it did not apply the proper standards for originality instead,it conflated them with the requirements for infringement,which involve findings regarding similarity.furthermore,the district court did not properly compare the relevant trolls.
dam things claims that the district court did consider the issue of originality,because it used the magic derivative works language here,the court believes that russ trolls contain only trivial variations from dam original troll,and therefore are not sufficiently original.dam things from denmark,d at emphasis added.but,then,in the next paragraph when comparing the dam things trolls to one of the russ trolls,the district court reverted to a broader statement t hey are substantially similar in appearance,and a casual observer would be unable to differentiate the maker of these troll dolls.id.at.the court seems to have completely intertwined the two tests to a point where it is impossible to determine where one analysis begins and the other ends,if in fact there are two analyses.it is important to remember that by definition,derivative works are substantially similar to the original work,because a work is not derivative unless it has been substantially copied from a prior work.nimmer.the test for minimal creativity is therefore necessarily separate and apart from the test for substantial similarity.we can not conclude that the district court conducted a derivative works analysis,apart from a similarity analysis,because although the court used the trivial variations language that is used to distinguish works as derivative,it never once employed the word derivative or noted that a second test needs to be applied 
the distinction between the tests for infringement and for originality may be nuanced,but it does exist and must be carefully considered by the court.the court of appeals for the second circuit explained 
the difference between these two tests is not merely academic.a work which makes contributions to an existing one may be copyrighted as a derivative work and yet,because it retains the same aesthetic appeal as the original work,render the holder liable for infringement of the original copyright if the derivative work were to be published without permission from the owner of the original copyright.
eden toys,at the fact that the two companies dolls have the same aesthetic appeal or are very similar in appearance does not rule out the applicability of the safe harbor for derivative works 
the district court analysis was also deficient in that it conducted a generalized comparison of the dam things trolls and the russ trolls.in order to determine whether one work is a derivative of another,the trial judge must actually compare the exact works at issue.in this case dam things presented its trolls to the district court on one occasion and russ presented its trolls on a separate occasion.the trolls themselves were never placed into evidence.as a result,the court never had the opportunity to compare the physical trolls of both russ and dam things.while each side places the blame for this evidentiary lapse on the other party,the placement of the blame is irrelevant.furthermore,we will not state that as a matter of law it is insufficient for the judge to consider photos of the trolls instead of the trolls themselves.however,having ourselves been faced with a legion of trolls on counsels tables during oral arguments,we know for a fact that the photographs are no substitute for the real thing in this case.
the district court should have compared the relevant trolls against one another to determine whether the various russ trolls are derivatives of.without detailed consideration of the russ trolls as against,the district court determined that all of the russ trolls and all of the dam things trolls are too similar to be distinguishable.it explained a finder of fact who compares russ trolls with dam could not reasonably conclude that the sic russ trolls are original designs or that they comprise original expression of the idea of a troll.dam things from denmark russ berrie,d.this blanket treatment relating to the trolls fell short of what is required.as we saw firsthand,these trolls come in all shapes and,and nine inch giants,as well as grandparents,teenagers,and babies.perhaps in the abstract one can believe that a troll is a troll,but it is clear that all trolls can not simply be judged alike,particularly when the inquiry must focus on distinct aspects of each.it is certainly possible that some of the russ trolls could be considered to be derivative works while others would not.this exacting comparison needs to be made.
on remand,the district court must reexamine dam things likelihood of success on the merits.while a party need not prove that its success is certain,and is not expected to submit all of its proof,it is essential that the district court consider the evidence before it according to the proper legal standards.therefore,on remand,the district court should look at the infringing russ trolls and individually compare each one to to determine whether it constitutes a derivative work of the dam things troll 
as the district court conducted an incomplete legal analysis of the likelihood of dam things success on the merits in this case,we will vacate the district court preliminary injunction order and remand this case for further consideration consistent with this opinion costs on appeal are to be borne equally by the parties.
dam things complaint sets forth five other claims for relief which are not implicated in this appeal.
