opinion of the court 
plaintiffs appeal from a grant of summary judgment.the district court found that the copyright office rulemaking with respect to the internet streaming of radio broadcast programming was entitled to deference.the plaintiffs argue that the exclusion from copyright protection for nonsubscription broadcast transmissions of recorded music is unambiguously intended to apply to their simultaneous webcasting of their radio broadcast signal.we conclude that,whether or not the copyright office interpretation of d a is to be accorded deference under chevron,natural resources defense council,d chevron,the copyright office arguments in support of its position are persuasive,see skidmore swift,and our own independent interpretation of the statute accords with that of the copyright office.we therefore affirm.
this case deals with copyright protection for sound recordings.the creator of a musical composition has long had a right of exclusive public performance of that musical piece.therefore,every time you hear the ubiquitous refrain from happy birthday in a public performance,a subsidiary of cashes a royalty check however,the owner of a copyright in a sound recording of a musical composition has long had very little copyright protection.until there was no copyright protection at all.with the sound recording amendment of,stat,a limited copyright in the reproduction of sound recordings was established in an effort to combat recording piracy.however,there was still no right to public performance of that sound recording.therefore,while playing a compact disc recording of happy birthday in a concert hall for the paying public would still enrich,the person or company that owned the copyright on the cd recording of the music would earn no remuneration beyond the proceeds from the original sale of the recording.this dichotomy of copyright protection has a significant impact in the radio broadcasting industry.while radio stations routinely pay copyright royalties to songwriters and composers through associations like the american society of composers,authors,and publishers and broadcast music,ascap and broadcast music,bmi for the privilege of broadcasting recorded performances of popular music,they do not pay the recording industry royalties for that same privilege.perhaps surprisingly,this state of affairs,until about ten years ago,produced relatively high levels of contentment for all parties.the recording industry and broadcasters existed in a sort of symbiotic relationship wherein the recording industry recognized that radio airplay was free advertising that lured consumers to retail stores where they would purchase recordings and in return,the broadcasters paid no fees,licensing or otherwise,to the recording industry for the performance of those recordings.the recording industry had repeatedly sought,however,additional copyright protection in the form of a performance copyright.until,those efforts were rejected by congress.
the brought significant technological change.the advance of digital recording technology and the prospect of digital transmission capabilities created the possibility that consumers would soon have access to services whereby they could pay for high quality digital audio transmissions subscription services or even pay for specific songs to be played on demand interactive services the recording industry was concerned that the traditional balance that had existed with the broadcasters would be disturbed and that new,alternative paths for consumers to purchase recorded music in ways that cut out the recording industry products would erode sales of recorded music.congress responded to these concerns with the digital performance right in sound recordings act of,stat.dpra.the dpra added to the list of protectable rights a digital audio transmission performance right.
t he owner of copyright under this title has the exclusive rights to do and to authorize any of the following 
in the case of sound recordings,to perform the copyrighted work publicly by means of a digital audio transmission.
when creating this new right,however,congress also created exemptions from it.of specific application to the present case was the exemption added to d a iii supp.i for a noninteractive,nonsubscription broadcast transmission.the paradigmatic nonsubscription broadcast transmission was a traditional radio broadcast.this exemption was founded in congress desire not to impose new and unreasonable burdens on radio and television broadcasters,which often promote,and appear to pose no threat to,the distribution of sound recordings,at house report app.at 
additionally,the dpra,in section,codified at d supp.i and f supp.i,created a statutory licensing regime for noninteractive,subscription services copyright holders were required to grant licenses to eligible subscription services.in cases where the copyright holder and the transmitter could not agree on the royalty rate for the license,the dpra outlined an arbitration mechanism for determining a reasonable rate f authorized the copyright office to convene a copyright arbitration royalty panel carp to arbitrate licensing rates.
but technology continued to advance,and the internet soon became a viable medium over which to transmit,in real time,sound recordings.this transmission of sound recordings over the internet is known as streaming and webcasting,and the transmitter of an internet stream of music is known as a webcaster.anyone with a computer,a reasonably speedy connection to the internet,streaming software and the equipment to copy songs from cds to a computer in the popular and compressed format rip the songs could webcast sound recordings through streaming.additionally,established radio broadcasters began to webcast simultaneously over the internet their broadcast programming.it is this webcasting that is the principal concern in the present case.
again,the recording industry became concerned that technology would erode recording sales by providing alternative sources of high quality recorded performances.in congress responded by amending the dpra amendments to the copyright act with the digital millennium copyright act,stat.dmca.the dmca expanded the class of transmissions available for the statutory licensing regime under the dpra to include eligible nonsubscription webcasting,and eliminated from d two of the nonsubscription,noninteractive exemptions to the digital audio transmission performance right.the exemption for nonsubscription broadcast transmissions was,however,left intact and moved to its current location at d a.the deletion of the other two exemptions wa s not intended to affect the exemption for nonsubscription broadcast transmissions.conf,at,code cong.admin.news at,conference report app.at.
in march of,the recording industry association of america riaa petitioned the copyright office for a rulemaking to clarify whether webcasting the simultaneous internet streaming by radio broadcasters of their broadcast programming was a nonsubscription broadcast transmission that was exempt from the digital audio transmission performance right.after a notice and comment procedure,in december of the copyright office promulgated a rule stating that webcasting is not an exempt transmission under d a.public performance of sound recordings definition of a service,final rule,streaming regulation app.at.
the national association of broadcasters,along with some of its more prominent the register of copyrights in the present action seeking judicial review of the rulemaking.the riaa joined the case as an.the district court granted summary judgment for the copyright office and the riaa.the district court found the scope of the exemption in d a to be ambiguous and that the copyright office was empowered by congress to interpret that ambiguity in order to administer the statutory licensing scheme of f.therefore,because the copyright office rule was reasonable,the court found that the rulemaking was entitled to deference under chevron,and,hence,the rule was enforced.this appeal followed.
our review of the district court grant of summary judgment is plenary.sutton rasheed,cir.
we have determined that,in this appeal,we do not need to decide whether chevron or skidmore deference should apply to our review of the copyright office interpretation of d a.we come to this conclusion because,whichever standard of deference is accorded,we agree with the copyright office.
if we had determined under united states mead,d,that the copyright office had been delegated authority by congress to regulate the scope of the digital audio transmission performance copyright,we would afford chevron deference to the copyright office interpretation of that statute.if,on the other hand,we were to conclude that the copyright office had not been authorized by congress to enact rules with the force of law on the issue whether the exclusion from copyright protection for nonsubscription broadcast transmissions applies to simultaneous webcasting of radio broadcast signals,we would,under mead,afford the copyright office interpretation of the statute only skidmore deference.see skidmore,at.under skidmore,the copyright office determination can be a useful tool for interpreting the statute as an original matter.because we find that the copyright office interpretation is persuasive even under the less demanding standard of skidmore deference,we need not go on to parse out whether chevron deference should,in fact,be accorded the copyright office regulation here 
we begin the process of statutory interpretation with the plain meaning of the must first consider the text.new rock asset partners,preferred entity advancements,cir.the parties do not dispute that,under,webcasting comprises a public digital audio transmission thus,in order for webcasting to be exempt under d a from the digital audio transmission performance copyright,it must be noninteractive,nonsubscription and broadcast.the parties agree that webcasting is not part of an interactive service there is equally no dispute that webcasting is a nonsubscription transmission thus,the question becomes whether webcasting is a broadcast transmission.
for a definition of broadcast transmission,we look to j,which defines terms as used in the section.section j tells us that a broadcast transmission is a transmission made by a terrestrial broadcast station licensed as such by the federal communications commission.this merely moves us to a new inquiry what is a terrestrial broadcast station licensed as such by the fcc terrestrial we give its natural and logical meaning of earthbound.the appellees seek to import a sense of limitation of a transmission geographic range into the meaning of terrestrial.see peters opening br.at thus,the use of the word terrestrial suggests that congress had in mind transmissions within limited geographic ranges.this reading of terrestrial is unnaturally strained,and we will not distort the plain meaning so.we believe that the present case deals only with terrestrial broadcast stations whatever broadcast station may be determined to mean.therefore,a more nuanced parsing of the exact parameters of terrestrial is not necessary for the resolution of the present case.
the nub of the interpretive disagreement between the two sides is whether a broadcast station refers to the broadcaster as a business entity that operates broadcasting facilities or to the broadcasting facilities themselves and by extension the mode of transmission.if the appellants are correct then a broadcast station refers to the broadcasting entity and not to the physical transmitting facility.as a result,for example,any transmission including webcasting by any facility operated by clear channel communications,an entity operating a radio broadcasting facility under an fcc license would qualify as a broadcast transmission.so long as the transmission was noninteractive and nonsubscription,webcasting,it would be an exempt transmission under d a.in comparison,if the copyright office interpretation is correct,then j broadcast station is limited to a radio broadcasting facility,and all forms of webcasting of recorded music,whether webcasting or webcasting in some other form,are covered by the digital audio transmission performance copyright in and are not exempt.
although not dispositive,we can initially point to some obvious and irreconcilable consequences of the appellants argument that broadcast station refers to the entity,not the facility.one such consequence would be that any entity that operates at least one radio station would have carte blanche to digitally perform recordings via any conceivable transmission medium in a noninteractive,nonsubscription manner without limitation or copyright liability under.for example,the sound recording performance complement,which limits statutory licensees ability to transmit performances of multiple recorded songs from the same artist or from the same phonorecord within a short time of each other,would not apply to any transmission by an broadcaster.see d c i,j.additionally,the appellants in the present case could hypothetically expand their webcasting to include original programming unrelated to their programming,and their interpretation of nonsubscription broadcast transmission would serve to exempt that webcasting from the digital audio transmission performance copyright as well.against that possibility,appellants argue that the sole issue before the copyright office for rulemaking,and the sole issue presented in this declaratory judgment action,is whether the simultaneous internet streaming of the same program fare as offered by broadcasters pursuant to their fcc licenses qualifies for the section d a exemption.appellants br.at emphasis in original.but appellants put forward and we can find no limiting principle in their argument with respect to the definition of broadcast station that would restrict the product of their argument to simultaneous internet streaming of programming.
another ramification of the broadcasters interpretation about which they are quite pointedly silent,is that the meaning of the modifier terrestrial becomes absurd.under the appellants argument,a terrestrial broadcast station means a business entity that is contrast,we must assume,to one that is.to our knowledge,there are not,presently,any broadcasting companies incorporated in outer can there be.an interpretation of terrestrial broadcast station that distinguishes between earthbound and orbiting broadcasting entities is when there is a far more natural interpretation available.but it is entirely plausible to postulate entirely earthbound broadcasting facilities as opposed to broadcasting done through satellites.
because the broadcast station in question is one that must be licensed as such by the fcc,our interpretive quest leads us next to the licensing regime of the fcc.the federal communications act,et.fca is the source of such licensing.
for the relevant definitions,we look to 
broadcast station.the term broadcast station,broadcasting station,or radio broadcast station means a radio station equipped to engage in broadcasting as herein defined.
broadcasting.the term broadcasting means the dissemination of radio communications intended to be received by the public,directly or by the intermediary of relay stations.
the combination of and of the fca would limit a broadcast station to a physical facility that transmits radio position exactly.however,we must consider the entirety of the relevant phrase broadcast station licensed as such by the fcc and determine whether the fca provides any guidance with respect to what it means by the phrase licensed as such.appellants seek to have us equate a licensee with the broadcast station licensed as such by the fcc.a licensee under the fca is a person or entity,not a facility.see,the term licensee means the holder of a radio station license,no person shall transmit radio except with a license,c licenses are granted for the operation of a broadcasting station,restricting the ownership and transfer of licenses by and to certain individuals.this argument affords a superficial appeal,since a common usage of the term licensed often has as its subject a person seeking to perform a sanctioned act.a person,for example,is the licensee who is licensed to drive a car.
however,it is also clear that a station that is licensed is something other than a licensee,and,in fact,means a physical broadcasting facility.the acquisition or modification or renewal of a broadcast station license under the fca is inextricably linked to the operation of a specific broadcast facility referred to,harmoniously,as a broadcast or broadcasting station,and more specifically to the location and broadcasting qualities of that facility.c each license granted for the operation of a broadcasting station,b all applications for station licenses shall set forth the ownership and location of the proposed station and of the stations,if any,with which it is proposed to communicate the frequencies and the power desired to be used the purposes for which the station is to be used,h the station license shall not vest in the licensee any right to operate the station in any other manner than authorized therein a initial licenses for broadcast stations emphasis added implemented by fcc form detailing the types of changes in a broadcasting facility that require an application for license modification,including a multitude of technical changes affecting the nature and quality of the radio transmissions by the broadcasting facility.in this sense the fca,when authorizing the issuance of a license,exercises a licensing power over the facility that will be operated under the license.the license,while not literally held by the transmitting facility is inseparable from that that connection and concomitant regulation makes the station licensed.
therefore,a licensee means something distinct from a broadcast station licensed as such.the licensee is the person or entity holding the license,and the licensed station is the facility that the licensee is permitted to operate under the license.based on this examination of the fca,we believe it clear that a broadcast station licensed as such by the fcc,as the term is used in j,refers to the physical radio station facility that broadcasts radio signals over the air,and not to the business entity that operates the radio station.a broadcast transmission under d a would therefore be a radio transmission by a radio station facility operated subject to an fcc license and would not include a webcast.webcasting does not meet the definition of a nonsubscription broadcast transmission and does not,therefore,qualify under d a for an exemption from the digital audio transmission performance copyright of.
additionally,further examination of the statute using the remaining tools of statutory interpretation only confirms what follows from the statute language.for example,we consider other parts of to see if our interpretation of d a harmonizes with the section as a whole.united states morton,d noting that,generally,statutes should be read as a whole.also,we consider legislative history to gain an indication of unambiguous congressional intent that may aid our interpretation.see new rock asset partners,at.
first,we consider the remainder of.of particular interest is d b,which lays out an exemption from the digital audio transmission performance right for retransmissions of nonsubscription broadcast transmissions the appellees argue that the d a broadcast exemption as interpreted by the broadcasters is inconsistent with this retransmission exemption.subsection d b i i refers to retransmission by a terrestrial broadcast station,terrestrial translator,or terrestrial repeater licensed by the fcc.translators and repeaters are,first of all,technical form of facilities.see,a definitions.the inclusion of broadcast station as a means of retransmission in this list together with translator and repeater suggests that a broadcast station is also a physical facility.plus,interpreting broadcast station as an business entity would render superfluous the use of translator and repeater.any translators or repeaters licensed as such by the fcc would necessarily be owned by a licensee.under the appellants interpretation,that licensee,as an entity that operates broadcasting facilities,would be a broadcast station.therefore,the phrase broadcast station would include the facilities of a repeater or translator,and make their listing superfluous.see united states menasche.listing familiar canon of statutory interpretation that statutes should be interpreted to give meaning to each word.additionally,the words broadcast station,translator and repeater are all modified by the phrase licensed by the fcc.that translators and repeaters both physical facilities are described as licensable by the fcc further supports the textual conclusion,above,that the broadcast station licensed as such by the fcc in j is the physical transmitting facility.
likewise,d b limits the retransmission of a nonsubscription broadcast transmission to a radius of.as the district court sagely recognized,it makes little sense to exempt webcasting,which is global in nature,while simultaneously limiting retransmission to a radius.bonneville int l peters,d.the absurdity of this construction is apparent when one considers that,under the appellants interpretation,the webcasting of programming by the original broadcaster would be exempt under d a and transmissible world wide over the internet without any limitations.however,if a third party webcaster that did not hold any fcc licenses,such as yahoo,were to re transmit via webcast the exact same programming,that third party would unavoidably be covered by the digital audio transmission performance right in,and not exempt.if,as the broadcasters protest,congressional intent were simply to protect the industry relationship wherein the sale of sound recordings has been promoted by the airplay decisions of radio broadcasters,what possible purpose could be served by distinguishing between different purveyors of that exact same airplay decision appellants br.at.we are not convinced that there is a coherent principle distinguishing a third party retransmitter of the same programming and requiring that the stand on a different footing.id.at.a reading of d b in light of d a is that the express geographic limitation on third party retransmissions in d b can not coexist with the unlimited geographic reach of webcasting proposed by the appellants for d a.a far more harmonious reading of is achieved if d a is limited to broadcasting,and all forms of webcasting are nonexempt from.the retransmission provisions of d b strongly favor the copyright office interpretation of d a.
a consideration of the legislative history of the dpra and the dmca also reinforces our conclusions.starting with the dpra,it is apparent that the public performance right of was originally intended to be limited in scope.see senate report,at app.at u nder d a,any transmission to members of the public that is neither a subscription transmission nor part of an interactive service is exempt from the new digital performance right.this new right was expressly limited in knowing opposition to policies preferred by the copyright office at the time 
notwithstanding the views of the copyright office that it is appropriate to create a comprehensive performance right for sound recordings,the committee has sought to address the concerns of record producers and performers regarding the effects that new digital technology and distribution systems might have on their core business without upsetting the longstanding business and contractual relationships among record producers and performers,music composers and publishers and broadcasters that have served all of these industries well for decades.accordingly,the committee has chosen to create a carefully crafted and narrow performance right,applicable only to certain digital transmissions of sound recordings.
id.at app.at emphasis added.see also house report,at app.at.congress had in mind the symbiotic relationship between the recording industry and broadcasters,and did not seek to change the existing relationship.see senate report,at app.at it is the committee intent to provide copyright holders of sound recordings with the ability to control the distribution of their product by digital transmissions,without hampering the arrival of new technologies,and without imposing new and unreasonable burdens on radio and television broadcasters,which often promote,and appear to pose no threat to,the distribution of sound recordings.to that end,the dpra,as enacted,contained a much broader exemption from the performance right than is presently the case.see note,supra.the legislation did not affect the interests of broadcasters,as that industry has traditionally been understood.cong.rec.hatch,introducing the bill that became the dpra.if the technological status quo could be maintained,it might well be that the current laws could be tolerated.but,we know that technological developments such as satellite and digital transmission of recordings make sound recordings vulnerable to exposure to a vast audience through the initial sale of only a potential handful of records.id.at.
intervening technological developments did,ultimately,require further legislation.section d a was amended in the dmca to delete two exemptions that were either the cause of confusion as to the application of the dpra to certain nonsubscription services especially webcasters or which overlapped with other exemptions such as the exemption in subsection a iii for nonsubscription broadcast transmissions.the deletion of these two exemptions is not intended to affect the exemption for nonsubscription broadcast transmissions.conference report,at app.at.congress sought to clarif y that the digital sound recording performance right applies to nonsubscription digital audio services such as webcasting.staff of the house comm.on the judiciary,analysis of as passed by the united states house of representatives on august,at committee print,serial,house manager report app.at.
in,while the dpra was being crafted,no serious attention was paid to the specific possibility that radio broadcasters would simultaneously stream their programming over the internet.the central question then is somewhat broader whether,in exempting nonsubscription broadcast transmissions,congress intended the dpra to exempt nontraditional transmissions by broadcasters.the answer appears to be solidly in the negative.congress decided not to include free broadcast services in this legislation in part because broadcasters provide public interest activities to local communities to fulfill a condition of the broadcasters license.senate report,at app.at emphasis added house report,at app.at.referring to the benefits of free broadcasting,the same reports reiterate that the legislation should do nothing to change or jeopardize the mutually beneficial economic relationship between the recording and traditional broadcasting industries.id.emphasis added.the classic example of an exempt transmission under section d a is a transmission to the general public by a free broadcast station,such as a traditional radio or television station,and the committee intends that such transmissions be exempt regardless of whether they are in a digital or nondigital format,in whole or in part.senate report,at app.at emphasis added.
the appellants argue,however,that the unambiguous intent of congress to exempt webcasting is clear in the senate report,which stated that t he underlying rationale for creation of this limited digital audio recorded performance right is grounded in the way the market for prerecorded music has developed,and the potential impact on that market posed by subscription and interactive not by broadcasting and related transmissions.id.at app.at emphasis added.this,they argue,favors a broad interpretation of the scope of congress intended protection of the industry relationship.we believe that this single sentence,out of context,provides little support for the broadcasters position.an interpretation of this sentence more in harmony with the remainder of the dpra is that a related transmission refers to the other types of transmissions other than a broadcast transmission expressly exempted in d,such as retransmissions.
appellants argue that this narrow reading of broadcast transmission makes the word nonsubscription in the phrase nonsubscription broadcast transmission surplusage,since all broadcasts are currently nonsubscription broadcasts.see bailey united states,d holding that each term in a statute should have a particular,nonsuperfluous meaning.we disagree.all broadcasts are currently nonsubscription because they are analog.it is our understanding that analog radio technology is not capable of providing a subscription broadcast transmission.in comparison,and are concerned with digital transmissions.with digital transmission technology it is possible for transmitters to provide their transmission services on a subscription basis inasmuch as the legislative history indicates that congress was anticipating the technology of digital radio when it formulated d a,senate report,at app.at t he committee intends that transmissions be exempt regardless of whether they are in a digital or nondigital format,in whole or in part,we find it perfectly reasonable to conclude that congress was also anticipating that digital radio potentially could give rise to subscription radio services and chose expressly to distinguish such services from nonsubscription digital radio services.
appellants also make much of the fact that webcasting,as it was generally defined at the time of dmca,referred to public multiple genre channels of sound recordings on a nonsubscription basis.house manager report,at app.at.under the appellants theory,the performance right in must be construed as narrowly as possible and the exemption in d a as broadly as possible.the changes wrought by the dmca to reduce the d exemptions to the digital audio transmission performance right,under the appellants theory,must also be construed narrowly in order to preserve the intended,narrow scope of the copyright.therefore,in interpreting the dmca,according to the appellants,the scope of the dmca reductions in the d exemptions and the corresponding expansion of the scope of the digital audio transmission performance copyright must be narrowly defined to include only the precise type of webcasting contemplated by congress at that time.under this argument,because webcasting was not exactly what congress contemplated when it adopted the dmca,webcasting was not meant to be included in the performance right but it is clear to us that congress did not intend to tie the scope of the dmca to such a narrow definition.while an impetus for this legislation was the licensing difficulties and legal issues raised by webcasters in particular,it is congress intent that this legislation apply generally to otherwise nonexempt nonsubscription digital audio services on the internet and in other media.house manager report,at app.at.
additionally,we have already noted that the exemptions the dpra afforded to radio broadcasters were specifically intended to protect only traditional radio broadcasting,and did not contemplate protecting webcasting.the dmca silence on webcasting gives us no affirmative grounds to believe that congress intended to expand the protections contemplated by the dpra.the appellants must show something more than congressional silence to argue convincingly that congress intended to lump webcasting with broadcasting in d a exemption.
the legislative history shows that dpra d a iii created a nonsubscription broadcast transmission exemption for traditional broadcasting in order to preserve the symbiotic relationship between broadcasters and the recording industry.and the dmca amendments to d were not intended to affect the exemption for nonsubscription broadcast transmissions.conference report,at app.at.therefore,the purpose of congress was to limit the exemption for nonsubscription broadcast transmissions to traditional,broadcasts.
for the reasons stated above,our analysis of d a convinces us that the copyright office arguments are persuasive.section d a nonsubscription broadcast transmission exemption implicates only radio broadcast transmissions,and does not cover the internet streaming of broadcast signals.therefore,we affirm.
