opinion of the court 
we face an issue of first impression for this the discovery rule or the injury rule governs the accrual of claims under the copyright act,which has a statute of limitations for civil actions,b.
under the injury rule,a claim accrues,and the statute of limitations begins to run,when the plaintiff suffers a legally cognizable injury.therefore,if the injury rule applies in this case,william graham company graham can not recover on its claims that usi midatlantic,and thomas haughey collectively,usi infringed its copyrights more than three years before graham filed suit.conversely,if the discovery rule applies,then graham cause of action for each act of infringement did not accrue until graham discovered,or with reasonable diligence should have discovered,the injury underlying its claim.thus,if the discovery rule applies,graham may be able to recover on acts of infringement that occurred more than three years before it filed suit.
the district court concluded that the discovery rule applied to civil actions under the copyright act and the case proceeded to a jury trial.the jury found that graham was not on notice of usi infringement prior to february,to its conclusion that none of graham infringement claims was.that jury entered a verdict in graham favor in the amount of against usi midatlantic and against haughey.however,the district court set aside the jury finding and ultimately held that graham was from recovering for acts of infringement that occurred more than three years before it filed suit in light of certain storm warnings of those earlier acts of infringement.
the case then proceeded to a second jury trial on the issue of damages for the three year period preceding graham filing the second jury entered a verdict for graham in the amount of million against usi midatlantic and against haughey.thus,if we determine that the district court correctly held that the discovery rule governs the accrual of claims under the copyright act,we must then decide whether the court correctly applied that rule to the facts of this case.
finally,usi and renews its contention,rejected by the district court,that graham can not recover on any of its claims because it failed to prove a legally sufficient causal nexus between the infringement and usi profits awarded to graham as compensation for the infringement.
backgrounda.facts 
graham is an insurance brokerage firm that provides property and casualty insurance services to businesses.haughey worked for graham as a producer salesperson from january through september.producers serve as intermediaries between their clients and insurance companies.graham producers solicit clients by first preparing a risk assessment study,called a survey and analysis,that evaluates the client needs.in order to prepare the survey and analysis,a producer generally must spend a significant amount of time learning the client business,assessing its insurance needs,and reviewing its current policies.the producer then prepares a written proposal that contains recommendations addressing the client needs as identified in the survey and analysis.if the client agrees to graham proposal,it places the client with an insurance company that actually writes the insurance.graham receives a commission from the insurance company which issues the policy and in addition receives a service fee from its client.
in the,graham president,william graham,developed form language called the standard paragraphs to be used by graham producers to prepare survey and analysis documents and coverage proposals.the standard paragraphs were not copyrighted.
sometime in,graham began to prepare the standard survey and analysis and the standard proposal collectively,the standard works or the works.the standard works,which were each hundreds of pages long,included some language from the standard paragraphs as well as new material.after draft versions of the standard works were distributed to graham eight producers,including haughey,the first edition of the standard survey was completed around march or april and it was then copyrighted.the first edition of the standard proposal was completed in the fall of and it also was copyrighted.graham placed copyright notices on client documents that incorporated the standard works and registered certain portions of the works with the copyright office.
graham producers use the standard works as templates for proposals.the standard works include plain english explanations of insurance policies and concepts that graham producers can copy into materials and that clients can easily understand.the standard works also serve as reference materials to guide graham producers in the development of materials.graham president testified that the standard works are absolutely essential to graham business b ecause they are probably the most important way that we can establish creditability sic with a perspective sic client.app.at.
haughey employment with graham was terminated in september,apparently because haughey clients were primarily smaller,businesses and graham sought at that time to attract larger businesses as clients.haughey testified at trial that he left graham on amicable terms and he received a dollar severance package payable over three months.graham and haughey also entered into a termination agreement in which haughey reaffirmed his promise in his employment contract to keep company information confidential and to turn over all of graham papers and the information contained therein in haughey possession upon termination of his employment.app.at.nonetheless,following his termination haughey retained binders that contained at least part of the standard works.
shortly thereafter,haughey got a job at a smaller insurance brokerage firm,flanigan,gentry fog.at about the same time that haughey joined fog,haughey solicited certain of graham clients in violation of his termination agreement.graham executive vice president judith dooling sent haughey a letter memorializing a conversation in which haughey agreed to cease such solicitation pending negotiation of an agreement to sell fog and haughey certain accounts 
in november,graham,fog and haughey entered into an agreement in which graham sold fog six of haughey prior accounts.graham provided fog and haughey with materials related to those six accounts,including proposals made to those clients in the current and prior year which included graham copyrighted materials.haughey also specifically promised to hold all knowledge and information concerning the standard works in trust and in confidence for the sole benefit of graham,to return all papers and information obtained from graham other than information related to the accounts sold,app.at,and not to use,divulge,or otherwise disclose any of graham confidential information,app.at.
notwithstanding his promise,haughey subsequently infringed graham copyrighted material in the standard works by including it in proposals to fog clients.haughey first included graham copyrighted material in a proposal to a client in july it is unclear whether haughey copied this material from his own copy of the standard works or whether he used a copy of the version of the standard works which haughey had not obtained before the termination of his employment with graham brought to fog by another former graham employee,don boresen,in the spring of.in any event,at some time in or,fog copied the entire version of the standard works into its word processing system paper copies were also distributed to fog employees.
in,fog was acquired by usi holdings and subsequently merged with two other entities to form usi midatlantic.the standard works were made available to usi employees.
according to graham expert,haughey and usi copied graham copyrighted language from the standard works into at least proposals over thirteen years through.usi personnel testified that its written proposals to clients including,presumably,those with infringing language were an important part of the sales fact,haughey even testified that some clients were convinced to purchase insurance through usi on the basis of the that it was usi practice to review the proposal contents page by page with the client.app.at.moreover,fog had nothing comparable to the standard works when haughey first arrived and,as noted above,fog and usi made electronic and paper copies of the standard works available to their employees and encouraged them to use the standard works when developing materials.on the other hand,most of usi proposals during this period did not include infringing language,and even those that did include infringing language did so only on a few pages.
it was usi practice to keep proposals to clients confidential,and graham did not discover usi infringement until november,when a client showed one of graham producers a copy of a usi proposal to the client.
procedural history 
graham filed this action on february,asserting claims for copyright infringement against usi and haughey as well as a breach of contract claim against haughey.usi moved for partial summary judgment,contending that any infringement that occurred more than three years prior to filing of the complaint was under the copyright act statute of limitations for civil actions.the district court denied the motion,holding that the discovery rule applied to infringement claims under the copyright act and that therefore graham was entitled to present evidence to demonstrate that it could not have reasonably discovered usi infringement before it actually did so 
the case proceeded to a jury trial after graham voluntarily dismissed the breach of contract claim that it had asserted against haughey,the jury reached a verdict in favor of graham on the copyright claim in the amount of against usi and against haughey the district court presented the jury with several interrogatories,including,as relevant here,whether graham should have discovered that usi was infringing its copyrights prior to february.because the jury answered in the negative,graham claims were not under the discovery rule.
following the jury verdict,usi moved for a new trial on the statute of limitations issue,and the district court granted the motion.according to the court,the jury answer to the statute of limitations interrogatory was against the great weight of the evidence because the district court concluded that graham knew or should have known of certain storm warnings that haughey would infringe as early as the fall of william graham haughey,wl,at.specifically,the court concluded that graham should have known that haughey retained a copy of the standard works in violation of his employment and termination agreements with graham as well as the november agreement that sold fog certain of haughey client accounts that he was working as a producer for another insurance brokerage firm and that,given these facts,it was quite possible,if not likely,that haughey and fog would copy the standard works into client proposals,for that was the only reason for haughey and fog to retain them.id.at.thus,the district court concluded that graham had information upon haughey departure in the fall of that would cause a person,in the exercise of reasonable diligence,to inquire of haughey and fog about the possession,use and copying of the standard works.id.therefore,the district court ordered a new trial as to the application of the copyright act statute of limitations and the calculation of graham damages.
because the district court granted usi motion for a new trial on the statute of limitations issue,it did not reach usi motion for a new trial on the grounds that the jury apportionment of usi profits,whether the profits were attributable to infringement or some other cause was against the weight of the evidence that the verdict was excessive.
usi also moved for judgment as a matter of law on the ground that graham failed to prove a legally sufficient causal connection between any copyright infringement and usi profits.the district court denied that motion,holding that graham met its burden on this issue because graham sought to recover usi profits only as to usi clients who received infringing proposals,demonstrated that the written proposals were an important part of usi sales process,and demonstrated that usi pervasively used language from the standard works.
following subsequent for summary judgment on the statute of limitations issue,the district court held that as a matter of law graham could not recover on any acts of infringement that occurred prior to february.william graham haughey,d.the court concluded that sufficient storm warnings existed to put graham on notice of haughey and thus usi infringement in the fall of,shortly after haughey left graham.the court noted that graham was or should have been aware that haughey retained possession of a copy of the standard works when he left graham that the only value of the standard works to haughey was to copy them into client proposals that haughey went to work for a competing insurance broker and that haughey was not a person of his word because he engaged in improper competitive behavior by violating the clause of his employment and termination contracts.id.at.
the district court rejected graham argument that the circumstances this court has identified as storm warnings could not have put graham on notice of the defendants infringement because those storm warnings were related to haughey departure from graham in the fall of,before the first evidence of an infringing proposal prepared by haughey in july.id.at.the court conceded that it would be nonsensical for a statute of limitations to begin running before the actual injury had occurred,but concluded that we see no reason why the clock on graham claims should not have started to run at the time when haughey first began to infringe,since there is no sign that any of the storm warnings had abated by that point.id.
the case proceeded to a second jury trial on the issue of damages for acts of infringement occurring on or after february.the jury again returned a verdict for graham,this time in the amount of million against usi and against haughey.graham timely appealed on april,and usi timely on april,
discussiona.statute of limitations 
the copyright act provides that n o civil action shall be maintained under the provisions of this title unless it is commenced within three years after the claim accrued.b.because graham filed this action on february,the accrual of graham claims must be evaluated as of february.however,in continuing infringement cases such as this,e ach act of infringement is a distinct harm giving rise to an independent claim for relief.stone williams,cir citing mount club,cir.thus,as the district court correctly held,graham was not from recovering for any acts of infringement that occurred on or after february,regardless of whether the injury or discovery rule applies to determine the accrual of claims under the copyright act.that is not in dispute.instead,the parties differ on whether graham may also recover for any acts of infringement that occurred prior to february.
claim accrual rule 
the question of whether the discovery rule or the injury rule applies to determine when a civil cause of action accrues under the copyright act is a legal one.under the discovery rule,a cause of action accrues when the plaintiff discovers,or with due diligence should have discovered,the injury that forms the basis for the claim.disabled in action of pennsylvania se.pennsylvania transp,cir quoting romero allstate,cir.under the injury rule,a cause of action accrues at the time of the injury.in this case,if the injury rule were to apply,graham would be time barred from recovery on any acts of infringement that occurred prior to february.
although we have not previously addressed this issue,eight of our sister courts of appeals have applied the discovery rule to civil actions under the copyright act.see warren freedenfeld,mctigue,cir comcast,cir roger miller music,publ g,llc,cir polar bear,timex,cir gaiman mcfarlane,cir lyons,morris costumes,cir daboub gibbons,cir stone williams,cir.
usi contends that these precedents are not persuasive because the question of whether the injury or discovery rule applied was not squarely raised in most of them and,more importantly,they fail to address the supreme court decision in trw andrews,d.
the trw case did not arise under the copyright act but under the fair credit reporting act fcra.in reaching the statute of limitations issue,the ninth circuit held that,because congress had not expressly legislated otherwise,the discovery rule applied to claims under the fcra.id.at.quoting andrews trw,cir.the supreme court rejected that approach and held that the discovery rule did not apply to actions under the fcra because the text and structure of the fcra evince congress intent to preclude judicial implication of a discovery rule.id.at.specifically,the court reasoned that because the fcra provided that the statute of limitations runs from the date on which the liability arises,subject to a single statutory exception for cases involving a defendant willful misrepresentation of material information,the most natural reading of the fcra is that congress implicitly excluded a general discovery rule by explicitly including a more limited one.id.quoting.
this court had the occasion to interpret and apply trw when it was faced with the issue of the statute of limitations applicable to the americans with disabilities act and the rehabilitation act.disabled in action,at.because neither act included an express statute of limitations,we applied the state statute of limitations.id.at.in reaching the more difficult question of when the two year statute begins to run,we interpreted trw to require the following inquiry to determine the applicable accrual rule for federal causes of action.first,w here congress has specified an accrual date by explicit command or by implication from the structure and text of the statute,we defer to its directive.id.at quoting trw,at.second,i n the absence of a contrary directive from congress,we apply the federal discovery rule.id.quoting romero,at.
usi would have us set aside that analysis,applied by this court less than a year ago,in favor of a single district court decision in another circuit which used the injury rule to determine when claims accrue under the copyright act.see auscape int l geographic soc y,d.we decline to do so.even the court in auscape conceded that the text and structure of the copyright act lend no guidance as to congress intent with regard to when an infringement claim accrues.id.at.this concession answers in the negative the first question raised in disabled in action whether congress has specified an accrual date by explicit command or by implication from the structure and text of the statute.at quoting trw,at.
further,the text and structure of the copyright act actually favor use of the discovery rule.as noted by graham,criminal actions under the copyright act must be commenced within years after the cause of action arose.a emphasis added.just six years prior to the amendment to the copyright act that added the civil limitations period now codified at b,the supreme court interpreted language similar to a s criminal limitations period in the admiralty act cause of action arises to embody the injury rule.mcmahon united states.see also trw,at.noting that petitioner offer ed a strong argument that use of the word arise in a statute of limitations provision signals congressional intent to adopt the injury rule citing mcmahon.significantly,congress used different language in the civil limitations provision after the claim accrued,which the supreme court had previously interpreted as embodying the discovery rule.see urie thompson.construing cause of action accrued in federal employers liability act and holding that statute of limitations was not triggered until injured employee should have known of injury.given the maxim of statutory construction that when the legislature uses certain language in one part of the statute and different language in another,the court assumes different meanings were intended,sosa,d quotation omitted,graham persuasively argues that the criminal and civil limitations periods embody different claim accrual rules and that b should be interpreted to embody the discovery rule.
usi,once again pointing to auscape,interprets the legislative history of the copyright act statute of limitations provision as evidence of congressional intent to adopt the injury rule for civil claims brought pursuant to the copyright act.however,congress provided no directive mandating use of the injury rule in that legislative history.disabled in action,at.
for example,until the statute of limitations provision now codified at b was enacted in,the copyright act lacked a statute of limitations period for civil actions and courts borrowed state statutes of limitation for analogous claims.see,as reprinted in.usi notes several instances in the legislative history of b in which congresspersons and witnesses argued that b was necessary to provide a uniform or fixed limitations period.however,these statements reflected dissatisfaction with the use of state statutes of limitations,which ranged from one to eight years and therefore encouraged.see id.at see also of limitations hearing on before comm.on the judiciary,cong,hereafter hearing.none of these statements addressed the separate issue of when a claim would accrue under the new federal statute of limitations.
usi also relies on a statement in the senate report that due to the nature of publication of works of art generally the person injured receives reasonably prompt notice or can easily ascertain any infringement of his rights.the committee agrees that years is an appropriate period for a uniform statute of limitations for civil copyright actions and that it would provide an adequate opportunity for the injured party to commence his action,as reprinted in.again,this statement does not speak directly to the accrual of actions,but rather seeks to support the limitations period adopted by congress.moreover,the fact that congress believed that infringement was generally a public act does not necessarily imply that,in cases in which infringement was not public,congress intended to reject application of the discovery rule.indeed,the quoted passage speaks of whether the injured party has reasonably prompt notice of inquiry consistent with the discovery rule.
usi next points to what we view as an unenlightening exchange between representative shepard crumpacker and a lobbyist for the motion picture industry during a house committee hearing.representative crumpacker was concerned that a movie company could make a movie that infringed on a writer script,secretly show that movie in a small town,sit on the movie until the statute of limitations passed,and then release the movie generally while claiming that the writer was barred from enforcing his or her rights.hearing at.the lobbyist responded that each performance of the film would constitute a separate act of infringement.id.at.this exchange is not illustrative of congressional intent regarding when copyright claims accrue,but is cited by usi because the lobbyist also stated that if an act of infringement occurred three years ago,then it would be barred in three years.id.that single statement by a witness at a congressional hearing,which no congressperson commented on or agreed with,signifies nothing and is hardly a basis to conclude that congress intended to apply the injury rule.
usi also notes that congress considered including certain express provisions to permit tolling of the statute of limitations,including where the infringer was guilty of fraudulent concealment,and it argues that the consideration of these exceptions would have been unnecessary had congress intended to apply the discovery rule to claims under the copyright act.of course,had congress included those limited exceptions within b,the holding in trw might well have inclined us to reject the discovery rule here.but the important fact is that congress rejected inclusion of any statutory exceptions to the statute of limitations period,and did so because the federal district courts,generally,would recognize these equitable defenses anyway,at.
moreover,the legislative history makes clear that congress intended the copyright act statute of limitations to apply to the remedy of the person affected thereby,and not to his substantive rights,by which congress meant that e quitable considerations are available to prolong the time for bringing suit,id.at.further,congress feared that inclusion of specific statutory exceptions to the limitations period might result in unfairness to some persons,as reprinted in.thus,this case actually presents the opposite situation as trw congress considered,but rejected,inclusion of specific statutory exceptions to the copyright act statute of limitations in order to ensure that the courts could consider any equitable circumstances sufficient to excuse a plaintiff failure to sue within the limitations period 
finally,usi argues that use of the discovery rule would be inappropriate as a matter of policy.usi notes that in trw the supreme court stated that it has recognized a prevailing discovery rule in two contexts,latent disease and medical malpractice,where the cry for such a rule is loudest.trw,at.quoting rotella wood,d.usi would distinguish copyright infringement,arguing that there is nothing intrinsically hidden or latent about copyright infringement because it is by its nature a public act that is only very rarely hidden from the copyright owner.usi reply br.at.that may be true in some instances but not in all.technological advances such as personal computing and the internet have ma de it more difficult for rights holders to stridently police and protect their copyrights.john ramirez,note,discovering injury the confused state of the statute of limitations for federal copyright infringement,fordham intell.prop.media ent,concluding that discovery rule is appropriate for copyright actions.
in sum,congress provided no directive mandating use of the injury rule to govern the accrual of claims under the copyright act.we conclude that use of the discovery rule comports with the text,structure,legislative history and underlying policies of the copyright act.thus,consistent with disabled in action and in agreement with our sister courts of appeals,we hold that the federal discovery rule governs the accrual of civil claims brought under the copyright act.
application of the discovery rule 
the first jury proceeded to calculate damages having been instructed to use the discovery rule in light of the district court rejection of usi arguments in favor of the injury rule.nonetheless,despite the jury finding to the contrary,the district court overturned the jury determination and ruled that,under the discovery rule,graham cause of action for copyright infringement accrued in the fall of after haughey left graham to work at usi predecessor company.accordingly,the district court granted usi motion for a new trial.after for summary judgment,the court granted usi judgment as a matter of law as to graham infringement claims for acts of infringement that occurred before february.according to the district court,storm warnings or suspicious circumstances about possible infringement were compelling long before february,but graham ignored them.graham,at.therefore,graham could recover only for acts of infringement that occurred within the three year period prior to its filing of the instant action,acts occurring on or after february.
in reviewing the district court decision to grant a new trial,we apply an abuse of discretion standard.fineman armstrong world,cir.where,as here,a district court grants a motion for a new trial because it determines that the jury verdict was against the weight of the evidence,it is the duty of the appellate tribunal to exercise a closer degree of scrutiny and supervision than is the case where a new trial is granted because of some undesirable or pernicious influence obtruding into the trial in order to protect the jury role.id.at quoting lind schenley indus,cir en banc.as to the district court grant of summary judgment,our review is plenary.northview motors,chrysler motors,cir.
graham challenges both the district court ruling that usi was entitled to a new trial on the statute of limitations and its subsequent grant of summary judgment to usi on that issue.that is,graham argues that the evidence was sufficient to support the first jury finding that graham was not chargeable with knowledge of usi infringement prior to february.accordingly,graham contends that we should reinstate the first jury verdict in favor of graham in the amount of against usi and against haughey.
storm warnings 
we reiterate that,under the discovery rule,a cause of action accrues when the plaintiff discovers,or with due diligence should have discovered,the injury that forms the basis for the claim.disabled in action,at quoting romero,at.applying that precept here,we ask whether graham should have known of the basis for its claims,which depends on whether it had sufficient information of possible wrongdoing to place it on inquiry notice or to excite storm warnings of culpable activity.benak ex rel.alliance premier growth fund alliance capital mgmt,cir quoting in re nahc.sec,cir internal quotation marks omitted.usi and haughey bear the burden of demonstrating such storm warnings and,if they do so,the burden shifts to graham to show that it exercised reasonable due diligence and yet was unable to discover its injuries.id.quoting mathews kidder,peabody,cir.
graham first contends that the district court erred because the storm warnings relied upon by the district court predated the first act of infringement.as we have previously explained,b ecause a potential plaintiff can not discover his injury before it has occurred,the discovery rule only postpones the accrual date of a claim where the plaintiff is unaware of the injury.it does not accelerate the accrual date when the plaintiff becomes aware that he will suffer injury in the future.disabled in action,at quotations,alterations,and internal citation omitted.thus,the first step in applying the discovery rule is to establish when the injurious act defined by the statute actually occurred.id.next,we must determine whether that injury was immediately discoverable,or whether the accrual date will be postponed until it is reasonable to expect the plaintiff to discover the injury.id.
although the district court recognized that the statute of limitations could not have begun to run until the first act of infringement occurred in july,the court concluded that it saw no reason why the clock on graham claims should not have started to run at the time when haughey first began to infringe,since there is no sign that any of the storm warnings had abated by that point.graham is incorrect in its contention that storm warnings must warn of an actual injury that has already taken place a copyright owner has the duty to investigate indications that infringement is in the offing,even if,in the course of the investigation,it learns that infringement has not yet occurred.graham,d at citing benak,at mathews,at.
we do not agree that the discovery rule operates in the manner suggested by the district court.significantly,neither of our precedents relied upon by the district court for the proposition that a copyright owner has a duty to investigate infringement in the offing supports such a rule.in both cases,which dealt with a securities action and rico action,not copyright infringement,we held that the plaintiffs claims were untimely under the discovery rule because storm warnings of the alleged wrongs put the plaintiffs on inquiry notice before the relevant date.in fact,the storm warnings arose after the alleged wrongs.benak,at,mathews,at.thus,benak and mathews do not stand for the proposition that prospective plaintiffs have a duty to inquire into future wrongdoing.rather,they dealt with the time at which inquiry notice arose for past wrongs.
indeed,we have rejected the proposition that the discovery rule places a duty on prospective plaintiffs to inquire into possible future wrongful conduct.for example,in cgb occupational therapy,rha health servs,cir,we held that several claims for tortious interference of contract did not accrue until,at least,the plaintiff suffer ed injury as a result of the defendant conduct.we rejected the defendant argument that mere notice of termination of the plaintiff contracts triggered the claim because the plaintiff did not suffer a legally cognizable injury until the contracts were actually terminated.id.we stated sunrise the defendant attempts to take that unremarkable the statute of limitations should be postponed where the victim is unaware of the reverse it,so as to mandate that the statute of limitations accelerates when the victim becomes aware that he will suffer injury in the future.that is logically fallacious.id.further,we analogized cgb to a case in which one person tells another that,in three months,he intends to trespass.the tort of trespass has not occurred until the victim property is entered by the tortfeasor.that the victim was informed in advance of the inevitable does not alter the accrual of his damages action for trespass.id.at.usi argument is no different than the one we rejected in cgb.
the district court also saw storm warnings in haughey departure from graham,even though that departure was ten months before haughey began to infringe.that departure in itself can not be considered a storm warning because a copyright owner does not have a duty to ferret out potential acts of infringement before they occur.maclean,cir rejecting argument that a copyright infringement claim was barred by laches because the district court laches rationale would have put plaintiff under a never ending obligation to discover whether anyone to whom he ever supplied his software would copy it,an obligation that the copyright act does not recognize.the district court feared that,if a copyright owner did not have a duty to investigate infringement in the offing,then haughey could have told graham on day one that he was anticipating infringing on day two,and because he was not infringing on day one,the statute of limitations would have been tolled for years without the need for any further action on the part of graham.graham,d at.that hypothetical is simply not our case.
we have previously recognized that the aggregate mix of information may constitute a storm warning.mathews,at.before determining whether this is such a case,we must first address each of the district court purported storm warnings separately.high on the district court list of reasons for its conclusion that there were ample storm warnings was its focus on haughey retention of a copy of the standard works when he left graham in september.however,as the district court recognized,possession of a copy of a work alone does not constitute copyright infringement or a storm warning thereof.graham,d at see also enumerating exclusive rights of copyright owner.nonetheless,the district court concluded that a storm warning existed here because graham was on notice that the only real use haughey would have for the works was to copy them in violation of graham copyright.d at.that was a jury argument and the record before the first jury did not compel that inference.
although the jury heard evidence that the works were valuable because they could be easily copied to provide consistent and accurate explanations of coverage,the jury also heard evidence that producers at both graham and usi used the works as reference materials without directly copying any text because they included instructions and checklists for producers to use when creating proposals for clients.
the mere fact that a copyright owner has notice that another person also possessed its copyrighted material and may find it useful to copy should not and does not by itself constitute a storm warning of possible infringement.warren freedenfeld,at there is no presumption that failed business relationships inevitably will give rise either to tortious conduct or disregard of proprietary rights.that a relationship between an architect and a client has become frayed and the client has decided to forge ahead with the project by engaging some other architect does not,in and of itself,serve as a harbinger of an intention to violate the original architect copyright protection.
the district court in its summary judgment decision also concluded that graham had a storm warning of haughey infringement based upon haughey improper solicitation of graham clients,in violation of his employment and termination agreements.however,improper solicitation of business,if it in fact occurred,is a far cry from copyright infringement.in in re merck,derivative erisa,cir,we dealt with application of the discovery rule to allegations of securities fraud.we held that simply stating that a smattering of evidence hinted at the possibility of some type of fraud does not answer the question whether there was sufficient information of possible wrongdoing to excite storm warnings of culpable activity under the securities laws.id.at quoting benak,at emphasis omitted alteration in original.thus,we concluded that the fda public allegations of misrepresentations by merck in its consumer advertisements were not a storm warning of the securities fraud alleged.id.at.
similarly,even if graham knew that haughey had improperly solicited certain of graham clients,that wrongdoing did not put graham on notice of haughey copyright infringement.the district court stated that this conduct was a storm warning of infringement because a person who had breached an agreement with graham in this regard is likely to infringe the copyright on its works.graham,d at.however,inquiry notice demands more than evidence that a person is a bad actor in some general sense before a court can conclude that a storm warning exists as to a specific cause of action.
moreover,after graham discovered haughey alleged improper solicitation of clients in october,it got haughey to agree to stop and,significantly,in november,just a month later,sold haughey and fog six of haughey old client accounts.thus,by the time of the first act of infringement in july,haughey alleged solicitation of clients was an old problem that the parties had resolved,not a storm warning of haughey infringement.
indeed,graham course of conduct at the time of haughey separation from graham demonstrates that graham diligently sought to protect its rights in the standard works.in his employment and termination agreements,as well as in the november agreement selling certain client accounts to fog,haughey repeatedly agreed to respect graham rights to its intellectual property,including specifically the standard works.the district court downplayed the significance of graham copyright notices,stating graham obviously did not deem the copyrights on the works in and of themselves to be a sufficient deterrent to infringement.otherwise,it would not have needed to negotiate a reaffirmation of haughey obligation to turn over the binders containing the works upon his departure graham,d at.that is,the district court seemed to suggest that the fact that graham sought to buttress its statutory rights under the copyright act with contractual obligations implied that graham was on notice of haughey infringement.the jury was entitled to make the opposite inference,that graham was diligently protecting its rights.
the evidence before the jury was sufficient to support its conclusion that graham was not on notice of haughey and usi infringement prior to february.there is no evidence to suggest that graham had actual knowledge of any infringement until.even if graham was or should have been aware that haughey possessed a copy of the standard works when he left graham,the jury heard testimony that haughey was aware that the standard works were confidential information and that graham had copyrighted them.the jury also heard evidence that haughey promised in the november agreement to hold graham proprietary information,including specifically the standard works,in trust and confidence,app.at,and agreed not to use,divulge,or otherwise disclose such information,id.finally,the jury knew that after haughey and usi infringed the copyrighted material in the standard works in a number of client proposals,these proposals were kept confidential by usi.
to summarize,usi was not entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the statute of limitations issue and therefore the district court erred in granting usi summary judgment because the evidence before t
