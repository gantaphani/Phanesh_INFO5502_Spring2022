plaintiffs and appellants,and were pupils in the central school district.they were victims of molestation by eric norman olsen,a substitute teacher.they each filed suit,alleging causes of action for negligence,negligence per se,and negligent infliction of emotional distress.in addition to naming olsen and central school district where the plaintiffs attended school and which had hired olsen as a substitute teacher,plaintiffs also named as defendants the chino valley unified school district defendant and respondent san bernardino city unified school district sbcusd,the school district,the san bernardino county department of children services,and the san bernardino county superintendent of schools,on the theory that these entities had failed in a mandatory statutory duty to report suspected child abuse when olsen had worked as a substitute teacher in other districts.defendant and respondent sbcusd demurred to each complaint on the ground that the child abuse and neglect reporting act the reporting act did not impose a duty on them toward these plaintiffs.the trial court sustained the demurrers without leave to amend as to all three causes of action against sbcusd.plaintiffs appeal as to the negligence and negligence per se causes of action they do not contest the ruling as to the cause of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress.we affirm the judgment of the trial court.
factual and procedural history 
because the matter arises on demurrer,we draw our factual statement from the pleadings,accepting as true the properly pleaded material facts alleged.the complaints in each of the four cases are substantially the same,and involve the same issues.action will serve as an adequate exemplar of the facts,contentions,issues and procedural history applicable to each of the four plaintiffs.
in december,was a student at a school within the central school district in rancho cucamonga.olsen was a substitute teacher in class,and olsen engaged in incidents of unlawful touching of,including having sit on his lap,for the purpose of olsen sexual arousal or gratification 
the complaints alleged that,in,olsen was a substitute teacher in a school in the chino valley unified school district,when he had unlawful contact with a girl.the chino valley unified school district permanently banned olsen from teaching in that district.the chino valley unified school district reported olsen to the san bernardino county superintendent of schools.
in april,olsen had unlawful contact with a student in the sbcusd.the alleged conduct included allowing children to sit on his lap.the sbcusd permanently banned olsen from teaching in that district.
the complaints alleged that o n or about or olsen engaged in inappropriate and improper conduct in the ontario montclair school district,but provided no further details.
the first cause of action,for negligence,alleged that olsen negligently,carelessly,recklessly and inappropriately fondled the plaintiffs,and that the central school district,where the plaintiffs were pupils,failed to properly investigate olsen background,and negligently hired and supervised him.
as to the other school districts and agencies,the negligence cause of action alleged that the reporting act requires certain persons mandated reporters to make a report whenever the person has knowledge of,observes,or reasonably suspects a child has been a victim of abuse or neglect.the other school districts and agencies,including sbcusd,allegedly failed to report olsen to the proper authorities under the reporting act.this failure allowed olsen to continue working as a substitute teacher in other districts,which caused plaintiffs harm.
the second cause of action,for negligence per se,was alleged against the central school district,as well as the prior school districts and agencies,including sbcusd,for alleged violation of the statutory duty of reporting under the reporting act.as to sbcusd in particular,the pleadings alleged that e mployees of the sbcusd who were mandated reporters negligently failed to comply with their statutory duties to report olsen conduct which occurred in the sbcusc on or about april which they knew or suspected to be inappropriate to the specified authorities as required by penal code et the pleadings further alleged that defendants,including sbcusd,had negligently failed to train,educate and instruct its personnel of the reporting requirements of the reporting act.as a result of these failures to report,other school districts and authorities were not alerted of olsen inappropriate conduct and propensities,which in turn allowed olsen to continue substitute teaching and thus to continue perpetrating unlawful acts on children,including plaintiffs 
sbcusd demurred to the complaints.sbcusd argued that the complaints failed to state facts sufficient to state a cause for liability against it,that sbcusd had governmental immunity against the action,and that the alleged source of the statutory violation to support the negligence per se cause of action,the reporting act,did not include plaintiffs in the class of persons protected by the statute.randi muroc joint unified school dist.cal th,d,randi.
plaintiffs opposed the demurrers,arguing that they had pled sufficient facts to state a proper cause of action,that governmental immunity did not apply,and that amendments to the reporting act,et had abrogated the holding in randi 
sbcusd responded that the amendments to the reporting act contained no indication of an intent to abrogate randi,which therefore remained a controlling precedent.
the trial court requested further briefing on the amendments and their alleged effect on randi,including perhaps a comparison to see what the language was in and how it was changed.after further briefing,the court ruled that the amendments had not intended to abrogate randi holding that future victims were not within the class of persons intended to be protected by the statute.the court therefore sustained the demurrers without leave to amend as to both the negligence and the negligence per se causes of action,on the theory that sbcusd did not owe a duty of care to these plaintiffs.a judgment of dismissal was entered in due course and plaintiffs have appealed.
discussion 
standard of review 
a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the complaint,and the granting of leave to amend involves the trial court discretion.therefore,an appellate court employs two separate standards of review on appeal.citations.the complaint is reviewed de novo to determine whether it contains sufficient facts to state a cause of action.citation.where a demurrer is sustained without leave to amend,the reviewing court must determine whether the trial court abused its discretion in doing so.citation.it is an abuse of discretion to deny leave to amend if there is a reasonable possibility that the pleading can be cured by amendment.citation.roman county of los angeles th,d.
while we accept all properly pleaded allegations of material fact,a demurrer does not admit deductions,contentions,or conclusions of law or fact.zelig county of los angeles cal th,d.
the crux of this case is the proper interpretation of section et,and most particularly the amendments to the reporting act,together with the california supreme court ruling in randi,supra,cal th,d.questions of statutory construction,and consideration of the legislative history of the amendments,raise issues of law which we review de novo.barner leeds cal th,d.
b.the trial court properly sustained the demurrers without leave to amend 
plaintiffs were not students of sbcusd at the time the alleged molestations took place.at the time of the incidents,sbcusd had not hired and was not supervising olsen in his capacity as a substitute teacher.
in randi,supra,a minor plaintiff,like the plaintiffs here,sued her own school district and other school districts after she was molested by a vice principal.the other school districts had formerly employed the vice principal,and had written letters recommending the vice principal for employment,without disclosing his history of sexual wrongdoing.the plaintiff alleged six causes of action negligence,negligent hiring,negligent misrepresentation,fraud,negligence per se for violating the reporting act et,and sex discrimination.randi,supra,cal th at,d.
the prior employer school districts demurred to the complaint,and the trial court sustained the demurrers as to all causes of action on the ground that there was no duty running from the prior employer school districts to the plaintiff.randi,supra,cal th at,d.the court of appeal affirmed as to the negligence,negligent hiring and sex discrimination counts,but reversed as to negligent misrepresentation,fraud,and negligence per se.ibid.
the plaintiff did not seek review as to the affirmed counts negligence,negligent hiring,sex discrimination,but the prior employer school districts did seek review of the reversed counts negligent misrepresentation,fraud,and negligence per se.
the court of appeal had held,with respect to the negligent misrepresentation and fraud counts,that the prior employer school districts had made misleading representations as to the vice principal qualifications by intentionally suppressing information about his prior sexual contact with students.the court of appeal had also held that the complaint stated a cause of action for negligence per se,because the prior employer school districts had allegedly failed in their statutory duty to report the vice principal under the reporting act et.randi,supra,cal th at,d.
the california supreme court granted review,and analyzed the reversed counts.as to the negligent misrepresentation and fraud counts,the court undertook an extensive analysis of duty under the factors set forth in rowland christian cal d.although there was no special relationship between the prior employer school districts and the plaintiff,who was not a student in any of those districts,she was a third party who alleged that she was put in peril by the hiring school district reliance on the prior employer school districts representations.
the injury to the plaintiff in randi was a foreseeable consequence of the misrepresentations unqualified recommendation of the vice principal,while saying nothing about his sexual misconduct,which induced the plaintiff home district to hire the vice principal,thus placing him in a position to injure the plaintiff.the court further considered whether moral blame attached to the prior employer school districts unreserved recommendations,coupled with the failure to disclose facts necessary to avoid or minimize risk of further child molestations or abuse.although insurance might be available for negligent misrepresentations,it would not be available for fraud or intentional misconduct,and the prior employer school districts had alternative courses of action available to them they could have made complete disclosures,or they could have issued a no comment letter.considerations of public policy weighed both for public policy of protecting children from molestation or abuse and against imposing liability for recommendation letters would inhibit employers from giving any recommendations at all imposing liability,but at a minimum,the writer of a letter of recommendation owes a duty not to misrepresent the facts in describing the qualifications and character of a former employee,if the misrepresentations present a substantial,foreseeable risk of physical harm.
the california supreme court concluded,therefore,that the plaintiff in randi had sufficiently pleaded a duty owed to her by the former employer school districts,as well as actual misrepresentation or fraud as opposed to mere nondisclosure,and reliance by the hiring school district,resulting in the plaintiff damage.the causes of action for fraud and negligent misrepresentation therefore withstood the demurrers.
the cause of action for negligence per se was premised on the breach of the statutory duty under the reporting act.the california supreme court decided that it need not decide whether the complaint allegations are sufficient to allege defendants knew or suspected reportable child abuse,because it is clear plaintiff was not a member of the class for whose protection the reporting act was enacted.defendant school districts were never the custodians of plaintiff,a livingston student and,accordingly,owed her no obligations under the act.randi,supra,cal th at,d.the court reasoned that,t he duty to report under the reporting act citation applies to a child care custodian which would include a school district who has knowledge of or observes a child,in his or her professional capacity or within the scope of his or her employment,whom he or she knows or reasonably suspects has been the victim of child abuse which includes sexual abuse.reasonably construed,the reporting a ct was intended to protect only those children in the custodial care of the person charged with reporting the abuse,and not all children who may at some future time be abused by the same offender.plaintiff fails to allege that she was ever in defendants custodial care,or even that defendants were aware that the vice principal had molested her.to adopt plaintiff contrary argument would impose a broader reporting obligation than the legislature intended.under plaintiff interpretation of the reporting act,a child care custodian that fails to report suspected child abuse affecting one child in its care or custody could be held liable,perhaps years later,to any other children abused by the same person,whether or not those children were within its custodial protection.neither legislative intent nor public policy would support such a broad extension of liability.ibid.
c.the reporting act and amendments 
the reporting act was amended in,to alter some of the language referring to child care custodian as a class of persons required to report suspected child abuse.plaintiff seizes upon the amendment of this language and,adverting to the similar language in the analysis of the california supreme court in randi,discerns an intent in the amendment to alter the result in randi 
the reporting act,as it existed when randi was decided,contained several sections defining classes of persons required to report suspected child abuse.former section defined a child care custodian to include teachers,instructional aides,and other school personnel,youth recreation center personnel,daycare workers,and other persons who had regular contact with children in such settings.former section defined health practitioners as another category of persons required to report suspected abuse.former section covered child protective agenc ies,former section covered film and photograph processors,former section covered licensing agencies,former section covered child visitation monitor s,former section covered firefighters,animal control officers and humane society officers,and former section covered clergy members,all as varying categories of persons who may have been subject to a reporting duty under the reporting act.
former section contained the reporting duty itself a except as provided in subdivision b,any child care custodian,health practitioner,employee of a child protective agency,child visitation monitor,firefighter,animal control officer,or humane society officer who has knowledge of or observes a child,in his or her professional capacity or within the scope of his or her employment,whom he or she knows or reasonably suspects has been the victim of child abuse,shall report the known or suspected instance of child abuse to a child protective agency immediately or as soon as practically possible by telephone and shall prepare and send a written report thereof within hours of receiving the information concerning the incident 
the amendment was enacted by assembly bill stats,ch.the legislative counsel digest for the bill which plaintiff attached to her supplemental memorandum of points and authorities below indicated that the legislature intended to reorganize and recast the list of specified persons who are required to report and designate those persons as mandated reporters 
as indicated,the amendment deleted the separate sections for child care custodians,health practitioners,and the other categories of persons required to report suspected abuse.instead,section was a
