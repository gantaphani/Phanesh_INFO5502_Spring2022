pivot point international,pivot point,brought this cause of action against charlene products,and its president peter yau collectively charlene,for copyright infringement pursuant to b.the district court granted summary judgment for the defendants on the ground that the copied subject matter,a mannequin head,was not copyrightable under the copyright act of act,et.for the reasons set forth in the following opinion,we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand the case for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
backgrounda.facts 
pivot point develops and markets educational techniques and tools for the hair design industry.it was founded in by leo passage,an internationally renowned hair designer.one aspect of pivot point business is the design and development of mannequin heads,facial forms that slip over a mannequin head and component hair pieces.
in the,passage desired to develop a mannequin that would imitate the hungry look of,runway models.passage believed that such a mannequin could be marketed as a premium item to and to stylists involved in hair design competitions.passage then worked with a german artist named horst heerlein to create an original sculpture of a female human head.although passage discussed his vision with heerlein,passage did not give heerlein any specific dimensional requirements.from passage description,heerlein created a sculpture in plaster entitled mara.
wax molds of mara were made and sent to pivot point manufacturer in hong kong.the manufacturer created exact reproductions of mara in polyvinyl chloride pvc.the manufacturer filled the pvc form with a liquid that expands and hardens into foam.the process of creating the mara sculpture and of developing the mannequin based on the sculpture took approximately eighteen months.
in february of,when pivot point first inspected the pvc forms of mara,it discovered that the mannequin hairline had been etched too high on the forehead.the manufacturer corrected the mistake by adding a second,lower hairline.although the first,higher hairline was visible upon inspection,it was covered with implanted hair.the early pvc reproductions of mara,and pivot point first shipment of the mannequins in may of,possessed the double hairlines.
about the same time that it received its first shipment of mannequins,pivot point obtained a copyright registration for the design of mara,specifically the bareheaded female human head with no makeup or hair.heerlein assigned all of his rights in the mara sculpture to pivot point.pivot point displayed the copyright notice in the name of pivot point on each mannequin.
pivot point enjoyed great success with its new mannequin.to respond to customer demand,pivot point began marketing the mara mannequin with different types and lengths of hair,different skin tones and variations in makeup however,no alterations were made to the facial features of the mannequin.for customer ease in identification,pivot point changed the name of the mannequin based on its hair and skin color for instance,a mara mannequin implanted with yak hair was called sonja,and the mara mannequin implanted with blonde hair was called karin.
at a trade show in,charlene,a wholesaler of beauty products founded by yau displayed its own liza mannequin,which was very close in appearance to pivot point mara.in addition to the strikingly similar facial features,liza also exhibited a double hairline that the early mara mannequins possessed.
on september,pivot point noticed charlene for copyright infringement.when charlene refused to stop importing and selling the liza mannequin,pivot point filed this action 
district court proceedings 
pivot point filed a complaint in district court against charlene.it alleged violations of federal copyright law as well as claims charlene both answered the complaint and counterclaimed.after extensive discovery,pivot point filed a comprehensive motion for summary judgment on its complaint and charlene counterclaims.charlene filed several for summary judgment as well.the district court tentatively ruled on these motions in july and issued a final ruling in october.
in its opinion,the district court stated that t he principal dispute is whether a human mannequin head is copyrightable subject matter.if it is,then there must be a trial on the question whether liza is a knock off of mara.at.the district court explained that,although sculptural works are copyrightable under a,sculptures that may be copyrighted are limited by the language of,which provides in relevant part 
such works shall include works of artistic craftsmanship insofar as their form but not their mechanical or utilitarian aspects are concerned the design of a useful article,as defined in this section,shall be considered a pictorial,graphic or sculptural work only if,and only to the extent that,such design incorporates pictorial,graphic,or sculptural features that can be identified separately from,and are capable of existing independently of,the utilitarian aspects of the article.
according to the district court,there was no question that mara was a sculpture.however,in the district court view,the sculpture served utilitarian ends.students in beauty schools practice styling hair on mara head and may practice other skills by applying makeup to mara eyes,lips,and cheeks.the parties dispute which functions are primary.at.
the district court then explored whether the artistic and utilitarian aspects of mara were separable for purposes of the piece copyrightability the statutory separability requirement confines copyright protection to those aspects of the design that exist apart from its utilitarian value,and that could be removed without reducing the usefulness of the item.id.at.the district court observed that drawing this line is particularly troublesome.
the statute,continued the district court,is generally recognized to suggest two types of separability physical separability and conceptual separability.the district court explained that physical separability occurs when the ornamental nature of the object can be physically removed from the object and that 
c onceptual separability differs from physical separability by asking not whether the features to be copyrighted could be sliced off for separate display,but whether one can conceive of this process.relying on a comment in the house report on the amendments,the second circuit in accessories by pearl,cir,purported to adopt conceptual separability as the exclusive test at,contrasting that approach with esquire ringer,which opted for physical separability,at.why a court should repair to the legislative history is unclear the second circuit did not identify any ambiguity in that needed to be resolved,and a statement in the house report that what appears on the face of the statutory text to be two requirements physical and conceptual separability should be administered as just one is not a proposition that in today legal climate can be indulged.the supreme court does not permit the use of legislative history to alter,as opposed to elucidate,a statutory text.
despite this lack of statutory moorings,the district court nevertheless reviewed the differing formulations for conceptual separability and determined that the definition proposed by professor paul goldstein was the best one a pictorial,graphic or sculptural feature incorporated in the design of a useful article is conceptually separable if it can stand on its own as work of art traditionally conceived,and if the useful article in which it is embodied would be equally useful without it.at quoting paul goldstein,copyright principles,law practice,at.the district court believed that the strength of this definition comes from the fact that it differs little,if at all,from the test of physical separability embraced by the circuit in esquire and by the majority in carol barnhart,economy cover,cir.id.applying this test led the district court to conclude that 
mara can not be copyrighted because,even though one can conceive of mara as a sculpture displayed as art,it would not be equally useful if the features that pivot point want to copyright were removed.so long as a utilitarian function is makeup tutoring and practice and the fact that pivot points sells mara without eye or lip coloring shows that this is a function even if not,in pivot point view,the primary utilitarian value would be diminished by removing the aesthetic features that pivot point wants to protect by copyright.
as a final matter,the district court distinguished two cases,hart dan chase taxidermy supply,cir,and superior form builders,dan chase taxidermy supply,cir,which upheld the copyrightability of animal and fish mannequins.the district court found the hart case unpersuasive,but concluded that one can not say of mara what the fourth circuit said of animal mannequins mara is valued not for its own appearance but for what it enables students to do and learn.mara is a useful article as and superior form builders deploy that term.id.at.
fee petition 
although fees are available under the act,the district court order made no provision for fees.charlene,therefore,sought an award of attorneys fees of approximately pursuant to.charlene submitted its fees to pivot point and sought to confer and exchange information as required by northern district of illinois local rule d.pivot point would not participate in this exercise on the basis that any fee request would be untimely because charlene had missed the deadline for filing a fee motion set forth in federal rule of civil procedure d b.
charlene then moved for an instruction from the district court ordering pivot point to participate in the fee request process but the district court refused.it explained that its opinion and declaratory judgment resolving this case on the merits did not make any provision for attorneys fees.at.because the judgment did not contain an order with respect to an attorneys fee petition,the district court did not believe local rule was applicable.instead,the parties were bound by the deadline set forth in federal rule d b.furthermore,the district court believed that its reading of local rule not extending the time period allowed in federal rule the local rule because otherwise it would be inconsistent with federal rule and therefore invalid pursuant to federal rule 
finally,the district court acknowledged that it had the discretion to extend the time to file such a motion however,it stated that it was not even slightly disposed to grant any extension,because the parties knew well before october what the judgment was likely to provide.id.at.
pivot point now appeals from the district court summary judgment in favor of charlene charlene appeals from the district court judgment with respect to its attorneys fee petition.
analysisa.standard of review 
this court reviews de novo a district court grant of summary judgment.see silk city of chicago,cir.in evaluating the judgment,we construe all facts in the light most favorable to the party and draw all reasonable and justifiable inferences in favor of that party.bellaver quanex,cir.if the record shows that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law,summary judgment is appropriate.c see celotex catrett,d.
copyrightability 
the central issue in this case is whether the mara mannequin is subject to copyright protection.this issue presents,at bottom,a question of statutory interpretation.we therefore begin our analysis with the language of the statute.two provisions contained in are at the center of our inquiry.the first of these is the description of pictorial,graphic and sculptural works 
pictorial,graphic,and sculptural works include and works of fine,graphic,and applied art,photographs,prints and art reproductions,maps,globes,charts,diagrams,models,and technical drawings,including architectural plans.such works shall include works of artistic craftsmanship insofar as their form but not their mechanical or utilitarian aspects are concerned the design of a useful article,as defined in this section,shall be considered a pictorial,graphic,or sculptural work only if,and only to the extent that,such design incorporates pictorial,graphic,or sculptural features that can be identified separately from,and are capable of existing independently of,the utilitarian aspects of the article.
the definition section further provides that a useful article is an article having an intrinsic utilitarian function that is not merely to portray the appearance of the article or to convey information.an article that is normally a part of a useful article is considered a useful article.as is clear from the definition of pictorial,graphic and sculptural work,only useful article s,as the term is further defined,are subject to the limitation contained in the emphasized language above.if an article is not useful as the term is defined in,then it is a pictorial,graphic and sculptural work entitled to copyright protection assuming the other requirements of the statute are met.
usefulness 
pivot point submits that the mara mannequin is not a useful article for purposes of because its inherent nature is to portray the appearance of runway models.its value,continues pivot point,resides in how well it portrays the appearance of runway models,just as the value of a cleopatra,for example,would be in how well it approximates what one imagines the subject looked like.appellant br.at.pivot point relies upon the decisions of the fourth circuit in superior form builders and of the second circuit in hart for the proposition that mannequins,albeit in those cases animal and fish mannequins,are not useful articles.specifically,the fourth circuit explained that 
a mannequin provides the creative form and expression of the ultimate animal display even though covered with a skin,the mannequin is not invisible but conspicuous in the final display.the angle of the animal head,the juxtaposition of its body parts,and the shape of the body parts in the final display is little more than the portrayal of the underlying mannequin.indeed,the mannequin can even portray the intensity of flexed body parts,or it can reveal the grace of relaxed ones.none of these expressive aspects of a mannequin is lost by covering the mannequin with a skin.thus,any utilitarian aspect of the mannequin exists merely to portray the appearance of the animal.
superior form builders,at see also hart,at the function of the fish form is to portray its own appearance,and that fact is enough to bring it within the scope of the copyright act.consequently,in pivot point view,because the mara mannequin performs functions similar to those of animal and fish mannequins,it is not a useful article and is therefore entitled to full copyright protection.
charlene presents us with a different view.it suggests that,unlike the animal mannequins at issue in superior form builders and in hart,the mara mannequin does have a useful function other than portraying an image of a runway model.according to charlene,mara also is marketed and used for practicing the art of makeup application.charlene points to various places in the record that establish that mara is used for this purpose and is,therefore,a useful article subject to the limiting language of.
pivot point strongly disputes that the record establishes such a use and argues that the district court reliance on charlene alleged proof improperly resolves an issue of fact against the party in contravention of federal rule of civil procedure indeed,our own review of the record leads us to believe that many of the documents cited by charlene are susceptible to more than one interpretation.
nevertheless,we shall assume that the district court correctly ruled that mara is a useful article and proceed to examine whether,despite that usefulness,it is amenable to copyright protection.
separability 
we return to the statutory language.a useful article falls within the definition of pictorial,graphic or sculptural works only if,and only to the extent that,such design incorporates pictorial,graphic,or sculptural features that can be identified separately from,and are capable of existing independently of,the utilitarian aspects of the article.it is common ground between the parties and,indeed,among the courts that have examined the issue,that this language,added by the act,was intended to distinguish creative works that enjoy protection from elements of industrial design that do not.see,at,reprinted in,stating that the purpose behind this language was to draw as clear a line as possible between copyrightable works of applied art and uncopyrighted works of industrial design.although the congressional goal was evident,application of this language has presented the courts with significant difficulty.indeed,one scholar has noted of the many fine lines that run through the copyright act,none is more troublesome than the line between protectible pictorial,graphic and sculptural works and unprotectible utilitarian elements of industrial design.paul goldstein,copyright,at ed.
the difficulty in the application of this language would not have come,in all likelihood,as a surprise to the congressional drafters.the language employed by congress is not the language of a rule of universal application.indeed,the circuits that have addressed the interpretative problem now before us uniformly have recognized that the wording of the statute does not supply categorical direction,but rather requires the copyright office and the courts to continue their efforts to distinguish applied art and industrial design.robert denicola,applied art industrial design a suggested approach to copyright in useful articles.in short,no doubt of the myriad of factual scenarios to which its policy guidance would have to be applied,congress wisely chose to provide only general policy guidance to be implemented on a basis through the copyright office and the courts.
even though the words of the statute do not yield a definitive answer,we believe that the statutory language nevertheless provides significant guidance in our task.we therefore shall examine in more detail what that language has to tell us,and we return to the necessary starting point of our task.
the statutory language provides that the design of a useful article shall be considered a pictorial,graphic,or sculptural work only if,and only to the extent that,such design incorporates pictorial,graphic,or sculptural features that can be identified separately from and are capable of existing independently of,the utilitarian aspects of the article.although the italicized clause contains two operative phrases can be identified separately from and are capable of existing independently of we believe,as have the other courts that have grappled with this issue that congress,in amending the statute,intended these two phrases to state a single,integrated standard to determine when there is sufficient separateness between the utilitarian and artistic aspects of a work to justify copyright protection.
certainly,one approach to determine whether material can be identified separately,and the most obvious,is to rely on the capacity of the artistic material to be severed physically from the industrial design.see mazer stein.holding that a statuette incorporated into the base of a lamp is copyrightable.when a article is the focus of the inquiry,reliance on physical separability can no doubt be a helpful tool in ascertaining whether the artistic material in question can be separated from the industrial design.as professor denicola points out,however,such an approach really is not of much use when the item in question is.see denicola,supra,at.indeed,because this provision,by its very words,was intended to apply to material,it is clear that a physical separability test can not be the exclusive test for determining copyrightability.
it seems to be common ground between the parties and,indeed,among the courts and commentators,that the protection of the copyright statute also can be secured when a conceptual separability exists between the material sought to be copyrighted and the utilitarian design in which that material is incorporated the difficulty lies not in the acceptance of that proposition,which the statutory language clearly contemplates,but in its application.as noted by pivot point,the following tests have been suggested for determining when the artistic and utilitarian aspects of useful articles are conceptually separable the artistic features are primary and the utilitarian features subsidiary,at the useful article would still be marketable to some significant segment of the community simply because of its aesthetic qualities,melville nimmer david nimmer,nimmer on copyright b,at the article stimulate s in the mind of the beholder a concept that is separate from the concept evoked by its utilitarian function,carol barnhart,at newman,dissenting the artistic design was not significantly influenced by functional considerations,see brandir int l,at adopting the test forwarded in denicola,supra,at the artistic features can stand alone as a work of art traditionally conceived,and the useful article in which it is embodied would be equally useful without it,goldstein,copyright,at and the artistic features are not utilitarian,see william patry,copyright law practice.
pivot point submits that the test for conceptual separability should reflect the focus of copyright artistic,not the marketability,design process,or usefulness.appellant br.at.according to pivot point,the central inquiry is whether the article is a work of art.id.pivot point further explains 
conceptual separability would inhere in a work of art integrated into a useful article,or a work of art put to unexpected use,since the independent concepts of art and utility coexist.conceptual separability would not exist in a useful article rendered simply aesthetically pleasing,since the independent concept of art does not exist,only the artistic embellishment to its utility,so that such artistic features are actually utilitarian.should the artistic embellishment of utility reach the level of a work of art,however,conceptual separability may exist.
id.at.this test,pivot point suggests,has the additional benefit of satisf ying most,if not all,of the current definitions of conceptual separability.id.at.
charlene,by contrast,lauds the district court adoption of professor goldstein test.under goldstein test,charlene asserts,a pictorial,graphic or sculptural feature incorporated in the design of a useful article is conceptually separable if it can stand on its own as a work of art traditionally conceived,and if the useful article in which it is embodied would be equally useful without it.appellees br.at quoting at emphasis added.charlene contends that this approach mirrors that adopted by the majority in carol barnhart economy cover,cir,the most closely related precedent to the case at bar.appellees br.at.
although both sides present thoughtful explanations for their proposed tests,we perceive shortcomings in the parties choices.with respect to pivot point focus on the article as a work of art,it is certainly correct that congress,in enacting,attempted to separate the artistic from the utilitarian.however,this approach necessarily involves judges in a qualitative evaluation of artistic function for which judicial office is hardly a qualifier.with respect to the charlene approach,we believe that the test,at least when applied alone,is tied too closely to physical separability and,consequently,does not give a sufficiently wide berth to congress determination that artistic material conceptually separate from the utilitarian design can satisfy the statutory mandate.
in articulating a meaningful approach to conceptual separability,we note that we are not the first court of appeals to deal with this problem.the work of our colleagues in the other circuits provides significant insights into our understanding of congressional intent.indeed,even when those judges have disagreed on the appropriate application of the congressional mandate to the case before them,their insight yield a bountiful harvest for those of us who now walk the same interpretative path.
among the circuits,the court of appeals for the second circuit has had occasion to wrestle most comprehensively with the notion of conceptual separability.its case law represents,we believe,an intellectual journey that has explored the key aspects of the problem.we therefore turn to a study of the key stages of doctrinal development in its case law.
the second circuit first grappled with the issue of conceptual separability in accessories by pearl,cir.in that case,a jewelry designer,had created a line of decorative and jeweled belt buckles inspired by works of art he obtained copyright registrations for his designs.when the line was successful,accessories by pearl,pearl copied the designs and marketed its own,versions of the belt buckles.then sued pearl for copyright infringement however,pearl claimed that the belt buckles were not copyrightable because they were useful articles with no pictorial,graphic,or sculptural features that can be identified separately from,and are capable of existing independently of,the utilitarian aspects of the buckles.id.at.the second circuit disagreed.although it did not articulate a specific test for evaluating conceptual separability,it focused on the primary and subsidiary elements of the article and concluded 
we see in appellant belt buckles conceptually separable sculptural elements,as apparently have the buckles wearers who have used them as ornamentation for parts of the body other than the waist.the primary ornamental aspect of the vaquero and winchester buckles is conceptually separable from their subsidiary utilitarian function.this conclusion is not at variance with the expressed congressional intent to distinguish copyrightable applied art and uncopyrightable industrial design.pieces of applied art,these buckles may be considered jewelry,the form of which is subject to copyright protection.
id.at internal citations omitted 
the second circuit revisited the issue of conceptual separability in carol barnhart economy cover,cir.in that case,carol barnhart,a provider of retail display items,developed four mannequins consisting of human torsos for the display of shirts and jackets.it obtained copyright registrations for each of the forms when a competitor,economy cover,copied the designs,carol barnhart claimed infringement of that copyright.the second circuit held that the designs were not copyrightable.it explained 
w hile copyright protection has increasingly been extended to cover articles having a utilitarian dimension,congress has explicitly refused copyright protection for works of applied art or industrial design which have aesthetic or artistic features that can not be identified separately from the useful article.such works are not copyrightable regardless of the fact that they may be aesthetically satisfying and valuable.
applying these principles,we are persuaded that since the aesthetic and artistic features of the barnhart forms are inseparable from the forms use as utilitarian articles the forms are not copyrightable barnhart stresses that the forms have been responded to as sculptural forms,and have been used for purposes other than modeling clothes,as decorating props and signs without any clothing or accessories.while this may indicate that the forms are aesthetically satisfying and valuable,it is insufficient to show that the forms possess aesthetic or artistic features that are physically or conceptually separable from the forms use as utilitarian objects to display clothes.on the contrary,to the extent the forms possess aesthetically pleasing features,even when these features are considered in the aggregate,they can not be conceptualized as existing independently of their utilitarian function.
id.at internal citations omitted.the court also rejected the argument that was controlling.the majority explained that what distinguished the buckles from the barnhart forms was that the ornamented surfaces of the buckles were not in any respect required by their functions the artistic and aesthetic features would thus be conceived as having been added to,or superimposed upon,an otherwise utilitarian article.id.at.
perhaps the most theoretical and comprehensive discussion of conceptual separability,as opposed to physical separability,can be found in the dissenting opinion of judge newman in carol barnhart,at.after reviewing the possible ways to determine conceptual separability,judge newman set forth his choice and rationale 
how,then,is conceptual separateness to be determined in my view,the answer derives from the word conceptual.for the design features to be conceptually separate from the utilitarian aspects of the useful article that embodies the design,the article must stimulate in the mind of the beholder a concept that is separate from the concept evoked by its utilitarian function.the test turns on what may reasonably be understood to be occurring in the mind of the beholder or,as some might say,in the mind eye of the beholder 
the separateness of the utilitarian and concepts engendered by an article design is itself a perplexing concept.i think the requisite separateness exists whenever the design creates in the mind of the ordinary observer two different concepts that are not inevitably entertained simultaneously.again,the example of the artistically designed chair displayed in a museum may be helpful.the ordinary observer can be expected to apprehend the design of a chair whenever the object is viewed.he may,in addition,entertain the concept of a work of art,but,if this second concept is engendered in the observer mind simultaneously with the concept of the article utilitarian function,the requisite separateness does not exist.the test is not whether the observer fails to recognize the object as a chair but only whether the concept of the utilitarian function can be displaced in the mind by some other concept.that does not occur,at least for the ordinary observer,when viewing even the most artistically designed chair.it may occur,however,when viewing some other object if the utilitarian function of the object is not perceived at all it may also occur,even when the utilitarian function is perceived by observation,perhaps aided by explanation,if the concept of the utilitarian function can be displaced in the observer mind while he entertains the separate concept of some function.the separate concept will normally be that of a work of art.
the second circuit soon addressed conceptual separability again in brandir international,cascade pacific lumber,cir.that case involved the work of an artist,david levine specifically,levine had created a sculpture of thick,interwoven wire.a cyclist friend of levine realized that the sculpture could,with modification,function as a bicycle rack and thereafter put levine in touch with brandir international,brandir.the artist and the brandir engineers then worked to modify the sculpture to produce a workable and marketable bicycle rack.their work culminated in the ribbon rack,which brandir began marketing in.shortly thereafter,cascade pacific lumber cascade began selling a similar product,and,in response,brandir applied for copyright protection and began placing copyright notices on its racks.the copyright office,however,rejected the registration on the ground that the rack did not contain any element that was capable of independent existence as a copyrightable pictorial,graphic or sculptural work apart from the shape of the useful article.id.at.
the court first considered the possible tests for conceptual separability in light of its past decisions and,notably,attempted to reconcile its earlier attempts 
perhaps the differences between the majority and the dissent in carol barnhart might have been resolved had they had before them the denicola article on applied art and industrial design a suggested approach to copyright in useful articles.denicola argues that the statutory directive requires a distinction between works of industrial design and works whose origins lie outside the design process,despite the utilitarian environment in which they appear.he views the statutory limitation of copyrightability as an attempt to identify elements whose form and appearance reflect the unconstrained perspective of the artist,such features not being the product of industrial design.id.at.copyrightability,therefore,should turn on the relationship between the proffered work and the process of industrial design.id.at.he suggests that the dominant characteristic of industrial design is the influence of nonaesthetic,utilitarian concerns and hence concludes that copyrightability ultimately should depend on the extent to which the work reflects artistic expression uninhibited by functional considerations.id.to state the denicola test in the language of conceptual separability,if design elements reflect a merger of aesthetic and functional considerations,the artistic aspects of a work can not be said to be conceptually separable from the utilitarian elements.conversely,where design elements can be identified as reflecting the designer artistic judgment exercised independently of functional influences,conceptual separability exists.
we believe that professor denicola approach provides the best test for conceptual separability and,accordingly,adopt it here for several reasons.first,the approach is consistent with the holdings of our previous cases.in,for example,the artistic aspects of the belt buckles reflected purely aesthetic choices,independent of the buckles function,while in carol barnhart the distinctive features of the accurate anatomical design and the sculpted shirts and clearly the influence of functional concerns second,the test emphasis on the influence of utilitarian concerns in the design process may help alleviate the de facto discrimination against nonrepresentational art that has regrettably accompanied much of the current analysis.id.at.
id.at footnotes omitted.
applying professor denicola test to the ribbon rack,the court found that the rack was not copyrightable.the court stated that,h ad brandir merely adopted one of the existing sculptures as a bicycle rack,neither the application to a utilitarian end nor commercialization of that use would have caused the object to forfeit its copyrighted status.id.at.however,when the ribbon rack was compared to earlier sculptures,continued the court,it was in its final form essentially a product of industrial design.id.
in creating the ribbon rack,the designer clearly adapted the original aesthetic elements to accommodate and further a utilitarian purpose.these altered design features of the ribbon rack,including the spacesaving,open design achieved by widening the upper loops,the straightened vertical elements that allow in and installation of the rack,the ability to fit all types of bicycles and mopeds,and the tubular construction of rustproof galvanized steel,are all features that combine to make for a safe,secure,and system of parking bicycles and mopeds.
while the ribbon rack may be worthy of admiration for its aesthetic qualities alone,it remains nonetheless the product of industrial design.form and function are inextricably intertwined in the rack,its ultimate design being as much the result of utilitarian pressures as aesthetic choices thus there remains no artistic element of the ribbon rack that can be identified as separate and capable of existing independently,of,the utilitarian aspects of the article.
we believe that the experience of the second circuit is also reflected in the more recent encounter of the fourth circuit with the same problem.in superior form builders,dan chase taxidermy supply,cir,the court considered whether animal mannequins qualified for copyright protection.the fourth circuit first considered whether the mannequins were useful articles as defined by and concluded that they were not 
a mannequin provides the creative form and expression of the ultimate animal display even though covered with a skin,the mannequin is not invisible but conspicuous in the final display.the angle of the animal head,the juxtaposition of its body parts,and the shape of the body parts in the final display is little more than the portrayal of the underlying mannequin none of these expressive aspects of a mannequin is lost by covering the mannequin with a skin.thus,any utilitarian aspect of the mannequin exists merely to portray the appearance of the animal.see.
it is the portrayal of the animal body expression given by the mannequin that is thus protectable under the copyright act.we therefore agree with the district court in this case because the usefulness of the forms is their portrayal of the appearance of animals.the mannequin forms by definition are not useful articles.
id.at quoting superior form builders dan chase taxidermy supply.
the court,however,also considered whether,if useful,the utilitarian and aesthetic aspects of the mannequin were separable 
to the extent that an argument can be made that the mannequins in this case perform a utilitarian than portraying supporting the mounted skins,we believe the function to be conceptually separable from the works sculptural features.see brandir int l,cascade pac.lumber,cir where design elements can be identified as reflecting the designer artistic judgment exercised independently of functional influences,conceptual separability exists.accessories by pearl,cir finding sculptural element of belt buckle conceptually separable from utilitarian function.
id.thus,without specifically adopting one of the tests of conceptual separability,the fourth circuit determined that artistic work put into the design of the animal frame was copyrightable the fact that a skin was placed on the model and that the model,therefore,was useful in the display of the skin did not negate the artistic elements of the design 
there is one final second circuit case that bears comment.in mattel,goldberger doll manufacturing,cir,the second circuit rejected the idea that a particular expression of features on a doll face was not subject to copyright protection.the case arose out of the alleged copying of the facial features of mattel barbie dolls by goldberger doll manufacturing when creating its rockettes doll.on goldberger motion for summary judgment,the district court held that copyright protection did not extend to barbie eyes,nose,and mouth id.at.the second circuit reversed.although it did not speak specifically in terms of conceptual separability,the court reasoning is nevertheless instructive it stated 
the proposition that standard or common features are not protected is inconsistent with copyright law.to merit protection from copying,a work need not be particularly novel or unusual.it need only have been independently created by the author and possess some minimal degree of creativity.feist publ ns,rural.serv,d there are innumerable ways of making upturned noses,bow lips,and widely spaced eyes.even if the record had shown that many dolls possess upturned noses,bow lips,and eyes,it would not follow that each such it was independently created and not copied from not enjoy protection from copying.
id.at footnotes and parallel citations omitted.additionally,the court noted the scope of the copyright protection that the barbie dolls enjoyed 
the copyright does not protect ideas it protects only the author particularized expression of the idea.thus,mattel copyright in a doll visage with an upturned nose,bow lips,and widely spaced eyes will not prevent a competitor from making dolls with upturned noses,bow lips,and widely spaced eyes,even if the competitor has taken the idea from mattel example,so long as the competitor has not copied mattel particularized expression.an upturned nose,bow lips,and wide eyes are the idea of a certain type of doll face.that idea belongs not to mattel but to the public domain.but mattel copyright will protect its own particularized expression of that idea and bar a competitor from copying mattel realization of the barbie features.
id.at citations omitted.
application 
each of these cases differs in the object at issue and the method by which the court evaluated whether the object was entitled to copyright protection.yet,each court attempted to give effect to the expressed congressional intent to distinguish copyrightable applied art and uncopyrightable industrial design,at see also carol barnhart,at reviewing legislative history in detail and concluding that,although copyright protection has increasingly been extended to cover articles having a utilitarian dimension,congress did not intend all useful articles that are aesthetically satisfying or valuable to be copyrightable brandir int l,at adopting professor denicola test that makes copyrightability dependent upon the extent to which the work reflects artistic expression uninhibited by functional considerations internal quotation marks and citations omitted superior form builders,at distinguishing the animal mannequins at issue from aesthetically pleasing articles of industrial design.
the second circuit cases exhibit a progressive attempt to forge a workable judicial approach capable of giving meaning to the basic congressional policy decision to distinguish applied art from uncopyrightable industrial art or design.in,the second circuit attempted to distinguish artistic expression from industrial design by focusing on the present use of the item,the primary ornamental aspect versus the subsidiary utilitarian function of the object at issue.at.in carol barnhart,the second circuit moved closer to a approach 
what distinguishes those buckles from the barnhart forms is that the ornamented surfaces of the buckles were not in any respect required by their utilitarian functions the artistic and aesthetic features could thus be conceived of as having been added to,or superimposed upon,an otherwise utilitarian article.the unique artistic design was wholly unnecessary to performance of the utilitarian function.in the case of the barnhart forms,on the other hand,the features claimed to be aesthetic or artistic,the configuration of the breasts and the width of the shoulders,are inextricably intertwined with the utilitarian feature,the display of clothes.whereas a model of a human torso,in order to serve its utilitarian function,must have some configuration of the chest and some width of shoulders,a belt buckle can serve its function satisfactorily without any ornamentation of the type that renders the buckles distinctive.
at.thus,it was the fact that the creator of the torsos was driven by utilitarian concerns,such as how display clothes would fit on the end product,that deprived the human torsos of copyright protection.
this approach for conceptual on the process of creating the object to determine whether it is entitled to copyright more fully articulated in brandir and indeed reconciles the earlier case law pertaining to conceptual separability.
t he approach is consistent with the holdings of our previous cases.in,for example,the artistic aspects of the belt buckles reflected purely aesthetic choices,independent of the buckles function,while in carol barnhart the distinctive features of the accurate anatomical design and the sculpted shirts and clearly the influence of functional concerns.though the torsos bore artistic features,it was evident the designer incorporated those features to further the usefulness of the torsos as mannequins.
brandir,at.
furthermore,brandir is not inconsistent with the more theoretical rendition of judge newman in his carol barnhart the requisite separateness exists whenever the design creates in the mind of an ordinary observer two different concepts that are not inevitably entertained simultaneously.at.when a product has reached its final form as a result of predominantly functional or utilitarian considerations,it necessarily will be more difficult for the observer to entertain simultaneously two different artistic object and the utilitarian object.in such circumstances,brandir has the added benefit of providing a more workable judicial methodology by articulating the driving principle behind conceptual influence of industrial design.when the ultimate form of the object in question is as much the result of utilitarian pressures as aesthetic choices,f orm and function are inextricably intertwined,and the artistic aspects of the object can not be separated from its utilitarian aspects for purposes of copyright protection.brandir,at.
conceptual separability exists,therefore,when the artistic aspects of an article can be conceptualized as existing independently of their utilitarian function.carol barnhart,at.this independence is necessarily informed by whether the design elements can be identified as reflecting the designer artistic judgment exercised independently of functional influences.brandir,at.if the elements do reflect the independent,artistic judgment of the designer,conceptual separability exists.conversely,when the design of a useful article is as much the result of utilitarian pressures as aesthetic choices,id.at,the useful and aesthetic elements are not conceptually separable.
applying this test to the mara mannequin,we must conclude that the mara face is subject to copyright protection.it certainly is not difficult to conceptualize a human face,independent of all of mara specific facial features,the shape of the eye,the upturned nose,the angular cheek and jaw structure,that would serve the utilitarian functions of a hair stand and,if proven,of a makeup model.indeed,one is not only able to conceive of a different face than that portrayed on the mara mannequin,but one easily can conceive of another visage that portrays the hungry look on a runway model.just as mattel is entitled to protection for its own particularized expression of an upturned nose,bow lips,and widely spaced eyes,mattel,at,so too is heerlein and,therefore,pivot point as assignee of the copyright registration entitled to have his expression of the hungry look protected from copying.
mara can be conceptualized as existing independent from its use in hair display or training because it is the product of heerlein artistic judgment.when passage approached heerlein about creating the mara sculpture,passage did not provide heerlein with specific dimensions or measurements indeed,there is no evidence that heerlein artistic judgment was constrained by functional considerations.passage did not require,for instance,that the sculpture eyes be a certain width to accommodate eyelashes,that the brow be arched at a certain angle to facilitate easy application or that the sculpture as a whole not exceed certain dimensional limits so as to fit within pivot point existing packaging system.such considerations,had they been present,would weigh against a determination that mara was purely the product of an artistic effort.by contrast,after passage met with heerlein to discuss passage idea for a model,heerlein had carte blanche to implement that vision as he saw fit.consequently,this is not a situation,such as was presented to the second circuit in carol barnhart,in which certain features accurate anatomical design and the sculpted shirts and collars were included in the design for purely functional reasons.brandir,at.furthermore,unlike the headless,armless,backless styrene torsos which were little more than glorified used to display clothing in stores,hart,at,the creative aspects of the mara sculpture were meant to be seen and admired.thus,because mara was the product of a creative process unfettered by functional concerns,its sculptural features can be identified separately from,and are capable of existing independently of,its utilitarian aspects.it therefore meets the requirements for conceptual separability and is subject to copyright protection.
conclusion 
the mara mannequin is subject to copyright protection.we therefore must reverse the summary judgment in favor of charlene products and yau the case is remanded for a trial on pivot point infringement claim.furthermore,because charlene products and yau have not prevailed on the merits at this point,the judgment of the district court with respect to attorneys fees must be vacated.the with respect to attorneys fees is moot.pivot point may recover its costs in this court.
reversed and remanded dismissed 
writing for the majority,judge ripple has applied his usual thorough and scholarly approach to this difficult intellectual property problem however,i can not join the majority opinion because i am not persuaded that the mara mannequin is copyrightable.all functional items have aesthetic qualities.if copyright provided protection for functional items simply because of their aesthetic qualities,congress policy choice that gives less protection in patent than copyright would be undermined.see american dental ass delta dental plans ass n,cir.
the majority rightly assumes that mara is a useful article as defined in.opinion at.to receive copyright protection as a sculptural work,then,mara must come within the narrow restrictions placed on useful articles in the definition of pictorial,graphic,and sculptural works 
t he design of a useful article shall be considered a sculptural work only if,and only to the extent that,such design incorporates sculptural features that can be identified separately from,and are capable of existing independently of,the utilitarian aspects of the article.
emphasis added.as the district court noted,the statute requires,on its face,that sculptural features must be separately identified from the utilitarian aspects of the article conceptual separability and they must exist independently from the utilitarian aspects of the article physical separability in order to receive copyright protection.as to whether both conceptual and physical separability are required for copyrightability,most courts and commentators have concluded that only one or the other test is appropriate.but that issue is not presented here because mara is not copyrightable regardless of whether both or either is applied.
taking physical separability first,the district court used examples from case law to illustrate that the sculptural features in many useful items can be physically removed from the object and sold separately without affecting the functionality of the useful article.see,mazer stein.holding that a sculpture of a dancer carved into the base of a lamp may be copyrighted accessories by pearl,cir holding that decorative belt buckles could be copyrighted as separate objects sold not to hold up one pants.
mara,on the other hand,has only functional attributes.thus,any physical separation of a portion of her would not be independent of her utilitarian aspects.she is sold to beauty schools as a teaching device students style her hair and apply makeup as realistic training for such pursuits on live subjects.a mannequin head without a neck,or with different eyes and musculature,would not serve the utilitarian purpose of applying makeup or teaching the art of matching hair styles to facial features.as the district court explained beauty students style hair to flatter the face,not to be worn on featureless ovoids.the use of a mannequin head in training students of beauty schools lies in its aesthetic qualities.there is nothing in mara that we could physically remove that would not be part of mara utility as a teaching aid.like mannequins of human torsos,carol barnhart economy cover,cir,mannequins of human faces are not physically separable from their functional purpose and are therefore not copyrightable.
next,the district court considered various restatements of the meaning of conceptual separability whether features can be identified or conceived of separately from the utilitarian aspects and applied the most appropriate one to mara.professor goldstein,in his treatise,copyright principles,law practice,presents a reasonable explanation of the statutory text a sculptural feature incorporated in the design of a useful article is conceptually separable if it can stand on its own as a work of art traditionally conceived,and if the useful article in which it is embodied would be equally useful without it.mara has no conceptually separable features to which copyright protection could be granted.her features are incapable of being identified separately from the utilitarian use of those features.without features,the mannequin head and neck would be little more than an egg on a stick,useless for its intended purpose.mara possesses neither physical nor conceptual separability.
the majority,concluding that congress intended to state a single,integrated standard,deduced that the standard must be conceptual separability.this may be correct,as it is very difficult to divine the distinction between physical and conceptual separability if those standards are properly stated.in my view,however,the majority explanation of conceptual separability lacks a basis in the statute.as the majority sees it,conceptual separability exists when the artistic aspects of an article can be conceptualized as existing independently of their utilitarian function.opinion at.the majority further explains that the way to determine if this is the case is to look to the process of design if independent artistic choices were made in the sculpture creation,and such choices were not later sullied by the influence of industrial design,then some of the useful article is a conceptually separable sculpture and therefore copyrightable,opinion at.
problematically,the majority test for conceptual separability seems to bear little resemblance to the statute.the statute asks two questions does the useful article incorporate sculptural features that can be identified separately from the utilitarian aspects of the article and are these features capable of existing independently from the utilitarian aspects the copyright statute is concerned with protecting only features of the useful article.to be copyrightable,the statute requires that the useful article functionality remain intact once the copyrightable material is separated.in other words,pivot point needs to show that mara face is not a utilitarian aspect of the product mara,but rather a separate feature.the majority,by looking only to whether the features could also be conceptualized as existing independently of their utilitarian function and ignoring the more important question of whether the features themselves are utilitarian aspects of the useful article,mistakenly presupposes that utilitarian aspects of a useful article can be copyrighted.if we took away mara facial features,her functionality would be greatly diminished or eliminated,thus proving that her features can not be copyrighted.
moreover,the approach,advocated by the majority drifts even further away from the statute.opinion at.the statute looks to the useful article as it exists,not to how it was created.i believe it simply is irrelevant to inquire into the origins of mara eyes,cheekbones,and neck.if such features have been fully incorporated as functional aspects of the mannequin,then copyright does not provide protection.even if we were to look at the process that led to the creation of mara,it is undeniable that,from the beginning,pivot point intended mara to serve a functional purpose and commissioned her creation to fulfill that purpose not to create a work of art for aesthetic beauty.
the majority,as evidenced by its emphasis on the fact that charlene products apparently copied mara with its doll,liza,seems unduly concerned in this context with charlene questionable business practices.this is immaterial to the determination of whether the mara doll is protected by copyright law.importantly,other possible legal protections for pivot point intellectual patent,trademark,trade dress,and state unfair competition available to address the majority concerns.copyright does not protect functional products.charlene is free,under its own brand name,to copy and sell copies of useful articles that do not have patent protection.see,traffix devices,marketing displays,d bonito boats,thunder craft boats,d sears,roebuck stiffel,d.i fear that the majority opinion grants copyright protection to functional aspects of a useful article.i would,therefore,affirm the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of charlene products and yau.
yau was not unfamiliar with pivot point.shortly before founding charlene products in,yau had worked for pivot point.
charlene eventually obtained a copyright registration for its liza mannequin.
