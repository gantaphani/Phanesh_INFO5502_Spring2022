before this court is an appeal from the district court grant of summary judgment in a case concerning the federal copyright laws.appellant argues that the district court erred by i holding that appellees had an irrevocable,nonexclusive implied license,which precluded appellant claim of copyright infringement ii determining that the doctrine of estoppel also barred the infringement claim iii holding that appellant conversion claims were preempted by federal copyright law and iv declining to resolve appellant prayer for declaratory relief.because estoppel bars appellant infringement claim,we affirm the district court granting summary judgment.we reverse the district court determination that appellant claims are preempted by federal law and remand this issue as well as appellant declaratory judgment claim to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
the dispute in this case involves the ownership of certain copyrightable expressions in the worksheet or the worksheet,a worksheet created by william carson,using microsoft excel,a spreadsheet program.carson,a resident of texas,began working for the dynegy a group that trades energy,in late as an analyst in the gas accounting department.in june,carson assumed the position of scheduler,a job in which his main duties included scheduling energy trades and handling scheduling problems for dynegy.dynegy characterized employees such as carson as whose duties included trading and scheduling.
while working as a scheduler,carson created,which allows its users to create a large amount of bids,which are offers to sell electrical power and ancillary services,in an fashion and causes those bids to be submitted to the appropriate website for processing carson contends that he created to impress management and to get promoted to the position of trader.it is not disputed that carson created by himself and largely on his own time away from the office,although uncontroverted record evidence indicates that he altered and modified the worksheet while at work.carson also informed his colleagues at dynegy about the worksheet and supported its application.carson,furthermore,allowed multiple individuals to access the password for.it is also undisputed that carson encouraged even those with whom he did not work closely to adopt and modify,and to prepare a worksheet derivative of it.and,despite carson claim that his knew that was his program,he admitted that he never explicitly told anyone that his program could not be modified or used unless he was present,and he never appeared to correct the impression among some of dynegy employees that was a project.
because of carson high performance on the job,which was at least in part due to his role in implementing the worksheet,carson was i nominated for a company award consisting of a monetary prize,ii earmarked to receive an annual bonus,and iii recommended for a promotion.carson,however,never received these benefits,as he was soon terminated for violating company policy in a matter unrelated to this litigation.despite carson firing,dynegy continued to use the worksheet.
only upon his termination did carson begin concerning himself with dynegy use of.more than eight months after his discharge and after allegedly discovering that dynegy still was using,carson wrote a letter to dynegy demanding that the company immediately discontinue its unauthorized use of my program and requesting that dynegy return all copies of the worksheet.dynegy responded that was its property,as it was developed by carson in the course and within the scope of his employment.a year following his initial letter,carson again demanded return of the worksheet dynegy responded to this correspondence by again asserting its ownership rights of and refusing to provide hard copy of the program.
carson then initiated the instant lawsuit,seeking the following 
i a declaratory judgment stating that carson owns all copyrights in the worksheet and that the program is not a,as identified in 
ii a determination that dynegy use of infringes carson copyrights in violation of,et 
iii a determination that the worksheet is not a joint work under 
iv a holding that if is determined to be a joint work,carson is entitled to an accounting of his share of the profits relating to its use 
v a determination that dynegy illegally converted a tangible copies of the program and b proceeds earned from use of the worksheet.
at the close of discovery,dynegy filed a motion for summary judgment,to which carson responded.dynegy filed a reply and carson sought leave to file a.the district court granted carson motion for leave to file a,though it made clear that carson was not permitted to add to the summary judgment evidence.despite this instruction,the district court determined that carson did attempt to add to the summary judgement record.accordingly,the district court refused to consider any offending portions of the.
after considering the parties memoranda and the summary judgment evidence as a whole,the district court held that even if carson owned,dynegy had acquired a nonexclusive implied license to use the worksheet.furthermore,the district court held that such a license was irrevocable because it was supported by consideration,namely,carson nomination for the company award consisting of a monetary prize,selection to receive an annual bonus,and recommendation for a promotion the district court noted further that it was immaterial that carson never received or enjoyed the benefits of the supposed consideration.in the alternative,the district court held that carson was estopped from filing his infringement claim against dynegy for its use of the worksheet.because of its rulings on the licensing and estoppel issues,the district court believed it was unnecessary to address the ownership issue.furthermore,the district court held that carson conversion claim was preempted by federal copyright law.carson now appeals these determinations of the district court.

irrevocable nonexclusive implied license 
carson argues that the district court erred in holding that the parties conduct created an irrevocable,nonexclusive implied license.specifically,he disputes the district court holdings that i a nonexclusive implied license was created ii the license was unlimited in scope and iii the license was irrevocable.analysis of the last of these three determinations is sufficient to conclude that the district court erred.
we turn first to carson argument that even if a nonexclusive implied license to use had been created,such a license was not irrevocable and,indeed,was revoked by carson.specifically,carson asserts that even if dynegy had a license to use,that license was revoked upon carson demanding the return of the worksheet after his termination.it is settled that a nonexclusive license may be irrevocable if supported by consideration.lulirama,axcess broadcast,cir and,t his is so because a nonexclusive license supported by consideration is a contract.id.citations omitted.assuming,arguendo,that a nonexclusive license was created,whether such a license was irrevocable rests solely with whether carson received consideration.
at summary judgment,the district court rejected dynegy claims that carson continued employment constituted sufficient consideration,as such dynegy was free to terminate at any merely an illusory promise.the district court,however,was persuaded that the consideration requirement was satisfied by dynegy i nominating carson for a company award consisting of a monetary prize,ii planning to award carson with an annual bonus,and iii recommending carson for a promotion.the district court determined that it was immaterial that carson never received the company award payment,annual bonus,or promotion,because he would have received these benefits had he not been fired due to circumstances and events unrelated to this litigation.
we decline to adopt the district court conclusion that the monetary award,annual bonus,and promotion,none of which carson received,were sufficient to establish consideration under lulirama.to determine whether such benefits can be deemed consideration in the context of an relationship,we examine texas law under texas contract law,
a employees may contract with their employers on any matter except those which would limit the ability of either employer or employee to terminate the employment at will.consideration for a promise,by either the employee or the employer in an employment,can not be dependent on a period of continued employment.such a promise would be illusory because it fails to bind the promisor who always retains the option of discontinuing employment in lieu of performance.citations omitted.when illusory promises are all that support a purported bilateral contract,there is no contract.in short,we hold that otherwise enforceable agreements can emanate from employment so long as the consideration for any promise is not illusory.
light centel cellular,accord kadco contract design kelly,d.here,the supposed consideration,eligibility for various cash awards and promotion,were dependent upon carson continued employment with dynegy.when carson was terminated,he was disqualified from receiving this putative consideration.dynegy was not bound by any of these supposed promises because it carson employment at its discretion,thereby unilaterally revoking its promises.and,such illusory promises are,as a matter of law,insufficient to constitute adequate consideration.see light,at.
accordingly,as consideration was not present,any license ostensibly granted to dynegy was revocable by carson.carson,of course,did revoke this license by complaining to dynegy of its use of and by filing this lawsuit.see,keane dealer services,harts,holding that issuance of a lawsuit is sufficient to constitute revocation of a license.as any license obtained by dynegy was revocable,and clearly revoked by carson,we need not address whether a nonexclusive implied license was even created or the scope of such a license.
even if dynegy has no irrevocable license to use,carson nevertheless is estopped from the instant infringement claim,as the district court appropriately recognized.although there is no circuit authority articulating the elements of estoppel as a defense to a copyright infringement allegation,a consensus has developed that a copyright defendant must prove four conjunctive elements to establish estoppel in such cases 
the plaintiff must know the facts of the defendant infringing conduct 
the plaintiff must intend that its conduct shall be acted on or must so act that the defendant has a right to believe that it is so intended 
the defendant must be ignorant of the true facts and 
the defendant must rely on the plaintiff conduct to its injury.
see melville nimmer david nimmer,nimmer on copyright nimmer.federal courts considering the doctrine of estoppel in copyright cases have adopted and applied this test.see,hampton paramount pictures,cir,cert.denied,d quinn city of detroit,d,national business lists,dun bradstreet,schuchart associates,professional engineers,solo serve,lottie joplin thomas trust crown publishers,aff,cir.furthermore,it is accepted that estoppel may be accomplished by a plaintiff silence and inaction.nimmer citing quinn,d at national business lists.at.
carson challenges that elements i,iii,and iv of the estoppel test have been satisfied by uncontroverted evidence.specifically,carson argues that he did not know that dynegy continued to use after his termination until shortly before he wrote his first letter to dynegy,asserting that he owned the worksheet and asking that dynegy cease using it.in essence,then,carson asserts that his knowledge of dynegy use of prior to his termination is not relevant rather,he claims that dynegy conduct only after carson termination is relevant with respect to the first estoppel element.furthermore,carson argues that there is a factual dispute regarding whether dynegy knew that carson created and had rights in.finally,carson argues that dynegy receipt of carson letter precludes the argument that dynegy could establish any reasonable detrimental reliance.this final argument is again dependent upon carson assumption that only the state of affairs after the than the state of affairs before relevant to the estoppel analysis.
as an initial matter,there is no factual dispute that dynegy was ignorant of the facts as alleged by carson.see nimmer.while carson argues that it was widely known that he owned the worksheet,the record militates to the contrary.indeed,there is evidence that carson encouraged the adaptation,modification,and preparation of a derivative program for other dynegy employees to use.carson,moreover,permitted multiple persons to access the password for.despite carson claim that his knew that was his property,he admitted that he never explicitly told anyone that the worksheet could not be modified or used unless he was present and he never appeared to correct the impression among some of dynegy employees that was a program.
all that now stands in the way of endorsing the district court estoppel determination is carson argument that it was improper to consider events prior to his termination in the analysis of estoppel elements i and iv while there is no controlling case on the matter,one district court,when confronted with similar facts,did not hesitate to consider the parties conduct during the course of the plaintiff employment to confront the estoppel issue.see quinn,d at.in quinn,the plaintiff,a staff attorney employed by the city of detroit,created a computer program designed to help the office run more efficiently.id.at.although the plaintiff consented to the office use of the program for a number of years,he attempted to withdraw such consent after other employees at the office attempted to modify the program without first obtaining permission.id.at.and,this attempt to keep the city from using the program occurred during the time that the plaintiff was employed by the city.id.after citing to the estoppel test,the district court determined that the plaintiff was estopped from pursuing an infringement claim because the city had,for years,relied on the plaintiff permission to use the program and had become dependent upon it,abandoning its prior system.id.at.thus,the court held that at some point between the time that the city began using the program and the time that the plaintiff first attempted to assert his rights approximately three years later,the plaintiff became estopped from withdrawing his consent because of the city reliance and the plaintiff past grant of permission.id.thus,if quinn were controlling,dynegy estoppel argument would prevail,as quinn clearly contemplates consideration of the parties conduct during the time in which the plaintiff is employed by the defendant.indeed,all the relevant conduct in quinn was,as the plaintiff there had not been terminated.
yet,as quinn is not binding precedent,we are not obliged to accept its reasoning if we deem it faulty.an analysis of the opinion in quinn,however,demonstrates its virtues.indeed,quinn permits courts to consider the relationship of employers and workers,such as the plaintiff in that case and carson in this matter,during the course of employment to determine whether estoppel should be an available defense.id.at.it further holds that estoppel can be established while a putative copyright holder is still employed by the alleged infringer.id.this rule is sound,as the theory of estoppel is based on reasonable reliance.see florida of ins.ch
