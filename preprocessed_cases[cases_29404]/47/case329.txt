roosevelt anderson,appeals his conviction for criminal copyright infringement under a a and b.anderson contends that the district court erred by giving an incorrect jury instruction on willfulness by allowing the government to introduce evidence of uncharged acts of infringement and in calculating restitution.applying the willfulness standard for criminal copyright cases as recently clarified in united states liu,cir,we conclude that the jury instruction was flawed but did not rise to the level of plain error.we also find that the evidence of uncharged acts was properly admitted as intrinsic to the charged conduct,and accordingly,we affirm anderson conviction.nonetheless,consistent with united states fair,and united states chalupnik,cir,we conclude that the district court erred in failing to award restitution reflecting the victim actual loss,which consisted of the victim lost profits on sales of authentic copies that would have taken place if not for anderson conduct.consequently,we vacate the restitution order and remand to the district court to reconsider restitution on an open record.
anderson was a las vegas cab driver who also dabbled in photography and electronics repair.at some point,he decided to start selling software.he initially considered contacting adobe systems,adobe to see if he could work out a financial deal with it.lacking any funding for such a deal,however,he decided to take an alternative route.using the moniker,anderson began a operation selling adobe software online through the price comparison website pricegrabber,while handling payments through the google checkout processing service.he also advertised software on his own website.
the discs containing the software anderson sold were burned discs with generic labels.anderson advertisements and the documents accompanying the discs referred to the software as full or complete oem meaning original equipment manufacturer products.the accompanying documents also indicated that would make,optional software upgrades providing improved software functionality available to the customer if the customer would rate on pricegrabber.the discs also contained a terms and conditions document,which stated that the software was only to be used for archival purposes or as a backup copy.the terms and conditions were not printed out for the customers,however,and the customers could and did install the software without viewing them.
in order to activate legitimate adobe software,a customer must enter a digit serial number or product key provided by adobe which it generates using an algorithm.the software first confirms that the number is in the correct format and then confirms that it is a valid number with adobe.however,counterfeiters can use key generators to create serial numbers that match adobe algorithm and disable or bypass the function requiring the software to confirm that the number is valid.anderson software was packaged with serial numbers written in permanent marker.
based in part on the inauthentic appearance of the product,two customers contacted anderson and demanded refunds.one bluntly told anderson you are pirating software and marketing it as if you are not doing something illegal.i have no doubt that this is not new software and that you are not operating under legal means.anderson provided the requested refunds.
anderson operation eventually attracted adobe attention.an adobe investigator purchased a copy of photoshop extended from anderson using pricegrabber and google checkout.the investigator purchased the software,which had a retail price of,from anderson for,including shipping and handling.adobe then contacted christopher morris,a postal inspector,who subpoenaed records from pricegrabber and google,as well as records from email addresses related to the pricegrabber and google accounts.morris eventually concluded that anderson controlled the accounts.the records showed that anderson had sold copies of photoshop and copies of photoshop extended from february through february.during that time period,anderson made approximately total software sales,totaling.
morris subsequently and arranged a purchase of adobe fireworks after exchanging voicemails with an individual identifying himself as morris paid,including shipping and handling,for the product,which had a retail price of.surveillance cameras captured images of anderson checking the post office box listed as the return address.morris subsequently set up another sale using the same process and arrested anderson.anderson then consented to a search of the rental car that he drove to the post office.in the car,morris found a number of blank discs,two copies of photoshop,various discs with adobe,a key generator disc,and discs with various other adobe programs.
anderson was subsequently charged with criminal copyright infringement based on his sales of photoshop and photoshop extended.at trial,anderson admitted to selling the software but explained that,based on his internet research,he believed that oems were companies that resell other companies products under their own names,and that oem referred to backup copies.he said that he pulled the information for the terms and conditions from the copyright act specifically,and from other websites selling oem software.he explained that he provided customers with serial numbers using a key generator because customers frequently misplace their original serial numbers.
anderson conceded that he did not mention that the software was for backup or archival purposes on pricegrabber.he also conceded that he continued to sell the software even after his customers told him that it looked illegal.he was also aware that some customers were installing the software and using it,as opposed to merely retaining it for backup purposes,but he did not change his practices.several customers testified that they would not have purchased anderson software if they had known it could be used only for backup purposes.
a representative from adobe testified that there was no market for backup copies of adobe software and that adobe does not authorize anyone to make backup copies for customers.he said that in an oem deal,adobe sells a copy of software at a discounted rate to a hardware purchaser.he said that oem software is not sold separately from a piece of hardware and oem does not refer to backup copies.he confirmed that the copy of extended that the investigator purchased and the copy of fireworks that morris purchased from anderson were unauthorized.he also stated that adobe had no relationship with anderson and did not authorize him to sell its products.
after a trial,the jury found anderson guilty.the district court sentenced him to months of imprisonment and two years of supervised release.it further ordered him to pay a special assessment and in restitution to adobe.anderson now appeals,and we have jurisdiction pursuant to.
anderson first contends that the district court erred because its jury instruction on the criminal copyright willfulness standard improperly suggested that the jury could convict him even if he did not have the specific intent to violate the law.
prior to trial,both parties submitted proposed jury instructions.the government set of proposed instructions included the following instruction,titled willfully defined 
the government must prove that the defendant willfully infringed a copyrighted work.an infringement was willful when the defendant engaged in acts that infringed the copyrights,and knew that those actions may infringe the copyrights or acted with reckless disregard for,or willful blindness to the copyright holder rights 
among other supporting authorities,the government cited the ninth circuit manual of model civil jury instructions.anderson proposed the following competing explanation of willful infringement 
a copyright is proven to be infringed willfully when the defendant voluntarily and intentionally violated a known legal duty.united states moran,citing cheek united states.to find him guilty,you must find anderson acted with a motive to violate that which the statute protects something more is required than the doing of the act proscribed by the statute.screws united states.infringement of a copyright held by adobe requires a finding that anderson acted with the purpose of depriving adobe of the interest protected by its copyright.united states heilman,accord screws,at.anderson must have known his actions constituted a copyright infringement in order for you to find he acted willfully.peer int l pausa records,cir.if you find that anderson did not know his actions were infringing the rights of adobe,then you must find him not guilty 
anderson objected to the government instruction,noting that there was no model instruction and that the government was relying on civil authority.the government argued that anderson instruction was not an accurate statement of the requirement of willfulness.in particular,the government indicated that it was concerned that anderson instruction added additional undefined elements,such as motive,known legal duty,and purpose.it argued that its instruction accurately stated the law,which is that the defendant knew what he was doing would violate adobe copyright.
the court found that anderson instruction did seek to add additional factors that were likely irrelevant.it proposed adding the last two sentences of anderson instruction to the end of the government instruction.anderson counsel then stated okay,i accept that.the government agreed that the penultimate sentence was an accurate statement of the government burden but argued that the last sentence was unnecessary and might lead to confusion about what the jury had to find.the court agreed that the last sentence would be left out of the instruction and left for the parties to address at closing argument.anderson counsel responded,okay.the court asked anderson counsel if he wanted the sentence as a instruction,but he responded as much as i would love to have a instruction,it makes sense to keep it with the willfully defined.the parties also agreed that the bracketed language in the government instruction regarding recklessness and willful blindness was not necessary based on the evidence in the record.
the final instruction,as read to the jury,was 
the government must prove that the defendant willfully infringed a copyrighted work.an infringement was willful when the defendant engaged in acts that infringed the copyrights and knew those actions may infringe the copyrights.
anderson must have known his actions substituted sic a copyright infringement in order for you to find he acted willfully.
the district court asked both parties if they objected to the reading of the instructions,and both responded,no.written copies of the instructions were also provided to the jury.
on the second day of deliberations,the jury sent a note stating a juror has looked at the word willful in a dictionary and shared that it means deliberate.please advise.in response,the court sent a note back pursuant to the parties agreement indicating that the jurors were instructed not to do any research and referring them to the willfulness instruction.twenty minutes later,the jury indicated that it had reached a unanimous verdict.
anderson contends that de novo review applies the district court improperly rejected his proposed willfulness instruction and adopted an instruction that misstated the law and the error affected the jury verdict.
the parties dispute whether a de novo or plain error standard of review applies here.we generally review whether a jury instruction omits or misstates an element of a crime on a de novo basis.united states kilbride,cir.however,in the absence of a timely objection to the jury instructions,we review for plain error.id.internal quotation marks omitted.in order to find plain error,we must find an error that is plain and affects substantial rights.id.even where these conditions are met,however,we may only exercise our discretion to correct the error if it seriously affects the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.id.
under federal rule of criminal procedure d,a party who objects to any portion of the instructions or to a failure to give a requested instruction must inform the court of the specific objection and the grounds for the objection before the jury retires to deliberate.we have held that rule requires a defendant to state with adequate specificity the grounds for an objection to a jury instruction before the jury retires,and that a defendant mere proposal of an alternate instruction does not satisfy rule standard of specificity.united states hofus,cir internal quotation marks omitted.an objection to an instruction on a different ground is not sufficient to preserve de novo review.see united states peterson,cir.
here,anderson submitted an alternative willfulness instruction that the court largely rejected.however,after the court discussed the issue with counsel,anderson attorney said okay,i accept that.moreover,despite having multiple opportunities to do so,anderson attorney did not specifically object to the court formulation of the final willfulness instruction,which was a combination of the government instruction and anderson instruction.indeed,rather than objecting,anderson attorney explicitly acquiesced to it.accordingly,plain error review applies 
under a a,a person is guilty of criminal copyright infringement if he or she willfully infringes a copyright for the purpose of commercial advantage or private financial gain.we do not have a model instruction explaining the willfulness requirement in criminal copyright infringement cases.however,we recently set forth the relevant standards in united states liu,cir 
in liu,the district court had instructed the jury that the defendant could be convicted of willful infringement if he without authorization duplicated,reproduced or sold the copyright belonging to the owners of the works and that an act is done willfully if the act is done knowingly and intentionally,not through ignorance,mistake or accident.id.at alteration and internal quotation marks omitted.the district court failed to incorporate an instruction that would have provided that evidence of reproduction or distribution of a copyrighted work,by itself,shall not be sufficient to establish willful infringement of a copyright.id.at alteration and internal quotation marks omitted.we reviewed the instructions de novo because the court failed to provide the defendant with an opportunity to object.id.at.
we held that willfully as used in a connotes a voluntary,intentional violation of a known legal duty.id.at quoting cheek,at.we noted that the key distinction between civil and criminal copyright liability is that civil liability requires the general intent to copy,whereas criminal liability requires the specific intent to violate the law.id.at.we accordingly found that the district court had erred and that the error was not harmless.id.at see also united states wise,cir suggesting that the government must prove an act intentionally done in violation of the law to establish willfulness.
thus,in order to satisfy the willfulness requirement,a defendant must have known that the copying was illegal.the parties do not seriously dispute this proposition.rather,anderson claims that the court instruction was erroneous because it indicated that anderson was guilty if he knew his actions may infringe the copyrights and m ore is required than just anderson knowing his actions may be illegal.model civil instruction for willful infringement.the commentary stated an infringement was willful when the defendant engaged in acts that infringed the copyright,and knew that those actions may infringe the copyright.ninth circuit manual of model civil jury instructions cmt.emphasis added.at the time of anderson prosecution,this commentary had been superseded by a new instruction that no longer used the word may.ninth circuit manual of model civil jury instructions.the commentary in the edition acknowledged that the earlier version suggested language for a willful infringement instruction that merely required that a defendant have knowledge that its actions may influence the plaintiff copyright.id.cmt.the government cited the edition of the manual but relied on the superseded language from the edition.it is unclear to us why the government based its proposed instruction on the older version of the instruction.
in general,a party is entitled to an instruction to help it prove its theory of the case united states heredia,cir en banc.this entitlement,however,is not unlimited.united states doe,cir.a district court may properly reject a misleading or confusing instruction.see hammer gross,f d,cir.in reviewing jury instructions,the relevant inquiry is whether the instructions as a whole are misleading or inadequate to guide the jury deliberation.united states chao fan xu,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
the district court rejected anderson proposed instruction because it sought to add additional elements and had the potential to create confusion.although each individual statement in anderson instruction had support in the case law,the combination of the statements was,at the very least,ineloquent and would have likely created confusion among persons without legal training.the district court reasonably distilled anderson proposed instruction to its fundamental point.
anderson real objection is to the use of the word may in the sentence of the instruction indicating that the government had to prove that he must have known that his actions may infringe the copyrights.he failed to object to this language and this failure was likely material given that the government agreed during the conference that it had to show that anderson knew he was infringing adobe copyright in order to establish willfulness.
the word may is vague and renders the first sentence of the instruction incorrect to the extent that it suggests that anderson could be convicted without knowing that he was violating adobe rights.indeed,it would not be enough for the government to show only that he knew that there was a possibility that his actions were illegal.nonetheless,error is only plain where it is clear and obvious.kilbride,at.the parties and the court did not perceive any issue with the phrasing of the sentence despite parsing the language very carefully.
notably,although the government did not pursue recklessness or willful blindness theories,those are valid theories for satisfying the intent element in this context.see.shoe a z sporting goods,cir.under those theories,the willfulness requirement is satisfied where there is a showing that the defendant recklessly disregarded the high probability that it was infringing plaintiffs copyrights.id.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.thus,the defendant actions could be willful even if the defendant only knew that the copying may be illegal but did not know that it was to a certainty.consequently,the instruction was arguably correct in that technical sense.nonetheless,we do not endorse the instruction,as without further explanation,it was imprecise at the very least.imprecision,however,is not the equivalent of clear and obvious error.
more significantly,when viewed in its entirety,the instruction was not misleading or inadequate.although the word may rendered the first half of the instruction vague,the last sentence explicitly required the jury to find that anderson knew his actions constituted copyright infringement for the jury to convict.indeed,this standard is arguably more stringent than what liu requires,as it required the jury to find that he specifically knew that his actions constituted copyright infringement in order to convict,rather than the more generalized knowledge that he was violating a legal duty this language materially distinguishes this case from liu,where the district court essentially instructed the jury that it could convict the defendant as long as it found that he had the general intent to copy.although the district court may have misspoken when reading the instruction to the jury,it directed the jury to the written copies of the instructions that were provided to the jury immediately before the jury announced that it had reached the verdict.
moreover,any error did not affect substantial rights or the fairness,integrity or public reputation of the proceedings.in context,it is apparent that there was no misunderstanding about the meaning of the instruction.the government referred to the last sentence of the instruction in its closing argument,asking did the defendant know that his actions constituted copyright infringement of course he knew.defense counsel also invoked the correct standard,stating that anderson must have known his actions constituted a copyright infringement in order for you to find he acted willfully.there was also overwhelming evidence that anderson acted with the requisite knowledge that his actions were unlawful,including his admissions that he a only resorted to selling unauthorized software after determining that he did not have the resources to pursue a legitimate deal with adobe b had been told by his customers that what he was doing was illegal,but continued to do it and c knew that his customers were not using the discs for backup purposes.
thus,evaluating the instructions as a whole,any error was neither clear and obvious nor substantial or prejudicial.consequently,the district court willfulness instruction did not constitute plain error.
prior to trial,anderson filed a motion in limine seeking to preclude the government from introducing uncharged but allegedly improper conduct,including evidence that morris purchased a copy of adobe fireworks from anderson and anderson possessed other discs containing adobe software.he argued that the evidence was not admissible under federal rule of evidence b as intrinsic evidence of the crime,and alternatively,that it should be excluded under rule.the district court denied the motion,finding that the evidence was intrinsic to anderson business model,completed an explanation of anderson conduct and business plan,and was not unfairly prejudicial.anderson contends that the district court erred we review a district court evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion and its interpretation of the federal rules of evidence de novo.united states waters,cir emphasis omitted.
other act evidence that is inextricably intertwined with a charged offense is independently admissible and is exempt from the requirements of rule b.united states dorsey,cir accord.b advisory committee notes stating that rule b requirements do not extend to evidence of acts which are intrinsic to the charged offense.such intrinsic evidence includes evidence constituting a part of the transaction that serves as the basis for the criminal charge.dorsey,at internal quotation marks omitted.we have found,for example,that contemporaneous uncharged drug transactions may be admissible on this basis.united states vizcarra martinez,cir.this is because rule b does not apply when offenses committed as part of a single criminal episode become other acts simply because the defendant is indicted for less than all of his actions.id.internal quotation marks omitted.a transaction that is far removed in time from the charged transaction,however,can not be considered a part of the charged transaction.see united states degeorge,cir.
intrinsic evidence,however,also includes evidence that is necessary to permit the prosecutor to offer a coherent and comprehensible story regarding the commission of the crime.dorsey,at alteration and internal quotation marks omitted.this is because t he jury can not be expected to make its decision in a void without knowledge of the time,place,and circumstances of the acts which form the basis of the charge.vizcarra martinez,at original alteration marks and quotation marks omitted.this includes circumstantial evidence explaining the general nature of a defendant business activity and providing a context in which the transactions at issue took place.united states king,cir.where the evidence,however,is not part of the charged transaction and the prosecution would encounter little difficulty in presenting the evidence relevant to its case against the defendant without it,the evidence is not admissible as being intrinsic to the charged offense.see id.
here,the fireworks sale,which occurred six months after the charged conduct took place,is arguably too far removed in time to constitute a part of the charged transaction nonetheless,the evidence of both the fireworks sale and the adobe programs that anderson possessed when he was arrested do help explain anderson business operations,including his manufacturing process.anderson argues that the government case was complete without this evidence and that it was unnecessary.however,the larger and more sophisticated his operation was,the more likely it was that he knew what he was doing was illegal.moreover,the fireworks sale also explained the circumstances leading up to his arrest,where the government obtained additional evidence that anderson is not disputing,including the blank discs,key generator disc,and disc.consequently,the evidence was intrinsic to the charged conduct in that it was reasonably necessary for the prosecution to tell a clear and comprehensible story.
a district court has discretion to exclude otherwise relevant evidence under rule if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice,confusion of the issues,or misleading the jury,or by considerations of undue delay,waste of time,or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.waters,at quoting.unfair prejudice is an undue tendency to suggest decision on an improper basis,commonly,though not necessarily,an emotional one.united states hankey,cir quoting.advisory committee note.the rule requires that the probative value of the evidence be compared to the articulated reasons for exclusion and permits exclusion only if one or more of those reasons substantially outweigh the probative value.id.
the evidence here was not unfairly prejudicial.it was very similar to the charged conduct.it was probative because it showed the scale of anderson operations and conduct.nonetheless,it was not particularly damning in light of all the other evidence directly relating to the charged conduct.consequently,any prejudice was fairly insignificant.moreover,it was not the type of bad act evidence that would suggest that the jury should decide the case on an improper emotional basis.unlike evidence of drug sales,for example,evidence of software sales does not have a strong prejudicial impact because there is nothing inherently wrong with selling software,which is usually sold legally.in any event,the district court did not abuse its discretion by finding that the evidence was not unfairly prejudicial.
the district court found that adobe was the victim of anderson crime and calculated restitution by multiplying the number of copies anderson sold by adobe retail price.anderson claims that the district court erred,arguing that the court should have a used the price he charged his customers because they were the real victims and adobe loss is speculative b used adobe lost profits instead of its retail price because lost profit is a more accurate measure of actual loss and c discounted the amount of restitution by the number of returns.we review the legality of a restitution order,including the district court valuation method,de novo.united states yeung,cir.we review the amount for abuse of discretion if the order is within the statutory bounds.id.internal quotation marks omitted.we review the district court factual findings supporting an order of restitution for clear error.id.
the presentence report recommended calculating the loss at at least,representing anderson total pricegrabber sales multiplied by the retail value of the authorized software.the loss calculation was relevant both to anderson sentencing guidelines calculation and the amount of restitution.anderson objected to using the retail value of adobe software as opposed to the price he charged and argued that he should receive credit for returns.the government agreed with the presentence report but eventually conceded that anderson should get credit for the returned software in the amount of anderson price.anderson counsel argued that any returns should be offset at adobe retail price if that was the price being used to set the amount of the loss.in response to anderson arguments,the probation officer noted that anderson conduct affected adobe in other ways,causing it to spend additional time on customer support and causing damage to its reputation.
the district court found that the loss amount exceeded,pursuant to the guidelines commentary,subjecting anderson to a sentencing enhancement under note a i.the court then imposed restitution in the amount of,specifically declining to offset the returns because the victim in this case is really adobe.
under the mandatory victims restitution act mvra,a court must order a defendant to make restitution to a victim of certain specified offenses without considering the defendant economic circumstances.yeung,at.the mvra defines the word victim as a person directly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of an offense for which restitution may be ordered.id.quoting a.the goal of restitution under the mvra is to make the victim whole.id.at.consequently,any award is limited to the victim actual losses.united states fu sheng kuo,cir.accordingly,the district court may not order restitution to reflect defendants gains.id.at.the government has the burden of proving the amount of the loss by a preponderance of the evidence.yeung,at citing e.
we may uphold a restitution order where the district court fails to make pertinent factual findings when the basis of the district court calculations is clear.id.at.indeed,the mvra affords the district court a degree of flexibility in assessing the victim actual losses nonetheless,the district court may utilize only evidence that possesses sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy.united states waknine,cir alteration and quotation marks omitted.additionally,a district court should not rely on its calculation of the loss under the sentencing guidelines to determine the amount of restitution as the two measures serve different purposes and utilize different calculation methods.united states gossi,cir sentencing,unlike restitution,focuses on the criminal defendant restitution clearly focuses on the victim,not the individual defendant.r emand is appropriate where the restitution award lacks an adequate evidentiary basis and the district court failed to explain its reasoning.yeung,at.
anderson relies on united states chalupnik,cir.in that case,the defendant was a post office janitor who had taken thousands of undeliverable cds and dvds originally sent by bmg and sold them to used record stores.id.at.the district court imposed restitution in the amount of the defendant gross revenues.id.at.the eighth circuit agreed that bmg could be a victim even though it was not the owner of the copyrights and might not be able to sue the defendant for copyright infringement.id.at.however,the court rejected district court use of the defendant gains as the measure for bmg loss because any loss was suffered by the market of retailers,in addition to bmg and the copyright owners.id.at.the court also noted that for goods held by a merchant for sale,lost profits rather than lost sales revenues are the proper measure of actual loss.id.at.moreover,the court stated that any calculation of lost sales or lost profits may not be based entirely upon speculation.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
the parties also cite the circuit recent decision in united states fair.like the present case,fair involved a defendant who was convicted of selling illegal copies of adobe software.id.at.the district court ordered the defendant to pay restitution corresponding to his infringing sales.id.at.reviewing the case law,the circuit explained 
in cases involving copyright infringement and fraudulent sales,the victim actual loss typically equates to the profit the victim lost on the sales that were diverted from the victim as a result of the defendant infringing sales.under this on theory,the government must offer sufficient evidence to establish both the profit margin per sale and the number of sales lost.if the record does not demonstrate that the counterfeit goods ever reached the market,or that their introduction to the market in fact thwarted actual
