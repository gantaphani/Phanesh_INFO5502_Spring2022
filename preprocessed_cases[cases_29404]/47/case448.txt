introduction 
gene jacobsen was a prisoner of war in the philippines and japan during world war ii.after returning from military service,jacobsen wrote his personal memoir entitled who refused to die.in gripping detail,who refused to die recounts jacobsen survival of the bataan death march and subsequent years of imprisonment and torture in various work camps.
in,deseret book company deseret book published the first of a series written by dean hughes entitled children of the promise the series is a fictional work written primarily for members of the church of jesus christ of saints.it portrays a saint family life during world war ii.the story of wally thomas,one of the family sons,closely follows jacobsen experiences as related in who refused to die.
in,jacobsen filed a complaint against hughes and deseret book seeking an injunction and damages for copyright infringement under and.after nearly a year of discovery,deseret book filed a motion asking the district court to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b and award deseret book attorney fees.hughes joined deseret book rule b motion and filed a motion for summary judgment on several affirmative defenses.the district court granted the rule b motion,granted summary judgment on the affirmative defense of laches,and denied the request for attorney fees.
on appeal,jacobsen challenges the district court dismissal of his complaint pursuant to.b as well as the court granting summary judgment on the affirmative defense of laches.jacobsen also appeals the district court refusal to strike defendants expert reports or allow jacobsen additional time to designate expert witnesses.hughes and deseret book filed a seeking attorney fees.we exercise jurisdiction under and reverse the b dismissal,the grant of summary judgment on laches,and the refusal to strike the expert reports.both jacobsen request for additional time to designate experts and hughes and deseret book request for attorney fees are moot.
ii.motion to dismiss 
jacobsen argues the district court erred in granting hughes and deseret books motion to dismiss we review a dismissal under rule b de novo.wark united states,cir.our function on a rule b motion is not to weigh potential evidence that the parties might present at trial,but to assess whether the plaintiff complaint alone is legally sufficient to state a claim for which relief may be granted.sutton utah state sch.for the deaf blind,cir quoting miller glanz,cir.
in addition to the complaint,the district court may consider documents referred to in the complaint if the documents are central to the plaintiff claim and the parties do not dispute the documents authenticity.see gff associated wholesale grocers,cir.because jacobsen complaint referred to who refused to die and the children of the promise series,and all the parties invited the district court to consider these works,the district court properly considered the work in ruling on the b motion see lewis kroger,at considering original and allegedly copied material in ruling on b motion.when a district court considers the original work and the allegedly copyrighted work in deciding a b motion,the legal effect of the works are determined by the works themselves rather than by allegations in the complaint.see droppleman horsley,cir holding the legal effect of an incorporated document considered on a motion to dismiss is to be determined by the document terms rather than by the allegations of the pleader in the complaint quoting zeligson,cir.
we can not affirm the dismissal for failure to state a claim unless,after considering the complaint,who refused to die,and the children of the promise series in the light most favorable to jacobsen,it appears beyond doubt jacobsen can prove no set of facts in support of his claim that would entitle him to relief.stidham peace officer standards training,cir.to establish copyright infringement,jacobsen must prove ownership of a valid copyright and copying of constituent elements of the work that are original.transwestern publ g,multimedia mktg,cir quoting feist publ ns,rural.serv,d.the complaint clearly alleges jacobsen has a federally registered copyright for who refused to die.thus,we need only determine whether the complaint and incorporated documents are sufficient to allege hughes and deseret book copied who refused to die.
whether hughes and deseret book copied who refused to die involves two distinct inquiries first,whether hughes,as a factual matter,copied jacobsen work,and second,whether,as a mixed issue of fact and law,those elements that were copied were protected.country kids n city slicks,sheen,cir.after reviewing the complaint and incorporated documents,we are satisfied jacobsen could present evidence showing hughes copied many of the experiences jacobsen recorded in who refused to die.the difficulty in this case arises in determining whether hughes copied only unprotected facts or instead impermissibly copied jacobsen original expression.
it is well settled no author may copyright facts or ideas.harper row,publishers,nation,d.thus,the copyright of a nonfiction work protects only those aspects of the expression that display the stamp of the author originality.id.see also feist,at.c opyright protection may extend only to those components of a work that are original to the author.a copyright does not prevent subsequent users from copying from a prior author work those constituent elements that are not example facts,or materials in the public long as such use does not unfairly appropriate the author original contributions.harper row,at.quotation marks and citations omitted.
in order to prove copying of legally protectible material,a plaintiff must typically show substantial similarity between legally protectible elements of the original work and the allegedly infringing work.country kids n city slicks,at.this is primarily a qualitative rather than a purely quantitative analysis,and must be performed on a basis.gates rubber bando chem,cir citation and footnote omitted to decide whether two works are substantially similar we ask whether the accused work is so similar to the plaintiff work that an ordinary reasonable person would conclude that the defendant unlawfully appropriated the plaintiff protectible expression by taking material of substance and value.country kids n city slicks,at quoting atari,north am.philips consumer elecs,cir.determining whether there is substantial similarity in cases involving works is particularly difficult.
t he measure of how substantial a substantial similarity must be may vary according to circumstances.for many copyrights represent significant creative effort,and are therefore reasonably robust,whereas others reflect only scant creativity the supreme court labels the latter thin.it would seem to follow analytically that more similarity is required when less protectible matter is at issue.thus,if substantial similarity is the normal measure required to demonstrate infringement,supersubstantial similarity must pertain when dealing with thin works.
melville nimmer david nimmer,nimmer on copyright a,at hereinafter nimmer.see also transwestern,at relying on nimmer supersubstantial similarity analysis.because n o easy rule of thumb can be stated as to the quantum of fragmented literal similarity permitted without crossing the line of substantial similarity,whether works are substantially similar is a classic jury question.nimmer,supra,a,at and.king of the mountain sports,chrysler,cir holding the trier of fact should normally make the determination of similarity in a trademark infringement case,but the court can monitor the outer limits of similarity if reasonable minds could not differ on the question.in applying these principles to jacobsen appeal,we first distinguish the supersubstantial similarity analysis relied on by the district court.then,we compare who refused to die and the children of the promise series addressing precedent relied upon by hughes and deseret book.
in ruling on the motion to dismiss,the district court found hughes copied some facts from jacobsen memoir,but not significant original expression.relying on feist publications,rural telephone service,d and transwestern publishing multimedia marketing associates,cir,two cases involving copied telephone directories,the district court applied a supersubstantial similarity test rather than the substantial similarity requirement traditionally applied in copyright infringement cases.the court noted several differences between who refused to die and the character wally in the children of the promise series.
much of the children of the promise series deals with spiritual matters and a sic most of the volumes are devoted to wally large and extended family.jacobson sic memoir,on the other hand,does not emphasize spiritual matters except in passing further,the memoir deals only with jacobsen experiences in a limited matter and does not expand much over time and geography as do hughes novels.it is clear to this court that wally is not gene jacobsen.
consequently,the district court concluded under the supersubstantial similarity test it is clear that hughes did not copy any protectable aspects of the memoir.
we disagree.first,we conclude the district court gave undue weight to language in feist and transwestern incorrectly applying a supersubstantial similarity test in evaluating whether hughes and deseret book copied protected elements of who refused to die.in feist,the supreme court held the copyright in a factual compilation is thin.feist,at.in transwestern,we stated if substantial similarity is the normal measure required to demonstrate infringement,supersubstantial similarity must pertain when dealing with thin works.transwestern,at quoting nimmer,supra,a,at.the district court seized this language and applied what it called the tenth circuit supersubstantial similarity test.we do not read transwestern so broadly as to require us to apply a supersubstantial similarity test to all works.rather transwestern merely reaffirmed the measure of how substantial a substantial similarity must be may vary according to circumstances.nimmer,supra,a,at.because works differ as to the relative proportion of fact and fancy,harper row,at,the quantum of similarity required to establish infringement differs in each case.merely applying a supersubstantial similarity test to all works would ignore the differences between sparsely embellished maps and directories and elegantly written biography.id.in short,who refused to die involves more creative effort and original expression than the telephone directories at issue in feist and transwestern.therefore,jacobsen could prove substantial similarity with less similarity than we would require if the allegedly infringed work were a telephone directory 
second,although the district court catalogue of differences between who refused to die and the children of the promise series is accurate,it is largely irrelevant.we realize the children of the promise series contains much material not taken from the who refused to die.however,a taking may not be excused merely because it is insubstantial with respect to the infringing work.as judge learned hand cogently remarked,no plagiarist can excuse the wrong by showing how much of his work he did not pirate.harper row,at.quoting sheldon pictures,cir.the question in each case is whether the similarity relates to matter that constitutes a substantial portion of plaintiff whether such material constitutes a substantial portion of defendant work.nimmer,supra,a,at.thus we are not concerned with whether the copied material is a substantial part of the children of the promise series.rather,we must consider whether hughes and deseret book copied a substantial portion of who refused to die.
with these clarifications in mind,we next compare who refused to die and the children of the promise series.it is clear hughes copied much of the plot line for wally thomas from who refused to die.as we need not weigh the evidence,we make no attempt to compile an exhaustive list of protectible material a jury could find to have been copied.suffice it to say the similarity goes beyond the bare facts that both works describe a world war ii army air corps supply sergeant who was captured by the japanese,forced to march across the bataan peninsula,and imprisoned in various work camps.both works tell how japanese planes bombed an air field just as a soldier was delivering cigars both describe a japanese officer anguish after he discovered an american prisoner of war serving on a work detail accidentally pulled up baby carrot plants both recount the humiliation the protagonist felt when guards assigned him to the honey detail and required him to empty their outhouses in some instances,the copying goes beyond close paraphrasing and reproduces jacobsen words exactly.consider the following example.the first paragraph is jacobsen description of his journey to unite with american troops after the war ended.the second is hughes description of the same event in the fictional life of wally thomas.
approaching the sailors the second time,one of the fellows drove his souvenir sword into the deck of the ship and said somewhat fiercely,listen you guys general macarthur said that we had the authority to use any means of transportation necessary to get out of japan,and this boat is necessary for us to reach american troops.we are going to get across this bay with you or without you.if you want to take us across and get paid for your troubles,fine.if you do,get off the ship,and we take ourselves across 
jacobsen,supra,at emphasis added.
this time it was potts who walked on ahead.he was carrying a souvenir sword of his own.when he stepped onto the deck,he shouted,we need to talk,and he slammed his sword into the deck,sticking it up by its point listen to me you guys,potts went on.general douglas macarthur has authorized us to use any means we find necessary to reach american troops.we re going to cross this bay with you or without you.if you want to take us across and get paid for your troubles,fine.if you do,get off the ship,and we take her across ourselves.
dean hughes,children of the promise when we meet again emphasis added.
hughes and deseret book do not believe these and other passages reveal copying.they argue hughes never copied who refused to die verbatim.he retold the factual events in his own words and style,and he placed them in a fictional context of his own creation.we disagree.hughes and deseret book never directly address why the preceding example and others do not amount to verbatim copying.instead,they cite several cases suggesting some verbatim copying is permissible.see narell freeman,cir suid newsweek magazine,alexander haley,norman columbia broad.we conclude these cases are inapplicable to the case before us.
narell,alexander,and norman are distinguishable because those cases involved verbatim copying of only a few words and phrases.see narell,at alexander.at norman.at.for example,in narell the court held there was no copyright infringement when the verbatim copying amounted to a few descriptive phrases like cow path and hordes of gold seekers.narell,at.indeed,the above cited example from the children of the promise series reveals hughes and deseret book arguably copied more than a few words and phrases.
suid is also inapplicable.in suid,the court held t he author of a factual work may not claim copyright in statements made by others and reported in the work since the author may not claim originality as to those statements.suid.at.we acknowledge the words contained in both paragraphs of the example were enclosed in quotation marks.we agree quotations may be freely copied if the quotation is recorded contemporaneously or taken directly from a written source as in suid.jacobsen did not,however,contemporaneously record the quotations or copy them from a written source.for this reason,a trier of fact might conclude the material in quotation marks in who refused to die was original expression rather than the actual words used.jacobsen may have enclosed the material in quotations merely to allow him to speak in the voice of a third party while recording his story.because the issue of whether the dialogue in who refused to die is original expression or fact turns,at least in part,on additional evidence to be presented at trial,the question should be determined by the trier of fact rather than the court.
the supreme court decision in harper row publishers,nation enterprises,d,is particularly instructive on the issue of verbatim copying.in harper row,the supreme court upheld a district court finding of copyright infringement.id.at.harper row owned the copyright to president ford unpublished memoir.id.at.prior to publication of the memoir,a magazine obtained a copy of the memoir and published an article including verbatim quotes from the memoir.id.at.the supreme court held even though president ford memoir was a factual work,the magazine verbatim copying of the memoir appropriated original expression and amounted to copyright infringement.id.at.likewise,when viewed in the light most favorable to jacobsen,the children of the promise series contains passages arguably copied verbatim from who refused to die.because harper row establishes verbatim copying from a memoir appropriates the author original expression,we could only uphold the district court dismissal if the copying were so minor as to be beyond the outer limits of substantial similarity.we conclude the copying is not so minor as to remove the substantial similarity decision from the domain of the trier of fact.
because we hold the children of the promise series contains enough material for a trier of fact to find verbatim copying,we need not address whether close paraphrasing of an historical work is sufficient to establish a copyright violation see id.at.we acknowledge the supreme court has not settled this issue.however,the second circuit has held close paraphrasing of unpublished letter in an historical biography violated copyright law.salinger random house,cir.nothing in our opinion would preclude the tenth circuit from adopting the second circuit approach in the future.
in conclusion,when viewing the complaint,the children of the promise series,and who refused to die in the light most favorable to jacobsen,we conclude jacobsen could prove a set of facts entitling him to relief.portions of the children of the promise series could be seen as verbatim copying of jacobsen original expression.these instances are numerous enough to allow a jury to determine whether the works are substantially similar.we,therefore,reverse the district court ruling on the b motion.
iii.laches 
next,we address whether the district court correctly granted summary judgment after determining jacobsen claims were barred by laches.because there are disputes as to material facts,we hold the district court erred in granting summary judgment on the laches issue.
as an initial matter,we must determine the appropriate standard for reviewing the district court decision.jacobsen argues we should apply a de novo standard.in contrast,hughes advocates an abuse of discretion standard.we have used the abuse of discretion standard to review a district court application of the laches defense after a bench trial.mile high indus.cohen,cir jicarilla apache tribe andrus,cir.however,when a district court applies the laches doctrine to dismiss a claim on summary judgment,we review the district court decision de novo.hutchinson pfeil,cir,cert.denied,d.in keeping with tenth circuit precedent,we apply de novo review in this case 
summary judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.hutchinson,at.in determining whether the defendant is entitled to summary judgment,we view all facts and reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.id.citing anderson liberty lobby,d.
in order to prove the affirmative defense of laches,the defendant must demonstrate that there has been an unreasonable delay in asserting the claim and that the defendant was materially prejudiced by that delay.hutchinson,at.generally speaking,the relevant delay is the period from when the plaintiff knew or should have known of the allegedly infringing conduct,until the initiation of the lawsuit in which the defendant seeks to counterpoise the laches defense.danjaq llc sony,cir.
in granting hughes summary judgment motion,the district court noted the facts in this matter are highly disputed however the facts regarding laches are to be determined by the court.the district court then found jacobsen had knowledge of the material used by hughes as early as and no later than.in addition,the court found jacobsen had ample opportunity to let hughes know of his disapproval as early but instead delayed in bringing his claim until causing extreme prejudice to hughes.consequently,the district court concluded jacobsen claims were barred by laches.
we disagree with the district court conclusion summary judgment was appropriate on the issue of laches.although a district court can make factual findings related to laches after a bench trial,mile high,at,the court should not make factual findings when addressing a summary judgment motion based on laches,hutchinson,at.rather than deferring to district court finding of fact,we view the record in the light most favorable to jacobsen.id.when viewing the record in this light,we find disputes of material facts.if jacobsen version of the facts are accepted,hughes is not entitled to summary judgment on the laches defense.
both parties agree jacobsen and hughes first met in.as the district court found,what happened at the meeting and thereafter is heavily disputed by the parties.in his deposition,jacobsen testified hughes was interested in gathering background information on the war in the pacific for use in writing a series of fictional books.because he thought it would be useful as background information,jacobsen gave hughes a copy of who refused to die.if this is accepted as true,we can not see how this meeting could have alerted jacobsen to the possibility hughes would use who refused to die in such a way as to raise copyright concerns.
jacobsen next contact with hughes occurred in march.the parties agree hughes mailed jacobsen a copy of a portion of the manuscript for the first book in the children of the promise series.the exact content of the material hughes sent is disputed.hughes contends the material should have put jacobsen on notice of the nature of his use of who refused to die.jacobsen argues he did not receive all of the material hughes claims to have sent.jacobsen testified the materials did not include excerpts containing stories from who refused to die.although jacobsen admitted he only skimmed the material,he testified he read the material carefully enough to identify any familiar stories.again,if jacobsen version of the facts are accepted,we can not conclude jacobsen knew or should have known about potential copyright claims in.
hughes argues even if we fully credit jacobsen testimony that he did not know exactly how who refused to die was being used,he indisputably should have known,if that issue was of any concern to him at all.emphasis in original.he suggests jacobsen should have asked questions to ensure hughes would not violate jacobsen copyright.while jacobsen was expected to exercise reasonable diligence in protecting his rights,jicarilla apache tribe,at,laches should not be applied if jacobsen was justifiably ignorant of the facts creating his cause of action,lawson haynes,cir.we can not conclude jacobsen had a responsibility to inquire into hughes use of who refused to die absent any reason to suspect hughes was using who refused to die in an inappropriate way.see west american.upholding a district court rejection of laches defense even though the plaintiff did not conduct an inquiry to reveal unlawful conduct because there was no evidence suggesting the plaintiff had reason for suspicion 
next,hughes argues jacobsen should have discovered the nature of hughes use of who refused to die when the first volume of the children of the promise series was published in march.because the district court relied on its factual determination that jacobsen should have known about hughes use of who refused to die by,the court did not consider whether laches would apply if the publication of the first volume was jacobsen first opportunity to discover his claims.we consider this argument because we can affirm for any reason supported by the record but not relied on by the district court.hayes whitman,cir.nevertheless,we conclude hughes argument is without merit.
even if we assume the publication of the first volume of the children of the promise series should have immediately alerted jacobsen to his potential copyright claims,we can not conclude jacobsen claims are barred by laches.jacobsen filed suit against hughes and deseret book within three years of the publication of the first volume of the children of the promise series.rather than deciding copyright cases on the issue of laches,courts should generally defer to the statute of limitations,b,provided by the copyright act.
because laches is a judicially created equitable doctrine,whereas statutes of limitations are legislative enactments,it has been observed that in deference to the doctrine of the separation of powers,the supreme court has been circumspect in adopting principles of equity in the context of enforcing federal statutes.accordingly,when a limitation on the period for bringing suit has been set by statute,laches will generally not be invoked to shorten the statutory period.
united states,cir quotation marks,citations,and alterations omitted.see also lyons,morris costumes,cir holding separation of powers principles dictate that an equitable timeliness rule adopted by courts can not bar claims that are brought within the legislatively prescribed statute of limitations in the copyright act.although it is possible,in rare cases,that a statute of limitations can be cut short by the doctrine of laches,at,we see no reason to supplant the statute of limitations in this case.
in arguing laches should be applied in this case,hughes directs us to jackson axton,cir,overruled on other grounds by fogerty fantasy,d.although jackson held a court can apply laches in a copyright case,the facts in jackson are different from the facts before us.in jackson,the plaintiff knew of his claim by but did not file suit until.at.given the prolonged delay,the ninth circuit held laches was applicable.id.at.see also danjaq,at,upholding a district court application of laches to prevent a plaintiff from pursuing copyright infringement claims when plaintiff filed suit at least more likely,years after having knowledge of the potential claims.in contrast,jacobsen filed suit less than three years after publication of the first volume.it does not seem unreasonable to allow jacobsen three years from the time he should have known of his claim to evaluate the viability of instituting a lawsuit or pursue remedies.new era publ ns int l henry holt,cir holding laches did not bar copyright holders claims for damages when plaintiff learned of alleged infringement two years prior to bringing suit.consequently,we defer to the copyright act statute of limitations in this case.
when viewing the record in the light most favorable to jacobsen,we conclude his delay in filing suit was reasonable.consequently we need not address whether hughes was materially prejudiced by the delay.we reverse the district court ruling on the summary judgment motion and remand for further proceedings.
iv.discovery issues 
next,jacobsen argues t he district court erred in denying jacobsen motion for additional time to file rebuttal expert reports or in the alternative to strike defendant expert reports and designations.we conclude the district court abused its discretion in refusing to strike the expert reports.
on august,hughes and deseret book filed the reports of four expert witnesses,marilyn lashner,merrill norman,paul rawlins,and allan wittman,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure a.hughes and deseret book offered the expert reports to establish the bulk of the profits from the children of the promise series are attributable to their work rather than jacobsen work.
rule a requires expert reports contain a complete statement of all opinions to be expressed.a b.a party is under a continuing duty to supplement the expert report if there are additions or changes to what has been previously disclosed.a c,e.a party that without substantial justification fails to disclose information required by rule a is not,unless such failure is harmless,permitted to use as evidence at a trial any information not so disclosed.c.arguing the expert reports were not complete,jacobsen filed a motion asking the district court to postpone his deadline for filing rebuttal reports until after the defendant expert reports were complete,or,in the alternative,strike the defendant expert reports.
after a hearing on this issue,the district court denied jacobsen motion.it first noted jacobsen was given the opportunity to submit his own expert reports to substantiate his claim of copyright infringement.jacobsen did not submit expert reports because he believes he can establish copying through hughes own admissions.the district court then reasoned jacobsen was fully aware that the burden regarding damages is the defendants burden,and should not have been surprised that defendants did choose to rely on expert testimony in order to prove that profits were derived from material other than the allegedly copyrighted material.consequently,the court concluded jacobsen had the same opportunity to provide expert witnesses as hughes and deseret book and should not now be given an opportunity to file late reports or strike defendants timely reports.although the district court stated it had considered the law relevant to jacobsen motion,it did not mention rule a or rule c.
in responding to jacobsen appeal,hughes and deseret book do not argue their expert reports were complete.instead,they claim the expert reports could not be complete because jacobsen never identified the alleged infringement with specificity.because jacobsen never provided a analysis to show which portions of the children of the promise series were copied,hughes and deseret book contend the expert reports were necessarily incomplete.their experts could only tell what method they would use to calculate the profits attributable to hughes and deseret book when they later issue their final opinions.in addition,hughes and deseret book argue the district court was within its discretion in refusing to grant jacobsen additional time to file rebuttal expert reports.they believe allowing jacobsen more time to file rebuttal expert reports would have meant abandoning the trial date,which was set for january.finally,hughes and deseret book assert the incomplete reports did not preclude jacobsen from filing rebuttal reports because jacobsen could have submitted rebuttal expert reports with the same level of generality as the incomplete reports.
because the district court did not find the expert reports complied with rule a,and hughes and deseret book acknowledge the reports were preliminary and incomplete,we turn directly to the issue of whether rule c nevertheless allows the district court to allow the experts to testify on the basis of the incomplete reports.see in re tmi litigation cases,holding preliminary expert reports do not satisfy rule a smith state farm fire cas,same.rule c permits a district court to refuse to strike expert reports and allow expert testimony even when the expert report violates rule a if the violation is justified or harmless.c.the determination of whether a rule a violation is justified or harmless is entrusted to the broad discretion of the district court.woodworker supply,principal mut.life ins,cir.nevertheless,we can hold the district court abused its discretion if the decision is based on an erroneous conclusion of law,kiowa indian tribe hoover,cir,or would result in fundamental unfairness in the trial of the case,orjias stevenson,cir,cert.denied,d.
although a district court can allow evidence violating rule a only if the violation was justified or harmless,jones lincoln,cir,a district court need not make explicit findings concerning the existence of a substantial justification or the harmlessness of a rule a violation,woodworker supply,at.neverth
