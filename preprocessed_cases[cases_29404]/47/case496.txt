factual and procedural background 
the single song contracts 
terry gilkyson,a successful songwriter in the and and a member of the band the easy riders,wrote the bare necessities and several other songs for the popular animated film the jungle book,which was first released in several years prior to the film release,gilkyson signed contracts with disney,walt disney productions,that deemed it the author of the songs and the owner of the copyright and obligated it to pay gilkyson an initial fee of for each song he wrote for the film,as well as specified royalties for sales of sheet music and for licensing or other disposition of the mechanical reproduction rights.the contract expressly excluded from that royalty obligation disney use of the songs in motion pictures,photoplays,books,merchandising,television,radio and endeavors of the same or similar nature.
pursuant to those contracts disney paid gilkyson over the years and,after his death in,his heirs royalties for sheet music and for audio reproductions of gilkyson songs vinyl records,compact discs cds and digital downloads.however,disney did not pay,and has never paid,gilkyson or his heirs royalties for the use of his songs in any audiovisual medium,including digital video disc recordings dvds.
this lawsuit 
on november,the gilkyson heirs sued disney for breach of contract and several related claims alleging disney had breached its contractual obligation to pay the gilkyson heirs royalties in connection with the use of gilkyson songs on videocassette recordings vhs tapes and dvds.in their original complaint the gilkyson heirs alleged the dvd version of the jungle book released by disney in included the bare necessities and additional songs that gilkyson had written for the film but that had never before been released.although disney sold approximately four million dvds containing gilkyson songs and received substantial profits,the complaint alleged it had failed to pay the gilkyson heirs any royalty in connection with those sales.the gilkyson heirs also alleged disney failed to pay any royalties in connection with vhs tapes containing the bare necessities,which were released some time prior to.
disney demurred to the complaint.while insisting its contractual obligation to pay mechanical reproduction royalties excluded use of gilkyson songs in any audiovisual medium,for purposes of its demurrer it confined its arguments to claiming each cause of action was under the applicable statutes of limitations.in particular,emphasizing the allegation the dvds had been released in,disney argued the gilkyson heirs claim for breach of written contract accrued no later than,thus making the claim,filed in november,untimely under the governing statute of limitations.in addition,the release of vhs tapes had occurred decades prior to.accordingly,disney argued any claim for failure to pay royalties accrued at the first breach of contract in the,leaving all claims.
the gilkyson heirs opposed the demurrer,arguing their claims were timely in their entirety under the continuing violation doctrine or,at a minimum,timely as to the claims for royalties due within the four years prior to their filing of the lawsuit in november pursuant to the continuous accrual doctrine explained in aryeh canon business solutions,cal th aryeh.
the trial court sustained disney demurrer,observing the claim for royalties began to accrue in when the vhs tapes of the jungle book were originally released and,at the latest,by december,when,by the gilkyson heirs own admission,the dvds were released.under either scenario,the court ruled,the gilkyson heirs claims were barred by the statute of limitations for written contracts.the court granted the gilkyson heirs leave to amend.
on april,the gilkyson heirs filed a first amended complaint asserting claims for breach of contract,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and declaratory relief.the amended complaint contained substantially similar allegations as the original complaint with a few exceptions.the amended complaint added the allegation that disney had released the jungle book in and the jungle book on format,digital download format and dvd in.although each of these products included gilkyson songs,disney failed to pay,and did not intend to pay in the future,the gilkyson heirs any royalties in connection with its sales of those products.the amended complaint,in contrast to the original,omitted any reference to the release of the jungle book in vhs format.
the trial court sustained disney demurrer to the first amended complaint,this time without leave to amend,ruling the omission of allegations relating to the release of the film in vhs format was a sham pleading intended to avoid the limitations bar.in any event,the gilkyson heirs claims asserted in the first amended complaint accrued no later than with the first release of dvds and thus their claim for royalties,filed well after the expiration of the statute of limitations applicable to written contracts,was.the court rejected the gilkyson heirs contention the continuous accrual doctrine rendered their claims timely for breaches within the four years preceding the filing of their complaint.

the court erred in sustaining the demurrer to the first amended complaint 
a.the bar and the continuous accrual doctrine 
the statute of limitations,a legislatively prescribed time period to bring a cause of action,exists to promote the diligent assertion of the claim,ensure defendants the opportunity to collect evidence while still fresh,and provide repose and protection from dilatory suits once excess time has passed.aryeh,supra,cal th at accord,shively bozanich cal th.for breach of a written contract,that period is four years from the time the claim accrues.traditionally,a claim accrues when it is complete with all of its elements those elements being wrongdoing or breach,harm,and causation.aryeh,at accord,howard jarvis taxpayers city of la habra cal th,howard jarvis statute of limitations runs from occurrence of the last element essential to the cause of action.however,there are several recognized exceptions to this legislative,among them,the continuous accrual doctrine.
under the continuous accrual doctrine each breach of a recurring obligation is independently actionable.aryeh,supra,cal th at w hen an obligation or liability arises on a recurring basis,a cause of action accrues each time a wrongful act occurs,triggering a new limitations period see ibid.b ecause each new breach of such an obligation provides all the elements of a claim wrongdoing,harm,and causation citations each may be treated as an independently actionable wrong with its own time limit for recovery howard jarvis,supra,cal th at same armstrong petroleum tri valley oil gas th,armstrong continuous accrual applies to contract where performance is severed into intervals,such as installment contracts,leases with periodic rental payments and periodic pension payments wells fargo bank bank of america th,fn.a new breach occurs each month the bank persists in its refusal to pay monthly rent at the gold clause rate.the effect of the doctrine is that a suit for relief may be partially as to older events but timely as to those acts of wrongdoing occurring within the applicable limitations period.aryeh,at accord,howard jarvis,at.in this way,the doctrine represents an equitable response to the inequities that would arise if the expiration of the limitations period following a first breach of duty or instance of misconduct were treated as sufficient to bar suit for any subsequent breach of misconduct absent the doctrine,parties engaged in misfeasance would thereby obtain immunity in perpetuity from suit even for recent and ongoing misfeasance.in addition,where misfeasance is ongoing,a defendant claim to repose,the principal justification underlying the limitations defense,is vitiated.aryeh,at.
b.the continuous accrual doctrine applies to the gilkyson heirs contract claims 
the supreme court most recently explained the proper use of the continuous accrual doctrine in aryeh,supra,cal th.there,plaintiff had leased copy machines from canon business solutions pursuant to a lease entered in.under the terms of the lease plaintiff was to pay a fixed monthly rent for each copier,subject to a maximum copy allowance.copies in excess of the monthly allowance required payment of an additional per copy charge.after entering the lease,plaintiff noticed discrepancies between the number of copies it had made and the meter readings taken by canon.ultimately plaintiff concluded canon had counted against plaintiff copy allowance copies made during canon periodic service visits,causing plaintiff to exceed the allowance and incur additional charges.in january plaintiff sued canon alleging a single claim for an unlawful or unfair business practice in violation of the unfair competition law ucl bus,et canon demurred,arguing the claim had accrued in at the first violation of the ucl as alleged in the complaint,making the complaint,filed six years later.the trial court agreed and sustained the demurer without leave to amend.aryeh,at.
the supreme court rejected canon argument the ucl claim was,explaining canon obligation to charge properly for its goods and services under the lease agreement was a recurring one plaintiff has alleged a recurring unfair act the inclusion in monthly bills of charges for copies canon itself made.the theory of continuous accrual applies to such allegations,and insofar as the operative complaint alleges at least some such acts within the four years preceding suit,the suit is not entirely.aryeh,supra,cal th at accord,howard jarvis,supra,cal th at plaintiff action alleging ongoing violation of tax ordinance not each illegal collection of tax was a new violation triggering a new limitations period.
here,as in aryeh,disney obligation to pay royalties based on its licensing or other disposition of the mechanical reproduction rights to gilkyson songs was unquestionably a continuing one as alleged in the first amended complaint consistent with the original complaint,the parties agreed in paragraph of the agreements that gilkyson will receive as a royalty an amount of money equal to fifty percent of the net amount received by our music publisher on account of licensing or other disposition of mechanical reproduction rights in and to material so written by you.the first amended complaint also alleged disney had issued quarterly royalty statements to gilkyson and,after his death,to his heirs.the continuing nature of the obligation to pay periodic royalties renders each breach of that obligation separately actionable.aryeh,supra,cal th at see armstrong,supra,th at contract to provide periodic oil and gas royalties was severable,with each failure of the continuing obligation to pay a proper royalty separately actionable and subject to its own limitation period.the result is that,while portions of the gilkyson heirs contract claim are undoubtedly,the action is timely as to those breaches occurring within the limitations period preceding the filing of the original lawsuit.
citing dillon board of pension commrs.cal d dillon,disney argues the continuous accrual doctrine does not apply in this case and this action is in its entirety because the gilkyson heirs seek to establish in this lawsuit the existence of a new contract right that is,the right to royalties on audiovisual reproductions of gilkyson songs.disney reliance on dillon is misplaced.
in dillon the widow of a los angeles police officer who had committed suicide in applied in to the board of pension commissioners to recover a pension.at the time of her application,the city charter required such claims to be filed within six months of accrual and,if the board denied the claim,the applicant had three years from the date the claim accrued to file a petition for administrative mandate to reverse that decision.the supreme court held the claim accrued when the officer died,and the mandate action,filed more than three years after his death,was in its entirety.although the court recognized the right to receive periodic payments under a pension was a continuing one,it held plaintiff could not claim entitlement to periodic pension payments until she first established her right to the pension with the board or,if the board had denied her claim,with a timely writ of mandate that overturned its decision.having failed to bring a timely petition for writ of mandate challenging the board finding she was not entitled to a pension,she could not claim a continuing right to a pension.dillon,supra,cal d at.
the supreme court later explained dillon holding was limited to the unique claims procedure available in pension cases see howard jarvis,supra,cal th at and rejected the contention,similar to the one disney asserts here,that a party must always first establish a continuing right before it may utilize the continuous accrual doctrine.in howard jarvis plaintiffs,three taxpayer advocacy groups and three individual taxpayers,challenged a city tax ordinance,arguing the ordinance unlawfully permitted collection of taxes without voter approval in violation of state law.the city of la habra demurred,asserting the claim had accrued within three years of the date the ordinance was enacted and plaintiffs claim,filed after that deadline,was.plaintiffs countered the right to a refund of taxes paid was a continuing one,triggering a new limitations period each time a tax was collected.the supreme court agreed plaintiffs claim was timely under the continuous accrual doctrine and distinguished dillon in dillon we held a mandamus action to compel payment of a widow pension was barred because it was not brought within three years of her husband death,even though,as we acknowledged,the right to receive a pension is a continuing one.our holding depended,however,on the premise that the plaintiff could not establish the right to a pension in an action to compel payment of a particular installment we are aware of no comparable rule requiring an action to invalidate a tax be brought before,and separately from,an action for relief from particular payments of the tax unlike in dillon,then,plaintiffs failure to establish the tax invalidity within three years of its enactment does not preclude them from complaining,on grounds of such invalidity,of the tax continuing collection.howard jarvis,at see abbott city of los angeles cal d,plaintiff was not obligated to seek a timely declaratory judgment as to right to pension before filing a claim for breach of pension obligation.
