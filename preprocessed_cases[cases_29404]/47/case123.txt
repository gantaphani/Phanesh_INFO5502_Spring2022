while the parties agree on the factual underpinnings of this case,they hotly contest the legal significance of the two contracts central to it.on august,mcgraw entered into a publishing agreement with philip postlewaite,a distinguished professor at northwestern university school of law,and his coauthor john pennell to publish partnership taxation,fifth edition the work through mcgraw topical publishing division the topical line.two years later,mcgraw entered into an agreement with augusta software design,augusta for the production of a computer program on that would include the partnership taxation treatise material the program.plaintiffs were not party to the software agreement.the product was never marketed by mcgraw.
under the publishing agreement,plaintiffs promised to deliver a manuscript of the work to mcgraw and assign ed exclusively to mcgraw each and every right in the work throughout the world.mcgraw right to publish the work,indisputably one of the rights in the work granted by plaintiffs,was not restricted in any way it had the right to publish the work at its own expense at such time and in such style and manner and to sell the work as it shall deem suitable the publishing agreement entitles plaintiffs to royalties upon the sale of individual copies of the work.in addition,if mcgraw sells,assigns,or licenses any rights to the work to others,plaintiffs are each entitled to of the gross receipts from the transfer 
the software agreement provided that augusta would prepare and deliver to mcgraw the program,entitled partnership taxation on,that mcgraw would publish the program,and that mcgraw would pay royalties to augusta upon the sale of copies of the program.specifically,augusta promised to deliver a f ull text program on,along with a form return of partnership income,software,and a user manual in both printed and electronic formats.augusta also conveyed the exclusive right to market the program to mcgraw.mcgraw expressly retained any copyrights of the material provided to augusta for the program.software agreement.
the publishing agreement provides for royalties to the work authors plaintiffs,publishing agreement a,and the software agreement provides for royalties to the program author augusta,software agreement.like the publishing agreement,the software agreement includes a paragraph governing its assignment and requires the other party or parties written consent.id.unlike the publishing agreement,however,the software agreement explicitly exempts a sale of assets by mcgraw from the royalty provisions.id.b.
mcgraw sold the topical line to thomson legal publishing,thompson in december.the assets of the topical line included mcgraw contractual rights under agreements,including the publishing and software agreements at issue here.mcgraw received a lump sum of for the sale of the topical line,without designating the value of the publishing agreements,inventory,or goodwill of the topical line.plaintiffs consented to the assignment of their publishing agreement to thomson,and thomson has confirmed its liability for royalties generated after the sale of the topical line 
arbitration by plaintiffs for damages based upon assignment of the publishing agreement to thomson and postlewaite appeals 
after the sale of the topical line,plaintiffs pressed a claim for royalties on the assignment of the publishing agreement to thomson.plaintiffs brought an arbitration proceeding in march against mcgraw,asserting that the sale of assets pursuant to the transfer of the topical line constituted a sale of rights to plaintiffs treatise,thereby entitling plaintiffs to royalties under paragraph a of the publishing agreement.postlewaite,wl,at arbitration appeal i.mcgraw countered that the sale of the topical line merely transferred mcgraw rights and obligations contained in its stable of publishing contracts to thomson and was not a event.in a terse opinion that did not set forth its rationale,a arbitration panel unanimously denied royalties to plaintiffs.
plaintiff postlewaite then brought a proceeding before the southern district of new york to vacate the award mcgraw for judgment on the award.see arbitration appeal i,wl,at.the district court entered judgment on the award.see id.at.postlewaite appealed,and we affirmed by a summary order.see postlewaite mcgraw hill.cir arbitration appeal ii.while the decision in arbitration appeal ii was pending,plaintiffs filed this action.
b.the present action for damages under the publishing agreement premised upon assignment of the software agreement to thomson 
the complaint in the current action contends that the assignment of the software agreement was also a event.mcgraw moved for summary judgment,arguing that the arbitration award collaterally estopped plaintiffs from seeking royalties for the transfer of the software agreement as the arbitration award necessarily precluded mcgraw liability under the publishing agreement.plaintiffs for summary judgment.the district court granted mcgraw motion and denied plaintiffs as moot.see postlewaite,d mcgraw i.plaintiffs appealed,and we reversed.this court was unable to conclude that the arbitrators had necessarily decided that plaintiffs were not entitled to royalties under the publication agreement as a result of the assignment of mcgraw contracts.see postlewaite,cir mcgraw ii.thus,express ing no view of the merits,the panel in mcgraw ii vacated the order of dismissal and remanded the case.id.at.
on remand,the parties again for summary judgment.both parties asserted that in light of the language and structure of the two agreements,each was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.the court found that the assignment of the software agreement as part of the sale of the topical line was not a event and did not trigger the royalty requirements of paragraph a of the publishing agreement.see postlewaite,wl,at mcgraw iii.judge rakoff concluded that plaintiffs assignment of the software agreement was the sale or assignment of any right to the contrary to a reasonable interpretation of the two agreements and defied common sense.see id.at plaintiffs once again appealed judge rakoff decision,and we now affirm.
discussion 
in our view,under the software agreement mcgraw purchased rights in a computer program created by augusta that dealt with plaintiffs work but did not establish any rights to the work.thus,the transfer to thomson of rights and obligations contained within the software agreement was not a transfer of any right to the work authored by plaintiffs and was not a event under the publishing agreement.under the publishing agreement,there is a critical distinction between mcgraw assigning or transferring a right in the work and mcgraw assigning or transferring contracts that facilitate mcgraw right to publish the work in the style and manner it deems suitable,here in a digital medium,on.since the language of the agreements makes clear that mcgraw owes no royalties to plaintiffs arising out of the transfer of the software agreement,summary judgment for defendant was appropriate.
a district court determination of summary judgment is reviewed anew.see arbitron,tralyn,cir.the parties do not dispute that new york law applies here.in new york,if a contract is straightforward and unambiguous,its interpretation presents a question of law for the court to be made without resort to extrinsic evidence.ruttenberg davidge data,dep t citation omitted.but summary judgment when interpreting a contract may be granted only when the intent of the parties can be ascertained from the face of their agreement.id.at,quotations omitted.however,when the meaning of the contract is ambiguous and the intent of the parties becomes a matter of inquiry,a question of fact is presented which can not be resolved on a motion for summary judgment.id.at,quotations omitted.
contracts must be read as a whole,and if possible,courts must interpret them to effect the general purpose of the contract.see westmoreland coal entech,quotations omitted.it is also important to read the document as a whole to ensure that excessive emphasis is not placed upon particular words or phrases.south road,llc int l bus.machs,citat
