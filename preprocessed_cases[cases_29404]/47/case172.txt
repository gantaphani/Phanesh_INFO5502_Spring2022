after selling bootleg dvds of unreleased movies to an undercover federal agent on june,and then selling more to the same agent on january,david armstead was indicted and convicted on two felony counts of willful copyright infringement for private financial gain by distributing at least unauthorized dvds on each occasion,having a total retail value of more than,in violation of a and b.at trial,armstead contested only the total retail value of the dvds sold and urged that he be convicted of only misdemeanors for selling dvds with a total retail value of or less.see b.the jury,however,convicted armstead of the felony charges,and he was sentenced to six months home detention.
on appeal,armstead focuses on the fact that he sold the dvds in the first transaction for a total of and in the second transaction for a total of,and that the government offered no adequate alternative value to prove that the total retail value of the dvds sold in each transaction was more than,as required for felony convictions.he requests that we vacate the felony convictions and enter judgments for misdemeanor offenses,remanding the case for resentencing accordingly.
as a matter of first impression,we hold that retail value as used in b refers to the value of copies of the copyrighted material at the time the defendant committed the violation and sold the copies and that the retail value is determined by taking the highest of the face value,par value,or market value of copies of the copyrighted material in a retail context.see.because the evidence of retail value,so construed,supported felony convictions,we affirm.
on june,armstead sold illicit movies in dvd format for per dvd to an undercover agent of the bureau of immigration and customs enforcement ice at the parking lot of the springfield mall in northern virginia.the bootleg dvds included copies of fast furious copies of the matrix reloaded copies of finding nemo copies of the italian job and copies of wrong turn.again on january,armstead sold the same agent more illicit movies in dvd format,this time dvds for again per dvd.the bootleg dvds included copies of lord of the rings the return of the king copies of paycheck copies of bad santa copies of my baby daddy and copies of gang of roses.the copies sold on both occasions were,for the most part,made by using a camcorder to record the films as they played in movie theaters and were,with a few exceptions,of poor quality.at the time,however,better copies of the dvd movies sold to the undercover agent were not available,as the movies were only in the theatrical release stage and authorized dvds were not yet available.according to the undercover agent,legitimate dvds would not be available until three to six months after the movie was released to theaters.
armstead was indicted in two felony counts,one for each occasion on which he sold dvds to the undercover agent.
at trial,armstead conceded all elements of the offenses against him except the total retail value of the dvds,claiming that their total value on each date was far less than,the threshold amount for felony liability under b.he contended that with the proper finding of retail value,he could be convicted of only misdemeanors.he grounded his retail value assertions on the fact that the only hard evidence of retail value was the price of the dvds in the thieves market,which priced the dvds at on the first occasion and on the second.
although the jury was instructed that if it found every element of the crime other than a retail value of over,it could return only misdemeanor convictions,it returned felony convictions on both counts.the district court sentenced armstead to six months home detention,five years probation,and ordered him to pay in restitution.
on appeal,armstead presents the single issue of retail value and argues that retail value,as used in b,refers to the price a willing buyer would pay a willing seller at the time and in the market in which the infringing dvds are thieves market.with that definition of retail value,armstead contends that the evidence at trial was insufficient to support felony convictions.
the copyright act,in relevant part,provides that a ny person who willfully infringes a copyright shall be punished as provided under section of title,if the infringement was committed a for purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain.a a.section of title,in turn,provides in relevant part 
any person who commits an offense under section a a of title 
shall be imprisoned not more than years,or fined in the amount set forth in this title,or both,if the offense consists of the reproduction or distribution,including by electronic means,during any period,of at least copies or phonorecords,of or more copyrighted works,which have a total retail value of more than.
b emphasis added.section also provides that if the element is not satisfied,the defendant is to be punished for a misdemeanor.see id.b.
armstead argument that the government failed to produce sufficient evidence that the dvds he sold to the undercover agent had an aggregate retail value of more than hinges on the meaning of retail value as used in b.he asserts that retail value,as used in the statute,means the price a willing buyer would pay a willing seller at the time and in the market in which it is thieves market.with this definition of retail value,he argues that what a willing buyer would pay a willing seller at the time was evidenced by what the undercover agent paid him and therefore that the retail value amount was insufficient to satisfy the felony threshold amount of.
the government contends that retail value refers to the higher value of what a willing buyer would pay a willing seller for a legitimate copy of the infringed item,such as an authentic,authorized dvd of the same movie.the government states that retail value as used in the statute is not the bootleg value the defendant received on the black market.it argues,i f the congress had meant to use the bootleg value or wholesale value of counterfeit product s,it certainly would have used that or similar language instead,the congress used the phrase total retail value of the copyright works.
both parties seem to be arguing about a market value,debating whether the relevant market from which to draw this market value refers to the market for bootleg products or the market for legitimate products.but their debate fails to account for the statutory language,which produces a broader formulation of retail value.
retail value,as a phrase,is not defined in the statute,but value is.section,which provides definitions for chapter of title addressing stolen property defines value for the entire chapter in which is included as the face,par,or market value,whichever is the greatest.emphasis added.thus,value is measured not only by actual transactions that define a market,but also by face or par values assigned to commodities or goods before reaching the market,and the statute instructs that the greatest of those values be used.retail,which is not defined at all,refers,in its ordinary meaning,to sales transactions of commodities or goods in small quantities to ultimate consumers.see,webster third new international dictionary.as distinct from retail,wholesale refers to sales transactions of goods and commodities in quantity for resale.id.at.it follows,accordingly,that retail prices are higher than wholesale prices.
thus considering retail and value as component terms that are individually defined by common understanding and by,respectively,we conclude that retail value refers to the greatest of any face value,par value,or market value of commodities or goods in reference to actual or potential sales to ultimate consumers.thus,while market value determined by the price that a willing buyer would pay a willing included in the class of values defined as retail value,it is not the exclusive determinant.it follows that if a manufacturer of dvds sells its dvds at wholesale with a suggested retail price of and the retailer actually sells the dvds to the consumer at the discounted price of,the retail value as used in b refers to the greater of the two numbers,or per dvd.of course,if
