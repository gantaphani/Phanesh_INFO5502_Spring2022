this case concerns the recording industry association of america use of the subpoena provision of the digital millennium copyright act,h,to identify internet users the riaa believes are infringing the copyrights of its members.the riaa served two subpoenas upon verizon internet services in order to discover the names of two verizon subscribers who appeared to be trading large numbers of.files of copyrighted music via file sharing programs,such as kazaa.verizon refused to comply with the subpoenas on various legal grounds.
the district court rejected verizon statutory and constitutional challenges to h and ordered the internet service provider isp to disclose to the riaa the names of the two subscribers.on appeal verizon presents three alternative arguments for reversing the orders of the district court h does not authorize the issuance of a subpoena to an isp acting solely as a conduit for communications the content of which is determined by others if the statute does authorize such a subpoena,then the statute is unconstitutional because the district court lacked article iii jurisdiction to issue a subpoena with no underlying case or controversy pending before the court and h violates the first amendment because it lacks sufficient safeguards to protect an internet user ability to speak and to associate anonymously.because we agree with verizon interpretation of the statute,we reverse the orders of the district court enforcing the subpoenas and do not reach either of verizon constitutional arguments.
background 
individuals with a personal computer and access to the internet began to offer digital copies of recordings for download by other users,an activity known as file sharing,in the late using a program called napster.although recording companies and music publishers successfully obtained an injunction against napster facilitating the sharing of files containing copyrighted recordings,see records,napster,cir records,napster,cir,millions of people in the united states and around the world continue to share digital.files of copyrighted recordings using computer programs such as kazaa,morpheus,grokster,and edonkey.see john borland,file swapping shifts up a gear may,available at http,last visited december.unlike napster,which relied upon a centralized communication architecture to identify the.files available for download,the current generation of file sharing programs allow an internet user to search directly the.file libraries of other users no web site is involved.see douglas lichtman william landes,indirect liability for copyright infringement an economic perspective,harv.laww tech.to date,owners of copyrights have not been able to stop the use of these decentralized programs.see studios,grokster,d holding grokster not contributorily liable for copyright infringement by users of its file sharing program.
the riaa now has begun to direct its efforts against individual users of file sharing programs.in order to pursue apparent infringers the riaa needs to be able to identify the individuals who are sharing and trading files using programs.the riaa can readily obtain the screen name of an individual user,and using the internet protocol ip address associated with that screen name,can trace the user to his isp.only the isp,however,can link the ip address used to access a program with the name and address of a person the isp customer who can then be contacted or,if need be,sued by the riaa.
the riaa has used the subpoena provisions of h of the digital millennium copyright act dmca to compel isps to disclose the names of subscribers whom the riaa has reason to believe are infringing its members copyrights.see h copyright owner may request the clerk of any united states district court to issue a subpoena to an isp for identification of an alleged infringer.some isps have complied with the riaa h subpoenas and identified the names of the subscribers sought by the riaa.the riaa has sent letters to and filed lawsuits against several hundred such individuals,each of whom allegedly made available for download by other users hundreds or in some cases even thousands of.files of copyrighted recordings.verizon refused to comply with and instead has challenged the validity of the two h subpoenas it has received.
a copyright owner or its agent,such as the riaa must file three items along with its request that the clerk of a district court issue a subpoena a notification of claimed infringement identifying the copyrighted work s claimed to have been infringed and the infringing material or activity,and providing information reasonably sufficient for the isp to locate the material,all as further specified in c a the proposed subpoena directed to the isp and a sworn declaration that the purpose of the subpoena is to obtain the identity of an alleged infringer and that such information will only be used for the purpose of protecting rights under the copyright laws of the united states.h a c.if the copyright owner request contains all three items,then the clerk shall expeditiously issue and sign the proposed subpoena and return it to the requester for delivery to the isp.h.upon receipt of the subpoena the isp is authorize d and order ed to disclose to the copyright owner the identity of the alleged infringer.see h.
on july,the riaa served verizon with a subpoena issued pursuant to h,seeking the identity of a subscriber whom the riaa believed to be engaged in infringing activity.the subpoena was for information sufficient to identify the alleged infringer of the sound recordings described in the attached notification.the notification of claimed infringement identified the ip address of the subscriber and about sound files he offered for trading expressed the riaa good faith belief the file sharing activity of verizon subscriber constituted infringement of its members copyrights and asked for verizon immediate assistance in stopping this unauthorized activity.specifically,we request that you remove or disable access to the infringing sound files via your system.
when verizon refused to disclose the name of its subscriber,the riaa filed a motion to compel production pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure c b and h of the act.in opposition to that motion,verizon argued h does not apply to an isp acting merely as a conduit for an individual using a file sharing program to exchange files.the district court rejected verizon argument based upon the language and structure of the statute,as confirmed by the purpose and history of the legislation,and ordered verizon to disclose to the riaa the name of its subscriber.in re verizon internet,d,verizon i.
the riaa then obtained another h subpoena directed to verizon.this time verizon moved to quash the subpoena,arguing that the district court,acting through the clerk,lacked jurisdiction under article iii to issue the subpoena and in the alternative that h violates the first amendment.the district court rejected verizon constitutional arguments,denied the motion to quash,and again ordered verizon to disclose the identity of its subscriber.in re verizon internet,d,verizon ii.
verizon appealed both orders to this court and we consolidated the two cases.as it did before the district court,the riaa defends both the applicability of h to an isp acting as a conduit for file sharing and the constitutionality of h.the united states has intervened solely to defend the constitutionality of the statute.
ii.analysis 
the court ordinarily reviews a district court grant of a motion to compel or denial of a motion to quash for abuse of discretion.see,in re sealed case.here,however,verizon contends the orders of the district court were based upon errors of law,specifically errors regarding the meaning of h.our review is therefore plenary.see in re subpoena served upon the comptroller of the currency.
the issue is whether h applies to an isp acting only as a conduit for data transferred between two internet users,such as persons sending and receiving or,as in this case,sharing files.verizon contends h does not authorize the issuance of a subpoena to an isp that transmits infringing material but does not store any such material on its servers.the riaa argues h on its face authorizes the issuance of a subpoena to an internet service provider without regard to whether the isp is acting as a conduit for communications.we conclude from both the terms of h and the overall structure of that,as verizon contends,a subpoena may be issued only to an isp engaged in storing on its servers material that is infringing or the subject of infringing activity.
subsection h by its terms 
we begin our analysis,as always,with the text of the statute.see barnhart sigmon coal,d.verizon statutory arguments address the meaning of and interaction between h and a d.having already discussed the general requirements of h,we now introduce a d.
section creates four safe harbors,each of which immunizes isps from liability for copyright infringement under certain highly specified conditions.subsection a,entitled transitory digital network communications,provides a safe harbor for infringement of copyright by reason of the isp transmitting,routing,or providing connections for infringing material,subject to certain conditions,including that the transmission is initiated and directed by an internet user.see a.subsection b,system caching,provides immunity from liability for infringement of copyright by reason of the intermediate and temporary storage of material on a system or network controlled or operated by or for the isp,b,as long as certain conditions regarding the transmission and retrieval of the material created by the isp are met.see b a e.subsection c,information residing on systems or networks at the direction of users,creates a safe harbor from liability for infringement of copyright by reason of the storage at the direction of a user of material that resides on a system or network controlled or operated by or for the service provider,as long as the isp meets certain conditions regarding its lack of knowledge concerning,financial benefit from,and expeditious efforts to remove or deny access to,material that is infringing or that is claimed to be the subject of infringing activity.see c a c.finally,d,information location tools,provides a safe harbor from liability for infringement of copyright by reason of the provider referring or linking users to an online location containing infringing material or infringing activity,by using information location tools such as a directory,index,reference,pointer,or hypertext link,subject to the same conditions as in c a c.see d.
notably present in b d,and notably absent from a,is the notice and provision.it makes a condition of the isp protection from liability for copyright infringement that upon notification of claimed infringement as described in c,the isp responds expeditiously to remove,or disable access to,the material that is claimed to be infringing.see b e,c c,and d.
verizon argues that h by its terms precludes the clerk of court from issuing a subpoena to an isp acting as a conduit for communications because a h subpoena request can not meet the requirement in h a that a proposed subpoena contain a copy of a notification of claimed infringement,as described in c a.in particular verizon maintains the two subpoenas obtained by the riaa fail to meet the requirements of c a iii in that they do not because verizon is not storing the infringing material on its server and can not,identify material to be removed or access to which is to be disabled by verizon.here verizon points out that h makes satisfaction of the notification requirement of c a a condition precedent to issuance of a subpoena if the notification filed satisfies the provisions of c a and the other content requirements of h are met,then the clerk shall expeditiously issue and sign the proposed subpoena for delivery to the isp.
infringing material obtained or distributed via file sharing is located in the computer or in an storage device,such as a compact disc of an individual user.no matter what information the copyright owner may provide,the isp can neither remove nor disable access to the infringing material because that material is not stored on the isp servers.verizon can not remove or disable one user access to infringing material resident on another user computer because verizon does not control the content on its subscribers computers.
the riaa contends an isp can indeed disable access to infringing material by terminating the offending subscriber internet account.this argument is undone by the terms of the act,however.as verizon notes,the congress considered disabling an individual access to infringing material and disabling access to the internet to be different remedies for the protection of copyright owners,the former blocking access to the infringing material on the offender computer and the latter more broadly blocking the offender access to the internet at least via his chosen isp.compare j a i authorizing injunction restraining isp from providing access to infringing material with j a ii authorizing injunction restraining isp from providing access to a subscriber or account holder who is engaging in infringing activity by terminating the accounts of the subscriber or account holder.w here different terms are used in a single piece of legislation,the court must presume that congress intended the terms have different meanings.transbrasil linhas aereas dep t of.these distinct statutory remedies establish that terminating a subscriber account is not the same as removing or disabling access by others to the infringing material resident on the subscriber computer.
the riaa points out that even if,with respect to an isp functioning as a conduit for communications,a copyright owner can not satisfy the requirement of c a iii by identifying material to be removed by the isp,a notification is effective under c a if it includes substantially the required information that standard is satisfied,the riaa maintains,because the isp can identify the infringer based upon the information provided by the copyright owner pursuant to c a i ii and iv vi.according to the riaa,the purpose of h being to identify infringers,a notice should be deemed sufficient so long as the isp can identify the infringer from the ip address in the subpoena.
nothing in the act itself says how we should determine whether a notification includes substantially all the required information both the senate and house reports,however,state the term means only that technical errors such as misspelling a name or supplying an outdated area code will not render ineffective an otherwise complete c a notification,at.ii,at.clearly,however,the defect in the riaa notification is not a mere technical error nor could it be thought insubstantial even under a more forgiving standard.the riaa notification identifies absolutely no material verizon could remove or access to which it could disable,which indicates to us that c a concerns means of infringement other than file sharing.
finally,the riaa argues the definition of internet service provider in k b makes h applicable to an isp regardless what function it performs with respect to infringing material transmitting it per a,caching it per b,hosting it per c,or locating it per d.
this argument borders upon the silly.the details of this argument need not burden the federal reporter,for the specific provisions of h,which we have just rehearsed,make clear that however broadly internet service provider is defined in k b,a subpoena may issue to an isp only under the prescribed conditions regarding notification.define all the world as an isp if you like,the validity of a h subpoena still depends upon the copyright holder having given the isp,however defined,a notification effective under c a.and as we have seen,any notice to an isp concerning its activity as a mere conduit does not satisfy the condition of c a iii and is therefore ineffective.
in sum,we agree with verizon that h does not by its terms authorize the subpoenas issued here.a h subpoena simply can not meet the notice requirement of c a iii.
verizon also argues the subpoena provision,h,relates uniquely to the safe harbor in c for isps engaged in storing copyrighted material and does not apply to the transmitting function addressed by
