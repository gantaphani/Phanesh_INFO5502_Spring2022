timothy vernor purchased several used copies of autodesk,autocad release software release from one of autodesk direct customers,and he resold the release copies on ebay.vernor brought this declaratory judgment action against autodesk to establish that these resales did not infringe autodesk copyright.the district court issued the requested declaratory judgment,holding that vernor sales were lawful because of two of the copyright act affirmative defenses that apply to owners of copies of copyrighted works,the first sale doctrine and the essential step defense.
autodesk distributes release pursuant to a limited license agreement in which it reserves title to the software copies and imposes significant use and transfer restrictions on its customers.we determine that autodesk direct customers are licensees of their copies of the software rather than owners,which has two ramifications.because vernor did not purchase the release copies from an owner,he may not invoke the first sale doctrine,and he also may not assert an essential step defense on behalf of his customers.for these reasons,we vacate the district court grant of summary judgment to vernor and remand for further proceedings.
autodesk release software and licensing practices 
the material facts are not in dispute.autodesk makes design software used by architects,engineers,and manufacturers.it has more than nine million customers.it first released its autocad software in.it holds registered copyrights in all versions of the software including the discontinued release version,which is at issue in this case.it provided release to customers on.
since at least,autodesk has offered autocad to customers pursuant to an accompanying software license agreement sla,which customers must accept before installing the software.a customer who does not accept the sla can return the software for a full refund.autodesk offers slas with different terms for commercial,educational institution,and student users.the commercial license,which is the most expensive,imposes the fewest restrictions on users and allows them software upgrades at discounted prices.
the sla for release first recites that autodesk retains title to all copies.second,it states that the customer has a nonexclusive and nontransferable license to use release.third,it imposes transfer restrictions,prohibiting customers from renting,leasing,or transferring the software without autodesk prior consent and from electronically or physically transferring the software out of the western hemisphere.fourth,it imposes significant use restrictions 
you may not modify,translate,reverseengineer,decompile,or disassemble the software remove any proprietary notices,labels,or marks from the software or documentation use the software outside of the western hemisphere utilize any computer software or hardware designed to defeat any hardware device,should the software you have licensed be equipped with such protection or use the software for commercial or other purposes if the software has been licensed or labeled for educational use only.
fifth,the sla provides for license termination if the user copies the software without authorization or does not comply with the sla restrictions.finally,the sla provides that if the software is an upgrade of a previous version 
y ou must destroy the software previously licensed to you,including any copies resident on your hard disk drive within sixty days of the purchase of the license to use the upgrade or update autodesk reserves the right to require you to show satisfactory proof that previous copies of the software have been destroyed.
autodesk takes measures to enforce these license requirements.it assigns a serial number to each copy of autocad and tracks registered licensees.it requires customers to input activation codes within one month after installation to continue using the software the customer obtains the code by providing the product serial number to autodesk.autodesk issues the activation code after confirming that the serial number is authentic,the copy is not registered to a different customer,and the product has not been upgraded.once a customer has an activation code,he or she may use it to activate the software on additional computers without notifying autodesk.
autodesk provision of release software to cta 
in march,autodesk reached a settlement agreement with its customer associates,cta,which autodesk had accused of unauthorized use of its software.as part of the settlement,autodesk licensed ten copies of release to cta.cta agreed to the sla,which appeared on each release package that autodesk provided to cta in the settlement agreement and,while the software is being installed.
cta later upgraded to the newer,fifteenth version of the autocad program,autocad.it paid per upgrade license,compared to for each new license.the sla for autocad,like the sla for release,required destruction of copies of previous versions of the software,with proof to be furnished to autodesk on request.however,rather than destroying its release copies,cta sold them to vernor at an office sale with the handwritten activation codes necessary to use the software 
vernor ebay business and sales of release 
vernor has sold more than items on ebay.in may,he purchased an authentic used copy of release at a garage sale from an unspecified seller.he never agreed to the sla terms,opened a sealed software packet,or installed the release software.though he was aware of the sla existence,he believed that he was not bound by its terms.he posted the software copy for sale on ebay.
autodesk filed a digital millennium copyright act dmca notice with ebay claiming that vernor sale infringed its copyright,and ebay terminated vernor auction autodesk advised vernor that it conveyed its software copies pursuant to licenses,and resale of its software was copyright infringement.vernor filed a dmca with ebay contesting the validity of autodesk copyright claim autodesk did not respond to the.ebay reinstated the auction,and vernor sold the software to another ebay user.
in april,vernor purchased four authentic used copies of release at cta office sale.the authorization codes were handwritten on the outside of the box.he listed the four copies on ebay sequentially,representing,this software is not currently installed on any computer.on each of the first three occasions,the same dmca process ensued.autodesk filed a dmca notice with ebay,and ebay removed vernor auction.vernor submitted a to which autodesk did not respond,and ebay reinstated the auction.
when vernor listed his fourth,final copy of release,autodesk again filed a dmca notice with ebay.this time,ebay suspended vernor account because of autodesk repeated charges of infringement.vernor also wrote to autodesk,claiming that he was entitled to sell his release copies pursuant to the first sale doctrine,because he never installed the software or agreed to the sla.in response,autodesk counsel directed vernor to stop selling the software.vernor filed a final with ebay.when autodesk again did not respond to vernor,ebay reinstated vernor account.at that point,vernor ebay account had been suspended for one month,during which he was unable to earn income on ebay.
vernor currently has two additional copies of release that he wishes to sell on ebay.although the record is not clear,it appears that vernor sold two of the software packages that he purchased from cta,for roughly each,but did not sell the final two to avoid risking further suspension of his ebay account.
in august,vernor brought a declaratory action against autodesk to establish that his resales of used release software are protected by the first sale doctrine and do not infringe autodesk copyright.he also sought damages and injunctive relief.on january,autodesk moved to dismiss vernor complaint,or in the alternative,for summary judgment.the district court denied the motion,holding that vernor sales were under the first sale doctrine and the essential step defense.see vernor autodesk,d.
following discovery,the parties filed for summary judgment.the district court granted summary judgment to vernor as to copyright infringement in an unpublished decision.however,the district court declined to resolve vernor affirmative defense that autodesk had misused its copyright,reasoning that a misuse defense would not benefit vernor since he had prevailed on copyright infringement.in october,the district court entered judgment for vernor,and autodesk timely appealed.
copyright is a federal law protection provided to the authors of original works of authorship,including software programs.the copyright act confers several exclusive rights on copyright owners,including the exclusive rights to reproduce their works and to distribute their works by sale or rental.id.the exclusive distribution right is limited by the first sale doctrine,an affirmative defense to copyright infringement that allows owners of copies of copyrighted works to resell those copies.the exclusive reproduction right is limited within the software context by the essential step defense,another affirmative defense to copyright infringement that is discussed further infra.both of these affirmative defenses are unavailable to those who are only licensed to use their copies of copyrighted works.
this case requires us to decide whether autodesk sold release copies to its customers or licensed the copies to its customers.if cta owned its copies of release,then both its sales to vernor and vernor subsequent sales were under the first sale doctrine however,if autodesk only licensed cta to use copies of release,then cta and vernor sales of those copies are not protected by the first sale doctrine and would therefore infringe autodesk exclusive distribution right.
a.the first sale doctrine 
the supreme court articulated the first sale doctrine in,holding that a copyright owner exclusive distribution right is exhausted after the owner first sale of a particular copy of the copyrighted work.see straus.in,the owner sold its book with a printed notice announcing that any retailer who sold the book for less than one dollar was responsible for copyright infringement.id.at.plaintiff sought injunctive relief against who failed to comply with the price restriction.id.at.the supreme court rejected the plaintiff claim,holding that its exclusive distribution right applied only to first sales of copies of the work.id.at.the distribution right did not permit plaintiff to dictate that subsequent sales of the work below a particular price were infringing.id.the court noted that its decision solely applied to the rights of a copyright owner that distributed its work without a license agreement.id.at there is no claim in this case of contract limitation,nor license agreement controlling the subsequent sales of the book.
congress codified the first sale doctrine the following year.see.in its current form,it allows the owner of a particular copy of a copyrighted work to sell or dispose of his copy without the copyright owner authorization id.a enacted.the first sale doctrine does not apply to a person who possesses a copy of the copyrighted work without owning it,such as a licensee.see id.d quality king,research int l,t he first sale doctrine would not provide a defense to any such as a bailee,a licensee,a consignee,or one whose possession of the copy was unlawful.
owners licensees 
we turn to our precedents governing whether a transferee of a copy of a copyrighted work is an owner or licensee of that copy.we then apply those precedents to cta and vernor possession of release copies.
united states wise,cir 
in wise,a criminal copyright infringement case,we considered whether copyright owners who transferred copies of their motion pictures pursuant to written distribution agreements had executed first sales.id.at.the defendant was found guilty of copyright infringement based on his sales of motion picture prints.see id.at.the copyright owners distributed their films to third parties pursuant to written agreements that restricted their use and transfer.id.at.on appeal,the defendant argued that the government failed to prove the absence of a first sale for each film if the copyright owners initial transfers of the films were first sales,then the defendant resales were protected by the first sale doctrine and thus were not copyright infringement.
to determine whether a first sale occurred,we considered multiple factors pertaining to each film distribution agreement.specifically,we considered whether the agreement a was labeled a license,b provided that the copyright owner retained title to the prints,c required the return or destruction of the prints,d forbade duplication of prints,or e required the transferee to maintain possession of the prints for the agreement duration.id.at.our use of these several considerations,none dispositive,may be seen in our treatment of each film print.
for example,we reversed the defendant conviction with respect to camelot.id.at.it was unclear whether the camelot print sold by the defendant had been subject to a first sale.copyright owner warner brothers distributed camelot prints pursuant to multiple agreements,and the government did not prove the absence of a first sale with respect to each agreement.id.at.we noted that,in one agreement,warner brothers had retained title to the prints,required possessor national broadcasting company nbc to return the prints if the parties could select a mutual agreeable price and if not,required nbc certification that the prints were destroyed.id.at.we held that these factors created a license rather than a first sale.id.
we further noted,however,that warner brothers had also furnished another camelot print to actress vanessa redgrave.id.at.the print was provided to redgrave at cost,and her use of the print was subject to several restrictions.she had to retain possession of the print and was not allowed to sell,license,reproduce,or publicly exhibit the print.id.she had no obligation to return the print to warner brothers.id.we concluded,while the provision for payment for the cost of the film,standing alone,does not establish a sale,when taken with the rest of the language of the agreement,it reveals a transaction strongly resembling a sale with restrictions on the use of the print.id.there was no evidence of the print whereabouts,and we held that i n the absence of such proof,the government failed to prove the absence of a first sale with respect to this redgrave print.id.at.since it was unclear which copy the defendant had obtained and resold,his conviction for sale of camelot had to be reversed.id.
thus,under wise,where a transferee receives a particular copy of a copyrighted work pursuant to a written agreement,we consider all of the provisions of the agreement to determine whether the transferee became an owner of the copy or received a license.we may consider whether the agreement was labeled a license and whether the copyright owner retained title to the copy,required its return or destruction,forbade its duplication,or required the transferee to maintain possession of the copy for the agreement duration.id.at.we did not find any one factor dispositive in wise we did not hold that the copyright owner retention of title itself established the absence of a first sale or that a transferee right to indefinite possession itself established a first sale 
the mai trio of cases 
over fifteen years after wise,we again considered the distinction between owners and licensees of copies of copyrighted works in three software copyright cases,the mai trio.see mai.peak computer,cir triad.se.express,cir wall data,los angeles county sheriff dep t,cir.in the mai trio,we considered which software purchasers were owners of copies of copyrighted works for purposes of a second affirmative defense to infringement,the essential step defense.
the enforcement of copyright owners exclusive right to reproduce their work under the copyright act,has posed special challenges in the software context.in order to use a software program,a user computer will automatically copy the software into the computer random access memory ram,which is a form of computer data storage.see mai,at.congress enacted the essential step defense to codify that a software user who is the owner of a copy of a copyrighted software program does not infringe by making a copy of the computer program,if the new copy is created as an essential step in the utilization of the computer program in conjunction with a machine and is used in no other manner.a.
the copyright act provides that an owner of a copy of copyrighted software may claim the essential step defense,and the owner of a particular copy of copyrighted software may claim the first sale doctrine.a,a.the mai trio construed the phrase owner of a copy for essential step defense purposes.neither vernor nor autodesk contends that the first sale doctrine inclusion of the word particular alters the phrase meaning,and we presume that words used more than once in the same statute have the same meaning throughout.moldo matsco,in re cybernetic,cir.accordingly,we consider the mai trio construction of owner of a copy controlling in our analysis of whether cta and vernor became owner s of a particular copy of release software.
in mai and triad,the defendants maintained computers that ran the plaintiffs operating system software.mai,at triad,at.when the defendants ran the computers,the computers automatically loaded plaintiffs software into ram.mai,at triad,at.the plaintiffs in both cases sold their software pursuant to restrictive license agreements,and we held that their customers were licensees who were therefore not entitled to claim the essential step defense.we found that the defendants infringed plaintiffs software copyrights by their unauthorized loading of copyrighted software into ram.mai,at triad,at.i n triad,the plaintiff had earlier sold software outright to some customers.at.we noted that these customers were owners who were entitled to the essential step defense,and the defendant did not infringe by making ram copies in servicing their computers.id.
in wall data,plaintiff sold software licenses to the defendant.wall data,at.the licenses were permitted use of the software on a single computer and permitted transfer of the software once per month,if the software was removed from the original computer.id.at.the defendant installed the software onto computers via hard drive imaging,which saved it from installing the software manually on each computer.it made an unverified claim that only users could simultaneously access the software.id.at.
the plaintiff sued for copyright infringement,contending that the defendant violated the license by the software.id.at.the defendant raised an essential step defense,contending that its hard drive imaging was a necessary step of installation.id.at.on appeal,we held that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the defendant request for a jury instruction on the essential step defense.id.at.citing mai,we held that the essential step defense does not apply where the copyright owner grants the user a license and significantly restricts the user ability to transfer the software.id.at.since the plaintiff license imposed significant restrictions on the defendant software rights,the defendant was a licensee and was not entitled to the essential step defense.id.at.
in wall data,we acknowledged that mai had been criticized in a federal circuit decision,but declined to revisit its holding,noting that the facts of wall data led to the conclusion that any error in the district court failure to instruct was harmless.even if the defendant owned its copies of the software,its installation of the software on a number of computers in excess of its license was not an essential step in the software use.id.at citing nimmer on copyright b c at dsc commc ns pulse commc ns,criticizing mai.
we read wise and the mai trio to prescribe three considerations that we may use to determine whether a software user is a licensee,rather than an owner of a copy.first,we consider whether the copyright owner specifies that a user is granted a license.second,we consider whether the copyright owner significantly restricts the user ability to transfer the software.finally,we consider whether the copyright owner imposes notable use restrictions our holding reconciles the mai trio and wise,even though the mai trio did not cite wise.see gonzales,cir w e are required to reconcile prior precedents if we can do so.
in response to mai,congress amended to permit a computer owner to copy software for maintenance or repair purposes.see c see also,pt,at.however,congress did not disturb mai holding that licensees are not entitled to the essential step defense.
a.the district court decision 
the district court interpreted wise to hold that a first sale occurs whenever the transferee is entitled to keep the copy of the work.since autodesk does not require its customers to return their copies of release,the district court found that autodesk had sold release to cta.it reasoned that thus,cta and vernor were successive owner s of a copy of the software and were entitled to resell it under the first sale doctrine.the district court also found that vernor customers copying of software during installation was protected by the essential step defense.
the district court acknowledged that were it to follow the mai trio,it would conclude that autodesk had licensed release copies to cta,rather than sold them.however,it viewed wise and the mai trio as irreconcilable,and it followed wise as the case.see united states,cir.
we hold today that a software user is a licensee rather than an owner of a copy where the copyright owner specifies that the user is granted a license significantly restricts the user ability to transfer the software and imposes notable use restrictions applying our holding to autodesk sla,we conclude that cta was a licensee rather than an owner of copies of release and thus was not entitled to invoke the first sale doctrine or the essential step defense.
autodesk retained title to the software and imposed significant transfer restrictions it stated that the license is nontransferable,the software could not be transferred or leased without autodesk written consent,and the software could not be transferred outside the western hemisphere.the sla also imposed use restrictions against the use of the software outside the western hemisphere and against modifying,translating,or the software,removing any proprietary marks from the software or documentation,or defeating any copy protection device.furthermore,the sla provided for termination of the license upon the licensee unauthorized copying or failure to comply with other license restrictions.thus,because autodesk reserved title to release copies and imposed significant transfer and use restrictions,we conclude that its customers are licensees of their copies of release rather than owners.
cta was a licensee rather than an owner of a particular copy of release,and it was not entitled to resell its release copies to vernor under the first sale doctrine.a.therefore,vernor did not receive title to the copies from cta and accordingly could not pass ownership on to others.both cta and vernor sales infringed autodesk exclusive right to distribute copies of its work.id.
because vernor was not an owner,his customers are also not owners of release copies.therefore,when they install release on their computers,the copies of the software that they make during installation infringe autodesk exclusive reproduction right because they too are not entitled to the benefit of the essential step defense,a.
although unnecessary to our resolution of the case,we address the legislative history in order to address the arguments raised by the parties and amici.that legislative history supports our conclusion that licensees such as cta are not entitled to claim the first sale doctrine.the house report for underscores congress view that the first sale doctrine is available only to a person who has acquired a copy via an outright sale,at,reprinted in.the report also asserts that the first sale doctrine does not apply to someone who merely possesses a copy or phonorecord without having acquired ownership of it.id.
our conclusion that those who rightfully possess,but do not own,a copy of copyrighted software are not entitled to claim the essential step defense is also supported by the legislative histor
