background 
collegesource and academyone compete in the market to assist students and educational institutions with the college transfer process.collegesource,a california corporation with its principal place of business in california,maintains a digital collection of course catalogs from colleges and universities dating back to.each catalog is available as a.pdf file on collegesource websites,and.students and college administrators may consult the catalogs to compare courses at different schools,or to research what credits a transferring student will obtain or what prerequisites she will have satisfied by virtue of courses taken at her prior institution.collegesource compiled its collection in large part by digitizing paper catalogs using optical character recognition software,which converts a printed page into a digital format that may be searched,copied,and pasted.collegesource alleges that its collection of catalogs cost more than million to compile and has significant commercial value.students,parents,guidance counselors,and teachers may use collegesource collection of catalogs for free,but libraries and educational institutions must pay to do so.collegesource has also used the information in its collection of catalogs to construct a searchable database of individual course descriptions that permits rapid assessment of course equivalencies and is available to educational institutions for a fee.
academyone is a pennsylvania corporation with its principal place of business in pennsylvania.academyone services resemble collegesource.academyone course atlas contains course catalogs for the current academic year,and its course equivalency management center enables users to compare the equivalencies of courses at different schools.both services are available on academyone websites,and.students who register with academyone may search these websites for information on courses,educational institutions,and course equivalencies create equivalency maps and transfer planning guides upload documents such as letters of recommendation and resumes to a storage center and post on a message board.academyone permits students to use many of the websites tools for free,but requires users to purchase subscriptions in order to access the websites more advanced features,including the course equivalency management center.most of academyone paying subscribers are educational institutions and state higher education agencies.
academyone seeks to serve a national market,but it has specifically targeted california students and schools.for example,academyone owns several google adwords that include the term california.an adword is a word or phrase that,when entered as a search term in google,prompts google to display an advertisement designed by the adword owner linking to the owner website.for example,academyone owns the adword california college transfer.when a google user searches that phrase,google returns both a list of relevant websites as determined by its own algorithm and advertisements for companies,including academyone,interested in targeting people who have searched that phrase.the adword owner hopes that the user will visit its advertised website in addition to,or in lieu of,the websites returned in the search results proper.see generally google adwords,last visited july,network automation,advanced.concepts,cir.academyone also solicited california colleges and state educational agencies by phone and email,and sponsored the keynote speaker at a conference of state higher education executive officers in san diego.
academyone efforts have borne fruit.approximately unique california ip addresses have visited academyone websites,amounting to percent of all visitors to the website.this is the highest number of visitors from any state.three hundred california students have registered with academyone.this is percent of all students who have registered with and provided an address to academyone.california colleges and universities have submitted institutional profiles for publication on academyone websites.two of academyone paid subscribers have california offices,though neither is a california corporation.however,academyone has no offices,real property,or staff in california is not licensed to do business in california has no agent for service of process in california and pays no california taxes.
in late and early,a few months after its founding,academyone made a series of attempts to acquire rights to collegesource collection of course catalogs.in september,ed johnson,academyone vice president for marketing,signed up for a trial membership in order to view collegesource catalogs.in october,johnson phoned a collegesource sales representative to ask what collegesource would charge for rights to its collection of catalogs.he then sent a email asking,w hat does it cost to obtain all your catalogs in electronic form,asap in december,peggi munkittrick,academyone executive director for product strategy,emailed collegesource ceo,kerry cooper,to determine whether collegesource has any interest in assisting us academyone with the creation of an online course inventory and whether collegesource had the interest ability to provide us with an electronic file of courses that could be loaded into our course inventory.munkittrick proposed a conference call to further identify what our opportunities might be.in january,munkittrick sent a email to cooper to determine whether a conversation is warranted to discuss how our companies might benefit from working together in an effort to create an online course inventory.munkittrick again proposed a conference call.cooper filed a declaration in the district court stating that collegesource briefly pursued academyone proposed partnership,but terminated the discussions because there was no point in selling away,at any price,our competitive advantage.
later in,academyone began building its own collection of catalogs and a database of course descriptions.two more academyone employees registered for trial memberships with collegesource that allowed them to download three catalogs each.academyone also hired a contractor to whom academyone provided a list of colleges and universities,as well as the urls of their homepages.academyone directed its contractor to collect catalogs and course descriptions from those schools websites,and then to provide that information to academyone for publication.during the collection process,the contractor employees downloaded.pdf files of catalogs that were linked from schools websites but were actually hosted on collegesource servers.the record does not reflect why these schools chose to host their catalogs on collegesource servers rather than their own.
academyone put catalogs from collegesource collection on its websites.the catalogs were easily identifiable as having come from collegesource.the first page of each.pdf file containing a catalog was a splash page bearing collegesource url.the second page file contained collegesource terms of use,which prohibit redistribution,modification,or commercial use of the catalogs without the consent of collegesource and the relevant school.both of these pages were reproduced on academyone websites.academyone also copied individual course descriptions from collegesource catalogs and pasted those course descriptions into its databases.the course descriptions were traceable to collegesource because they contained idiosyncratic errors created by collegesource optical character recognition software for example,instead of catalog that were also present in collegesource catalogs.
in april,collegesource to academyone a letter demanding the removal of collegesource catalogs and course descriptions from academyone websites.david moldoff,academyone ceo,filed a declaration in the district court stating that he did not know that collegesource was a corporation until he received the letter.he also stated that he removed all of the catalogs s hortly after receiving the letter.collegesource disputes that declaration,stating that academyone left misappropriated catalogs on its websites for several weeks following delivery of the letter,and continues to keep misappropriated course descriptions on its websites.
collegesource brought suit in federal district court for the southern district of california in october,alleging six causes of action violations of the computer fraud and abuse act,g violations of the california computer crimes act,code breach of contract misappropriation unfair competition,in violation of cal.bus.and unjust enrichment.during discovery in a related action in pennsylvania,collegesource learned that academyone had registered two of its trademarks as adwords.collegesource therefore filed an amended complaint in june adding causes of action for trademark infringement,in violation of and unfair competition,in violation of the lanham act.after jurisdictional discovery in this action,the district court granted academyone motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.see.b.collegesource timely appealed.
ii.standard of review 
we review a dismissal for lack of personal jurisdiction de novo.boschetto hansing,cir.in opposing a defendant motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction,the plaintiff bears the burden of establishing that jurisdiction is proper.id.where,as here,the defendant motion is based on written materials rather than an evidentiary hearing,the plaintiff need only make a prima facie showing of jurisdictional facts to withstand the motion to dismiss.brayton purcell llp recordon recordon,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the plaintiff can not simply rest on the bare allegations of its complaint,but uncontroverted allegations in the complaint must be taken as true.schwarzenegger fred martin motor,cir quoting amba mktg,jobar int l,cir.w e may not assume the truth of allegations in a pleading which are contradicted by affidavit,data disc.tech,cir,but we resolve factual disputes in the plaintiff favor,pebble beach caddy,cir.
where,as here,no federal statute authorizes personal jurisdiction,the district court applies the law of the state in which the court sits.k a panavision int l,toeppen,cir.california statute,is coextensive with federal due process requirements,so the jurisdictional analyses under state law and federal due process are the same.schwarzenegger,at.for a court to exercise personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant consistent with due process,that defendant must have certain minimum contacts with the relevant forum such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.international shoe washington.quoting milliken meyer.
iii.discussion 
general jurisdiction 
collegesource makes a cursory argument that academyone is subject to general jurisdiction in california.a court may assert general jurisdiction over foreign or corporations to hear any and all claims against them when their affiliations with the state are so continuous and systematic as to render them essentially at home in the forum state.goodyear dunlop tires operations,brown,d.for general jurisdiction to exist over a nonresident defendant such as academyone,the defendant must engage in continuous and systematic general business contacts,helicopteros nacionales de colombia,hall,d,that approximate physical presence in the forum state.bancroft masters,augusta,cir.the standard is met only by continuous corporate operations within a state that are thought so substantial and of such a nature as to justify suit against the defendant on causes of action arising from dealings entirely distinct from those activities.king am.family,cir quoting international shoe,at.to determine whether a nonresident defendant contacts are sufficiently substantial,continuous,and systematic,we consider their l ongevity,continuity,volume,economic impact,physical presence,and integration into the state regulatory or economic markets.tuazon reynolds tobacco,cir.the standard for general jurisdiction is an exacting standard,as it should be,because a finding of general jurisdiction permits a defendant to be haled into court in the forum state to answer for any of its activities anywhere in the world.schwarzenegger,at.see also,mavrix photo,brand,slip op.at cir.august.
collegesource argues that academyone is subject to general jurisdiction because academyone misappropriated collegesource catalogs and course descriptions in california markets its services to california students and educational institutions has three hundred registered users and two paid subscribers in california and maintains a highly interactive website.
collegesource has not satisfied the exacting standard necessary to establish general jurisdiction.academyone has no offices or staff in california is not registered to do business in the state has no registered agent for service of process and pays no state taxes.see,goodyear.at helicopteros,at glencore grain rotterdam shivnath rai harnarain,cir bancroft masters,at.academyone has not closed its pennsylvania offices and removed its corporate operations to california,perkins benguet consol.mining.
academyone alleged misappropriation of college source intellectual property does not support general jurisdiction because the misappropriation was not a continuous and systematic forum activity,but was,rather,a few discrete acts over a relatively short period of time.see international shoe,at corporate agent conduct of single or isolated items of activities in a state in the corporation behalf are not enough to subject it to suit on causes of action unconnected with the activities there tuazon,at generally,an isolated contact with the forum state will not support general jurisdiction.collegesource confuses the general and specific jurisdiction inquiries.a nonresident defendant discrete,isolated contacts with the forum support jurisdiction on a cause of action arising directly out of its forum contacts,but this is specific rather than general jurisdiction.see,mcgee int l life ins,d holding that one insurance policy issued by texas insurer to california resident subjected insurer to personal jurisdiction in california to answer claim based on that policy shute carnival cruise lines,cir w here a defendant has only one contact with the forum state,a close nexus between its activities and the cause of the plaintiffs harm may be required,rev on other grounds,d lake lake,cir.however,discrete forum contacts such as academyone alleged acts of misappropriation do not support jurisdiction on causes of action unrelated to those contacts.
marketing to forum residents,at least where such marketing does not result in substantial and continuous commerce with the forum,does not support general jurisdiction.see,shute,at no general jurisdiction despite advertising in the local media,the mailing of brochures and the payment of commissions to forum travel agents,and the conducting of promotional seminars congoleum dlw aktiengesellschaft,cir no general jurisdiction despite solicitation of orders,promotion of products to potential customers through the mail and through showroom displays,and attendance at trade shows and sales meetings.academyone single trip to a trade show in san diego is an isolated contact of just the type held inadequate to sustain general jurisdiction in helicopteros.see at.
academyone relationships with three hundred california registered users from whom,moldoff declares,academyone realizes no profit and two paid subscribers fall well short of the necessary substantial volume and economic impact.tuazon,at.see,keeton hustler magazine,d no general jurisdiction despite circulation of copies of nonresident defendant magazine in forum per month bancroft masters,at e ngaging in commerce with residents of the forum state is not in and of itself the kind of activity that appr
