latin american music company lamco and asociación de compositores y editores de música latino americana acemla brought suit in,alleging that the archdiocese of san juan of the roman catholic and apostolic church,through its two radio stations,along with ten other radio broadcasters,were infringing their copyrights in songs the case then expanded to include other claims and parties and was consolidated with four related cases,which together involved copyrights to more than five hundred songs.lamco and acemla appeal decisions by the district court that denied their infringement claims as to five songs allocated half of the obligation to pay for a special master fees to lamco and acemla dismissed their claims,counterclaims,and defenses as a sanction and held that they were infringing copyrights owned by other parties.
luis raul bernard founded lamco,a music publisher based in new york,and acemla,a performance rights society affiliated with lamco and based in puerto rico.bernard is the chief executive officer,director,and majority stockholder of both lamco and acemla.because lamco and acemla are closely aligned in this case,we will refer to them as,unless individual differentiation is necessary.
in response to the infringement suit brought against them by,the archdiocese and the other radio broadcaster defendants collectively referred to as the broadcasters brought counterclaims against.they also filed complaints against broadcast music,peer international corporation,and the american society of composers,authors,and publishers ascap,seeking indemnification and a defense against the claims brought by ascap and disputed the rights to five of the songs listed in the complaint and agreed that resolution of the ownership and copyright issues as to those songs could serve as a roadmap for resolving the same issues as to the other songs disputed by the parties.ascap and filed motions for partial summary judgment.the district court granted ascap motion,dismissing infringement claims on all five songs.
several music publishers collectively referred to as the publishers brought claims against,alleging that they owned or controlled copyrights to songs that were infringing the publishers moved for summary judgment on their infringement claims.disputed the rights to of the songs claimed by the publishers and moved for summary judgment as to infringement of those copyrights.as to the remaining songs,acknowledged that they had been included in an acemla catalog in error but denied infringement.in response to the motions,the district court summarized the bases of the parties claims of ownership and the applicable law but reserved judgment on infringement pending review of the ownership issues by a special master.
on march,noting that the present copyright cases are complicated and extremely fact intensive,the district court appointed a special master to examine the documentation pertaining to the chains of title as to all of the songs at issue in the consolidated cases.the district court directed the special master to make recommendations as to issues of authorship,ownership,and compliance with statutory requirements,whether the copyrights for the songs at issue had been infringed,and if so,by whom,and a recommendation on allegations of missing royalty payments.the special master compensation was set at an hourly rate of.the district court ordered the publishers to pay half of the fees and costs and to pay the other half and ordered each group to file a bond with the court in the amount of,within ten days following entry of the order.
during the course of the litigation,repeatedly failed to meet deadlines and obligations,including posting the bond.on october,the district court issued an ultimatum,granting a final extension of time for to post the bond and warning that failure to comply would result in sanctions which could include dismissal of their claims and affirmative defenses.nearly nine months later,on august,the district court concluded that had failed to comply with its order and dismissed their claims,counterclaims,and affirmative defenses in all of the consolidated cases.
on may,the special master issued his report and recommendation.the district court approved and adopted the special master report and recommendation,in part,with modifications as to the ownership of rights to certain songs,and ordered a hearing to resolve a question about notice and good faith with respect to ownership of rights in other songs.with respect to the songs for which the special master report and recommendation was approved,the district court granted the publishers motion for summary judgment on copyright infringement against.the order also assessed damages in the amount of and allowed the publishers to file an application for reasonable attorneys fees and costs.
following a hearing on ownership issues for the songs that were not resolved by the special master report and recommendation,the district court determined that the publishers also owned the copyrights to those songs.the court granted the publishers motion for summary judgment as to their infringement claims on those songs and awarded damages in the amount of.the court also granted the publishers motion for a permanent injunction against future infringement by and resolved other issues that were then pending.based on those determinations,the district court entered judgment as to the claims and counterclaims in the consolidated cases.appealed.
on appeal,challenge the district court decisions holding that did not own copyrights in five songs claimed by publishers,apportioning fifty percent of the special master fees to,sanctioning them for failing to post a bond as ordered,concluding that they lacked standing to seek rescission of copyright assignments,and holding that authorizing use of songs constitutes copyright infringement.ascap and the publishers oppose arguments on appeal.
summary judgment on five songs 
ascap sought partial summary judgment on infringement claims against the broadcasters as to five songs,asking that those five claims be dismissed sought partial summary judgment that they held the performing rights licenses to the same five songs.the disputed five songs are caballo viejo by simón díaz,patacón by ramon chaverra,ojos chinos by rogelio kito vélez,and te sigo quieriendo and una tercera persona by luz tirado.
the district court concluded that as to four of the songs,caballo viejo,patacón,te sigo quieriendo,and una tercera persona,ascap members held the copyrights,which precluded infringement claims arising from those songs.with respect to the fifth song,ojos chinos,the district court determined that had a license,which might entitle them to receive payments from the broadcasters but did not support standing to maintain a copyright infringement claim.the court also held that although recorded their agreement with the composer heirs to a license for all performing rights to ojos chinos,the recording did not comply with the requirements of c and,therefore,did not provide constructive notice of the license.based on those conclusions,the court dismissed infringement claims based on the five disputed songs.appeal that decision.

caballo viejo 
it is undisputed that the composer,simón díaz,granted the rights to caballo viejo to selemúsica,through an agreement dated september.selemúsica entered agreements with west side music publishing,that granted west side the right to represent selemúsica in the united states and its territories.west side registered the copyright for caballo viejo in,showing selemúsica as the copyright owner.
based their claim to caballo viejo on their agreements with west side.in an agreement dated may,west side granted the photomechanical rights and the exclusive rights to publish and license performance of caballo viejo for a term.west side and also entered an exclusive performing rights agreement on january.recorded the agreement on december.
ascap asserted its claim to caballo viejo also based on the rights held by west side.west side entered an agreement with barnegat music corporation in,which included the rights to collect performing fees and royalties for caballo viejo.west side and barnegat merged in.barnegat had been a member of ascap since.on december,before recorded their agreement with west side,the copyright royalty tribunal determined that t he settling parties which include ascap showed that selemusica,conveyed its rights to barnegat music,an ascap member.final determination of the distribution of the jukebox royalty fund,crt,wl,crt.
the district court agreed with the tribunal that barnegat held the rights to caballo viejo but came to that conclusion based on a somewhat different chain of title.the court concluded that hector varona,the president of west side,verbally terminated the agreement with,thereafter did not accept royalty payments sent to him,and refused to extend the agreement with.based on those circumstances,the district court held,based on the summary judgment record,that the rights to caballo viejo were transferred from the composer to selemúsica,to west side,and then to barnegat,an ascap member.the court ruled that ascap was entitled to collect performance royalties for the song.
on appeal,argue that the district court erroneously concluded that west side rescinded the agreement with and assert that under the agreement,continue to own the rights to caballo viejo.also argue that varona,on behalf of west side,could not terminate the agreement verbally because all transfers of copyright must be in writing.see a.ascap contends that west side entire agreement with expired at the end of the agreement term and was not renewed.
the summary judgment record is far from clear as to how,when,or if the agreement was terminated.the record shows that the agreement between and west side expired at the end of its term in the agreement between and west side,however,did not include a time limit.in the agreement,west side transfer red and cede d to acemla the exclusive rights to license in the territory or territories of united states,puerto rico and dominican republic all the rights to public performance which have been assigned to west side and other sic which may be assigned in the future 
although the district court concluded that varona verbally terminated the agreement,his testimony suggests that he did not remember or clearly understand the distinctions between the and agreements and that he was not sure when or how he terminated the agreement.further,even if he did intend to terminate the agreement,that action would be effective only if the exclusive license,granted in the agreement,could be terminated verbally and unilaterally.the district court order does not cite authority to support either theory therefore,the record as it pertains to caballo viejo demonstrates that material facts remain in dispute so that ascap was not entitled to summary judgment as to that song.
ramon chaverra wrote patacón in.he conveyed his copyrights to a colombian music publisher,prodemus,in february of.prodemus then conveyed to música unica publishers the right to represent prodemus in the united states and puerto rico,which gave música unica the rights to authorize and license patacón.música unica obtained a copyright registration certificate for patacón on september.música unica,operating under the name unimúsica,is an ascap member and has a licensing agreement with ascap.
claim to rights for patacón was based on a separate line of agreements.on september,chaverra,the composer,entered an agreement with edinmúsica,ldt,transferring all title and licensing authority for patacón as interpreted by another performer.on june,edinmúsica and obtained a copyright registration for the words and music for patacón.in,chaverra terminated his agreement with edinmúsica and entered an agreement with,transferring the exclusive rights to publish patacón and rights to collect performance royalties.chaverra also signed an affidavit,stating that represented his interests.on november,recorded chaverra affidavit and their agreement in the copyright office.
the district court concluded that because música unica never recorded its agreement with chaverra,was the first to record.the district court held,however,that música unica copyright registration certificate for patacón provided constructive notice of música unica claim to the song.for that reason,could not satisfy the good faith and without notice requirements of d.dispute that result,arguing that the registration,in música unica name,did not provide constructive notice that ascap had the right to license the song.
the recording statute,provides the process for the copyright office to accept for recordation any document pertaining to a copyright.nimmer on copyright,supra.section is relevant primarily to providing notification of transfers of copyright ownership hence,it is interwoven with the inquiry over what constitutes constructive notice of ownership and accordingly,when a subsequent transferee may prevail over a prior transferee.id.section d provides 
a s between two conflicting transfers,the one executed first prevails if it is recorded in the manner required to give constructive notice under c,within one month after its execution in the united states or within two months after its execution outside the united states,or at any time before recordation in such manner of the later transfer.otherwise the later transfer prevails if recorded first in such manner,and if taken in good faith,for valuable consideration or on the basis of a binding promise to pay royalties,and without notice of the earlier transfer.
a copyright registration certificate in the copyright office provides constructive notice as to the ownership of the copyright and the facts stated in the registration certificate.saenger,nationwide ins.licensing,cir see also johnson jones,cir constructive notice of a valid copyright is presumed upon registration.under federal copyright law,remedies for infringement are tied to copyright registration,which provides incentive to owners to register copyrights and also provides potential infringers with an incentive to check the federal register.gaiman mcfarlane,cir holding that do not have incentive to check the federal copyright register as to ownership claimed by their collaborators.
to meet the d requirements and prevail on summary judgment as the first to record,had to provide undisputed facts that they recorded the transfer from chaverra in good faith and without notice of the earlier transfer to música unica.it is undisputed,however,that música unica obtained a certificate of copyright registration for patacón in september of,days before chaverra entered an agreement with edinmúsica transferring rights to the song,and almost two years before edinmúsica and obtained a copyright registration for the song.at the time entered into their transfer agreement with chaverra,a review of the copyright office register would have revealed that música unica was listed as the copyright owner.música unica registration certification for patacón,therefore,provided notice that prior transactions existed relating to the copyright for patacón,regardless of what entity currently might claim those rights.
argue for a different rule that would base constructive notice for purposes of d on recording the transfer to the current copyright owner,focusing on identification of the current owner as opposed to notice of prior transfers.because such an interpretation would appear to alter the existing legal standard,we are not persuaded to adopt argument.see,pasdon city of peabody,cir declining invitation to expand standard in the absence of supporting legal authority plumley container,cir same.the district court was correct in concluding,based on the record presented and d,that had notice of música unica copyright claim to patacón,so that d did not apply to give priority and ascap claim prevailed over claim.
ojos chinos 
regarding ojos chinos,the district court concluded that had received and recorded their license before southern music publishing company,southern an ascap member recorded,giving priority.the court held,however,that because held only a license,they lacked standing to bring a copyright infringement claim.the district court also stated that the transfer agreement recorded did not meet the specificity requirements of c and would not serve as constructive notice of rights to the song.
in their appellate brief,challenge only the court ruling on the specificity requirements of c.in response,ascap notes that no dispute exists that a license does not provide standing to sue for infringement and does not address the district court statements about the specificity requirements of c.filed a reply brief in which they assert,for the first time,that the district court failed to realize that the composer heirs granted them an exclusive license to ojos chinos.we do not consider issues raised for the first time in a reply brief,and therefore,do not address late claim that they were granted an exclusive license,cir citing waste mgmt.holdings,mowbray,cir.
the district court ruling that as licensees lacked standing to bring an infringement claim is not disputed and is correct.b the legal or beneficial owner of an exclusive right under a copyright is entitled,subject to the requirements of section,to institute an action for any infringement of that particular right committed while he or she is the owner of it.emphasis added.see also,at one infringes a copyright when he or she violates one of the exclusive rights to a work held by a copyright owner,and the owner has the right to sue for infringement.russian news agency russian kurier,cir under united states law,an owner may sue for infringement in a united states court only if it meets the standing test of b,which accords standing only to the legal or beneficial owner of an exclusive right,shaver,cir a person holding a nonexclusive license has no standing to sue for copyright infringement.the district court additional statements about the specificity requirements of c are not material to the decision that lacked standing to sue for infringement.therefore,we will not delve into whether recording satisfied c.
una tercera persona and te sigo queriendo 
luz tirado wrote una tercera persona and te sigo queriendo in and transferred her rights in the songs to southern,an ascap member,on november and december,respectively.the transfer agreements also granted southern the right to renew the copyrights and a power of attorney to act on tirado behalf in obtaining the copyright renewals.southern registered the copyright to una tercera persona on february,and registered the copyright to te sigo queriendo on july.southern did not record the registrations.under the terms of the transfer agreements with tirado,southern,acting on behalf of tirado,executed assignments of the renewal rights to una tercera persona and te sigo queriendo and obtained copyright renewal registration certificates for una tercera persona on june,and for te sigo queriendo on june.
on december,tirado transferred the copyrights to songs,including una tercera persona,to,and they recorded the transfer agreement with the copyright office on february.tirado then granted the right to collect royalties on tirado behalf from the public performances of the songs transferred by the december,agreement,and the royalties agreement was recorded on february.on september,tirado transferred her rights in te sigo queriendo to,and they obtained copyright registration on february.
on appeal,contend that the district court erred in crediting the and transfers of renewal rights to southern because the assignments were not actually signed by tirado.they rely on a,which provides the requirements for recording copyright documents.fail to explain,however,why the recording statute,a,is pertinent to the validity of the and transfers.in contrast,a,pertaining to execution of transfers of copyright ownership,provides that a transfer of copyright ownership,other than by operation of law,is not valid unless an instrument of conveyance,or a note or memorandum of the transfer,is in writing and signed by the owner of the rights conveyed or such owner duly authorized agent.emphasis added.as have failed to show that southern was not tirado duly authorized agent,the district court correctly credited the and transfers to southern.
also challenge the district court conclusion that southern certificates of registration for una tercera persona and te sigo queriendo provided notice of conflicting ownership interests in those songs.at the time entered into agreements to obtain the copyrights to una tercera persona and te sigo queriendo,a review of the copyright office register would have revealed the registration certificates for those songs,giving notice that southern claimed the copyrights.see saenger,at.because failed to produce evidence that the copyright certificates are invalid,the district court correctly concluded,for purposes of summary judgment,that had notice of southern copyright claims and,for that reason,could not meet the good faith and lack of notice requirements of d.
payment allocation 
the publishers and filed summary judgment motions on claims of ownership and infringement of copyrights for songs.instead of deciding the motions,the court laid the groundwork for a special master to use in addressing the complex issues of ownership and infringement.on march,the district court appointed morton david goldberg,esquire,to serve as a special master in the case the court apportioned payment of the special master fees between the publishers and in equal portions and directed the special master to bill the parties monthly.the parties were each ordered to file a bond in the amount of.on appeal,challenge the district court decision to divide equally,between and the publishers,the obligation to pay the special master fees 
federal rule of civil procedure a,which governed in march of when the district court appointed the special master,gave the district court authority to allocate his fees as the court may direct.a under rule a,the district court enjoys broad discretion to allocate the master fees as it thinks best under the circumstances of the case.aird ford motor,see also charles alan wright arthur miller,federal practice procedure civil ed.therefore,a court decision on allocation is reviewed for abuse of discretion.morgan kerrigan,cir accord roy county of lexington,cir manhattan,sweater bee by banff,cir.an abuse of discretion occurs when a material factor deserving significant weight is ignored,when an improper factor is relied upon,or when all proper and no improper factors are assessed,but the court makes a serious mistake in weighing them.sheppard river valley fitness one,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
assert that the publishers should have been required to pay the majority of the fees because they had enormously disproportionate wealth and were responsible for complicating the case to include more than songs.also contend that the broadcasters should have paid some of the fees because they benefited from the special master work and were parties to the suit.equal apportionment of the fees between the publishers and,they argue,constituted an abuse of discretion.
such arguments might be persuasive if the record supported them.here,however,the record shows that initiated a copyright infringement case that foreseeably burgeoned into claims involving more than five hundred songs the record also shows that the district court gave repeated opportunities to demonstrate their inability to pay their share of the fees,which failed to do.with respect to the broadcasters benefit from the special master work,the publishers took their place through the indemnification provisions in the agreements between them and paid half of the fees,partially on their behalf.therefore,in the particular circumstances of this case,have not shown that the district court abused its discretion in the equal allocation of the special master fees.
in august of,the district court dismissed remaining claims,counterclaims,and defenses as a sanction for failing to comply with the court orders to post a bond for their share of the special master fees.challenge the sanction as being too extreme for the circumstances and,therefore,an abuse of discretion.
a dismissal entered to sanction a party for failure to comply with a court order or for failure to prosecute the case is reviewed for abuse of discretion,at.whether a sanction constitutes an abuse of discretion is determined by considering all of the pertinent circumstances,including the severity of the violation,the legitimacy of the party excuse,repetition of violations,the deliberateness vel non of the misconduct,mitigating excuses,prejudice to the other side and to the operations of the court,and the adequacy of lesser sanctions.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
the docket and record in this case show a pattern of delaying conduct by.the district court had previously imposed sanctions against because of unexcused delay in responding to a motion for summary judgment.after a year and a half of failing to comply with the order to post a bond for their share of the special master fees,the district court issued an ultimatum on october.the court ordered to post the bond within thirty days and warned that failure to comply would result in sanctions,including possible dismissal of their claims and defenses.after waiting for more than eight more months,during which time still did not post the ordered bond or provide adequate reasons for their failure to do so,on august,the district court dismissed remaining claims,counterclaims,and affirmative defenses as a sanction for their failure to comply with the court orders.under these circumstances,the district court sanction was not an abuse of discretion 
summary judgment in favor of the publishers 
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the publishers on their infringement claims against.on appeal,argue that the district court erred in holding that a certificate of copyright registration provides notice for purposes of d,that merely authorizing the use of songs constitutes copyright infringement,and that infringement could occur when had the right to license a fifty percent writer share of the disputed songs.the publishers,joined in part by ascap,defend the district court decision.
dispute the district court ruling that registration of a copyright constitutes notice for purpose of d.as they did in opposition to ascap claim to patacón,argue that recording,in compliance with c,should be required to provide notice under d.we previously rejected that argument,and the same result applies here.the district court interpretation of d was not erroneous.
writers share 
claim that they have not infringed the copyrights to the disputed songs because they were entitled to license a fifty percent writer performance share of acemla affiliated composers.they have not cited authority,however,to support a theory that a writer retains a fifty percent performance share in a song after relinquishing the copyright.in contrast to theory,the owner of a copyright has the exclusive rights to do and to authorize others to perform the copyrighted work publicly.see also,phillips pembroke real estate,cir discussing the limited rights retained by an artist after relinquishing the copyright to his work llc librarian of congress,discussing the exclusive performance rights held by copyright owner under digital millennium copyright act.
in addition,even if could support their retained performance rights theory,to the extent it is raised as a defense to the publishers infringement claims,it has been dismissed as part of the sanction imposed by the district court.
rescission 
challenged the publishers rights to some of the disputed songs on a rescission theory.specifically,argued that the publishers had failed to pay royalties under their agreements with the composers,which provided a basis for rescinding the agreements with those composers.the district court ruled that lacked standing to claim that the agreements should be rescinded.on appeal,contend that the district court decision was error.
a question of who may assert an otherwise justiciable claim is a question of prudential standing that does not implicate the court jurisdiction.baena kpmg llp,cir.a party generally must assert his own legal rights and interests,and can not rest his claim to relief on the legal rights or interests of third parties.kowalski tesmer,d internal quotation marks omitted.a party may assert a claim on behalf of another only when the party asserting the right has a close relationship with the person who possesses the right and when there is a hindrance to the possessor ability to protect his own interests.id.at.
the composers,not,were parties to the agreements in question.have not cited authority to show that they,as to the composers agreements with the publishers,may seek rescission.they have not shown a close relationship with the composers or a hindrance to the composers ability to protect their own rights.therefore,the district court correctly determined that lacked standing to assert that the composers agreements with the publishers should be rescinded.in addition,to the extent rescission is raised as a defense to the publishers infringement claims,it was dismissed by the district court as part of the sanction imposed on.
infringement 
challenge the district court conclusion that they infringed the publishers copyrights in the disputed songs by including them in the acemla catalog.they contend that merely authorizing the use of the songs,in the absence of proof that the songs were actually used in an infringing manner,is not infringement.the publishers argue that the particular circumstances of this case show conduct by beyond merely authorizing use of the songs.
provides the exclusive rights that are held by the owner of a copyright.one infringes a copyright when he or she violates one of the exclusive rights to a work held by a copyright owner,and the owner has the right to sue for infringement,at.mere authorization of an infringing act is an insufficient basis for copyright infringement,at.infringement depends upon whether an infringing act,such as copying or performing,has occurred.id.at.therefore,to prove infringement,a claimant must show an infringing act after the authorization.id.at.
in this case,the district court held that infringed the publishers copyrights by including songs assigned to the publishers in acemla catalog.the district court also noted that had songs available to be heard through their website and had distributed a compact disc that included some of the publishers songs.the publishers argue that knowingly hijacked their songs by including them in the acemla catalog,issued licenses to broadcasters for songs that they knew were assigned to someone else,and threatened and initiated litigation against broadcasters who played works in acemla catalog.
the publishers have not cited authority to show that including songs in a catalog,issuing licenses,and threatening litigation are infringing actions under.the district court identified eight songs that were available on acemla website and two of those songs,along with an additional song,that had been distributed by in a compact disc.while those might be infringing actions,only nine of the songs that were the subject of summary judgment are involved.in addition,the district court did not decide whether had committed infringing acts in addition to authorization,leaving a factual issue as to whether actions were infringing acts.in the absence of guidance from the district court and little assistance from the parties,we can not decide whether the record contains sufficient undisputed evidence of infringing acts to warrant summary judgment on infringement.
