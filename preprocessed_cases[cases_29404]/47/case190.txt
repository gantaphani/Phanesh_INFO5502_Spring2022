mge ups systems,mge appeals the district court federal rule of civil procedure a dismissal of its digital millennium copyright act dmca claim against power maintenance international,pmi general electric company ge ge consumer and industrial,and ge industrial systems,collectively.mge also appeals the district court denial of prejudgment interest on mge damages award.on four grounds whether the district court erred in dismissing rule a motion because mge failed to present evidence of damages,or in the alternative,whether the district court erred in dismissing rule b motion because the million jury award was not a reasonable calculation of damages whether mge impermissibly damages whether the parties had a tolling agreement in place that permitted mge to recover damages prior to december,and whether the district court erred in granting mge injunctive relief against.
uninterruptible power supply ups machines are used during periods of power outages to provide power to critical operating systems.mge manufactures several lines of ups machines,some of which require the use of mge copyrighted software programs pacret and muguet during servicing.this software fixes calibration problems more quickly than traditional manual servicing techniques.without the software,a service technician can still partially service an mge ups machine,but a number of critical procedures including recalibration and adjustment of voltage levels can only be performed through use of the software,which works only on devices.
the software requires connection of an external hardware security key called a dongle to the laptop serial port.each dongle has an expiration date,a maximum number of uses,and a unique password.when the software is activated,it searches for a properly programmed dongle before it will fully launch.once launched,the software will go through a second series of protocol exchanges with the data located on the ups machine microprocessors to confirm that mge software is communicating with mge hardware.if the protocol exchange is successful,mge software proceeds to collect system status information for the technician.
years after mge introduced its security technology,a number of software hackers published information on the internet disclosing general instructions on how to defeat the external security features of a hardware key.once the software is cracked and the security key is defeated,the software can be accessed and used without limitation.
pmi is a critical power service company servicing a variety of brands of ups machines,including mge ups machines.pmi initially subcontracted mge to perform software service on mge ups machines,but sometime before june,a group of pmi employees obtained at least one copy of mge software from an unknown source.ge acquired pmi in.
in december,mge filed suit against for,inter alia,copyright infringement,misappropriation of trade secrets,unfair competition,conversion,and dmca violations.does not dispute liability,inasmuch as it admits to recovering a laptop from a former pmi employee that contained hacked mge software,and admits to five instances of this software use from june through may.mge alleges that used the software a total of times,including uses after the district court granted mge a preliminary injunction against use of mge software and trade secrets.
during the proceedings for this action,moved,renewed,and motions for summary judgment and judgment as a matter of law pursuant to federal rules of civil procedure a and b arguing,inter alia,that mge could not sustain a dmca cause of action against.after initially denying pretrial motion for summary judgment and its rule a motion on mge dmca claim,the district court dismissed the dmca claim during an jury charge conference.the jury found that had infringed mge copyrights,misappropriated mge trade secrets,and committed unfair business practices.the jury awarded mge the following damages

the district court awarded mge the total jury verdict,interest,a permanent injunction against,impoundment of infringing materials,taxable costs,and attorney fees.the district court declined to award prejudgment interest on the damage awards.
mge argues that the district court erred in granting rule a motion dismissing mge dmca violation claim.we review de novo a trial court decision on a rule a motion for judgment as a matter of law,viewing all of the evidence in the light and with all reasonable inferences most favorable to the party opposed to the motion.resolution trust cramer,cir internal quotations omitted.a rule a motion is properly granted i f the facts and inferences point so strongly and overwhelmingly in favor of the moving party that reasonable jurors could not have arrived at a contrary verdict.id.citation omitted.
argues that mge dongle does not actually prevent copying of mge software,but merely prevents access to the software.once that access is breached,there are no barriers to copying the software.accordingly,argues that mge software is freely accessible within the meaning of the dmca because the dongle does not block the type of access the dmca is designed to prevent.furthermore,though the mge software in possession was modified to eliminate the need for a dongle,mge has not presented evidence that a pmi employee initially modified the software.
one of congress purposes behind enacting the dmca was targeting the circumvention of technological protections.see davidson assocs.jung,cir.the dmca provision states,no person shall circumvent a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under this title.a a.to circumvent a technological measure means to descramble a scrambled work,to decrypt an encrypted work,or otherwise to avoid,bypass,remove,deactivate,or impair a technological measure,without the authority of the copyright owner.id.a a.effectively controls access to a work means that the measure,in the ordinary course of its operation,requires the application of information,or a process or a treatment,with the authority of the copyright owner,to gain access to the work.id.a b.does not contest that mge software was a work protected under title of the copyright act.
the dmca does not describe the type of access controlling technological measure required to invoke the dmca protections,and this is an issue of first impression in this circuit.mge proposes a definition from a fifth circuit case that discussed copyright issues and determined access to include an opportunity to view the copyrighted work.ferguson broad,cir citing nimmer,copyright a.reading this definition alongside definitions from dictionary and black law dictionary,mge concludes that access means viewing,making use of,or using the protected work.mge argues that dongles prevented access to its software and that without using both this hardware key and its corresponding password,a user can not view,gain access to,or make use of the software.
however,mge advocates too broad a definition of access their interpretation would permit liability under a for accessing a work simply to view it or to use it within the purview of fair use permitted under the copyright act.merely bypassing a technological protection that restricts a user from viewing or using a work is insufficient to trigger the dmca provision.the dmca prohibits only forms of access that would violate or impinge on the protections that the copyright act otherwise affords copyright owners.see chamberlain group,skylink.the federal circuit,in analyzing the dmca provision,concluded that it convey s no additional property rights in and of themselves it simply provide s property owners with new ways to secure their property.id.at.indeed,virtually every clause of that mentions access links access to protection.id.at.without showing a link between access and protection of the copyrighted work,the dmca provision does not apply.the owner technological measure must protect the copyrighted material against an infringement of a right that the copyright act protects,not from mere use or viewing.id.at see also lexmark int l,static control components,cir finding no dmca liability where an authentication sequence in a printer microchip blocked one form of access printer function but permitted free access from other avenues for example,anyone who purchased that brand of printer could download a copy of the program.
here,mge has not shown that bypassing its dongle infringes a right protected by the copyright act.mge dongle merely prevents initial access to the software.if no dongle is detected,the software program will not complete the process.however,even if a dongle is present,it does not prevent the literal code or text of mge copyrighted computer software from being freely read and copied once that access is obtained there is no encryption or other form of protection on the software itself to prevent copyright violations.because the dongle does not protect against copyright violations,the mere fact that the dongle itself is circumvented does not give rise to a circumvention violation within the meaning of the dmca.
moreover,the dmca provision does not apply to the use of copyrighted works after the technological measure has been circumvented,targeting instead the circumvention itself.universal city studios,corley,cir.mge cites no evidence that a employee or representative was responsible for altering the pacret and muguet software such that a dongle was not required to use the software.without proving actually circumvented the technology as opposed to using technology already circumvented,mge does not present a valid dmca claim.see id.t he dmca targets the circumvention of digital walls guarding copyrighted material and trafficking in circumvention tools,but does not concern itself with the use of those materials after circumvention has occurred.
because the dmca does not apply to mere use of a copyrighted work,and because mge has not shown that circumvented mge software protections in violation of the dmca,the district court did not err in granting rule a motion dismissing mge dmca claim.
argues the district court erred in denying its rule a motion with regard to mge claim under the copyright act because the testimony of mge damages expert had been stricken,and mge improperly relied on pmi total gross revenue figure rather than the portion reasonably related to the copyright infringement.for the same reason,argues mge failed to prove all the elements of its state law misappropriation of trade secrets and unfair competition claims without introducing evidence of pmi profits related to the infringement,mge has failed to prove damages for these claims.
argues that the district court erred in denying its rule a motion because mge failed to present sufficient evidence of damages.under a and b,a copyright owner is permitted to recover his own actual damages,including lost profits and reasonable royalty rates,or what a willing buyer would have been reasonably required to pay a willing seller as a licensing fee for the actual use of the copyrighted material by the infringers.davis gap,cir.a copyright owner may also seek any profits of the infringer that are attributable to the infringement and are not taken into account in computing the actual damages.b.if the copyright owner chooses to claim infringer profits,the copyright owner is required to present proof only of the infringer gross revenue,and the infringer is required to prove his or her deductible expenses and the elements of profit attributable to factors other than the copyrighted work.see also estate of vane fair,cir applying this standard to copyright infringement action seeking infringer profits.argues that mge failed to satisfy the first step of proving infringer profits because mge only evidence of gross revenues was exhibit,a bar graph showing pmi total revenue from all lines of business from through.contends that this chart includes undifferentiated gross revenue from servicing a variety of brands of equipment,not merely mge equipment,and therefore does not reflect revenues attributable to the infringement.
o nce liability has been shown,b creates an initial presumption that the infringer profits attributable to the infringement are equal to its gross revenue.bonner dawson,cir alteration in original quoting b.in meeting its initial burden,however,a copyright holder must show more than the infringer total gross revenue from all of its profit streams rather,gross revenue refers only to revenue reasonably related to the infringement.id.emphases added see also davis,at finding proffered evidence of defendant total gross revenues too broad to support a copyright infringement claim based on defendant use of plaintiff copyrighted eyeglasses in an ad campaign estate of vane,at,finding that a figure for profits attributable to the television commercials that contained infringed material as a whole without accounting for the fact that the infringed material constituted only a fraction of any given commercial was too speculative a connection to sustain damages taylor meirick,cir finding insufficient for b purposes that plaintiff showed defendant gross revenues from the sales of all products instead of demonstrating gross revenues from sale of the infringing products.
mge sought over million in damages based almost exclusively on the testimony of its only damages expert,laurance prescott.prescott testimony related to two damage models mge lost profits and recovering a reasonable royalty.notably,prescott did not testify to profits attributable to the infringement.the district court carried federal rule of evidence and daubert objections to prescott testimony and permitted him to testify at trial.after hearing his testimony,the district court concluded that it should be stricken in its entirety,determining that prescott conclusions regarding mge lost profits were based on insufficient facts and data,including unsupported assumptions regarding mge lost market share and service pricing.the district court also found prescott had no experience in assessing hypothetical reasonable royalty rates and that his proffered hypothetical reasonable royalty rate was not based on objective analysis.
once prescott testimony was stricken,mge offered a final witness,mge general manager michael,who presented testimony relating only to mge reasonable royalty damages.was never designated as an expert on damage calculations.the district court ultimately found his testimony insufficient to permit mge to offer a jury instruction on reasonable royalty damages 
mge only remaining evidence of damages was,the bar graph indicating pmi total revenue from through.though this was an exhibit prepared by,the district court admitted the exhibit during prescott examination.mge questioned prescott only on the lack of ge revenue represented on graph.prescott was not questioned about whether the total pmi revenue indicated on the graph represented revenue related to pmi infringement of mge copyright 
argues that it would not have included in its proposed exhibits had it known that prescott testimony would be stricken because it had no idea mge would be seeking profits rather than mge own lost profits and reasonable royalties.mge contends that seeking defendant profits was not a new theory of recovery because the joint pretrial order indicates that it sought monetary damages pursuant to for copyright infringement.this provision encompasses all types of damages available for copyright infringement,including the copyright owner actual damages,the infringer profits attributable to the infringement,and statutory damages.however,in its federal rule of civil procedure a disclosures,when asked to provide a computation of each category of damages claimed,mge indicated that prescott testimony would comprise its damages calculation.prescott only testified to mge actual damages mge own lost profits and reasonable royalty rates.in other word
