in this architectural copyright infringement action,plaintiff appellant humphreys partners architects,hpa appeals the district court entry of summary judgment in favor of defendants appellees lessard design,lessard group,and christian lessard collectively,lessard clark builders group,llc clark pdt builders,llc,the penrose group,and sixth penrose investing,llc collectively,penrose and northwestern investment management,llc,and northwestern mutual life insurance collectively,northwestern.hpa claims that the design,development,ownership,and construction of two park crest,an apartment building in mclean,virginia,infringed hpa architectural copyright embodied in grant park,a condominium building in minneapolis,minnesota the district court awarded summary judgment to appellees,primarily because no reasonable jury could find that the grant park and two park crest designs are substantially similar.for the following reasons,we affirm.
hpa is an architecture firm based in dallas,texas,that designs residential buildings.in and,hpa designed a residential tower known as grant park.in,hpa registered the grant park design as an architectural work with the united states copyright office and received a certificate of copyright registration.the grant park building was constructed in minneapolis,minnesota,in.
grant park is a story condominium building with units per floor.it has two separate elevator cores,such that each floor has two elevator lobbies.the units on a typical floor open directly into these lobbies,five units into one and six into the other.the lobbies also each provide access to a stairwell and to either a trash chute or a room.residents can travel between the lobbies through an unfinished service corridor,which allows all residents to access both utility rooms and both stairwells.this layout is desirable because it eliminates the need for a finished central hallway and fosters a sense of community among the units sharing a lobby.
in,penrose began developing a apartment building called two park crest for construction in mclean,virginia.in,it solicited design proposals from three architecture firms,including hpa and lessard,a firm based in vienna,virginia.hpa submitted illustrations of its grant park design in september and met with penrose in october.
on november,penrose informed lessard that it wanted the two park crest design to feature dual elevator cores connected by a service corridor,and emailed lessard the grant park floorplan to illustrate the concept.later that month,on november,lessard emailed penrose a preliminary sketch of a design with two elevator cores penrose responded that the design was looking good.lessard ultimately submitted a design for a story building with apartments per floor.the design incorporated three elevator cores two passenger elevator cores connected by an unfinished hallway,and a service elevator core accessible from that hallway.of the apartments per floor,would open directly into one passenger elevator lobby and would open directly into the other.
on november,penrose told hpa that it had hired lessard to design the two park crest project.penrose subsequently sold the project to northwestern.in november,northwestern hired clark to construct two park crest.clark began constructing the building in january.
in april,hpa filed this action against under et,alleging one count of copyright infringement against each appellee.following discovery,the parties for summary judgment.appellees argued that they were not liable to hpa because,among other reasons,they did not copy the grant park design and the two designs are not substantially similar.appellees supported their motions with expert reports filed by three architects stephen gresham,robert greenstreet,and douglas carter who concluded in their reports that the two designs are not substantially similar.
hpa argued in its motion and responses to appellees motions that lessard copied the grant park design after receiving that design from penrose.it claimed that the speed with which lessard created the two park crest design is direct evidence of copying,and that the similarities between the two designs is circumstantial evidence of copying.hpa supported its claim that the two designs are substantially similar with a declaration from architect and hpa expert daniel figert,who identified nine characteristics shared by both designs for example,both designs are for buildings that are approximately twenty stories tall,that have two elevator lobbies connected by a service corridor,and that provide direct access to units from the elevator lobbies hpa argued that the presence and arrangement of these nine features in two park crest infringed its copyright in the grant park design.
hpa also moved to strike gresham,greenstreet,and carter expert reports on the ground that those reports were inadmissible hearsay.in response,appellees provided declarations from the experts verifying the contents of their reports and stating that they would testify at trial to the substance thereof.the district court then denied hpa motions to strike,reasoning that the declarations,although belated,cured hpa objection.
on september,the district court granted appellees motions for summary judgment.the court determined that summary judgment was appropriate because,among other reasons,there was no direct evidence of copying,and no reasonable jury could find that the grant park and two park crest designs are extrinsically,objectively similar.
the court held that the two designs are not extrinsically similar for two independently sufficient reasons.first,neither the nine features that figert identified nor their arrangement in grant park is eligible for copyright protection.and second,those features are presented and arranged differently in the two park crest design.with respect to the arrangement of the nine features in the two designs,the court noted that appellees experts had provided detailed explanations as to how the two designs differ with respect to their size,footprints,floorplans,and exterior appearances.hpa expert,in contrast,offer ed no evidence as to what makes the two arrangements extrinsically similar.humphreys partners architects,lessard design,d.the court concluded that appellees were entitled to summary judgment based on the results of the extrinsic similarity analysis.id.hpa timely appealed.
before turning to hpa arguments on appeal,we set forth the law governing architectural copyright infringement claims.copyright protection subsists in original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression from which they can be perceived,reproduced,or otherwise communicated a.in,congress expanded the scope of works of authorship to include architectural works,id.a,by enacting the architectural works copyright protection act the awcpa,stat.codified in various sections of.the awcpa defines an architectural work as the design of a building as embodied in any tangible medium of expression.the work includes the overall form as well as the arrangement and composition of spaces and elements in the design,but does not include individual standard features.id.the awcpa legislative history explains that the arrangement and composition of spaces and elements is protectable because creativity in architecture frequently takes the form of a selection,coordination,or arrangement of unprotectible elements into an original,protectible whole,at,reprinted in.
to establish a claim for copyright infringement,a plaintiff must prove that it owned a valid copyright and that the defendant copied the original elements of that copyright.lyons,l.morris costumes,cir.copying can be proven through direct or circumstantial evidence.graphics,lennar,cir.
direct evidence of copying includes evidence such as party admissions,witness accounts of the physical act of copying,and common errors in the works of plaintiffs and the defendants.rottlund pinnacle,cir.in kramer manufacturing andrews,cir,for example,we found direct evidence of copying where t he computer programs in the record were virtually identical and the defendants program,like plaintiff,included a hidden legend that would appear only when the program buttons were pressed in an abnormal sequence,id.at.similarly,our sister circuits have found direct evidence of copying where a defendant gave explicit instruction that a work be copied,rogers koons,cir,and where the defendant admitted to copying the plaintiff work,see,enter.mgmt.warrick,cir soc y of holy transfiguration monastery,gregory,cir.
where direct evidence of copying is lacking,the plaintiff may prove copying by circumstantial evidence in the form of proof that the alleged infringer had access to the work and that the supposed copy is substantially similar to the author original work.bouchat baltimore ravens,cir.to show substantial similarity,the plaintiff must establish that the two works are both extrinsically and intrinsically similar.universal furniture int l,collezione europa usa,cir.the extrinsic inquiry is an objective one that looks to external criteria of substantial similarity between the alleged copy and the protected elements of the copyrighted work.id.at quoting apple computer,microsoft,cir.the intrinsic inquiry,in contrast,implicates the perspective of the works intended observer and looks to the total concept and feel of the works id.at quoting lyons,at.
while we have applied this substantial similarity test in a variety of copyright contexts,we have not expressly held in a published opinion that this test governs claims of architectural copyright infringement.the parties both argue,and the district court determined,that the test governs.we agree,and therefore hold that the test for determining substantial similarity is applicable to a copyright infringement claim involving architectural works.charles ross builder,olsen fine home,llc,app x,cir see also.graphics,at stating in dicta that the court would apply the test to a claim of architectural copyright infringement.
we turn now to hpa arguments on appeal.hpa claims that the district court erred in three respects by considering appellees expert reports when resolving the motions for summary judgment by failing to credit hpa direct and circumstantial evidence of copying and by making various errors of copyright law.we consider each argument in turn.
we begin with hpa argument that the district court erred by considering appellees expert reports,a claim we review for abuse of discretion.see nader blair,cir reviewing admissibility of affidavits at summary judgment stage for abuse of discretion eeoc freeman,cir we review a district court decision to admit or to exclude expert evidence for an abuse of discretion.
hpa maintains that,because these reports were inadmissible hearsay,they were not evidence upon which the court could grant summary judgment.appellant br.at.appellees respond that the district court acted within its discretion when considering the expert reports because those reports were both sworn to in declarations filed in response to hpa objection and the content of the reports would be admissible through the expert testimony at trial.appellees br.at.we agree with appellees that the district court did not err by considering the reports.
the court and the parties have great flexibility with regard to the evidence that may be used on a summary judgment proceeding.charles alan wright,arthur miller mary kay kane,federal practice and procedure ed.the court may consider materials that would themselves be admissible at trial,and the content or substance of otherwise inadmissible materials where the the party submitting the evidence show s that it will be possible to put the information into an admissible form.james moore et,moore federal practice ed.if the nonmovant objects to the court consideration of material cited to support or dispute a fact.c,the movant has the burden to show that the material is admissible as presented or to explain the admissible form that is anticipated.advisory committee note.
here,the admissibility of the reports themselves is immaterial because appellees explain ed the admissible form that is anticipated.id.appellees submitted declarations made under penalty of perjury from the experts attesting that they would testify to the matters set forth in their respective report s.greenstreet,carter accord gresham.and s ubsequent verification or reaffirmation of an unsworn expert report,either by affidavit or deposition,allows the court to consider the unsworn expert report on a motion for summary judgment.dg g,flexsol packaging of pompano beach,cir quoting maytag electrolux home,d.hpa does not claim that the experts declarations are deficient or that the experts testimony would be inadmissible at trial.we therefore find no error in the district court consideration of the experts reports 
we turn now to hpa argument that the district court failed to credit hpa direct and circumstantial evidence of copying when granting summary judgment to appellees.as the district court noted,summary judgment is appropriate if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a.we review de novo a district court award of summary judgment,viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.boyer liberto fontainebleau,wl,at cir.may,en banc.
hpa first argues that the district court ignored hpa evidence when it stated that there was no direct evidence of copying.appellant br.at.hpa submits that the development of lessard sketches establishes direct evidence of copying,id.at,particularly when viewed in concert with figert deposition testimony.figert stated in relevant part it appears that rather than going through the normal iterative design process,that lessard had a preconceived solution to the design.id.quoting.
this evidence is not direct evidence of copying.that lessard may have created its design with more speed and less revision than is typical in the industry is consistent with hpa theory that lessard copied its design,but it does not itself establish copying and figert did not claim to have personal knowledge that lessard copied the grant park design.in fact,figert made clear in his deposition that he was not prepared to state that lessard copied the design.asked whether it was his opinion that lessard copied the grant park design,figert responded,i was not asked to give an opinion about whether or not there was a copy made i pass on giving a conclusion as to whether or not i think they copied it or not.because hpa presented no direct evidence of copying,the district court did not err by stating that direct evidence of copying does not exist here.humphreys partners architects,lessard design,d.
hpa next argues that the district court resolved disputed issues of fact in appellees favor and failed to credit hpa evidence when considering whether the two designs are extrinsically similar specifically,hpa claims that the district court failed to credit its evidence showing that the overall form and composition of the works was similar.appellant br.at.this argument presents a closer question then does hpa claim.we address it by outlining the parties respective burdens at summary judgment,and then considering whether appellees and hpa met those burdens.
the party moving for summary judgment discharges its burden by showing that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party case.kitchen upshaw,cir.if the movant discharges this burden,the nonmoving party must present specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.blair defender,cir quoting white rockingham radiologists,cir.to create a genuine issue for trial,the nonmoving party must rely on more than conclusory allegations,mere speculation,the building of one inference upon another,or the mere existence of a scintilla of evidence.dash mayweather,cir.in other words,a factual dispute is genuine only where the version is supported by sufficient evidence to permit a reasonable jury to find in its favor.stone of.med,cir.
here,appellees carried their initial burden of showing that is,pointing out to the district court that there is an absence of evidence to support hpa case.celotex catrett.they explained in their motions that no evidence suggests that two park crest and grant park have a substant
