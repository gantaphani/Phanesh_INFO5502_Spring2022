the original opinion in this case was issued by the panel on july.treating the petition for rehearing en banc as one for panel rehearing,we grant the petition in part,withdraw our previous opinion cir,and substitute the following.
mge ups systems,mge appeals the district court federal rule of civil procedure a dismissal of its digital millennium copyright act dmca claim against power maintenance international,pmi general electric company ge ge consumer and industrial,and ge industrial systems,collectively.mge also appeals the district court denial of prejudgment interest on mge damages award.on four grounds whether the district court erred in dismissing rule a motion because mge failed to present evidence of damages,or in the alternative,whether the district court erred in dismissing rule b motion because the million jury award was not a reasonable calculation of damages whether mge impermissibly damages whether the parties had a tolling agreement in place that permitted mge to recover damages prior to december,and whether the district court erred in granting mge injunctive relief against.
uninterruptible power supply ups machines are used during periods of power outages to provide power to critical operating systems.mge manufactures several lines of ups machines,some of which require the use of mge copyrighted software programs pacret and muguet during servicing.this software fixes calibration problems more quickly than traditional manual servicing techniques.without the software,a service technician can still partially service an mge ups machine,but a number of critical procedures including recalibration and adjustment of voltage levels can only be performed through use of the software,which works only on devices.
the software requires connection of an external hardware security key called a dongle to the laptop serial port.each dongle has an expiration date,a maximum number of uses,and a unique password.when the software is activated,it searches for a properly programmed dongle before it will fully launch.once launched,the software will go through a second series of protocol exchanges with the data located on the ups machine microprocessors to confirm that mge software is communicating with mge hardware.if the protocol exchange is successful,mge software proceeds to collect system status information for the technician.
years after mge introduced its security technology,a number of software hackers published information on the internet disclosing general instructions on how to defeat the external security features of a hardware key.once the software is cracked and the security key is defeated,the software can be accessed and used without limitation.
pmi is a critical power service company servicing a variety of brands of ups machines,including mge ups machines.pmi initially subcontracted mge to perform software service on mge ups machines,but sometime before june,a group of pmi employees obtained at least one copy of mge software from an unknown source.ge acquired pmi in.
in december,mge filed suit against for,inter alia,copyright infringement,misappropriation of trade secrets,unfair competition,conversion,and dmca violations.does not dispute liability,inasmuch as it admits to recovering a laptop from a former pmi employee that contained hacked mge software,and admits to five instances of this software use from june through may.mge alleges that used the software a total of times,including uses after the district court granted mge a preliminary injunction against use of mge software and trade secrets.
during the proceedings for this action,moved,renewed,and motions for summary judgment and judgment as a matter of law pursuant to federal rules of civil procedure a and b arguing,inter alia,that mge could not sustain a dmca cause of action against.after initially denying pretrial motion for summary judgment and its rule a motion on mge dmca claim,the district court dismissed the dmca claim during an jury charge conference.the jury found that had infringed mge copyrights,misappropriated mge trade secrets,and committed unfair business practices.the jury awarded mge the following damages 
damages for misappropriation of trade secrets on mge data disk 
net profits earned by from january,to december,
net profits earned by from december,to august,
damages for copyright infringement 
net profits earned by from january,to december,
net profits earned by from december,to august,
damages for misappropriation of mge software trade secrets 
net profits earned by from january,to december,
net profits earned by from december,to august,
the district court awarded mge the total jury verdict,interest,a permanent injunction against,impoundment of infringing materials,taxable costs,and attorney fees.the district court declined to award prejudgment interest on the damage awards.
mge argues that the district court erred in granting rule a motion dismissing mge dmca violation claim.we review de novo a trial court decision on a rule a motion for judgment as a matter of law,viewing all of the evidence in the light and with all reasonable inferences most favorable to the party opposed to the motion.resolution trust cramer,cir internal quotations omitted.a rule a motion is properly granted i f the facts and inferences point so strongly and overwhelmingly in favor of the moving party that reasonable jurors could not have arrived at a contrary verdict.id.citation omitted.
argues that mge has failed to show that the dmca provision applied to the actions of the employees,because it cites no evidence that a employee or representative was responsible for circumventing the security features of mge software as opposed to merely using the software after some other party disabled the code requiring a dongle.as a result,argues,its actions did not violate the dmca and would,at most,have amounted to copyright infringement.
one of congress purposes behind enacting the dmca was targeting the circumvention of technological protections.davidson assocs.jung,cir.the dmca provision states,no person shall circumvent a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under this title.a a.to circumvent a technological measure means to descramble a scrambled work,to decrypt an encrypted work,or otherwise to avoid,bypass,remove,deactivate,or impair a technological measure,without the authority of the copyright owner.id.a a.effectively controls access to a work means that the measure,in the ordinary course of its operation,requires the application of information,or a process or a treatment,with the authority of the copyright owner,to gain access to the work.id.a b.
because a is targeted at circumvention,it does not apply to the use of copyrighted works after the technological measure has been circumvented.see universal city studios,corley,cir.t he dmca targets the circumvention of digital walls guarding copyrighted material and trafficking in circumvention tools,but does not concern itself with the use of those materials after circumvention has occurred.the issue,therefore,is not whether the technological measures that effectively controlled access to mge software were circumvented at some point,but whether the actions of own representatives amounted to circumvention.the dmca defines circumvention broadly to include not only disabling protections,but also avoiding or bypassing them.see a a.we,however,do not construe bypass or avoid to encompass use of a copyrighted work subsequent to a circumvention merely because that use would have been subject to a technological measure that would have controlled access to the work,but for that circumvention.so broad a construction would extend the dmca beyond its intended purposes to reach extensive conduct already by existing copyright laws.mge did not present any evidence showing that a representative altered the pacret and muguet software such that a dongle was not required to use the software rather,employees simply used the software after the alteration was made.as such,the actions by employees did not amount to circumvention.without proving actually circumvented the technology,mge does not present a valid dmca claim.
