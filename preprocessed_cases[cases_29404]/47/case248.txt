in this copyright infringement dispute,automation by design,abd alleges that raybestos products company,a wholly owned subsidiary of raytech,together raybestos or rpc infringed on its copyright and breached their agreement when it hired production design services,pdsi to build a duplicate machine of one that abd had designed and built for raybestos several years earlier.because we find that raybestos did not violate the terms of the license agreement,we affirm the decision of the district court granting summary judgment and declaratory judgment in favor of the defendants,raybestos and pdsi.
raybestos manufactures parts used in the automotive industry.in late or early it contacted abd,a designer and manufacturer of automated assembly machines,to initiate negotiations for a contract to manufacture an automated clutch plate assembly machine to replace an existing one.representatives from the companies met several times and abd submitted three separate offers,none of which was accepted by raybestos.on june,following further discussions by the parties,abd sent raybestos a letter offering to build the clutch plate assembly machine for.among other things,the june offer letter memorialized the parties earlier agreement that raybestos would itself purchase all of the component parts for the machine,allegedly due to concerns about abd financial health.the letter also contained the following language which forms the gordian knot of this case 
abd grants rpc the right to duplicate any or all design copyrighted by abd,as it relates to this project.this license is and is only for equipment to be used exclusively by rpc and does include any equipment to be fabricated for resale or transferred to a customer or supplier of rpc.
raybestos accepted the terms of this june offer letter and,on june,issued a purchase order.the purchase order required,among other things,that abd design,construct,and install a clutch plate assembly machine and provide raybestos with a reproducible set of machine drawings.the purchase order also reflected the parties agreement that the price for duplicates of this machine will be for not more than of the price of this machine.at,ex.n.abd accepted the terms of the purchase order and designed,manufactured and,sometime in the summer of,installed the machine and delivered to raybestos all of the documentation specified in the purchase order,including the machine design drawings.abd affixed a copyright symbol to each drawing.
all remained well until late or early,when raybestos contacted abd and requested a quote for a second machine expecting the discount described in the june,purchase order.the quote from abd,however,was not less than the price of the first machine,but rather it was higher.abd asserts that because raybestos requested over thirty material changes to the machine,abd did not view the second machine as a duplicate of the original,subject to the terms of the discount.raybestos disagreed.
smarting from the higher quote,raybestos sought bids from alternate suppliers,but continued to negotiate with abd.during negotiations,raybestos informed abd that it had received a bid for nearly less than abd bid.in response,on july,abd attorney delivered a letter to raybestos declaring that the plans are the exclusive property of automation by design,and may not be reproduced or used by raybestos or provided by raybestos to any third party for its use.at,ex.v.raybestos countered this claim by pointing to the language of the purchase order granting raybestos the right to duplicate any or all designs for equipment to be used exclusively by raybestos.abd letter also revoked the license effective immediately and demanded the return of the designs.raybestos disagreed with abd interpretation of the contract language and continued to pursue alternate suppliers.toward that end,during fall,raybestos made three copies of the machine manual.ken harlan,raybestos manager of technical services,delivered one copy of the manual to each of six different suppliers with directions to return the copy with its bid along with a confidentiality agreement.when one supplier returned the copy of the machine manual,harlan delivered that same copy to another supplier.all of the copies of the machine manual were returned to raybestos with the bids.ultimately raybestos chose pdsi to design and install the second machine,incorporating the changes requested by raybestos,and,some time after june,raybestos provided pdsi with a copy of abd drawings to use during the manufacturing process.pdsi made a photocopy of the abd drawings and used the manual to obtain the list of component suppliers and to identify the various changes that raybestos requested.at the end of its process,pdsi generated a complete set of its own drawings for the machine it built.
on march,abd registered its copyright with the copyright office abd does not hold a patent on the abd machine or any part of it.abd subsequently brought a claim against raybestos and pdsi alleging copyright infringement and breach of contract and requesting declaratory relief.raybestos and pdsi counterclaimed for breach of contract and declaratory relief.upon the defendants motion,the district court granted summary judgment for the defendants.thereafter the defendants moved the district court for entry of a declaratory judgment in their favor and against abd.raybestos separately moved to voluntarily dismiss its breach of contract claim.the district court granted the defendants motions and entered final judgment in favor of the defendants and against abd.abd appeals and we affirm.
for the most part the parties do not dispute the course of events described above with minor disagreements regarding motivation and intent.the crux of the dispute is whether the language of abd june letter,and raybestos responsive purchase order of june,which together formed the contract between the parties,allowed raybestos to act as it is,to hire pdsi to create a second clutch plate assembly machine.because the primary question is interpretation of a written contract,this matter is particularly amenable to summary judgment,cherry auburn gear,cir explaining that where there is no contractual ambiguity,a contract interpretation is a matter of law orthodontic affiliates,long,generally,the construction of a written contract is a question of law for which summary judgment is particularly appropriate,which we will grant after de novo review if there are no questions of material fact and the defendants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c hess mach.tool,cir.
copyright infringement.
although the united states copyright act,grants exclusive jurisdiction for infringement claims to the federal courts,those courts construe copyrights as contracts and turn to the relevant state law to interpret them.kennedy juvenile ass n,cir.the district court properly turned to indiana law to resolve the dispute between these two corporations whose principal places of business are in indiana.at.under indiana contract law,interpretation of an unambiguous contract is a matter of law that can be resolved on summary judgment.orthodontic affiliates,at.ambiguous contracts,on the other hand,must be set before a trier of fact to ascertain the facts necessary to construe the contract.id.when a court grants summary judgment it has necessarily determined that the contract is not ambiguous or that any existing ambiguity can be resolved without the aid of a factual determination.perryman motorist mut.ins.
abd maintains that the contract at issue in this case is ambiguous and that it can not be interpreted without resort to parol evidence.raybestos counters that abd failed to make this argument to the district court and therefore has waived the right to do so in this court.although it is true that the arguments were framed slightly differently in the summary judgment briefing below at,abd sufficiently raised the question of ambiguity to preserve its right to argue to this court that the language of the contract fails to clearly define which subdivided copyrights abd granted to question to which we now turn.
the rights comprised in a copyright may be subdivided and transferred.d any of the exclusive rights comprised in a copyright,including any subdivision of any of the rights specified by section,may be transferred as provided by clause and owned separately.in other words,a copyright holder may transfer the right to duplicate to one person,the right to distribute to another,and the right to produce derivative works to yet another.see itofca megatrans logistics,cir making and selling are distinct rights and you can assign one without the other.this case turns on which subdividable rights abd granted to raybestos.
to determine which rights abd granted to raybestos,we look to the language of the agreement.if,and only if,the language is ambiguous may we turn to evidence outside of the four corners of the agreement to determine the parameters of the license.magee.the language of a contract is not ambiguous simply because the parties disagree as to the meaning of the terms.simon prop.group.sporting goods.a contract is ambiguous only where a reasonable person could find its terms susceptible to more than one interpretation.cummins mcintosh.to determine if there are any ambiguities in the contested two sentences of the june,letter,we begin by eliminating that which is clear.both parties agree that the license unambiguously gave raybestos the right to duplicate the designs of the clutch plate assembly machine.the language as to this point is unequivocally clear abd grants rpc the right to duplicate any or all design copyrighted by abd,as it relates to this project.at,ex.m.
the next sentence of the keystone paragraph states that the license that is,the right to duplicate any or all design is only for equipment to be used exclusively by rpc.the question then becomes what does it mean to be permitted to use a license for equipment.one obvious way to use a right to duplicate the design license for equipment is to duplicate that equipment.consequently,the language on its face appears to allow raybestos to duplicate the equipment.indeed,abd itself agrees that raybestos could duplicate the equipment,so on this point the language is clear.abd argues,however,that raybestos could duplicate only parts of the equipment and then solely for the purpose of maintenance and repair.abd brief at,reply brief at.as evidence for this proposition,abd points to its june,letter to raybestos which states,for maintenance and repair purposes,raybestos products company does have the right to duplicate parts of the assembler.at,ex.m.as just noted above,however,where the terms of a contract are clear and unambiguous,this court can not consider extrinsic evidence.magee,at.the parties agreement as to the meaning of this raybestos had the right to duplicate vigorous proof of the clarity of language.indeed,if the parties agree as to the meaning,it seems certain that a reasonable person could interpret this language in only one way.see cummins,at.the major dispute then turns on whether raybestos had the right to duplicate only parts of the equipment,as abd maintains,or to duplicate the machine in toto,as raybestos question to which we will turn momentarily.in any case,reviewing the controverted language to this point,we can conclude that resort to extrinsic evidence is unavailable given the lack of ambiguity in the agreement.
interestingly,even if we were to consider the proffered parol evidence,that evidence only would serve to clarify this interpretation.the letter to which abd refers makes clear that the agreement allows raybestos to use the designs to duplicate parts of the machinery as opposed to simply duplicating the design itself,as by photocopy.raybestos insists that the letter makes clear that raybestos could duplicate parts solely for maintenance and repair purposes for maintenance and replacement purposes,raybestos products company does have the right to duplicate parts of the assembler.at,ex.s.nothing in that letter,however,limits raybestos to duplicating parts for maintenance and repair only.the letter,after all,was written in response to raybestos purchase order for a specific part,and only addresses,therefore,raybestos right to replace that particular part.to understand raybestos copyright permission in other contexts,one would have to turn back to the language of the agreement which,as we interpreted above,issues a broad grant to duplicate any or all designs for the equipment.in this way the extrinsic evidence further clarifies the language of the agreement which,on its face,grants raybestos the right to use the license to duplicate parts of the equipment.
we emphasize,however,that because the language of the contract is subject to only one interpretation,we need not and will not rely on extrinsic evidence to guide our way.similarly,the court can not add to,vary,or explain the terms of this unambiguous agreement.cooper cooper.consequently,we reject abd invitation to the court to interpret the contract or add language to it limiting the license to the repair and maintenance of the machine.
turning to the second sentence of the disputed paragraph,abd letter states that the license is language that is similarly unambiguous.in other words,whatever rights abd granted to raybestos,raybestos could not transfer those rights to another.the sentence that follows augments and clarifies this conclusion the license is only for equipment to be used exclusively by raybestos this language indicates that abd intended to prevent raybestos from using abd designs to enter the clutch plate assembly business is from manufacturing clutch plate assembly machines for sale to others.similarly,it intended to prevent raybestos from transferring the designs to a third party to manufacture equipment to be used by or sold to entities other than raybestos.
after this point,however,the streak of clarity ends.recall the language of the june letter 
abd grants rpc the right to duplicate any or all design copyrighted by abd,as it relates to this project.this license is and is only for equipment to be used exclusively by rpc and does include any equipment to be fabricated for resale or transferred to a customer or supplier of rpc.
at,ex.m,both bold and italicized emphasis ours.the second sentence of this paragraph is made up of two clauses which appear to contradict one another.in the first clause it restricts raybestos use of the license to equipment to be used exclusively by raybestos.the second half of the sentence,however,seems to allow raybestos the use of the license to fabricate equipment for resale or to transfer equipment to a customer or seemingly limitless grant of permission to use the license,including a grant to use the license to compete directly with abd.neither party mentions this contradiction in the briefing before this court and the district court ignores it as well,most likely because all parties assumed,as we do,that abd meant to include the word not between the word does and include.in fact,in depositions the deponents repeatedly read the contract to include the word not.resolving this ambiguity is not necessary for the resolution of this matter indeed,as just noted,neither the parties nor the district court mentioned it.such a glaring contradiction in the key paragraph of the contractual language warrants mention,however,if not resolution.we could resolve the matter simply by applying the doctrine of mutual mistake,and,since the ambiguity is one that can be resolved without aid of a factual determination,it does not prevent a grant of summary judgment.see perryman,at.but because such resolution is not necessary for a decision in this case,we mention the contradiction solely for the sake of thoroughness.
having reviewed all of the key language of the contract,we can turn to the parties arguments regarding the alleged transfer of the design.according to abd,raybestos violated the agreement when it transferred the design to pdsi for the purpose of allowing pdsi to manufacture a duplicate machine for raybestos use.abd makes two claims regarding transferability and distribution.the first is that the license did not permit any distribution or transfer whatsoever the language of the license clearly states that the license is.abd brief the use of the term nontransferable means nontransferable.oral argument at sec a bsent from the language the license,however,is any right to distribute the designs.abd brief there is no question but that the license language does not permit distribution.id.it is without question that the express language of the license prohibited the transfer of any duplication rights to any third party,including pdsi.id.at o n it face,the license did not grant any rights of distribution.id.at.at the same time,it concedes that,despite the language on the face of the agreement,raybestos had an implicit right of distribution for the sole purpose of maintaining and repairing the machine,oral argument at sec one that was not apparent from any language in the agreement,but solely from the extrinsic evidence.abd brief at,reply brief at.in short,abd simultaneously argues that means period,but also states that there are exceptions to the prohibition of transferability.raybestos position,on the other hand,is that defining the scope of a permissible transfer is unnecessary as raybestos never transferred or attempted to transfer the license to pdsi.appellee brief at.rather,the license applied to pdsi as raybestos agent.id.
abd counters that pdsi could not have been raybestos agent because the two parties signed an agreement which specifically defined their relationship as that of independent contractors and not agents.at,ex.this puts too fine a point on it.we need not delve into a complex discussion of agency to understand the term as raybestos uses it here.raybestos hired pdsi to act for or in place of itself,as a representative.see black law dictionary,ed defining agent as o ne who is authorized to act for or in place of another a representative.regardless of how the two parties chose to define their relationship for remuneration,tax,employment law,or tort liability purposes,for purposes of determining whether a transfer occurred,it seems clear that raybestos simply hired pdsi to act in raybestos the design to create a machine that it likely did not have the capacity to create on its own.to see that raybestos had the right to use the designs in this manner we need only look to a more example.take,for instance,raybestos right to duplicate the designs.all parties agree that this language clearly allowed raybestos to make photocopies of the designs.if,however,raybestos lacked the capacity to photocopy the designs on sight if,for example,the designs were to large for an ordinary copier or needed to be reproduced in color,raybestos could certainly take the designs to a kinko photocopy shop to have them copied.similarly,if it lacked the capacity to manufacture parts on its own,it had the right to hire another to do so in its stead.it is true,as the dissent points out,that pdsi benefitted from having the designs.it benefitted in part,however,in the same way that kinkos might benefit from being awarded a photocopy job.additionally,of course,pdsi saved considerable time and expense by not having to reinvent the wheel.but again,had raybestos opted to put engineers and manufacturers on its payroll to complete the job on its own,it would have saved considerable expense by having the designs rather than being forced to reverse engineer the machine.the benefit of having the designs,therefore,was raybestos benefit for which it paid.without the designs,raybestos would have had to start from contingency it avoided by requiring access to the designs as a term of the agreement.the dissent would return this case to the district court for further proceedings to determine whether pdsi low bid on the replacement machine and its possession of the existing machine designs was merely coincidental in the face of a reasonable inference to the contrary.post at.as the above discussion demonstrates,however,the answer to that question is irrelevant.once raybestos secured the rights to duplicate the designs and use the license to duplicate machinery,it could hire another party to manufacture parts for it if raybestos lacked the tools or skills to do so itself.
allowing one agent or contractor to use designs for one own benefit is not a transfer.the definition of a transfer under the copyright act is not helpful in this context as it explicitly excludes from its definition licenses like the one in this case other general definitions of transfer,like the one from black law dictionary,are perhaps more helpful.black defines a transfer as a ny mode of disposing of or parting with an asset or an interest in an asset,including a gift,the payment of money,release,lease,or creation of a lien or other encumbrance negotiation of an instrument according to the forms of law a conveyance of property or title from one person to another.black law dictionary ed.surely raybestos never intended to part with whatever license rights it had.raybestos needed then,and likely needs today,the ability to use the designs to operate and maintain its machinery.furthermore,pdsi signed a secrecy and confidentiality agreement agreeing not to use any proprietary information it gained in its work with raybestos for commercial use,so it has no continuing need or ability to use the license.at,ex.x.
the second sentence of the disputed agreement language further explains the parameters of what the parties intended to constitute a transfer.the license is only for equipment to be used exclusively by rpc.in other words,the purpose of prohibiting a transfer was to prevent raybestos or third parties from going into the clutch plate assembly business and selling such equipment to others.the license permitted raybestos to employ the designs only for its own is precisely what it did.
this no transfer up all but one aspect of the copyright infringement claims in this case.abd argues that although raybestos could duplicate and manufacture parts of the machinery on its own,it could not duplicate the machinery as a whole.but once abd admitted that raybestos could duplicate parts of the equipment for maintenance and repair,this fight was over.for there is nothing in the contract language that would distinguish between copying and making derivative works for one or more parts,from copying the machine as a whole.and,as explained above,whatever rights raybestos had to duplicate,it could hire pdsi to do so in its stead.the dissent argues that the right of duplication was limited to the project which the dissent claims was only the first machine.post at.from this the dissent concludes that raybestos implied right of distribution should not extend beyond making spare and replacements parts for the first machine because abd has not admitted such a right of distribution.id.emphasis ours.but this leap in logic works only if we grant abd request to interpret the contract to add such limiting is if we accept abd contention that the contract implies something that it does not say.and for the reasons described above,we can not.furthermore,the language points to the opposite result.if the license grants a right of duplication as it relates to the project,as the dissent states,and the project is defined as the first machine,then raybestos had the right to duplicate the first machine in toto.the district court correctly granted summary judgment for raybestos and pdsi on this copyright infringement claim.
revocation of the license.
because raybestos did not materially breach the license agreement,the district court was correct in determining that abd could not revoke the license for breach of the agreement.at.we turn consequently to the only remaining question in this abd could terminate the license at will.
under indiana law,a contract which provides no termination date is terminable at will by either party.rogier am.testing and eng g,marksill specialties,barger.furthermore,state law governing contract termination does not conflict with and is therefore not by the federal copyright act.walthal rusk,cir.in other words,if a contract is terminable at will under indiana law,nothing in the federal copyright act would prevent such a termination.
according to abd,because the contract provided no termination date or fixed duration,abd could terminate it at will.in support of its position it
