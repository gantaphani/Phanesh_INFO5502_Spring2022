cosmetic ideas,cosmetic appeals the decision of the united states district court for the central district of california district court dismissing its claims against,home shopping network,hsn lp,and hsn general partner llc collectively,hsn for lack of jurisdiction.the district court determined that cosmetic failed to comply with the registration requirement of a,which makes registration of a copyright a prerequisite to bringing an infringement suit,then concluded that lack of registration deprived it of jurisdiction.cosmetic contends that it complied with a,because it submitted a completed registration application to the copyright office before instituting its infringement action.hsn argues that registration occurs only after the copyright office has affirmatively granted a registration.

on march,cosmetic submitted an application to the copyright office for registration of its copyright in the necklace,and received confirmation of receipt of the application on march.on march,cosmetic filed a complaint alleging that hsn had infringed on cosmetic copyright in the necklace.although the copyright office ultimately issued cosmetic a registration certificate for its copyright in the necklace,it did not do so before cosmetic filed its complaint 
on june,hsn filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim and lack of jurisdiction.hsn argued that cosmetic did not possess a valid copyright registration when it commenced its action,and thus the court lacked jurisdiction over the claim of copyright infringement.on june,the district court granted the motion to dismiss on the basis that it lacked jurisdiction.cosmetic timely appealed.

discussion 
we first address hsn argument that a registration mandates that a copyrighted work be registered before an infringement action can be a jurisdictional prerequisite to suit.in reed elsevier,muchnick,the supreme court held otherwise specifically,reed elsevier held that,although s ection a registration requirement is a to filing a claim,it does not restrict a federal court jurisdiction.at.therefore,the district court dismissal of cosmetic complaint on the basis of lack of must have been predicated on a conclusion that cosmetic had not registered its error.
however,this conclusion does not end our inquiry,as the district court still may have correctly dismissed the suit on another basis.this court may affirm the district court on any ground supported by the record,even if the ground is not relied on by the district court.charley taxi radio dispatch sida of hawaii,cir.below,hsn moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.specifically,hsn argued that cosmetic failed to register the necklace,and elsevier,registration is an element of an infringement claim,rather than a jurisdictional bar.
thus,we are asked to answer the question what does it mean to register a copyrighted work stated another way,is a copyright registered at the time the copyright holder application is received by the copyright office the application approach,or at the time that the office acts on the application and issues a certificate of registration the registration approach our sister circuits have split in answering this question for instance,the fifth and seventh circuits have adopted the application approach.apple barrel,beard,f d,cir chicago bd.of educ.substance,cir.the tenth and eleventh circuits have adopted the registration approach.la resolana,at homes,ameron homes,cir,abrogated in part by reed elsevier.at.
we now turn to this issue 
we first note that,according to the representations of cosmetic at oral argument and in subsequent briefing,the copyright office has now acted on cosmetic application and issued a certificate of registration of copyright in the necklace.once a certificate is issued,the registration dates back to the date of application.d.thus,cosmetic can now allege the registration element of an infringement claim,irrespective of whether registration accrues at application or issuance.nonetheless,we address the issue of the point at which a work is registered because it is an unsettled issue of law in this circuit,and because it is an issue capable of repetition yet evading review if the copyright office acts on the application during litigation.see gerstein pugh,citing sosna.iowa,united states brandau,cir.
in interpreting a statutory provision,we begin with the plain language of the statute.see k n eng g,bulat,cir.section a of the copyright act of the act or act provides,in relevant part n o civil action for infringement of the copyright in any united states work shall be instituted until or registration of the copyright claim has been made in accordance with this title.a.registration is unhelpfully defined as a registration of a claim in the original or the renewed and extended term of copyright.
because the clause at issue gives no guidance in interpreting the meaning of registration,we turn to the language of the statute as a whole to determine the intended meaning.see united states,cir while the starting point is always the language of the statute itself r ather than focusing just on the word or phrase at issue,this court looks to the entire statute to determine intent.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.an examination of the statutory language here,however,reveals ambiguity that leaves us no closer to determining which interpretation to adopt.
looking to the act as a whole,copyright registration is addressed in five consecutive sections through.two subsections of the act,a and portions of a,contain language that suggests that registration requires some affirmative steps to be taken by the copyright office.section a details the role of the register of copyrights the register 
when,after examination,the register of copyrights determines that,in accordance with the provisions of this title,the material deposited constitutes copyrightable subject matter and that the other legal and formal requirements of this title have been met,the register shall register the claim and issue to the applicant a certificate of registration under the seal of the copyright office.
a emphasis added.this provision places an active burden of examination and registration upon the register,suggesting that registration is not accomplished by application alone.see,loree rodkin,d at reading the provision in this way.but see iconbazaar,d at pointing out that this section could be read to apply only to the requirements for issuance of a registration certificate,not to the requirements for instituting an action for infringement.
the latter portion of a can be read similarly.the portion of a setting forth the registration requirement is followed by an exception 
in any case,however,where the deposit,application,and fee required for registration have been delivered to the copyright office in proper form and registration has been refused,the applicant is entitled to institute a civil action for infringement if notice thereof,with a copy of the complaint,is served on the register of copyrights.
a emphasis added.because registration in this subsection is juxtaposed with the separate act of delivering the necessary application materials to the copyright office,this subsection could be read to mean that congress intended registration to require acceptance or refusal by the register,not mere delivery.see,strategy source,d at loree rodkin,d at.
other sections of the act,however,cast doubt on this interpretation.in particular,blurs the line between application and registration and favors the application approach.in setting forth the permissive registration requirements,states t he owner of copyright or of any exclusive right in the work may obtain registration by delivering to the copyright office the deposit specified by this section,together with the application and fee specified a emphasis added.this section implies that the sole requirement for obtaining registration is delivery of the appropriate documents and fee.see prunté,d at concurring in this analysis and adopting the application approach iconbazaar,d at same but see ryan,wl,at adopting the registration approach and concluding that a means merely that the delivery of the application is a step the applicant must take,not that delivery is sufficient by itself to obtain a registration 
one final relevant subsection of the act,d,could be read as supporting either the application or registration approach.section d provides the effective date of a copyright registration is the day on which an application,deposit,and fee,which are later determined by the register of copyrights or by a court of competent jurisdiction to be acceptable for registration,have all been received in the copyright office.d.because this subsection dates a registration as of the date of its application,it supports the interpretation that application is the critical event.see,dielsi.at prunté,d at.however,because this does not occur until after the copyright office or a court has deemed the registration acceptable,the statute could be read to require action by the register to effect registration.see,la resolana,at it is not logical to assume that the provision subsumes the explicit requirements of and a.ryan,wl,at brush creek,wl,at.
we are not persuaded that the plain language of the act unequivocally supports either the registration or application approach.although in some places the act seems to equate registration with affirmative approval by the copyright office,in others the act suggests registration is accomplished by completing the process of submitting an application.this ambiguity makes it necessary to go beyond the act plain language to determine which approach better carries out the purpose of the statute.
when statutory language proves unclear,we work to discern its meaning by looking to the broader context of the statute as a whole and the purpose of the statute.see united states olander,cir quoting robinson shell oil.an understanding of the history of is helpful in discerning the statute purpose.section is a product of the act,which drastically amended the act.see,stat.see also,at,reprinted in.under the act,federal copyright protection attached only upon publication,and even then,only if proper notice,registration,and deposit occurred see,at.protection of unpublished works was left to the states.id.at.the act,however,created a unitary system that attached federal copyright protection to all and the time of their creation,a codified at a see also,at.it also eliminated some of the prior formalities of copyright law by relaxing notice requirements and eliminating mandatory registration.see,codified at,see also,at,these changes vastly increased the scope of works subject to copyright protection,thus providing an incentive to create expressive works.see,chicago bd.of,at.
although registration was made optional,congress still valued having a robust federal register of existing copyrights.see,at to this end,it chose to encourage copyright holders to register with the office of copyright through various statutory incentives.see.for instance,if a copyright holder secures a registration certificate within five years after first publication,such certificate will constitute prima facie evidence of both the validity of the copyright and the facts stated in the certificate.c.moreover,certain remedies,such as statutory damages and attorney fees,are available only after registration.finally,registration is required for works prior to bringing any infringement action a.indeed,because registration is not mandatory under the act,copyright holders frequently register specifically for the purpose of being able to bring suit.
with this framework in mind,we conclude that the application approach better fulfills congress purpose of providing broad copyright protection while maintaining a robust federal register.
first,the application approach avoids unnecessary delay in copyright infringement litigation,which could permit an infringing party to continue to profit from its wrongful acts.section a allows a party,after applying for registration,to litigate the claim whether the copyright office accepts or rejects the registration.see a permitting an applicant to bring an infringement suit after the register has rejected his or her registration,so long as the register is notified of the suit see also forasté,d at prunté,d at.under the registration approach,however,a party must wait on the copyright office affirmative acceptance or rejection,despite knowing that suit can proceed in either event.as the leading treatise on copyright explains,the registration approach thus creates a strange scheme g iven that the claimant will ultimately be allowed to proceed regardless of how the copyright office treats the application,it makes little sense to create a period of legal limbo in which suit is barred.see melville nimmer david nimmer,nimmer on copyright b a i nimmer.the application approach avoids this legal avoids prolonging the period of allowing a litigant to proceed with an infringement suit as soon as he has taken all of the necessary steps to register the copyright at issue.
moreover,the application approach avoids delay without impairing the central goal of copyright registration.as explained above,copyright registration is now a voluntary procedure,with the registration requirement acting as an incentive to help congress maintain a robust national register of copyrights.see,at copyright registration for published works,which is useful and important to users and the public at large should be induced in some practical way.this goal,however,is accomplished equally by the registration and application approaches,as either approach requires a party to submit the information necessary to add the copyright to the federal registry.see setting forth the steps an applicant must take to register a copyright.
the registration approach added requirement of affirmative approval or rejection before suit thus amounts to little more than just the type of needless formality congress generally worked to eliminate in the act.on this point,it is telling that even many courts adopting the registration approach have recognized that construing the statute this way leads to an inefficient and peculiar result.brush creek,wl,at quoting ryan,wl,at loree rodkin,d at same strategy source,d at same.we agree.it makes little sense to dismiss a case which will likely be refiled in a matter of weeks or months simply because the copyright office has not made a prompt decision that will have no substantive impact on whether or not a litigant can ultimately proceed.
furthermore,in addition to being generally inefficient,in the scenario the registration approach could cause a party to lose its ability to sue.the act provides a statute of limitations for copyright infringement actions.b.thus,under the registration approach,a plaintiff who applied for registration towards the end of the period could see the statute of limitations expire during the time it took the copyright office to act on the application.see nimmer b a i g iven a statute of limitations for recovery of all damages caused by copyright infringement,the narrow registration approach may indeed occasion complete inability to recover damages.this result does not square well with d mandate that an application effective registration date should be the day that a completed application is received.in specifying that registration is to be dated as of the date of sought to ensure that an applicant did not suffer the consequences of a delay by the register.see.at noting that the provision is designed to take account of the inevitable timelag between receipt of the application and other material and the issuance of the certificate.only the application approach fully protects litigants from any disadvantage caused by this timelag.
finally,we find unpersuasive the argument that deference to the register requires adoption of the registration approach.this argument posits that congress structured the act to require the register approval or rejection of registration before suit because it wanted the register to determine the propriety of granting copyright registration in the first instance.see,strategy source,d at.however,as nimmer explains,the pace of litigation entails that the copyright office will typically have granted or refused registration during its pendency.nimmer b a i.thus,should the register determine that it wanted to reject an application already in litigation,it would still have an opportunity to appear.id.furthermore,the register decision of whether or not to grant a registration certificate is largely perfunctory,and is ultimately reviewable by the courts there is,therefore,no compelling justification for delaying litigation until after the register has acted on an application.the two approval by the copyright office and an underlying infringement case in the occur simultaneously with little or no prejudice to any involved parties 
we therefore hold that receipt by the copyright office of a complete application satisfies the registration requirement of a.this interpretation ensures the broad copyright protection that the act provided.it best effectuate s the interests of justice and promote s judicial economy.int l kitchen exhaust cleaning ass power washers of north america,d.this approach also fully accomplishes the central purpose of compilation of a robust national register of existing at the same time avoids unfairness and waste of judicial resources.lau ow bew united states,nothing is better settled than that statutes should receive a sensible construction,such as will effectuate the legislative intention,and,if possible,so as to avoid an unjust or an absurd conclusion.united states leon,cir citing lau ow bew,at.
under the application approach,cosmetic satisfied a registration requirement before it instituted this action.cosmetic alleged in its complaint that the copyright office received its complete application on march,weeks before cosmetic filed its complaint.thus,a does not bar cosmetic infringement claim,which should proceed on its merits.
conclusion 
the judgment of the district court dismissing this action is vacated and reversed.this case is remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
at oral argument and in supplemental briefing,cosmetic confirmed that it has now received a registration certificate and has filed a new infringement action against hsn,which has been stayed pending the outcome of this appeal.see cosmetic ideas,hsn,r rzx,doc.may.

the tenth circuit appears to have coined the terms application approach and registration approach in describing the two schools of thought.see la resolana architects,pa clay realtors angel fire,cir,abrogated in part by reed elsevier.at.

although we addressed a similar issue in roth greeting cards united card,that opinion does not control the outcome here,because it construed the language of the copyright act of act,which has since been substantially amended.see,cir holding that under the act,a plaintiff could maintain his action the day he fully complied with the registration requirements by mailing in a revised application,and that the revised application filing date related back to the original application.
preregistration is allowed only for certain commercial works within categories that the register of copyrights has determined to have a history of infringement prior to commercial release,and is not applicable to the work in question here.see f c.
the tenth circuit read a to support the registration approach by positing that may,as used in that section,indicates that registration requires review.see la resolana,at this provision envisions substantive review of the material by the register of copyrights.if it were otherwise,the verb would be shall obtain instead of may obtain.internal quotation marks omitted.but the word may,as used here,is better read to indicate that registration is now permissive,especially as the subsection is entitled registration permissive if shall obtain were used,it would create a mandatory registration requirement.
unlike the act registration procedures,registration under the act did not allow for any discretionary determination by the register of copyright.rather,if the proper steps had been,notice,deposit,and payment of a fee it was the duty of the register of copyrights to issue a certificate of registration under the seal of the copyright office.roth greeting cards,at.
notice has since been made entirely permissive,see a,as congress further relaxed copyright formalities in order to join the berne convention for the protection of literary and artistic works berne convention,which requires that foreign works not be subject to formalities.see berne convention,paris text,treaty doc,stat.adopting laws consistent with the berne convention,thus becoming party to the agreement.
in discussing the need for proposed registration incentives in the act,the house judiciary committee explained copyright registration for published works,which is useful and important to users and the public at large,would no longer be compulsory,and should therefore be induced in some practical way,at.
for infringement occurring prior to the effective date of registration,a copyright owner may still obtain actual damages injunctive relief.see.
as a result of the berne convention mandate that foreign works not be subject to formalities,registration requirement does not apply to works.see berne convention.
the register looks only to ensure that the material deposited is copyrightable subject matter and that the legal and formal requirements of the title have been met.a.after the register determination,the courts are empowered to review any denial of a certificate,and approval by the register gives an applicant only prima facie evidence of copyright,leaving the courts to make the ultimate determination in either instance.see a,c.
in fact,a defendant is in some ways aided by a plaintiff lack of a certificate,because if a party proceeds to litigation without a registration certificate,it bears a greater evidentiary burden of proving the validity of its copyright.see c in any judicial proceedings the certificate of a registration made before or within five years after first publication of the work shall constitute prima facie evidence of the validity of the copyrigh
