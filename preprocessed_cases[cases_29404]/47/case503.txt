pavlovich is the president of a technology company.he was,f or the most part of four years,a computer engineering student at purdue university,and had worked as a computer technician for best buy and pingtek corporation.the discovery materials on record indicate that pavlovich and the other defendants developed posted computer programs on the internet,including a program called decss,that misappropriate dvd cca trade secrets.such computer programs have been designed to defeat dvd cca copy protection system,known as the content scramble system,or css,which is employed to encrypt and protect the copyrighted motion pictures contained on digital versatile discs,or dvds.at the time pavlovich posted decss on the internet,he was a leader in the open source movement,the purpose of which was to make as much material as possible available over the internet.deposition materials further indicate that pavlovich founded and operated the livid video project,whose purpose was to aid in the development of an unlicensed system for dvd playback and copying.pavlovich owned and operated the web site called,where he posted the decss program.
pavlovich knew that dvds deliver motion picture content to their purchasers.he testified in his deposition that dvds are a large storage medium that can be used for a lot of different things,one of which,holding motion pictures,is probably the most well known.
pavlovich admitted in his deposition that there was an organization which you had to file for or apply for a license or whatever to use certain dvd technology,and that he knew about this because i n the course of the development of the project,the linux video and dvd project,there was a lot of discussion regarding the decryption piece of the full length of decoding of dvd and,you know,there were individuals making statements on the mailing list as that effect.pressed for the kind of statements he had heard,pavlovich answered it was s omething along the lines of you got to apply for a license and whatnot.
nonetheless,pavlovich never sought or obtained a license to use dvd technology for his livid project.pavlovich admitted that his livid project utilized dvd cca trade secrets,including those contained in decss.pavlovich further admitted that through the livid project he aimed to develop an unlicensed dvd player that would use decss to decrypt dvd data.pavlovich knew that decss was developed by reverse engineering,which he knew was unauthorized.pavlovich stated in his deposition that he believed that decss was reverse engineered from another player like a windows player.asked if decss was derived from css algorithms,pavlovich responded yes.they had to reverse engineer those algorithms in order to mimic them.like just kind of quick once over,when you are reverse engineering something,you see what goes in and what comes out,and if you do have access to that information,what one would do is try to mimic those,so they would necessarily be the exact algorithms,but if you can get as close or if you can get the correct results,then the engineering process can be deemed a success.
despite his knowledge of how decss obtained and misappropriated dvd cca trade secrets,pavlovich sought to and actually disseminated those trade secrets.
pavlovich further admitted that it was common knowledge that the motion picture industry was centered in california,and that the computer technology industry has a dominant presence in california.of the more than companies nationwide that are licensed to make computer hardware and software which allow consumers to view digital images on dvds css licensees,are located in california.pavlovich knew that pirating dvds is illegal,and that decss facilitates pirating of dvds.
discussion 
the internet is new technology that allows instant access to information published at a web site jurisdictions away.the question in this case is whether california statute reaches owners,publishers,and operators of those web sites when,in violation of california law,they make available for copying or distribution trade secrets or copyrighted material of california companies.we hold it does.
the internet,as a mode of communication and a system of information delivery is new,but the rules governing the protection of property rights,and how that protection may be enforced under the new technology,need not be.there is,for instance,sufficient guidance provided by the united states supreme court in calder jones,d calder.
in calder,the plaintiff shirley jones brought suit in california against the defendants south and calder,claiming that she had been libeled in an article written and edited by the defendants in florida.the article was published in a national magazine national enquirer that had a large circulation in california.south,who wrote the first draft of the article,lived in florida,and did most of his research in florida,relying on phone calls to sources in california for the information contained in the article.calder,the president and editor of the enquirer,was also a resident of florida.calder reviewed south draft and edited it in its final form.in finding that california had specific jurisdiction over south and calder persons under these facts,the calder court stated that california was the focal point both of the story and of the harm suffered,and that jurisdiction over their persons was proper in california based on the effects of their florida conduct in california.citations.calder,supra,at.
addressing due process concerns,the calder court stated the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the united states constitution permits personal jurisdiction over a defendant in any state with which the defendant has certain minimum contacts such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.citation.citation.in judging minimum contacts,a court properly focuses on the relationship among the defendant,the forum,and the litigation.citations.the plaintiff lack of contacts will not defeat otherwise proper jurisdiction,citation,but they may be so manifold as to permit jurisdiction when it would not exist in their absence.calder,supra,at.
calder concluded that california courts had personal jurisdiction over the defendants in florida because defendants intentional conduct in florida was calculated to cause injury to respondent in california.calder,supra,at.
in california,the state statute authorizes california courts to exercise jurisdiction on any basis not inconsistent with the constitution of this state or of the united states.code civ.in vons companies,seabest foods,cal th,d,vons companies,the california supreme court stated that the assertion of personal jurisdiction by a california court over a nonresident defendant who has not been served with process within the state comports with the requirements of the due process clause of the federal constitution if the defendant has such minimum contacts with the state that the assertion of jurisdiction does not violate traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.citations.the requirement of minimum contacts is satisfied,subjecting the nonresident defendant to the specific jurisdiction of the forum,if the defendant has purposefully availed himself or herself of forum benefits citation,and the controversy is related to or arises out of a defendant contacts with the forum.citations.id.at,d.
citing burger king rudzewicz,d,vons companies,explained that a forum state may exercise specific jurisdiction over a nonresident who purposefully avails himself or herself of forum benefits because the state has a manifest interest in providing its residents with a convenient forum for redressing injuries inflicted by actors.citations.moreover,where individuals purposely derive benefit from their interstate activities citation it may well be unfair to allow them to escape having to account in other states for consequences that arise proximately from such activities.citation.further,because modern transportation and communications have made it much less burdensome for a party sued to defend himself in a state where he engages in economic activity,it usually will not be unfair to subject him to the burdens of litigating in another forum for disputes relating to such activity.citation.vons companies,supra,cal th at,d.
vons companies,added that a claim need not arise directly from the defendant forum contacts in order to be sufficiently related to the contact to warrant the exercise of specific jurisdiction.rather,as long as the claim bears a substantial connection to the nonresident forum contacts,the exercise of specific jurisdiction is appropriate.the due process clause is concerned with protecting nonresident defendants from being brought unfairly into court in the forum,on the basis of random contacts.that constitutional provision,however,does not provide defendants with a shield against jurisdiction when the defendant purposefully has availed himself or herself of benefits in the forum.vons companies,supra,cal th at,d.
earlier,in cornelison chaney cal d,cornelison,the court,describing the reach of california statute,set the standard by which the goal of fairness may be served the general rule is that the forum state may not exercise jurisdiction over a nonresident unless his relationship to the state is such as to make the exercise of such jurisdiction reasonable.citation.if a nonresident defendant activities may be described as extensive or citation or substantial continuous and systematic citation,there is a constitutionally sufficient relationship to warrant jurisdiction for all causes of action asserted against him.in such circumstances,it is not necessary that the specific cause of action alleged be connected with the defendant business relationship to the forum.if,however,the defendant activities in the forum are not so pervasive as to justify the exercise of general jurisdiction over him,then jurisdiction depends upon the quality and nature of his activity in the forum in relation to the particular cause of action.in such a situation,the cause of action must arise out of an act done or transaction consummated in the forum,or defendant must perform some other act by which he purposefully avails himself of the privilege of conducting activities in the forum,thereby invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.thus,as the relationship of the defendant with the state seeking to exercise jurisdiction over him grows more tenuous,the scope of jurisdiction also retracts,and fairness is assured by limiting the circumstances under which the plaintiff can compel him to appear and defend.the crucial inquiry concerns the character of defendant activity in the forum,whether the cause of action arises out of or has a substantial connection with that activity,and upon the balancing of the convenience of the parties and the interests of the state in assuming jurisdiction.citations.
here,pavlovich,a computer engineering student,a technician in the computer and telecommunications industry,and the founder and president of a technology company,knew that california is commonly known as the center of the motion picture industry,and that the computer industry holds a commanding presence in the state.in his deposition,pavlovich spoke of california dominance in the motion picture industry,as follows 
are you you have any understanding where the major motion pictures studios sic are located 
a by pavlovich.by major i just going to go out on a limb here in that you mean some of the larger motion picture producers or production companies.
that correct.the sort of plaintiffs that were the plaintiffs in the matter that you were just an expert witness in.
okay.that makes a lot of sense.yeah,they make a lot of movies in california,hollywood,yeah.
right.so what your understanding of the term hollywood 
hollywood is the big area in california where they make a lot of movies and a lot of movie stars live and whatnot.
is it fair to say that hollywood,california is the center of the motion picture industry 
i would know.whether or not like all their offices and buildings are there,i do know specifically,but i guess the general common idea is that hollywood is the area for that 
as to california dominance in the computer industry,pavlovich testified in the same deposition,as follows 
do you have any understanding of whether or not a significant number of hardware manufacturers are located in california 
a by pavlovich.i believe there is a lot of technology companies out in california yeah,there several hardware manufacturers located in california.
have you ever heard of silicon valley 
q.what does that refer to 
that an area where there is a lot of companies,software writers,hardware manufacturers,programmers.
and that in california is that correct 
based on your expertise in the computer industry,is there another state besides california that you could name has more or a higher concentration of hardware manufacturers 
i do know the exact numbers that are in the silicon valley.you know,i do know there is a lot now in texas.we have got the silicon triangle is what we call it.there three major cities in texas with a lot of technology and telecommunications companies.whether or do know the numbers between the areas,but there is a lot of technology hot spots around the world.
q.what would you describe as the top three technology hot spots in the united states 
silicon valley,texas,have no idea where i get the third one from.
and as far lack of a better term,hot spot of technology,is silicon your understanding that silicon valley is such a hot spot of technology with respect to hardware or software and programmers is that the things you identified before is that correct 
because pavlovich knew that california is commonly known as the center of the movie industry,and knew that silicon valley in california is one of the top three technology hot spots in the country,he knew,or should have known,that the dvd republishing and distribution activities he was illegally doing and allowing to be done through the use of his web site,while benefiting him,were injuriously affecting the motion picture and computer industries in california.the question is whether pavlovich lack of physical and personal presence in california
