this case presents several novel issues including whether,and to what degree,deference is due an advisory opinion analyzing the potential conflict between foil and the copyright act by new york state committee on open government,which is required by statute to issue advisory opinions regarding foil whether,by enacting foil,new york abrogated its municipalities copyrights and whether the official tax maps are in the public domain from their inception.we hold that foil does not abrogate suffolk county copyrights and find that it is possible for suffolk county to comply with its obligations under foil while preserving its rights under the copyright act.in so holding,we decline to defer to the committee on open government advisory opinion.we also find that suffolk county sufficiently alleged that its tax maps possess enough originality to withstand first american motion to dismiss.finally,we find,at least on the record before us,that suffolk county official tax maps can not be deemed,as a matter of law,to be in the public domain since their inception.we thus vacate the judgment below and remand for further proceedings.in light of this disposition,we do not address first american and dismiss it as moot.
background 
because this is an appeal from the grant of a motion to dismiss the complaint,we accept as true all factual allegations set forth in the complaint,and any documents attached,incorporated by reference,or integral to the claims asserted,and we draw all reasonable inferences in favor of suffolk county.see schnall marine midland bank,cir.
factual background 
during,suffolk county,through its real property tax service agency,created and designed a series of original maps tax maps and an index system reflecting the ownership,size,and location of real property in each of suffolk county political subdivisions.compl.suffolk county is required by law to create such tax maps and to make them available to the public.real prop.tax law a,mckinney.all tax districts and special district boundaries were created and referenced by suffolk county on its maps and indices.compl.suffolk county creates new maps and indices annually to reflect alterations in size,shape,location of parcels of land,subdivisions,or roadways.id.currently,there are twelve albums representing ten townships containing over tax maps,which show over parcels of land.id.
suffolk county alleges that its tax maps contain a substantial amount of original material,research,compilation and organization wholly original with the plaintiff and are copyrightable subject matter under the laws of the united states.id.these tax maps,suffolk county asserts,are the result of substantial work,effort and expense.id.suffolk county registered its copyright claims from the initial cartographic compilation in,and during various times thereafter in order to copyright new and amended maps.id.suffolk county has received copyright registrations for these works and has affixed a notice of copyright to the tax maps it has published or sold to the public.id.it also affixed a notice of copyright in the introduction to each tax map album.id.suffolk county is the sole proprietor of all right,title,and interest in and to such copyrights and in and to its maps.id.
suffolk county alleges that the defendants have infringed its copyrights in the tax maps by publishing and placing on the market,without license or its consent,copies of the tax maps and disks containing the maps.id.suffolk county claims that it notified the defendants of their alleged infringement but that the defendants refused to cease their infringing conduct.id.suffolk county then filed this action seeking to enjoin the defendants from copying,utilizing,and marketing in any manner the tax maps,or any portion thereof,and seeking damages suffered as a result of the defendants infringement.
first american moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim,arguing that the tax maps lack sufficient originality to qualify for copyright protection because their content is dictated by state regulation the tax maps are sufficiently analogous to judicial opinions and statutes to be deemed in the public domain from their inception and,hence,not entitled to copyright protection and foil bars suffolk county from owning a copyright in its tax maps.

new york enacted its freedom of information law to provide the public with greater access to governmental records and to increase public accountability.pub.off.law mckinney.under foil,state agencies,which include the state counties must make available for public inspection and copying all records,subject to certain exceptions not relevant here.pub.off.law mckinney supp.the covered entities may deny access to those records falling within an enumerated exception and must,if the person seeking access appeals the denial in writing,fully explain in writing the reasons for its denial.id.foil establishes the committee on open government the committee,which,among other tasks,is required to furnish advisory opinions to any person or agency.pub.off.law mckinney supp.the committee,however,does not substantively participate in the review process established by subdivision of section and only receives a copy of the state agency determination whether to provide access after an appeal to that agency has been made.john whalen.the committee is required annually to propose recommendations for changes in the law to the governor of the state of new york and the state legislature.pub.off.law b v mckinney supp.
iii.procedural history 
the district court initially denied first american motion to dismiss,holding that suffolk county was entitled to offer evidence regarding the originality of its tax maps in order to support its claim of copyright infringement tax maps are not in the public domain from inception and foil,by its text,does not prohibit suffolk county from enforcing its copyrights.county of suffolk i,wl,at.the district court refused to defer to two unpublished advisory opinions of the committee,in which the committee executive director indicated his view that a local government claim of copyright would be superseded by foil.id.at.the effect of foil on a local government copyright was not analyzed extensively in either of these committee opinions.
after first american motion was briefed and submitted,but before the district court filed county of suffolk i,the committee issued a third advisory opinion regarding the effect of foil on a state agency copyright unlike the prior opinions,this advisory opinion contained substantial analysis.first american moved for reconsideration solely on the foil issue,emphasizing this third advisory opinion,and argued that the district court should defer to the committee interpretation of foil unless that interpretation is irrational or unreasonable.the district court agreed,granted the motion for reconsideration,and then dismissed suffolk county complaint in its entirety.the district court found that this new advisory opinion was neither irrational nor unreasonable.county of suffolk ii,wl,at.the district court further analyzed foil and suffolk county obligation to create tax maps by law.the district court concluded that prohibiting suffolk county from enforcing its copyrights would not generate an economic disincentive to creating tax maps.id.
suffolk county timely appealed the order dismissing its complaint.in its appeal,suffolk county challenges both the district court decision to grant first american motion for reconsideration and the dismissal of its complaint.in this appeal,we have also received the benefit of the participation of amici curiae state of new york state and city of new york city.amici argue on behalf of their interests in their use and development of geographic information systems gis we note the amici interests not because we intend to decide how foil impacts gis,but because we recognize the broader context that many of the issues raised on appeal implicate.
in a subsequent order,the district court denied first american application for an award of costs,including reasonable attorneys fees,pursuant to,finding that suffolk county case was neither frivolous nor objectively unreasonable.first american timely from this order.given our disposition of this appeal,however,we do not address the merits of first american.
discussion 
i.the motion for reconsideration 
on appeal,suffolk county contends that the district court abused its discretion in granting the motion for reconsideration based on the third committee advisory opinion because,suffolk county argues,that opinion was neither controlling precedent nor a change in the applicable law.
preliminarily,we must address whether the grant of a motion for reconsideration is appealable.in shrader csx transportation,we expressed grave doubts whether such a motion is appealable,even if we properly had jurisdiction over the case for independent reasons,cir.as we noted,such a decision,by itself,would not be an appealable final order sufficient to provide an appellate court with jurisdiction.id.but because we found that the merits of the motion at issue in shrader were easily resolved,we proceeded to address them without suggesting that the grant of a motion for reconsideration is in fact reviewable.see id.at finding that the district court decision to reconsider its earlier ruling was not an abuse of discretion.
here,first american provided the district court with a new advisory opinion,containing substantial analysis,authored by the entity specifically charged by foil with providing advisory opinions regarding that short,a decision that might reasonably be expected to alter the conclusion reached by the court.id.at.although we ultimately disagree with the weight the district court accorded this new opinion,we can not say that it exceeded its allowable discretion in reconsidering its earlier order.as in shrader,however,we do not suggest that the grant of a motion to reconsider is necessarily reviewable.see id.at.
ii.dismissal of the complaint 
relevant legal standards 
we review de novo a district court decision to dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.see friedl city of new york,cir.the issue is not whether a plaintiff will ultimately prevail but whether the claimant is entitled to offer evidence to support the claims.villager pond,town of darien,cir internal quotation marks omitted,cert.denied,d.to establish a claim of copyright infringement,a plaintiff with a valid copyright must demonstrate that the defendant has actually copied the plaintiff work and the copying is illegal because a substantial similarity exists between the defendant work and the protectible elements of plaintiff.hamil am.gfi,cir internal quotation marks omitted,cert.denied,d.
may states,and their subdivisions,obtain a copyright 
although the federal government does not possess a statutory right to obtain copyright protection for its works,the copyright act is silent as to the rights of states or their subdivisions.nor is there an indication in the statute that copyright ownership is limited to private persons.see copyright owner,with respect to any one of the exclusive rights comprised in a copyright,refers to the owner of that particular right.id.noting simply that copyright protection subsists in original works of authorship.by specifying a limitation on ownership solely against the federal government,the copyright act implies that states and their subdivisions are not excluded from protection under the act.see.officials code code,cir works of state governments are therefore left available for copyright protection by the state or the individual author conf.of bar exam rs multistate legal studies,aff,cir melville nimmer david nimmer,nimmer on copyright a,at real estate data,sidwell,cir indicating that,under the copyright act of doctrine,the county,which contracted for the production of tax maps,was presumed to be the copyright owner rather than the creator of the maps.thus,suffolk county may own a copyright under the copyright act.the question remains whether suffolk county has sufficiently alleged that it possesses a valid copyright in its tax maps.
should suffolk county be permitted to present evidence as to the maps originality 
to allege a claim of copyright infringement,suffolk county must claim that a substantial similarity exists between the defendant work and the protectible elements of its work.to be protectible,these elements must be original.see feist publ ns,rural,d holding that a compilation of facts does not qualify for copyright protection unless it possesses sufficient originality,that is,it possesses at least some minimal degree of creativity streetwise maps,vandam,cir.as an alternate ground for affirmance,first american argues that suffolk county tax maps lack sufficient originality,and are hence not subject to copyright protection,because the content and the form of the maps are dictated by state law and regulations.
in streetwise maps,we addressed what portion,if any,of a map could be protected against copyright infringement.we noted that items such as street location and landmarks were physical facts and thus not protected recognized that the presentation of such physical facts could be original.id.at accord mason montgomery data,cir.we thus focused on the overall manner in which the plaintiff selected,coordinated,and arranged the expressive elements in its map,including color,to depict the map factual content.streetwise maps,at.the level of creativity required to demonstrate that the work is original is extremely low even a slight amount will suffice.mason,at quoting feist,at.suffolk county complaint alleges that its tax maps contain a substantial amount of original material,research,compilation and organization wholly original with the plaintiff.compl.the district court thus correctly found that suffolk county has sufficiently alleged that its work is protected.
d.did the new york legislature,by enacting foil,abrogate suffolk county copyright 
the new york state legislature may enact laws that impact the property or affairs of local governments,such as suffolk county,especially on matters of state concern.see city of new york state of new york,see also kelley mcgee,tracing evolution of home rule amendment to new york state constitution williams mayor of baltimore.a municipal corporation,created by a state for the better ordering of government,has no privileges or immunities under the federal constitution which it may invoke in opposition to the will of its creator.thus,although a state and its subdivisions may own a copyright as a matter of copyright law,it may be that suffolk county is not permitted to do so in this instance.the question becomes whether new york legislature,by enacting foil,has ceded suffolk county copyright.
the text of foil provides no clear indication that the legislature intended to abrogate a covered entity copyright.foil provides only that e ach agency shall,in accordance with its published rules,make available for public inspection and copying all records,subject to certain exceptions that are not relevant here.pub.off.law mckinney supp see also id.mckinney supp requiring each entity subject to foil to provide the person requesting the record access or a written denial of access,and for those records to which it provides access,to provide,upon payment of a fee,a copy of the record to the requester.foil is silent as to the existence of,and the effect of requiring disclosure on,any preexisting copyright the state agency may possess.foil is also silent as to what may occur after a state agency discloses its records.when the current version of foil was enacted in,there was an established recognition that certain state entities could possess a copyright,see,jud.law mckinney requiring that the copyright of the statement of facts,head notes and all other notes prepared by the law reporting bureau must be taken by and shall be vested in the secretary of state opinion of the att y,wl citing prior opinion concluding the same.because foil was enacted against such a baseline,yet did not specifically address the impact on a state agency copyright,this silence is deafening.by the statute plain language,the extent of the state agency obligation is to make its records available for public inspection and copying.it is one thing to read this provision to permit a member of the public to copy a public record,but it is quite another to read into it the right of a private entity to distribute commercially what it would otherwise,under copyright law,be unable to distribute.
first american attempts to read legislative abrogation from the policies favoring broad access to governmental documents and the presumption of openness inherent in foil.first american fears that state agencies,armed with the weaponry of copyright infringement suits,will convert foil goal of maximum access into a reality of minimum access.first american trumpets a portion of the legislative declaration introducing the law that states that the public,individually and collectively and represented by a free press,should have access to the records of government in accordance with the provisions of this article.pub.off.law mckinney.this statement,in a preamble no less,may assist in the determination of the legislature purpose,but it certainly is not conclusive.see stat.mckinney observing that while a preamble may illuminate the statute purpose and intent,it enacts nothing,contains no directives,and may not be resorted to as fixing terms of the statute.first american reading requires a degree of inference that fails to overcome the limited scope of the obligations dictated by the plain language of the a state agency must make its records available for public inspection.moreover,first american ignores the fact that the free press or an individual seeking to use the state agency records to educate others or to criticize the state or the state agency may be protected by the copyright act fair use doctrine.see on davis v.the gap,cir.
both first american and the state as amicus point to the existence of pending legislation or proposals for legislative action to prove their respective contentions that the legislature intended foil to preclude or not to preclude a state agency assertion of its copyright in this situation,however,attempting to extrapolate from these bills,which have not yet been enacted,what the legislature that enacted foil intended with respect to a covered entity copyright is of questionable utility.norman singer,sutherland statutes and statutory construction ed indicating that a subsequent legislative interpretation of a statute is not conclusive of the meaning of the former statute,and may either be read to indicate that the construction of the first statute is the same as the new enactment or to provide evidence that the prior statute meant the contrary of the new enactment.at best,these bills reflect concern that foil does not satisfactorily address the ability or inability of a covered entity to assert its copyright.in any event,as we have stated,the plain language of foil suggests that it did not abrogate a covered entity rights under the copyright act.ratzlaf united states,d holding that even when there are contrary indications in the statute legislative history we do not resort to legislative history to cloud a statutory text that is clear.therefore,we conclude that the legislature,by enacting foil,did not abrogate suffolk county copyright.
e.what degree of deference,if any,is due advisory opinions by the committee on open government 
in the third committee on open government advisory opinion,the executive director of the committee addressed whether the department of transportation dot,in response to a foil request for its digital datasets,could require a commercial entity to license the requested records before disclosing them.while conceding that there was no judicial decision on point and that the dot view reconciling both foil and the copyright act arguably was correct,the executive director concluded after an extensive analysis that the dot could not assert its copyright in such a matter 
although the district court correctly acknowledged that in some instances the opinions of the committee are entitled to deference,that is not true here.in this case,the committee was interpreting the effect of foil on rights provided by the copyright area outside of the committee limited expertise as defined by statute.see pub.off.law b i ii.moreover,the committee was also engaged in statutory interpretation of foil and an evaluation of the policies behind the copyright act.
the new york court of appeals has indicated that deference is not appropriate in such situations.in john whalen,the court of appeals held that the committee opinion interpreting the confidentiality of medical records pursuant to new york public health law was not entitled to deference,especially when the committee view conflicted with that of the commissioner of public health,the officer directly concerned with that law.the court of appeals also noted as a general proposition 
from the perspective of judicial review over agency determinations denying foil requests,committee advisory opinions carry such weight as results from the strength of the reasoning and analysis they contain,but no more.
id.at,at,at see also buffalo news,buffalo enter.dev,rejecting appellate division decision to defer to the committee interpretation of agency within the public officer law but upholding appellate division order only after conducting its own statutory interpretation.the court of appeals has also held that deference to an agency opinion is not required if the issue is one of statutory interpretation,dependent on discerning legislative intent,as statutory construction is the function of the courts.newark valley cent.sch.dist.pub.employment relations,holding that issue of whether a school district duty to negotiate a smoking policy was preempted by statute or policy is a question of law that must be independently examined by courts.because the executive director rested his decision on his interpretation of the copyright act and engaged in statutory interpretation of foil,new york courts would not be required to defer to his opinion,and indeed,would be required to analyze independently both foil and any conflicts foil might raise with the copyright act.
may suffolk county comply with foil and preserve its copyright 
foil emphasizes broad public distribution to further the goal of opening government and explicitly permits the copying of state agency records.while one possible reading of these statutory aspects is to permit publishers,including commercial publishers,to disseminate agency records as widely as possible,it is not the only reading.we find that the better reading,one consistent with the plain language of foil,is to permit suffolk county to maintain its copyright protections while complying with its obligations under foil.
first,foil does not explicitly address what a recipient may or may not do once it receives the agency records it provides only that the state agency must make the records available for public inspection and copying.see pub.off.law.suffolk county may comply with both these mandates while maintaining its copyright.foil also does not prohibit a state agency from placing restrictions on how a record,if it were copyrighted,could be subsequently distributed.weisberg united states dep t of justice,deciding that copyrighted materials are subject to the federal freedom of information act foia,however,does not resolve whether any particular foia request should be granted,and if so,under what terms.foil restricts only the fee which an agency may charge for copying or reproducing the record.pub.off.law b iii.moreover,concluding that foil prohibits the state agency from initiating an infringement action also prevents that agency from taking action in the event that a reproduction inaccurately portrays the content of its record.although there are limits to a state agency ability to restrict access to its records,see farbman sons,new york city health and hosps,foil does not require that the party requesting records make any showing of need,good faith or legitimate purpose,suffolk county is not attempting to restrict initial access but is attempting to restrict only the subsequent redistribution of its copyrighted works.there is nothing inconsistent between fulfilling foil goal of access and permitting a state agency to place reasonable restrictions on the redistribution of its copyrighted works.for example,an agency choice to notify the recipient that a portion of the record is protected by copyright law or an agency requirement that the recipient enter into a licensing agreement if it wishes to distribute the record commercially does not restrict initial access but only what the recipient may do once it acquires access.
it is true that suffolk county tax maps,because they are used in making up the assessment rolls,real prop.tax law a,go to the heart of the purposes of foil providing the public access to the operation or functions of government.a commercial publisher may be an effective means for distributing those records as widely as possible.one could thus attempt to draw a distinction between copyrighted materials such as the tax maps and those copyrighted materials that do not directly impact the governmental agency.but this distinction ignores the fact that foil,by its text,simply does not distinguish among governmental functions that are performed in the exercise of the government public role,its proprietary role,or as a hybrid of both roles.see pub.off.law mckinney defining record as any information kept,held,filed,produced or reproduced by,with or for an agency in any physical form whatsoever id.mckinney supp enumerating specific categories of governmental records that the agency may exempt from disclosure.
to the extent first american raises fears that a state agency will use its copyright to prevent all but the most meager access to its copyrighted materials,see henry perritt,sources of rights to access public information,mary bill rts,those fears are largely quelled by the legal mechanisms preventing a state agency from doing so.the assertion of a copyright does not fall within foil limited exceptions permitting an agency to deny access.see pub.off.law id.b mckinney supp.
suffolk county also can not restrict the subsequent dissemination of its work completely.first,the copyright act protect s only the form of expression and not the ideas expressed.new york times united states,d brennan,concurring see also feist publ ns,rural.serv,d compilation of facts,if sufficiently original,is entitled to copyright protection although the facts contained therein are not attia soc y of new york,cir a copyright thus protects not the author ideas,but only her expression of them,cert.denied,d.second,the fair use doctrine,codified in section of the copyright act,strikes a balance between the rights of a copyright holder and the interest of the public in disseminating information.the fair use of a copyrighted work for purposes such as criticism,comment,news reporting,teaching including multiple copies for classroom use,scholarship,or research,is not an infringement of copyright.the fair use doctrine permits and requires courts to avoid rigid application of the copyright statute when,on occasion,it would stifle the very creativity which that law is designed to foster.campbell music,d internal quotation marks omitted.
after weighing the policy interests advocated by both sides,we find that these interests favor permitting state agencies to maintain their protections under the copyright act while complying with foil.thus,it is possible for suffolk county to comply with its obligations under foil while preserving its rights under the copyright act.
are suffolk county tax maps in the public domain from inception 
first american also contends that,even if we find that suffolk county may assert its copyright while complying with its obligations under foil,we can not do so in this case because suffolk county tax maps should be viewed as being in the public domain,and,hence,uncopyrightable.while conceding below that this is a matter of first impression,first american argues that the tax maps are sufficiently analogous to statutes and judicial opinions,which courts have found may not be copyrighted because they are in the public domain since their inception.see,banks manchester.state judicial opinion howell miller,cir state statutes.officials code code,cir hereinafter boca suggesting but not deciding that regulations modeled on a privately developed code are in the public domain.
the determination that no one may own a copyright in statutes and opinions arises not from a specific provision of the copyright act,but from a judicial gloss on the act.boca,at.in banks,for example,the supreme court held that as a matter of public policy judges may not own a copyright in the fruits of their judicial labor.see at.because judges receive from the public treasury a stated annual salary and can themselves have no pecuniary interest or proprietorship,as against the public at large,they can not own a copyright.id.considerations of due process and fair notice also motivated the banks court the whole work done by the judges constitutes the authentic exposition and interpretation of the law,which,binding every citizen,is free for publication to all id.if judges owned a copyright in their opinions,theoretically,they could restrict dissemination of the law.thus,two considerations influence whether a particular work may be properly deemed in the public domain whether the entity or individual who created the work needs an economic incentive to create or has a proprietary interest in creating the work and whether the public needs notice of this particular work to have notice of the law.see practice mgmt.info.american med,cir boca,at.we consider each factor in turn.
incentive to create 
copyright benefits the public by providing an incentive to stimulate artistic creativity through the grant of a temporary monopoly to a copyright owner.see twentieth century music aiken,d.the banks court found such an incentive for the creation of judicial opinions unnecessary.but banks,to us,represents more than the simple syllogism concluding that the public owns works produced by government employees merely because it pays their salaries.rather,banks is properly read as requiring a determination whether the particular governmental entity or employee has adequate incentive to create the work absent copyright protections.see practice,at the copyright system goal of promoting the arts and sciences by granting temporary monopolies to copyrightholders was not at stake in banks because judges salaries provided adequate incentive to write opinions,keiper,cir recognizing,although rejecting in the specific context,the potential that the profit motive created by copyright may prov
