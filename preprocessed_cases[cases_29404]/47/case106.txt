this case calls upon us to decide whether the new york mercantile exchange,nymex can enforce a copyright in the settlement prices it produces to value customers open positions.we hold that even if these prices are created by question we do not has been no infringement because enforcing the copyright here would effectively accord protection to the idea itself.we also consider the district court dismissal of intercontinentalexchange,ice state law claims and conclude that it did not abuse its discretion in declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction.the judgment of the district court is affirmed.
the new york mercantile exchange,is an exchange for the trading of futures and options contracts for energy commodities.it operates a physical trading floor in new york city where brokers and traders transact.two of its most successful futures contracts are those for henry hub natural gas and west texas intermediate crude oil.intercontinentalexchange,operates an electronic,trading market for trading of physical commodities and derivative contracts.
a futures contract requires the delivery of a commodity at a specified price at a specified future time,though most contracts are liquidated before physical delivery occurs.for each day when the contract remains open before delivery or liquidation,nymex clearing house evaluates the change in value of its customers open contracts.this process,known as the customer open position,determines whether a customer must post additional margin or,instead,receives payments on margin.the settlement prices are used to value the open positions.
to that end,on a daily basis nymex determines the settlement prices for each futures contract.the commodity futures trading commission cftc,pursuant to the commodities exchange act cea,requires nymex,as a designated contract market,to record and disseminate these prices.see b.nymex defines a settlement price as the value,at the end of trading each day,of a particular futures contract for a particular commodity for future delivery at a particular time.for example,today settlement price for an october crude oil contract is the fair market value,today,of a contract obliging the purchase or sale of a specified amount of crude oil in october.
the subcommittees of the nymex settlement price committee the committee are charged with determining the settlement price of each open futures contract for each commodity.unlike on a securities exchange,the settlement price may not be the final trade,for two reasons.first,because of the nature of the trading,it is not always clear which trade was the closing trade.traders handwrite their transactions on cards which are thrown into the center of trading rings,scooped up,time stamped,and sent for processing.because the cards may be scooped up out of order,the card with the latest time stamp may not represent the final trade of the day.second,on any given day,or months of crude oil futures contracts and months of natural gas futures contracts are being traded.for the outer months,those further from the trading date,there is often little or no trading on a particular day.
after the trading floor closes,the committee determines the appropriate price for the delivery of crude oil for each of the next or months and for delivery of natural gas for each of the next.nymex rules distinguish between months with sufficient trading and open interest and months without for simplicity,we will call the former months and the latter months.for months,settlement prices are based on a formula a weighted average of all trades done within the closing range.while only a small number of delivery months are on any given day,ice claims that these months represent a large percentage of the total daily trading volume in these contracts.
for months,the extent of the committee creative judgment is disputed.nymex asserts that the membership considers,sifts,weighs and extrapolates from a wealth of data at the close of trading to reach an opinion as to the appropriate settlement price.ice contends that there is little judgment involved because the subcommittees only review objective market data,and,in practice,look at settlement prices for the near month,those that are determined by mathematical then extrapolate to determine the remainder of the settlement prices based on the changes in the spread relationships in the various contracts compared to the previous day.
nymex rules also provide that the committee may override the settlement price for a high or month.the frequency of the use of the override provision is disputed.
after determining the settlement prices,nymex uses and disseminates them in several ways.first,its clearing house uses the settlement prices to place current values on the accounts of all nymex clearing members whose clients have open positions.the members then use the settlement prices to their customers open positions.second,it publicly discloses those prices by the next business day,as required by the cftc.see pt,app.b,core principle.third,between the time of creating the prices and the required public disclosure the following day,nymex supplies them to market data vendors such as reuters pursuant to license agreements.these vendors then disclose the prices to their subscribers.fourth,the prices are disclosed to the public on nymex website.
ice is one of the subscribers that receives settlement prices through a licensed market data vendor.while ice can not clear trades itself,it contracts with the london clearing house lch to do so.ice copies nymex settlement prices and forwards them to lch which clears ice customers trades.one small exception,however,is when there has been trading on an ice contract and it is not the final day of trading for that particular contract.in that case,the ice committee adjusts the nymex settlement price one tick one cent for crude oil and one tenth of a cent for natural gas closer to the weighted average price of the ice trades.this exception is used more often for natural gas contracts,but even there,most of the prices transmitted to lch are copied from nymex.
in march,nymex sought a copyright for its database including the settlement prices.after the copyright office informed nymex that it was unwilling to provide a copyright in settlement prices,nymex filed a replacement application and obtained a copyright for its database only.
nymex brought this suit in november,in the southern district of new york,alleging copyright infringement trademark infringement under federal and state law,and a state law claim of tortious interference with contract.
ice moved for summary judgment on all of nymex claims nymex for partial summary judgment on the copyrightability of nymex settlement prices and on its state law tortious interference claim.the district court granted ice summary judgment on both the copyright and trademark claims it then declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction and dismissed the state law claims as well.mercantile,intercontinentalexchange,d.
the district court resolved the copyright question without determin ing the degree of creativity that goes into the setting of individual prices.id.at.instead,it found two grounds for depriving nymex of copyright protection in its settlement prices.first,it found that these prices are facts,the actual price at which a futures contract must be settled,and are widely publicized and used as benchmarks by market participants.id.at.b ecause the only way to express the idea of a settlement price,is a single number,the idea can not be distinguished from its expression,and the merger doctrine applies.id.at.second,the settlement prices are words or short phrases.id.at.the district court did not address ice additional arguments for denying nymex copyright claim.id.at.nymex does not appeal the trademark ruling so that portion of the district court decision is not relevant to this discussion.
nymex argues that the district court erred because settlement prices are copyrightable.furthermore,it argues that the district court abused its discretion in declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims.ice defends the district court decision and argues for several alternate grounds to affirm.the united states has filed an amicus curia brief in support of ice,arguing that the settlement prices are facts,even if they are not facts the idea of the prices have merged with their expression,and even if merger did not apply,the prices are not copyrightable because they are short phrases.

the constitution provides that congress shall have power to promote the progress of science and useful arts,by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.const.art.i,cl.pursuant to this power,congress enacted the copyright act,et the latest version of the act states copyright protection subsists in original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression,now known or later developed,from which they can be perceived,reproduced,or otherwise communicated,either directly or with the aid of a machine or device.id.a.one of the categories of protectable works listed in the act is literary works,id.a,defined as works,other than audiovisual works,expressed in words,numbers,or other verbal or numerical symbols or indicia,regardless of the nature of the material objects,such as books,periodicals,manuscripts,phonorecords,film,tapes,disks,or cards,in which they are embodied,id.
the sine qua non of copyright is originality.feist publ ns,rural.serv,d.originality is a constitutional requisite and requires that the work was independently created by the author as opposed to copied from other works and that it possesses at least some minimal degree of creativity.id.originality has been described as founded in the creative powers of the mind the fruits of intellectual labor,in re cases.emphasis omitted,and evidencing intellectual production,thought,and conception,lithographic sarony.
in contrast,facts do not owe their origin to an act of authorship.the distinction is one between creation and discovery the first person to find and report a particular fact has not created the fact he or she has merely discovered its existence.feist,at.a ll,historical biographical,and news of the day may not be copyrighted and are part of the public domain available to every person.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.as professor nimmer explains in his leading copyright treatise 
the discoverer of a scientific fact as to the nature of the physical world,an historical fact,a contemporary news event,or any other fact,may not claim to be the author of that fact the discoverer merely finds and records.he may not claim that the facts are original with him,although there may be originality and hence,authorship in the manner of reporting,the expression,of the facts.as copyright may only be conferred upon authors,it follows that discoveries as facts per se may not be the subject of copyright.
melville nimmer david nimmer,nimmer on copyright e nimmer internal footnote call numbers omitted.nymex concedes,and indeed it is universally understood,that if a settlement price is a fact,it can not be copyrighted.feist,at.
in elucidating the distinction between original creation and discovery,the feist court provided a helpful example census takers are not authors of the census data.census takers merely discover the appropriate population figure in a sense,they copy these figures from the world around them.id.at.
the question then,is one of characterization does the committee create the settlement prices,or is it more accurate to view the committee task as like that of a census taker,copying the market valuation of futures contracts while the line between creation and discovery is often,we recognize that it is a difficult line to draw in this case.for reasons we explain below,we believe there is a strong argument that,like the census taker,nymex does not author the settlement prices as the term is used in copyright law see,at.defining author as he to whom anything owes its origin originator maker internal citation omitted.still,because this is a close question,particularly at the summary judgment stage,we do not decide whether settlement prices are unoriginal,and instead affirm based on the merger doctrine,as discussed in part iii.
in considering how to characterize the committee task we start with what a settlement price measures.for months,settlement prices are determinations of how the market values a particular futures contract.after all,there is no dispute that the committee members seek to determine the appropriate market valuation of each commodity contract,not how the market should value them or will value them.under this view,the market is an empirical reality,an economic fact about the world,that committee members are seeking to discover.thus,there is a strong argument that,as a matter of law,the committee is discovering facts,not creating predictions or estimates so characterized,there is one proper settlement price other prices are mistakes which actually overvalue or undervalue the futures contract.after all,as nymex executive vice president and chief operating officer has stated,nymex settlement prices are heavily relied upon because they reflect actual trades,not mere sentiment 
that said,characterizing the committee task as discovery,even for months,is disputable.the analogy to the census taker is not perfectly apt because the discovery of a settlement price is a more abstract concept than the discovery of a population figure an economic reality is certainly less tangible than a population reality.for example,with sufficiently precise tools we could perhaps measure the population of a metropolis,whereas it is not clear that we could ever precisely calculate the appropriate valuation of a particular futures contract.
the characterization inquiry is even more difficult for months,particularly at the summary judgment stage.we recognize that settlement prices are determined for or months of crude oil futures contracts and months of natural gas futures contracts every day.there is generally less trading in contracts for the outer months.it may be the case that there is a material factual dispute whether,for certain outer months,there is so little trading that there is no real market to speak of.where there is no market the committee work appears closer to creation,to making predictions of expected values.ccc,at.for such months,then,we are particularly reluctant to hold,as a matter of law,that the committee is discovering the settlement prices in any event,it is unnecessary to resolve this question and we instead affirm because even if nymex creates the settlement prices,nymex claim fails due to application of the merger doctrine,as explained below.
assuming that the settlement prices are created and not discovered,we consider whether the merger doctrine should be applied to withhold copyright protection it has been long accepted that copyright protection does not extend to ideas it protects only the means of expression employed by the author.ccc,at see also b in no case does copyright protection for an original work of authorship extend to any idea,procedure,process,system,method of operation,concept,principle,or discovery,regardless of the form in which it is described,explained,illustrated,or embodied in such work.because ideas are too important to the advancement of knowledge to permit them to be under private ownership,and because open public debate,which is essential to a free democratic society,requires free access to the ideas to be debated,ideas can not be copyrighted.ccc,at.instead,only the manner of an idea expression is copyrightable.id.
to ensure free access to ideas,courts have applied the merger doctrine such that even expression is not protected in those instances where there is only one or so few ways of expressing an idea that protection of the expression would effectively accord protection to the idea itself.kregos associated press,cir see also nimmer b explaining that courts have invoked the merger doctrine where rigorously protecting the expression would confer a monopoly over the idea itself,in contravention of the statutory command.we must exercise considerable care,in analyzing merger if the merger doctrine is applied too readily,arguably available alternative forms of expression will be precluded if applied too sparingly,protection will be accorded to ideas.kregos,at.
we begin by identifying the idea that might be merging with its expression.the district court stated that the idea is the price of a particular futures contract at the close of trading.nymex,d at.nymex disputes this approach and argues that the idea is that a sound and reasonable opinion of fair market value for each nymex contract as of the close of open outcry trading on the nymex floor each day may be achieved by assessing trades,bids,and offers and in various instances off exchange information,particularly developed late in the trading day.the united states disagrees,and argues instead that a settlement price is the expression of a much more specific idea,for example,that a henry hub natural gas futures contracts is worth dollars sic at the end of a given day.
even if we accept nymex formulation,however,the expression here merges with the idea.in this circuit,we look at the range of possible expressions and consider whether all possible expressions are so substantially similar that granting the copyright would bar others from expressing the underlying idea hart dan chase taxidermy supply,cir.to survive summary judgment,then,nymex must demonstrate that the range of possible settlement prices is broad enough that any possible expression will not necessarily be substantially similar.id.
it can not meet that burden.nymex is not seeking a copyright in the process whereby settlement prices are created instead,the fair market value for each nymex contract is expressed as a settlement price,and it is these prices that nymex seeks to bar ice from using.it is undisputed that all possible expression takes the same form,a number.the question then becomes the possible range of that number.because any settlement price for a particular futures contract would be determined based on the same underlying market facts,any dissension would be exceptionally narrow.while nymex contends that there are numerous possible variations as to what the settlement prices should be,it has not demonstrated a range of possible variations that would preclude application of the merger doctrine.see colavito organ donor network,cir a party may not defeat a rule motion based on conjecture alone.instead,the record merely demonstrates that,at times,committee members have disagreed on the exact settlement price.to grant nymex copyright protection here would effectively accord protection to the idea itself,kregos,at,and bar ice or other competitors from valuing nymex contracts.we decline to do so.
furthermore,policy considerations weigh heavily in determining the appropriate application of the merger doctrine.see ccc,at noting that kregos,makes a policy judgment as between two evils,and withholding application of the merger doctrine where u nbridled application of the merger doctrine would undo the protection the copyright law intends to accord.t he objectives of the copyright law are to promote the advancement of knowledge and learning by giving authors economic incentives in the form of exclusive rights to their creations to labor on creative,works.id.at.without such incentives authors might direct their energies elsewhere,depriving the public of their creations and impeding the advance of learning.id.at.put another way,copyright is intended to increase and not to impede the harvest of knowledge,while also assur ing contributors to the store of knowledge a fair return for their labors.harper row,publishers,nation,d.
nymex needs no such incentives here.in order to establish a functioning commodities market it must have a price at which to settle open positions.furthermore,nymex is required by law to record settlement prices,and it does not challenge the legality of that rule.see b each reporting market shall record the following information t he settlement price established by each reporting market or its clearing organization.even without copyright in its settlement prices we are confident that nymex will not direct its energies elsewhere,ccc,at,as its exchange requires settlement prices to clear contracts.
we therefore apply the merger doctrine and hold that,in using the settlement prices,ice took nothing more than ideas,for which the copyright law affords no protection to the author.id.at.because the expression is essential to the statement of the idea,the expression is also unprotected.id.
as nymex can not prevail due to application of the merger doctrine,we reach neither the district court analysis of the short phrases doctrine nor ice alternative bases on which to affirm.
having determined that the district court correctly found that nymex federal copyright claim fails,we must now consider whether the district court abused its discretion in declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over nymex state law claims.we find that the district court acted well within the bounds of its discretion.in general,where the federal claims are dismissed before trial,the state claims should be dismissed as well.marcus,cir.furthermore,here the district court determined that resolving the state law claim would entail resolving additional issues of fact,nymex,d at,making dismissal of those claims after the federal claims had been dismissed particularly appropriate.
for the foregoing reasons,we hereby affirm the judgment of the district court granting summary judgment to the defendants,denying plaintiff for partial summary judgment,and declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction.
i agree with the result reached in the majority opinion nymex settlement prices do not merit copyright protection.i write separately,however,to register my disagreement with the majority analysis in part ii of its opinion,where it asserts,unnecessarily in my view,that there exists a strong argument nymex settlement prices lack the requisite originality to qualify for copyright protection.in so doing,the majority renders dicta that contemplate heightening the standards by which we determine whether a work exhibits some minimal degree of creativity.feist publ ns rural.serv,d.this is a step contraindicated both by our jurisprudence and by the procedural posture of this case.because the application of the merger doctrine,as explained in part iii of the majority opinion,makes it unnecessary for us to consider this question of originality,i concur in all but part ii of the majority opinion.
in this case,nymex faced the task of meeting the originality requirement in the context of an appeal from summary judgment.rooted in the constitution,the originality requirement of copyright presents an extremely low bar.feist,at.to prove possession of a valid copyright,a party must show a subject is an original work of authorship.a nimmer on copyright,a ed.the supreme court has emphasized that o riginal,as the term is used in copyright,means only that the work was independently created by the author and that it possesses at least some minimal degree of creativity.feist,at.to be sure,the requisite level of creativity is extremely low even a slight amount will suffice.the vast majority of works make the grade quite easily,as they possess some creative spark,no matter how crude,humble or obvious it might be.id.internal citations omitted see also key publ ns chinatown today publ g,cir.
