appellant porta stor,porta stor appeals a judgment in favor of appellee pods,pods for,among other things,patent and copyright infringement.we conclude that the district court erred in its patent claim construction that no literal infringement occurred under the correct construction and that infringement under the doctrine of equivalents is barred by prosecution history estoppel.therefore,we reverse the judgment of patent infringement.in addition,since we hold that a reasonable jury could have concluded that pods did not own the asserted copyright,we reverse the district court grant of judgment as a matter of law on copyright infringement and remand for a new trial on this issue.in other respects,we affirm.
background 
pods and porta stor are both storage and moving companies that operate by delivering storage containers to customers.after loading the container,the customer either uses it for storage or requests that the container be picked up and transported to warehouse storage or a destination of the customer choosing.
pods is the assignee of united states patent filed june,patent,which claims an apparatus and method for lifting a storage container from the ground onto a transport vehicle or vice versa.patent.claim claims a n apparatus for lifting,handling and transporting a container that includes,in relevant part 
a carrier frame including right and left longitudinal elements juxtaposed with the right and left sides,respectively,of the container to be handled and transported,each longitudinal element extending between opposite first and second ends,the carrier frame having front and rear transverse elements juxtaposed with the front and rear ends,respectively,of the container to be handled and transported,each transverse element extending between opposite right and left ends,the left ends of the front and rear elements being adjacent to the first and second ends,respectively,of the left longitudinal element,and the right ends of the front and rear elements being adjacent to the first and second ends,respectively,of the right longitudinal element.
id.emphases added.claim also requires that the carrier frame is capable of being lowered around the container.id.emphasis added.it is undisputed that claim discloses a rectangular carrier frame,with the right and left longitudinal elements defining the length of the rectangle and the front and rear elements defining its width apparatus claim is identical to claim in all relevant respects claim claims a method of lifting,handling and transporting a container on to and off from a transport vehicle.id.two limitations of claim are relevant to this appeal positioning a carrier frame around the container on the transport vehicle platform and moving and positioning the carrier frame around the container.id,
on september,pods filed a complaint in the united states district court for the middle district of florida,and later amended it.the amended complaint alleged that porta stor apparatus for lifting,handling,and transporting storage structure with two long sides,one shorter side,and an so as to form a the patent.pods also alleged copyright infringement,asserting that porta stor copied a rental agreement for portable storage units of which pods was the copyright owner.
the parties consented to have the entire proceeding conducted before a magistrate judge.see c.on november,the district court issued a preliminary injunction barring porta stor from,inter alia,selling or marketing their method and apparatus for lifting,handling,and transporting a storage container.on appeal we affirmed the grant of a preliminary injunction,finding that the magistrate judge was correct in holding that porta stor motion did not present sufficient grounds for dissolving the preliminary injunction.pods,porta stor.
after the final pretrial conference,the district court resolved issues of claim construction.the parties apparently agreed that the terms carrier frame and around in claims and required an apparatus that uses a or carrier frame.pods,porta stor,slip op.at,wl.june,claim construction order.porta stor argued that the terms in claim should be given the same meaning.id.at.instead,the district court,agreeing with pods,construed carrier frame in claim as not limited to a,rectangular shaped frame and around to mean on all four sides or on less than all four sides.id.at.the district court apparently agreed with pods argument that the omission in claim of the detailed description of a carrier frame found in claim presumably carries consequences and that the carrier frame described in claim is less precise and limited.id.at.
a jury trial began on june.at the close of the evidence,the district court granted judgment of infringement as a matter of law jmol for pods on the patent and copyright infringement claims.it found that independent claim of the patent was literally infringed and that independent claims and and their dependent claims were infringed under the doctrine of equivalents.the district court also found,as a matter of law,that the patent was not invalid,thus effectively rejecting porta stor affirmative defenses and counterclaims of invalidity.additionally,the district court found that the pods rental agreement was subject to valid copyright protection and,since porta rental agreement is identical to pods rental agreement porta by its rental agreement has infringed pods copyright.the case was then submitted to the jury,which found that porta stor infringement of the patent was willful and awarded in damages.the jury concluded that the infringement of the copyright was not willful and awarded no copyright damages,though the court allowed damages in the statutory minimum amount of.
the jury also found a willful violation of the lanham act,but only awarded.the jury also found that porta stor willfully violated the florida common law of unfair competition and awarded.finally,the jury found a willful violation of the florida deceptive and unfair trade practices act,but awarded no damages.
on june,the day of the jury verdict,the court entered a judgment ordering porta stor to pay pods a total of.the court noted in an order accompanying the judgment that it would still consider a motion from pods to increase the patent damages under.on august,the district court doubled the patent damages and entered a permanent injunction that bars porta stor from infringing the patent.on the same day,it also awarded attorney fees and expenses to pods on the patent claim under based on willful infringement but declined to do so on the claims.
porta stor appealed on july.
discussion 
we have an obligation to assure ourselves of our jurisdiction before considering the merits of an appeal.see steel citizens for a better env t,d.this case represents another example of the litigants failure to address potential problems concerning the finality of the judgment.the district court entered a formal judgment in a civil case on june,that appeared to be appealable however,on august,the court also entered a permanent injunction on the patent claims.porta stor filed a notice of appeal on july,from the june,judgment but apparently did not file a notice of appeal from the august,amended judgment.
under federal rule of appellate procedure a,a notice of appeal filed after the court announces a decision or before the entry of the judgment or treated as filed on the date of and after the entry.this situation falls within the scope of rule a.this provision is designed for situations in which the unskilled litigant files a notice of appeal from a decision that he reasonably but mistakenly believes to be a final judgment,while failing to file a notice of appeal from the actual final judgment.firstier mortgage investors mortgage ins,d.we believe it applies equally where the formal judgment appears to be appealable even though not final.thus,porta stor premature notice of appeal should be treated as being filed on august,the date that the district court entered the amended judgment.we thus conclude that we have jurisdiction over this appeal.
because article iii standing is jurisdictional,we must also consider porta stor standing to bring this appeal before considering the merits.pandrol usa,lp airboss ry.we conclude that porta stor lacks standing to appeal the jury finding of a violation of the florida deceptive and unfair trade practices act.t he law is that a party lacks standing to appeal from a judgment by which it is not aggrieved.see penda united states.the district court judgment in this case did not award damages,an injunction,or attorney fees based on the florida statutory claim,nor did pods seek a declaratory judgment on this claim.porta stor has identified no other basis to conclude that it was aggrieved by the district court judgment,and therefore it lacks standing to appeal the jury verdict on the florida deceptive and unfair trade practices act.see id.at courts have not recognized standing to appeal where a party does not seek reversal of the judgment but asks only for review of unfavorable findings.
addressing the merits,porta stor asserts that the district court erred when it granted jmol on the issue of patent infringement,finding infringement as a matter of law.we review the grant or denial of jmol without deference.go med.indus,inmed.claim construction is a question of law which we review without deference.cybor fas,en banc.
porta stor argues that the district court erred in not construing the phrases carrier frame and around in claim to have the same meaning as they undisputedly have in claim,namely a rectangular shaped frame that completely surrounds the container on all four sides.
we begin our claim construction analysis with the words of the claims themselves.see phillips awh,en banc.we are not limited to considering just the language of claim because o ther claims of the patent in question,both asserted and unasserted,are valuable sources of enlightenment as to the meaning of a claim term.id.at.in this case,the term carrier frame in claim also appears in claim where it is specifically described as including right and left longitudinal elements adjacent to front and rear transverse elements.patent.the parties agree that the structure described as a carrier frame in claim is a or carrier frame that surrounds the container on all sides.claim construction order,slip op.at.we apply a presumption that the same terms appearing in different portions of the claims should be given the same meaning unless it is clear from the specification and prosecution history that the terms have different meanings at different portions of the claims.fin control,oam,see also,phillips,at rexnord laitram.pods has pointed to no evidence in the specification or the prosecution history that the term carrier frame in claim has any meaning other than the uncontested meaning in claim.to the contrary,the only embodiments disclosed in the specification are.also,as discussed in the next section,during prosecution the dousset prior art patent was distinguished on the ground that the patent claimed a frame,thus suggesting that all claims were limited to a device.see southwall,cardinal ig,a rguments made during prosecution regarding the meaning of a claim term are relevant to the interpretation of that term in every claim of the patent absent a clear indication to the contrary.we therefore conclude that the term carrier frame in claim,as in claim,requires a or rectangular shape.see claim construction order,slip op.at.
as pods itself notes,in a claim that recites a carrier frame placing that carrier frame around the container would result in all four sides of the carrier frame being around the container.appellee br.at.thus,since we construe the term carrier frame in claim to require a structure,we necessarily construe the term around to require the frame to be on all sides of the container.this construction is confirmed by the ordinary meaning of around,which in this context is defined as along the outer edge or boundary of on all sides of so as to encircle or enclose about.webster third new international dictionary emphases added.
the second step of the infringement analysis is to compare the accused device to the patented invention as construed to determine infringement.pods conced ed that the accused device,which embodies a or carrier frame,does not literally read on claim because claim describes an apparatus that uses a or carrier frame.claim construction order,slip op.at.since claim also describes a or carrier frame,there can be no dispute that porta stor device does not literally infringe claim.thus,the district court finding of literal infringement of claim was erroneous.
even if a product or process does not literally infringe upon the express terms of a patent claim,it may nonetheless be found to infringe if there is equivalence between the elements of the accused product or process and the claimed elements of the patented invention.hilton davis chem,d.the district court found infringement by equivalents of claims and of the patent.however,prosecution history estoppel limits the range of equivalents available to a patentee by preventing recapture of subject matter surrendered during prosecution of the patent.southwall,at.w here a patent applicant sets forth multiple bases to distinguish between its invention and the cited prior art,the separate arguments can create separate estoppels as long as the prior art was not distinguished based on the combination of these various grounds.id.at.to invoke estoppel the prosecution history must evince a clear and unmistakable surrender of subject matter.conoco,energy envtl.int l,internal quotation marks omitted.
we conclude that arguments made by pods during prosecution bar it from asserting that porta stor device infringed by equivalents.during prosecution,the examiner rejected claim of the patent as obvious in light of the dousset prior art reference,patent patent,and another reference.in response,pods argued that applicants invention is decidedly different from the teachings of the dousset patent for three reasons.first,dousset required specially designed containers,whereas pods device was operable with any container.second,a s the examiner acknowledges,the dousset reference clearly lacks the teachings of the singular frame.at emphasis added.third,pods invention teaches uniformity in the handling,lifting and lowering of a container whereas the dousset reference clearly lacks combined elevating and positioning means as thought by the present invention which allows the carrier frame to be elevated and positioned as a frame with respect to the container,the vehicle and the ground.at emphasis added.the second basis pods offered for distinguishing dousset,along with the reference to a rectangular shape in the third basis,clearly and unmistakably shows that pods limited its claims to a frame and surrendered any claim to a frame that was not rectangular or.since pods offered each argument as a separate basis for distinguishing dousset,its argument created a separate estoppel.see southwall,at.
pods argues that it was unnecessary to distinguish dousset on the ground since the examiner had acknowledged that dousset comprises two separate units rather than a single frame and relied on another reference to satisfy the rectangular frame limitation of claim.at.however,c lear assertions made during prosecution in support of patentability,whether or not actually required to secure allowance of the claim,may also create an estoppel,southwall,at,because t he relevant inquiry is whether a competitor would reasonably believe that the applicant had surrendered the relevant subject matter,conoco,at quoting cybor,at.in this case,pods,in support of its assertion of patentability over dousset,clearly stated that its claimed frame was rectangular in shape.a competitor would reasonably believe that pods had surrendered any claim to a frame that was not rectangular or in shape,such as porta stor,device.
thus,pods arguments during prosecution bar it from asserting that porta stor device infringed claim of the patent under the doctrine of equivalents.moreover,although the arguments distinguishing dousset do not directly apply to claim,which was added after the obviousness rejection,once an argument is made regarding a claim term so as to create an estoppel,the estoppel will apply to that
