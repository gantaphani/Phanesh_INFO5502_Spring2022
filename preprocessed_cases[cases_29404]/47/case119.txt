plaintiff william krause appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york thomas platt,granting defendants motion for summary judgment.krause brought this suit against titleserv,its owner and ceo,three employees,and an affiliated company collectively titleserv.the complaint alleged that titleserv infringed the plaintiff copyright by modifying the source code of eight computer programs he authored for titleserv.
titleserv moved for summary judgment on the basis of a as well as on other grounds.section a provides an affirmative defense against copyright infringement for anyone who i owns a physical copy of a computer program,ii makes an adaptation as an essential step in the utilization of the computer program in conjunction with a machine,and iii uses it in no other manner.the district court,following the recommendation of magistrate judge william wall,concluded there was no genuine issue of material fact and granted summary judgment in favor of titleserv.
on appeal,krause challenges the district court interpretation and application of a.we affirm.
background 
between and plaintiff krause performed computer and communications work for titleserv.he wrote over computer programs for titleserv.the eight programs at issue in this suit were designed to enable titleserv to track and report on the status of client requests and other aspects of its operations.the programs were installed on titleserv computer network and were thus accessible to titleserv employees.
krause wrote the programs in clipper,a programming language.code written in such a programming language is called source code.source code becomes executable only when it is run through a compiler which converts it into the binary and of object,or executable,code.see universal city studios,corley,cir.
in,krause and titleserv began negotiating krause assignment of the copyright in his programs to titleserv in exchange for a consulting agreement.on july,before any agreement was reached,krause terminated his relationship with titleserv after learning that titleserv intended that he take direction from its new director of information technology.when krause left,he took his notebook computer,which contained the only copies of the source code for two of the programs.he left copies of the source code for the other six disputed programs on the titleserv file servers because titleserv had backup tapes,so that in krause words,removing the source from the file servers would have been a meaningless gesture.krause left executable versions of all eight programs at issue on titleserv file servers,but locked them with a command,which prevented a popular decompiler from converting the executable code back into source code.
krause told titleserv that it was free to continue using the executable code as it existed on the day krause left,but asserted that titleserv had no right to modify the source code.inability to modify the source code would have severely limited the value of those programs to titleserv.many routine functions such as the addition of a new customer or a change of a customer address could be performed only by changing the source code.in addition,changes were required to fix bugs from time to time to keep the system from crashing.
on july,titleserv filed suit against krause in state court alleging,inter alia,misappropriation of its property employees of titleserv subsequently circumvented the lock he had placed on the executable code and decompiled it back into source code.an employee then set about cleaning up the source code by formatting it,assigning proper variable names,and adding comments.titleserv made further modifications,including the fixing of bugs,the addition of new customers,and changes in customer addresses,to keep the old programs functional while titleserv developed a new,system.krause system was then phased out at some point between late and early.
krause brought this suit in the eastern district of new york.the complaint,as amended,states a single cause of action for copyright infringement based on titleserv alleged copying of his programs and its production of derivative works.
after discovery,titleserv moved for summary judgment.the district court referred the matter to magistrate judge wall,who recommended granting summary judgment in favor of titleserv on the ground that titleserv use and modification of krause programs was protected by a.
on october,the district court adopted the magistrate judge report and granted summary judgment for titleserv.krause titleserv,d.krause then brought this appeal.
discussion 
this appeal turns on whether titleserv was entitled to summary judgment on the basis of the affirmative defense provided in a,as the district court found section a allows the owner of a copy of a computer program to copy or modify the program for limited purposes without incurring liability for infringement.it states 
notwithstanding the provisions of section which generally provides,inter alia,that copying of a protected work is an infringement,it is not an infringement for the owner of a copy of a computer program to make or authorize the making of another copy or adaptation of that computer program provided 
that such a new copy or adaptation is created as an essential step in the utilization of the computer program in conjunction with a machine and that it is used in no other manner,or 
that such new copy or adaptation is for archival purposes only and that all archival copies are destroyed in the event that continued possession of the computer program should cease to be rightful.
we are concerned only with subparagraph,as titleserv has not alleged that it copied krause programs solely for archival purposes.
to come within the protection of a on these facts,titleserv must demonstrate that the new adaptation of krause program i was made by the owner of a copy of the computer program ii was created as an essential step in the utilization of the computer program in conjunction with a machine and iii was used in no other manner.
o wner of a copy of a computer program 
because a protects only the owner of a copy of a computer program,we must first determine whether titleserv owned the copies of the computer programs at issue.ownership of a copy is something distinct from copyright ownership.see ownership of a copyright,or of any of the exclusive rights under a copyright,is distinct from ownership of any material object in which the work is embodied.for example,the author of a book,or her assignee,ordinarily owns the copyright in the book and thus the sole right to authorize copying each purchaser of a copy of the book owns that copy,but is generally not entitled to make copies from it.
it is undisputed that titleserv possessed executable copies of all the programs.the parties disagree whether titleserv owned those copies within the meaning of a.krause claims that titleserv never owned the program copies saved on its file server,but rather possessed the copies as a licensee pursuant to an oral agreement.titleserv asserts that it owns copies of the programs because it paid krause a substantial sum to develop them and has an undisputed right to possess and use them permanently.
interpreting the word owner is more complex than might first appear.ownership of property is often described as a bundle of rights.see,flagg,brooks,d observing that for purposes of interpreting the fourteenth amendment,a property interest is not a monolithic,abstract concept hovering in the legal stratosphere.it is a bundle of rights.it is not clear from the text of a how many and what kind of sticks may be removed from the bundle before the possessor of a copy of a computer program is no longer considered its owner for purposes of a.
the legislative history of a is sparse and provides limited guidance on this point.section a was based on the recommendations of the national commission on new technological uses of copyrighted works contu or the commission.congress largely enacted the language proposed by the commission,with one notable exception.the report originally proposed making the affirmative defense of a available to the rightful possessor of a copy of a computer program.final report of the national commission on new technological uses of copyrighted works emphasis added hereinafter contu report.congress changed the term rightful possessor to owner but did not explain its reason.see.i,at,reprinted in.
krause contends that congress substitution of the word owner for the commission term,which would have accorded adaptation rights to any rightful possessor,reveals that congress intended to restrict the benefit of the statute to title owners.at least one district court has agreed.see applied info.mgmt.icart.other courts have attached less importance to formal title,looking rather at the various incidents of ownership.the federal circuit followed this latter approach in dsc communications pulse communications.dsc communications involved a contributory infringement claim that required the court to determine whether the regional bell operating companies rbocs owned copies of the software they transferred regularly onto interface cards.the federal circuit concluded that the rbocs were not owners within the meaning of a,not merely because the rbocs did not have title,but rather because licensing agreements with the copyright holder severely limit ed the rights of the rbocs with respect to the software in ways that are inconsistent with the rights normally enjoyed by owners of copies of software.id.at.for example,the agreements prohibited the rbocs from using dsc software on hardware other than that provided by dsc.id.the agreements also limited the authority of the rbocs to transfer copies of the software,even though the first sale doctrine would have protected certain transfers if the rbocs had owned copies of the software.id.
in our view,congress decision to reject rightful possessor in favor of owner does not indicate an intention to limit the protection of the statute to those possessing formal title.the term rightful possessor is quite broad.had that term been used,the authority granted by the statute would benefit a messenger delivering a program,a bailee,or countless others temporarily in lawful possession of a copy.congress easily could have intended to reject so broad a category of beneficiaries without intending a narrow,formalistic definition of ownership dependent on title.
several considerations militate against interpreting a to require formal title in a program copy.first,whether a party possesses formal title will frequently be a matter of state law.see melville nimmer david nimmer,nimmer on copyright b stating that copy ownership arises presumably under state law.the result would be to undermine some of the uniformity achieved by the copyright act.the same transaction might be deemed a sale under one state law and a lease under another.if a required formal title,two software users,engaged in substantively identical transactions might find that one is liable for copyright infringement while the other is protected by a,depending solely on the state in which the conduct occurred.such a result would contradict the copyright act express objective of creating national,uniform copyright law by broadly preempting state statutory and copyright regulation.cmty.for creative reid,d see also a.
second,it seems anomalous for a user whose degree of ownership of a copy is so complete that he may lawfully use it and keep it forever,or if so disposed,throw it in the trash,to be nonetheless unauthorized to fix it when it develops a bug,or to make an archival copy as backup security.
we conclude for these reasons that formal title in a program copy is not an absolute prerequisite to qualifying for a affirmative defense.instead,courts should inquire into whether the party exercises sufficient incidents of ownership over a copy of the program to be sensibly considered the owner of the copy for purposes of a.the presence or absence of formal title may of course be a factor in this inquiry,but the absence of formal title may be outweighed by evidence that the possessor of the copy enjoys sufficiently broad rights over it to be sensibly considered its owner.
we conclude that titleserv owned copies of the disputed programs within the meaning of a.we reach this conclusion in consideration of the following factors titleserv paid krause substantial consideration to develop the programs for its sole benefit.krause customized the software to serve titleserv operations.the copies were stored on a server owned by titleserv.krause never reserved the right to repossess the copies used by titleserv and agreed that titleserv had the right to continue to possess and use the programs forever,regardless whether its relationship with krause terminated.titleserv was similarly free to discard or destroy the copies any time it wished.in our view,the pertinent facts in the aggregate satisfy a requirement of ownership of a copy.
krause responds to this strong evidence of ownership by asserting that titleserv,acting through its ceo,orally agreed to possess the copies as a mere licensee.he claims evidentiary support in six of his own prior statements.his reliance on these statements,however,confuses ownership of a copyright with ownership of a copy of the copyrighted material.most of the cited passages,when read in context,relate to the ownership right to use of the copyright,and not to ownership of the copies krause ownership of the copyright in the programs is not disputed,but is irrelevant to titleserv rights under a,which depend on ownership of a copy of the copyrighted material.the final citation is to krause deposition in which he gave the conclusory answer no when asked when you left on july,did titleserv own the copies of the executables this conclusory assertion on an issue of law is not sufficient to raise a material issue of fact.see jorgensen records,cir.
we conclude in the absence of other evidence that titleserv right,for which it paid substantial sums,to possess and use a copy indefinitely without material restriction,as well as to discard or destroy it at will,gave it sufficient incidents of ownership to make it the owner of the copy for purposes of applying a 
ii.c reated as an essential step in the utilization of the computer program in conjunction with a machine 
the next statutory factor titleserv must satisfy addresses whether titleserv modification of the programs was an essential step in the utilization of the computer program s in conjunction with a machine.the district court and the magistrate judge both relied heavily on our decision in aymes bonelli,cir aymes ii in finding that titleserv modifications qualified.aymes ii involved programs designed to assist the inventory,and sales functions of a chain of retail stores selling swimming pools and pool supplies.id.at.the defendants,which were the users of the programs,modified the programs to keep them and to ensure their compatibility with the defendants successive generations of computer systems.id.at.the plaintiff,who owned the copyright in the programs,alleged that the defendants unauthorized modifications infringed his copyright.we concluded that the modifications were essential to the defendants utilization of the programs within the meaning of a because the adaptations were essential to allow use of the program s for the very purpose for which they were purchased.id.at.
the modifications allegedly made by titleserv to its copy of the programs fall into four main categories correcting programming errors or bugs,which interfered with the proper functioning of the programs changing the source code to add new clients,insert changed client addresses,and perform other routine tasks necessary to keep the programs and to maintain their usefulness to titleserv incorporating the programs into the system titleserv designed and implemented between and and adding capabilities,such as the ability to print checks,and,to a limited degree,allowing customers direct access to their records,which made titleserv copy of the programs more responsive to the needs of titleserv business.
as for the first two types of modifications,a straightforward application of aymes ii to the undisputed facts establishes that these modifications constituted essential step s in the utilization of the computer program s in conjunction with a machine.the fixing of bugs was done so that the programs would continue to function.without such fixing,the programs would not function properly.it can not seriously be disputed that such fixing is essential.titleserv modification of the source code to reflect such business changes as the addition of new customers and changed customer addresses also comes within the scope of the modifications approved in aymes ii,which were designed to keep the software in step with changes in the defendants business.
as for the third type of modifications,involving adaptation of the programs so that they would function on titleserv new system,we note in passing that titleserv vigorously denies krause allegation that it copied his programs into the new system.in adjudicating titleserv motion for summary judgment,however,we must utilize the version of the evidence most favorable to krause,drawing all permissible inferences in his favor.cifarelli vill.of babylon,cir.utilizing that standard to assume that titleserv did incorporate copyrighted matter from krause programs into its new system,we nonetheless conclude,following aymes ii,that such adaptation qualifies under a as an essential step.in aymes ii,we reached the same conclusion as to the defendants adaptation of their copy of the software so that it would continue to function on the defendants new computer system.at.
the only category of titleserv modifications requiring additional analysis is the fourth category the addition of new features,such as check printing and providing for direct client access.such changes were not strictly necessary to keep the programs functioning,but were designed to improve their functionality in serving the business for which they were created.
focusing on a use of the word essential,krause argues that an adaptation or change does not come within the protection of a unless it is truly necessary to the functioning of the system.he thus argues that,while the fixing of bugs may be permitted because such repairs are essential to keep the program operating,adaptations that improve the functionality of the system but are not required to keep it operational can not qualify.
we already implicitly rejected krause argument in aymes ii.in that case,some of the program changes approved by our ruling as falling within the protection of a had nothing to do with enabling the programs to continue functioning they rather involved adapting the programs to changes in the defendants business.for example,the aymes ii defendants changed product lines,from gas barbecues to ceiling fans to swimming pool supplies,and the alterations of the programs were designed to maintain the utility of the programs in connection with these changes in product lines.joint app.at,aymes ii.unless we were to retreat from that ruling,we would be compelled to reject the narrow reading of a which krause urges on us.
we see no reason to retreat from aymes ii.the statute is ambiguous on the point in question.the word essential is defined as necessary,indispensable,or unavoidable.see webster third new international dictionary.in use,its meaning varies considerably from one context to another.for example,one might say it is essential when driving a car to stay alert.this does not mean it is impossible to drive a car without being alert,but rather stresses the importance of staying alert.similarly,one might ask an essential question.this does not mean the question had to be asked,but rather that it goes to the heart of the matter.
essential is often used as a synonym of necessary,as indicated by its dictionary definition.particularly as used in the law,the word necessary is ambiguous.according to black law dictionary,the word is susceptible of various meanings.it may import absolute physical necessity or inevitability,or it may import that which is only convenient,useful,appropriate,suitable,proper,or conducive to the end sought.black law dictionary ed black law dictionary ed see also maryland,wheat.the word necessary,standing by itself,has no inflexible meaning it is used in a sense more or less strict,according to the subject.the same ambiguity inheres in the word essential,which in some of its meanings is effectively synonymous with necessary.we reject krause contention that the word essential can apply only to a modification without which the program could not function.
moreover,krause focuses too narrowly on the word essential.the meaning of the phrase an essential step in the utilization of the computer program is equally dependent on the word utilization.the dictionary defines utilize as to make useful,turn to profitable account or use,make use of,and convert to use.webster third new international dictionary at.this definition sheds little light on what the word utilization means in the context of a.utilization of a computer program might refer exclusively to booting and running the program,in which case only limited modification,such as fixing bugs to prevent the program from crashing,might qualify as an essential step in booting or running the program.on the other hand,utilization might refer more broadly to mak ing the program useful to the owner of the copy,in which case more extensive modification that involved adding new program features to enhance functionality might qualify as an essential step in making the program useful.accordingly,even if the word essential is given a narrow meaning,encompassing only absolute necessity,a remains ambiguous because the statute does not clearly indicate for what end modifications must be absolutely necessary.
in arguing that a authorizes only adaptations absolutely necessary to make a program boot or run,krause contends that his interpretation is required to avoid rendering the phrase in conjunction with a machine superfluous.his argument goes as follows because a computer program inevitably functions on a machine,the statutory words in conjunction with a machine would be tautological and unnecessary if given their ordinary meaning.on the assumption that congress intends every portion of a statute to have meaning,the phrase in conjunction with a machine must therefore place an additional limitation on the scope of a.that limitation restricts the meaning of essential step to those modifications absolutely necessary to make a program boot and run.
krause is mistaken in suggesting that the words in conjunction with a machine are tautological if given their plain meaning.those words can serve to broaden a by making clear that the utilization of a program does not need to be in conjunction with what we conventionally call a computer,but can be in conjunction with a range of machines driven in part by computer programs,such as automobiles,airplanes,and air conditioners.furthermore,even if the statute used the phrase in conjunction with a computer,we would see no reason to ascribe specialized meaning to the phrase simply for the sake of avoiding slight repetition in the statutory text.some repetition can help clarify the meaning of a statute,and we are reluctant to endorse an awkward reading of its words for no better reason than to satisfy the canon of construction that cautions against adopt ing a construction making another statutory provision superfluous.hohn united states,d.as we have noted previously,g eneral principles of statutory construction are notoriously unreliable and should not take precedence over more convincing reasons.hakala deutsche bank ag,cir.the supreme court has recognized in particular that the preference for avoiding surplusage constructions is not absolute.lamie united states,d.we therefore reject krause argument and conclude that the phrase in conjunction with a machine does not cure the ambiguity of the statutory text.
given the ambiguity of the text,we turn to the legislative history of a for guidance.as discussed above,congress enacted the language proposed in the contu report largely without alteration.the house report simply states that a embodies the recommendation of contu.i,at,reprinted in.we therefore look to the contu report for indications of congressional intent.see aym
