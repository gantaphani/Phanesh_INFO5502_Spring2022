background 
mavrix,a florida corporation with its principal place of business in miami,is a celebrity photo agency.mavrix pays photographers for candid photos of celebrities.its primary business is licensing and selling those photos to purveyors of celebrity news such as people and us weekly magazines.many of the celebrities whom mavrix photographs live and work in southern california.mavrix keeps a los angeles office,employs los photographers,has a registered agent for service of process in california,and pays fees to the california franchise tax board.
brand,an ohio corporation with its principal place of business in toledo,operates a website called.net.as its name suggests,the website covers popular personalities in the entertainment industry and features photo galleries,videos,and short articles for example,lindsay lohan stays sexy and sober,and shiloh jolie pitt named most influential infant.the website has several interactive features.visitors to the site may post comments on articles,vote in polls is robert pattinson the sexiest man on the planet,subscribe to an email celebrity newsletter,join the gossip center membership club,and submit news tips and photos of celebrities.the website is very popular.when this litigation began,an internet tracking service,ranked.net as number out of approximately million websites worldwide based on traffic.by comparison,the national news website was then ranked number.in its marketing materials,brand claims that.net currently receives more than million unique visitors and million page views per month.gossip center network,media kit,at,available at http last visited july.the record does not reflect how many of the website visitors are california residents.
like any large media entity.net courts a national audience,not restricted to california.however,the website has some specific ties to california.brand makes money from advertisements for jobs,hotels,and vacations in california.the website also features a ticket center,which is a link to the website of a vendor that sells tickets to nationwide events.some of these events are in california.brand has agreements with several california businesses.a california internet advertising agency solicits buyers and places advertisements on.net.a california wireless provider designed and hosts on its servers a version of.net accessible to mobile phone users.a california firm designed the website and performs site maintenance.finally,brand has entered a agreement with a national news site,according to which each site agrees to promote the other top stories.however,brand has no offices,real property,or staff in california,is not licensed to do business in california,and pays no california taxes.
in,a photographer working for mavrix shot thirtyfive pictures of stacy ferguson and josh duhamel while the couple was bathing,sunning,and jet skiing in the bahamas.ferguson,better known by her stage name fergie,is a singer in the group the black eyed peas.the group has sold some million records in the last decade and has won grammy awards for such hit singles as i got ta feeling and my humps.see the black eyed peas,wikipedia,http last visited july.ferguson husband duhamel is an actor who has appeared,most notably,in the trilogy of transformers movies.see josh duhamel,the internet movie database,last visited july.mavrix registered its copyright in the photos and posted them on its website.mavrix alleges that shortly thereafter brand reposted the photos on.net in violation of mavrix copyright.mavrix alleges that in doing so brand destroyed the market value of the photos.
mavrix sued in federal district court for the central district of california,alleging that brand infringed mavrix copyright in the photos.see.mavrix sought an injunction barring brand from further disseminating the photos,as well as actual and statutory damages.see id.brand moved to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.see.b.the district court denied mavrix request for leave to conduct jurisdictional discovery and granted the motion to dismiss.mavrix timely appealed.
ii.standard of review 
we review a dismissal for lack of personal jurisdiction de novo.boschetto hansing,cir.in opposing a defendant motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction,the plaintiff bears the burden of establishing that jurisdiction is proper.id.where,as here,the defendant motion is based on written materials rather than an evidentiary hearing,the plaintiff need only make a prima facie showing of jurisdictional facts to withstand the motion to dismiss.brayton purcell llp recordon recordon,cir.the plaintiff can not simply rest on the bare allegations of its complaint,but uncontroverted allegations in the complaint must be taken as true.schwarzenegger fred martin motor,cir quoting amba mktg,jobar int l,cir.w e may not assume the truth of allegations in a pleading which are contradicted by affidavit,data disc.tech,cir,but we resolve factual disputes in the plaintiff favor,pebble beach caddy,cir.
where,as here,no federal statute authorizes personal jurisdiction,the district court applies the law of the state in which the court sits.k a panavision int l,toeppen,cir.california statute,is coextensive with federal due process requirements,so the jurisdictional analyses under state law and federal due process are the same.schwarzenegger,at.for a court to exercise personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant consistent with due process,that defendant must have certain minimum contacts with the relevant forum such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.international shoe washington.quoting milliken meyer.
iii.discussion 
general jurisdiction 
mavrix argues that brand is subject to general jurisdiction in california.a court may assert general jurisdiction over foreign or corporations to hear any and all claims against them when their affiliations with the state are so continuous and systematic as to render them essentially at home in the forum state.goodyear dunlop tires operations,brown,d.for general jurisdiction to exist,a defendant must engage in continuous and systematic general business contacts,helicopteros nacionales de colombia,hall,d,that approximate physical presence in the forum state,bancroft masters,augusta,cir.the standard is met only by continuous corporate operations within a state that are thought so substantial and of such a nature as to justify suit against the defendant on causes of action arising from dealings entirely distinct from those activities.king am.family mut.ins,cir alterations in original quoting international shoe,at.to determine whether a nonresident defendant contacts are sufficiently substantial,continuous,and systematic,we consider their l ongevity,continuity,volume,economic impact,physical presence,and integration into the state regulatory or economic markets.tuazon reynolds tobacco,cir.the standard for general jurisdiction is an exacting standard,as it should be,because a finding of general jurisdiction permits a defendant to be haled into court in the forum state to answer for any of its activities anywhere in the world.schwarzenegger,at.
the supreme court has found general personal jurisdiction over a defendant in only one case,although it did not use the term general jurisdiction in its opinion.perkins benguet consol.mining.the court has recently described perkins as the textbook case of general jurisdiction appropriately exercised over a foreign corporation that has not consented to suit in the forum.goodyear.at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.the facts of perkins illustrate the nature and extent of the contacts required for general jurisdiction.the defendant was a philippine corporation whose mining operations were suspended while the japanese occupied the philippines during world war ii.at.the corporation president,who was also its general manager and principal stockholder,returned to his home in ohio,where he ran a corporate office.id.at.the president kept business files in ohio handled corporate correspondence from ohio drew employees salaries from accounts in ohio banks and distributed paychecks held directors meetings while he was in ohio and carried on in ohio a continuous and systematic supervision of the necessarily limited wartime activities of the company.id.at.plaintiff cause of action did not arise in ohio and did not relate to the corporation activities there.id.at.but because of the nature and extent of the corporation activities in the state,ohio was the corporation principal,if temporary,place of business.keeton hustler magazine,d describing facts of perkins.the court therefore upheld the exercise of personal jurisdiction over the corporation in ohio.see also,tuazon,at finding general jurisdiction in washington over north carolina cigarette company that had been licensed to do business in the state for more than years,had advertised in purely local publications for more than years,kept a permanent office and workforce,engaged in local political activity,and had made hundreds of millions of dollars in annual net sales in recent years.
by contrast,both the supreme court and our court have refused to permit the exercise of general jurisdiction based on contacts that were not so substantial,continuous,or systematic.for example,in goodyear,the court held that foreign subsidiaries of goodyear usa,organized and operating in turkey,france and luxembourg,were not subject to general jurisdiction in north carolina.two north carolina residents had been killed in france when a tire manufactured by one of the subsidiaries failed,causing a bus to overturn.at.between and,tens of thousands of tires made by the foreign subsidiaries,out of tens of millions of tires manufactured made by them during this period,reached north carolina through the stream of commerce.id.at.however,the subsidiaries were not registered to do business in north carolina had no places of business,no employees,and no bank accounts in north carolina did not design,manufacture,or advertise their tires in north carolina did not solicit business in north carolina and did not themselves sell or ship tires to customers in north carolina.id.
in helicopteros,the court held that a colombian corporation was not subject to general jurisdiction in texas even though the corporation sent its ceo to texas to negotiate a contract spent more than million to purchase approximately percent of its fleet of aircraft,as well as spare parts and accessories,from a texas supplier sent pilots for training in texas sent management and maintenance personnel to texas for technical consultation and received over million in contract payments from funds drawn on a texas bank.at,see also,keeton,at,contrasting perkins and denying general jurisdiction in new hampshire over ohio corporation that circulated copies of its magazine per month in new hampshire schwarzenegger,at denying general jurisdiction in california over ohio automobile dealership that regularly purchased automobiles imported by california importers via contracts that included a provision specifying california law regularly retained the services of a california marketing company hired a california corporation for consulting services and maintained a website accessible in california glencore grain rotterdam shivnath rai harnarain,cir bancroft masters,at.
mavrix argues that brand is subject to general jurisdiction in california on the basis of the following contacts brand allows third parties to advertise jobs,hotels,and vacations in california on its website sells,or allows a vendor to sell,tickets to california events on its website employs a california firm to design its website has business relationships with a national news organization,an internet advertising agency,and a wireless provider and maintains a highly interactive website.
these contacts fall well short of the requisite showing for general jurisdiction.we reiterate that brand has no offices or staff in california,is not registered to do business in the state,has no registered agent for service of process,and pays no state taxes.see,goodyear.at helicopteros,at glencore grain,at bancroft masters,at.third parties use brand website to advertise california jobs,hotels,and vacations.a substantial number of the website visitors to whom these advertisements are directed are california residents.but brand does not solicit business in the state by carrying those advertisements.bancroft masters,at.instead,it allows other entities to solicit business by taking advantage of brand existing user base.evidence that a nonresident defendant advertises in a forum is significant for general jurisdiction when the defendant markets its own product by targeting forum residents,see,tuazon,at congoleum dlw akiengesellschaft,cir,but has less significance for general jurisdiction when other entities use the defendant publication to promote their own businesses.
the parties dispute the identity of the ticket vendor.brand ceo,mandell,declares that brand merely links to a third party ticket service.mavrix argues that brand is the true seller.whether the ticket sales are attributable to brand or to a vendor,mandell declares and mavrix does not dispute that it has made only a single ticket sale through its ticket center,and that mavrix counsel was the buyer.we have held that occasional sales to forum residents by a nonresident defendant do not suffice to establish general jurisdiction.see bancroft masters,at brand menlove dodge,cir.indeed,we have held that even the physical presence in the forum state of a sales agent,see glencore grain,at,or a substantial sales force,congoleum,at,is insufficient to establish general jurisdiction.
brand relationship with its website designer is likewise insufficient.brand ceo declares,and mavrix does not dispute,that the independent contractors who designed.net were canadian citizens who,after building.net,formed a california web design firm.although that firm continues to perform website maintenance for brand and sends bills to brand from california,the contractors do the work in canada.that those contractors incorporated in california after building.net is a fortuitous circumstance upon which jurisdiction can not be premised.see world wide volkswagen woodson.
brand business relationships with other california companies constitute doing business with california,but not necessarily doing business in california.see schwarzenegger,at bancroft masters,at.in schwarzenegger,we rejected a nonresident defendant partnership with a advertising agency as a basis for general jurisdiction.at.and in bancroft masters,we rejected a nonresident defendant licensing agreements with television networks and vendors.at.there,we explained that engaging in commerce with residents of the forum state is not in and of itself the kind of activity that approximates physical presence within the state borders.id.citing helicopteros,at.
finally,brand operation of an interactive website even a highly interactive website does not confer general jurisdiction.mavrix relies on zippo zippo dot com,but that reliance,in the context of general jurisdiction,is misplaced.the court in zippo developed a sliding scale test to characterize the nature and quality of commercial activity that an entity conducts over the internet.id.at.at one end of the scale were active sites where a defendant clearly does business over the internet and enters into contracts with residents of a foreign jurisdiction that involve the knowing and repeated transmission of computer files over the internet,which support jurisdiction.id.at the other end were passive sites where a defendant has simply posted information on an internet web site which is accessible to users in foreign jurisdictions,and which do not support jurisdiction.id.under the zippo analysis,the availability of jurisdiction is determined by examining the level of interactivity and commercial nature of the exchange that occurs on the web site.id.
we have followed zippo.see,cybersell,cybersell,cir.but zippo sliding scale test was formulated in the context of a specific jurisdiction inquiry.see id.at.the level of interactivity of a nonresident defendant website provides limited help in answering the distinct question whether the defendant forum contacts are sufficiently substantial,continuous,and systematic to justify general jurisdiction.see,lakin prudential,cir under the zippo test,it is possible for a web site to be very interactive,but to have no quantity of contacts.in other words,the contacts would be continuous,but not substantial.this is untenable in a general jurisdiction analysis.revell lidov,cir zippo test is not well adapted to the general jurisdiction inquiry,because even repeated contacts with forum residents by a foreign defendant may not constitute the requisite substantial,continuous and systematic contacts required for a finding of general jurisdiction accord charles alan wright arthur miller,federal practice procedure,at ed.t he zippo case sliding scale approach should be of little value in a general jurisdiction analysis.
many of the features on which mavrix relies to show zippo interactivity commenting,receiving email newsletters,voting in polls,uploading user generated content are standard attributes of many websites.such features require a minimal amount of engineering expense and effort on the part of a site owner and do not signal a defendant intent to sit down and make itself at home in the forum by cultivating deep,persistent ties with forum residents.tuazon,at internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.to permit the exercise of general jurisdiction based on the accessibility in the forum of a interactive website would expose most large media entities to nationwide general jurisdiction.that result would be inconsistent with the constitutional requirement that the continuous corporate operations within a state be so substantial and of such a nature as to justify suit against the nonresident defendant on causes of action arising from dealings entirely distinct from those activities.international shoe,at.see generally raymond nimmer,the law of computer technology,at ed collecting cases.
in sum,brand contacts with california,even considered collectively,do not justify the exercise of general jurisdiction.
specific jurisdiction 
in the alternative,mavrix argues that brand has sufficient minimum contacts with california arising out of,or related to,its actions in reposting the photos of ferguson and duhamel to justify the exercise of specific jurisdiction.we analyze specific jurisdiction under a test 
the defendant must purposefully direct his activities or consummate some transaction with the forum or resident thereof or perform some act by which he purposefully avails himself of the privilege of conducting activities in the forum,thereby invoking the benefits and protections of its laws the claim must be one which arises out of or relates to the defendant activities and the exercise of jurisdiction must comport with fair play and substantial justice,it must be reasonable.
schwarzenegger,at quoting lake lake,cir emphases added.mavrix bears the burden of satisfying the first two prongs.sher johnson,cir.if mavrix does so,the burden then shifts to brand to set forth a compelling case that the exercise of jurisdiction would not be reasonable.burger king rudzewicz,d.
only the first prong is at issue here.as to the second prong,mavrix claim of copyright infringement arises out of brand publication of the photos on a website accessible to users in the forum state.as to the third prong,brand does not argue that the exercise of jurisdiction would be unreasonable on the basis of any of the factors listed in burger king.
the first prong of the specific jurisdiction test refers to both purposeful direction and purposeful availment.we have explained that in cases involving tortious conduct,we most often employ a purposeful direction analysis.schwarzenegger,at.in tort cases,we typically inquire whether a defendant purposefully direct s his activities at the forum state,applying an effects test that focuses on the forum in which the defendant actions were felt,whether or not the actions themselves occurred within the forum.la ligue contre le racisme,cir en banc quoting schwarzenegger,at alterations in original.the effects test,which is based on the supreme court decision in calder jones,d,requires that the defendant allegedly must have committed an intentional act,expressly aimed at the forum state,causing harm that the defendant knows is likely to be suffered in the forum state.brayton purcell,at quoting,at.because mavrix has alleged copyright infringement,a tortlike cause of action,purposeful direction is the proper analytical framework.id.citing schwarzenegger,at.
we believe that the supreme court recent decision in mcintyre machinery,nicastro,d,is consistent with the line of cases finding specific jurisdiction when there has been purposeful direction.mcintyre machinery was a product liability case.the question was whether suit could be brought in new jersey state court against a manufacturer headquartered in the united kingdom based on an injury caused by an allegedly defective product made in the.in performing a purposeful availment rather than a purposeful direction analysis,the plurality wrote 
as a general rule,the exercise of judicial power is not lawful unless the defendant purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum state,thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.hanson denckla,d.there may be exceptions,say,for instance,in cases involving an intentional tort.but the general rule is applicable in this productsliability case,and the doctrine can not displace it.
mcintyre.at plurality op.of kennedy,see also id.at distinguishing intentional tort cases from cases governed by this general rule.we therefore address the three requirements of the calder effects test in turn.
first,we conclude that brand committed an intentional act.there is no question that it acted intentionally reposting the allegedly infringing photos of ferguson and duhamel.
second,we conclude that brand expressly aimed at the forum state.in prior cases,we have struggled with the question whether tortious conduct on a nationally accessible website is expressly aimed at any,or all,of the forums in which the website can be viewed.see,brayton purcell,at pebble beach,at rio,rio int l interlink,cir panavision int l,toeppen,cir cybersell,at.on the one hand,we have made clear that maintenance of a passive website alone can not satisfy the express aiming prong.brayton purcell,at.on the other,we have held that operating even a passive website in conjunction with something more conduct directly targeting the forum is sufficient.rio,at.in determining whether a nonresident defendant has done something more,we have considered several factors,including the interactivity of the defendant website,pebble beach,at,cybersell,at the geographic scope of the defendant commercial ambitions,pebble beach,at rio,at and whether the defendant individually targeted a plaintiff known to be a forum resident,brayton purcell,at pebble beach,at panavision,at.
in this case,we find most salient the fact that brand used mavrix copyrighted photos as part of its exploitation of the california market for its own commercial gain.the court decision in keeton is directly relevant.see schwarzenegger,at describing keeton as a purposeful direction case.the plaintiff in keeton was a new york resident.she sued hustler magazine,an ohio corporation,for libel in new hampshire based on the circulation in new hampshire of copies of the magazine that contained the allegedly libelous material.at.the plaintiff sued in new hampshire in order to take advantage of the state unusually
