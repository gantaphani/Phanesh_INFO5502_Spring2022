this case presents a significant and unresolved issue of new york copyright law is there a right of public performance for creators of sound recordings under new york law and,if so,what is the nature and scope of that right because this question is important,its answer is unclear,and its resolution controls the present appeal,we reserve decision and certify this question to the new york court of appeals.
background 
plaintiff appellee flo eddie,appellee is a california corporation that asserts that it owns the recordings of the turtles,a rock band with a string of hits in the,most notably happy together.appellee,which is controlled by two of the band founding members,acquired the rights to the turtles recordings in and continues to market the recordings in a variety of ways,including by licensing the rights to make and sell records and by licensing the use of the recordings in other media.
defendant appellant sirius xm radio,appellant is a delaware corporation that is the largest radio and broadcaster in the united states,with a subscriber base of more than million individuals.appellant broadcasts music directly to its own subscribers as well as through third parties.these broadcasts include sound recordings created before february.see c.among them are recordings allegedly belonging to appellee.appellant has not compensated appellee for the use of these pre recordings,nor has appellee granted appellant a license to use them.
on september,appellee brought suit against appellant in the southern district of new york on behalf of itself and a class of owners of pre recordings,asserting claims for copyright infringement and unfair competition under new york law.in particular,appellee alleged that appellant infringed appellee copyright in the turtles recordings by broadcasting and making internal reproductions of the recordings,library,buffer and cache copes to facilitate its broadcasts.appellee simultaneously filed parallel class actions against appellant in california on august,and in florida on september,alleging state copyright claims based on california and florida law,respectively.see flo eddie sirius xm radio,no.cv psg,wl,flo eddie,sirius xm radio,cv,wl.june,appeal filed cir.july,
on may,appellant moved for summary judgment on two grounds.first,appellant contended that there is no right in pre recordings under new york copyright law,and that its internal reproductions of these recordings were permissible fair use.second,appellant argued that a public performance right,if recognized,would be barred by the dormant commerce clause.on november,the district court mcmahon,denied this motion.flo eddie,sirius xm radio,d.on the first issue,the court concluded that new york does afford a right of public performance to copyright holders,and that appellant internal reproductions were correspondingly not fair use.id.at.on the second issue,the court found that the recognition of a performance right did not implicate the dormant commerce clause because such a right was not a regulation of commerce under sherlock alling,otto.id.at.
soon after,appellant,with new counsel,filed a motion for reconsideration of the november,order and,in the alternative,requested that the district court certify its order for interlocutory appeal.the district court denied appellant motion for reconsideration,flo eddie,sirius xm radio,cv,wl,but certified its and reconsideration orders for interlocutory appeal,flo eddie,sirius xm radio,cv,wl.

discussion 
we review de novo the district court denial of appellant motion for summary judgment,construing the evidence in the light most favorable to appellant and drawing all reasonable inferences in its favor.gary friedrich,llc marvel characters,cir.we review the district court denial of appellant motion for reconsideration de novo as well.bayerische landesbank,branch aladdin capital mgmt.llc,cir.
in,congress amended the copyright act to grant limited copyright protection to sound recordings fixed on or after february,while expressly preserving property rights in sound recordings fixed before that date.see c.later,congress created an exclusive performance right in post sound recordings performed by digital audio transmission.see.performances of post sound recordings transmitted by other means,such as radio,still do not enjoy federal copyright protection.because appellee recordings were fixed before february,they are protected,if at all,by state copyright law.while new york provides no statutory protection to owners of pre sound recordings,new york common law does provide certain rights to copyright holders in these recordings.see capitol records,naxos of,naxos ii.as a result,the issue before us is whether new york common law affords copyright holders the right to control the performance of sound recordings as part of their copyright ownership.
the new york court of appeals has not ruled on whether such a right exists.appellee contends that new york common law affords it a right of public performance,which appellant violated when it broadcast appellee recordings without a license.appellant,conversely,argues that no such right exists.siding with appellee,the district court concluded that general principles of common law copyright dictate that public performance rights in pre sound recordings do exist.flo eddie,d at 
with no clear guidance from the new york court of appeals,we are in doubt as to whether new york common law affords appellee a right to prohibit appellant from broadcasting the sound recordings in question in such circumstances,we may certify the unresolved,determinative question to new york highest court.see cir.local schoenfeld new york,cir.in deciding whether to certify,we consider three factors 
whether the new york court of appeals has addressed the issue and,if not,whether the decisions of other new york courts permit us to predict how the court of appeals would resolve it whether the question is of importance to the state and may require value judgments and public policy choices and whether the certified question is determinative of a claim before us.

certification is clearly appropriate in the case before us.first,the court of appeals has not addressed whether copyright holders in sound recordings have a right in their works,nor is there sufficient other guidance that allows us to predict how the court would resolve this issue.second,appellee claims of infringement patently rise and fall with the question resolution and third,whether to recognize such a right of public performance is essentially a public policy choice appropriately resolved by a new york court.there are clear costs to recognizing a right of public performance in sound recordings as the district court recognized,appellee suit threatens to upset those settled expectations of radio broadcasters that have adapted to an environment in which they do not pay for broadcasting pre sound recordings.flo eddie,d at.still,new york interest in compensating copyright holders may perhaps outweigh the cost of making such a change.whatever the merits of such a determination might be as a value judgment,however,it is a value judgment,which is for new york to make.and that fact counsels certification.
both parties,however,argue that new york maintains a default rule as to the scope of property rights that settles this case.appellee asserts that,in new york,property rights are unless specifically limited.appellee bases this contention principally on tangible property cases.see,victory baker,stating that property ownership carries with it to the owner the right to enjoy,use and manage it in any way he pleases,subject only to restrictions imposed by law or by the duty which he owes to third persons.it then argues that such broad ownership applies as fully to intellectual property,and cites to naxos ii.see naxos ii,at,noting that the new york judiciary and state legislature intended to fill the gap in federal copyright law by protecting the owners of sound recordings in the absence of congress
