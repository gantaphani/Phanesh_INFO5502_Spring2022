in this copyright case,we must decide an issue unaddressed by our prior decisions which law,state or federal,governs the creation of an implied,nonexclusive copyright license we conclude that while federal law answers the threshold question of whether an implied,nonexclusive copyright license can be granted it can,state law determines the contract question whether a copyright holder has,in fact,granted such a license.construing california law and applying it to the facts of this case,we conclude that foad consulting group,gave an implied,nonexclusive license to the predecessor in interest of defendants canyon partners,llc,and agra,llc,to reproduce and adapt the revised project plan at issue in this case and to publish the subsequent work,all in conjunction with defendants development of a shopping center.because we also conclude that defendants modification and use of the plans did not exceed the scope of the implied license,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment to defendants.
background 
in august,gencom,hired the engineering firm foad consulting group,to create a preliminary concept development plan for a acre shopping center project the project that gencom intended to build in arroyo grande,california the city.pursuant to a contract dated august,foad prepared a preliminary plot plan that showed the location of the proposed buildings,parking lots,and landscape areas.gencom submitted this plan to the city on january,as part of its application to build the shopping center.gencom and foad entered into a second contract,dated february,under which foad agreed to create final engineering drawings for the project,including a revised plot plan,and to process the various plans through the offices of the city of arroyo grande.the revised plot plan was subsequently submitted to the city and the city approved gencom application for the project on july.
after it obtained the city approval,gencom transferred its rights to develop the project to claire enterprises,llc in october,claire hired hawkeye investments,llc,as the project developer.hawkeye,in turn,hired the predecessor of musil govan azzalino mga,to perform architectural and engineering services mga obtained copies of the revised plot plan and other documents from the city it also obtained copies of various documents relating to the project from foad.based on the plot plan approved by the city,and suggestions and requirements of the project owners,the city,and potential tenants,mga prepared final site plans for the project.in creating the final site plan,mga copied much of foad revised plot plan by tracing from it onto an overlay.the developers wished to substantially revise foad plan,but the city was unwilling to allow major deviation from the plan that it had already approved.mga circulated the final site plans to the city as well as to the shopping center potential tenants.
concerned that its copyright was being infringed,foad sent a letter of admonition to mga,dated february,informing mga that foad revised plot plan was copyrighted and that foad would pursue any violation of its copyright in federal court.foad also obtained a certificate of registration for the revised plot plan from the register of copyrights,which is also dated february.on august,foad filed a complaint in federal district court alleging copyright infringement on april,the district court heard defendants motion for summary judgment.it granted the motion because it concluded that the merger doctrine applied on april,the court entered final judgment for the defendants.foad timely appealed.

discussion 
one who owns a copyright in a work has the exclusive right to reproduce,adapt,publish,perform,and display the work.a copyright holder may transfer any or all of these rights,id.d,but in order for the transfer to be valid it must be in writing,id.a.
foad argues that defendants infringed its copyright in the revised plot plan by copying and modifying it and by publishing the resulting work defendants also infringed its reproduction rights,foad contends,by using the revised plot plan without its permission to build the project.they infringed its exclusive right to adapt the revised plot plan by using it as a basis for the final site plan.and by filing the final site plan with the city and circulating it among prospective tenants,defendants infringed foad publication rights.there is nothing in either contract between gencom and foad which purports to transfer any of foad exclusive rights to gencom,and defendants do not point to any other writing that evidences a transfer of copyright.thus,we can not conclude from the writings that foad transferred to gencom explicitly its reproduction,adaptation,and publication rights in the revised plot plan.
we have recognized,however,that a writing requirement applies only to the transfer of exclusive rights grants of nonexclusive copyright licenses need not be in writing effects,cohen,cir.so we must consider whether foad granted gencom a nonexclusive license to copy and modify its revised plot plan and to publish the resulting work.a nonexclusive copyright license may be granted orally or by implication.effects associates,at.defendants argue that foad granted gencom an implied license to reproduce,adapt,and publish in the february contract between the parties.we agree that the contract grants gencom an implied license to use the revised plot plan to complete development of the project,to hire another firm to create derivative works using the revised plot plan for the purpose of completing the project,and to publish the resulting work.
foad asks us to consider certain extrinsic evidence in interpreting the contract the contract was formed in california,concerns work that was done in california,and contains a clause that identifies california law as governing its interpretation.in contrast to many other states,california has a liberal parol evidence rule it permits consideration of extrinsic evidence to explain the meaning of the terms of a contract even when the meaning appears unambiguous.compare city of manhattan beach superior court,cal th,d,t he test of admissibility of extrinsic evidence to explain the meaning of a written instrument is not whether it appears to the court to be plain and unambiguous on its face,but whether the offered evidence is relevant to prove a meaning to which the language of the instrument is reasonably susceptible.quoting pacific gas thomas drayage rigging,cal d,with,namad salomon,parol evidence is inadmissible if a contract is clear on its face and sufficient alone to divine the intent of the parties.thus,if state law determines whether an implied,nonexclusive copyright license has been granted,we should consider whether foad extrinsic evidence discloses a latent ambiguity in the contract.if state law does not apply,then we will need to consider whether the extrinsic evidence is admissible under federal common law.russian news agency russian kurier,cir developing federal common law to decide a conflicts of law issue in a copyright case,where the copyright act does not contain a controlling provision.accordingly,before we interpret the contract between foad and gencom,we consider whether federal or state law determines whether a copyright holder has granted an implied,copyright license to another 
as a general matter,we rely on state law to fill in the gaps congress leaves in federal statutes.pm group life ins.growers assurance trust,cir.the case for adopting state law rules is strongest where congress legislates interstitially,leaving state law largely undisturbed.under those circumstances,comity and common sense counsel against exercising the power of federal courts to fashion rules of decision as a matter of federal common law.id.in enacting the copyright act,congress did not preempt the field.morseburg balyon,cir discussing goldstein,d.thus,where the copyright act does not address an issue,we turn to state law to resolve the matter,so long as state law does not otherwise conflict with the copyright act.see,sun,microsoft,cir stating that we rely on state law to provide the canons of contractual construction provided that such rules do not interfere with federal copyright law or policy internal quotation marks and citation omitted rano sipa press,cir rejecting california rule that agreements of duration are terminable at the will of either party because the rule directly conflicts with federal copyright law barris,worldvision,cir stating that state contract law determines ownership of federal statutory royalties due copyright owners dolch united cal.bank,cir stating that while the assignability of copyright renewal rights is a federal question,the conditions for valid assignment is a question of state law topolos caldewey,cir stating that ownership of a copyright is a matter of state contract law aronson quick point pencil,d state law is not displaced merely because the contract relates to intellectual property which may or may not be patentable the states are free to regulate the use of such intellectual property in any manner not inconsistent with federal law.there is no reason we should treat implied copyright licenses any differently.congress did not choose to regulate the conditions under which a copyright holder can grant a nonexclusive copyright license to another.thus,so long as it does not conflict with the copyright act,state law determines whether a copyright holder has granted such a license 
we must ask,then,whether california parol evidence rule conflicts with federal copyright law or policy.the principle effect of the california parol evidence rule is to lessen the importance of written contracts.it does so because the rule requires courts to consider extrinsic evidence of possible ambiguity even where the terms of the contract appear unequivocal.and if a party extrinsic evidence creates the possibility of ambiguity,a court may not rely on the text of the contract alone to determine the intent of the parties.see trident ctr.life ins,cir.the copyright act places great emphasis on the necessity of writings to grant exclusive licenses,but not when it comes to granting nonexclusive licenses as we have noted,nonexclusive licenses may be granted orally.thus,if a copyright holder and another have a contract that clearly does not grant the other an exclusive copyright license,in a copyright infringement suit the other may nonetheless introduce nonwritten as testimony,course of conduct,and custom and show that the copyright holder orally granted her a nonexclusive license since the copyright act itself places no particular emphasis on writings in the case of nonexclusive licenses,we conclude that application of california parol evidence rule in interpreting a contract that a party purports to have granted an implied copyright license does not conflict with the act or its underlying policies.
we must now determine whether the february contract between foad and gencom granted gencom an implied copyright license.in this analysis,we consider whether foad extrinsic evidence discloses any ambiguities in the contract.
license to reproduce 
foad claims that defendants infringed its reproduction rights to build the project by using the revised plot plan without its permission.we conclude from the terms of the contract that foad granted gencom an implied license to do just that.the central purpose of the contract was the production of a set of engineering documents for the grande plaza commercial center in the city of arroyo grande.under the contract,foad agreed to create multiple maps,drawings,and plans for the project and to process these documents with the city.for this service,gencom agreed to pay foad a fee of.given the amount of money gencom paid for foad services and because part of the agreement was for foad to help gencom with its application to the city,it would be surprising if the parties had intended for gencom to seek foad permission before using the plans to build the project.had that been the parties intention,one would expect to see the requirement spelled out explicitly in the agreement.but nowhere does the contract state that after the city had granted its approval,gencom would need to obtain foad permission before commencing work.we conclude that the contract gives gencom an implied license to use the revised plot plan to build the project 
as evidence that the contract indicates the parties intent to restrict gencom ability to use the revised plot plan without foad approval,foad asks us to consider a legend that appears on the plan.the legend reads 
all ideas,designs,arrangements and plans indicated or represented by this drawing are owned by,and the property of foad consulting group,and were created,evolved and developed for use on,and in connection with the specified project.none of such ideas,designs,arrangements or plans shall be used without written permission of foad consulting group.
this legend does not divulge a latent ambiguity in the contract,much less show that under the contract foad permission was required before gencom could start work.it is patent that the plans were developed for use on the specific project that was built.although the legend states that no plans shall be used without written permission of foad,it appears on a document that was created after the agreement was made,and presumably was written by foad or its agent.what more,the legend would apply,if at all,to projects other than the specified project.foad offers no explanation of how such a statement calls into question the parties intent,as manifested by the contract,that gencom would pay foad for plans that it could use to develop its property,union fire ins,cal th,d,the fundamental goal of contractual interpretation is to give effect to the mutual intention of the parties.internal quotation marks and citation omitted emphasis added.
license to adapt 
foad next alleges that defendants infringed its adaptation rights by using much of the revised plot plan in creating the final site plan.but the february contract contains no language prohibiting others from modifying the revised plot plan.quite the opposite the contract contains a clause requiring gencom to indemnify foad in the event that others modify the plan and the changes lead to some liability in addition,that clause does not require gencom to obtain foad consent in order to modify the plans it only requires consent in order to avoid foad waiver of liability.the indemnification clause plus the absence of any prohibition against modification by others indicates that the contract granted gencom an implied license to hire others to create derivative works using the revised plot plan for the purpose of completing the project 
foad points to paragraph of the contract in support of its argument that it did not grant gencom a license to hire another company to complete the project using the revised plot plan.paragraph states 
all original drawings,plans,documents,other papers and copies thereof prepared in connection with this agreement will remain the property of foad consulting group,and may be used without the consent of the client s.t he aforementioned papers will be kept on file by foad consulting group,and copies will be provided to the client s at client s request,and at client s expense.
the paragraph provides foad no support.it concerns ownership of the original documents and copies prepared by foad under the agreement.it also makes plain foad intention to retain its right to use the documents,presumably by reproduction,adaptation,or publication.however,the paragraph is silent about what gencom may or may not do with the copies prepared for it.
foad also asks us to consider extrinsic evidence a declaration from an alleged architectural expert who asserted that,under the custom and practice in the industry,a plan may not be used to produce a similar plan,without the permission of the original designer.this statement does nothing to undermine our conclusion that the contract grants gencom an implied license to modify the revised plot plan.the contract protects foad against any liability that might arise from a plan modified by others while imposing no restriction on such modifications.even assuming that industry custom and practice requires a client to obtain an engineer consent before modifying a plan created by the engineer,we conclude that the contract gave gencom the requisite permission.
license to publish 
finally,foad contends that defendants infringed its publication rights by filing the final site plan with the city and circulating it among prospective tenants.the conclusion that the february contract granted gencom an implied license to file the final site plan with the city and to use the plan to attract potential tenants follows from our previous analysis.the contract granted gencom a license to reproduce and adapt the revised plot plan for the purpose of developing the project.it would defy common sense to conclude that the contract at the same time withheld permission to publish the resulting work for the same purpose.in the absence of a contractual provision concerning gencom right to circulate any derivative works as part of its development of the project,we conclude that gencom did not infringe foad publication rights.
the february contract contains a clause prohibiting either party from assigning any rights under the contract without the written consent of the other there is no evidence in the record that gencom obtained foad written permission to assign its rights under the contract to its successor.foad argues that,even assuming that foad granted gencom an implied license to reproduce,copy,and publish,in the absence of foad written consent to an assignment of rights,gencom license was not passed on to its successor.california law,however,is to the contrary.in california,contractual provisions against assignment are for the benefit of the vendor only,and in no way affect the validity of an assignment without consent as between the assignor and assignee.johnston landucci,cal d,in bank accord klamath land cattle roemer,d.the limitation on assignment contained in the contract between foad and gencom does not affect the validity of gencom transfer of its development rights,including its rights concerning the revised plot plan,to its 
conclusion 
the copyright act permits copyright holders to grant nonexclusive copyright licenses by implication.but whether a copyright holder has properly granted another a nonexclusive license by implication is a matter of state contract law,provided that the state law does not conflict with the copyright act or its underlying policies.in this case,the february contract granted gencom an implied license to copy and adapt foad revised plot plan and to publish the resulting derivative work in aid of constructing the project for which it was designed.the extrinsic evidence which we consider as required by california law reveals no latent ambiguity in the contract.the defendants did not exceed the scope of the license by using the revised plot plan to create a final site plan,build the project,and publish the final site plan.finally,the clause in the contract limiting assignments does not affect the validity of gencom transfer of its development rights.for these reasons,the district court grant of summary judgment to defendants is 
the parties will no doubt be surprised by the majority opinion,as it decides a question they neither briefed nor argued,and that was even raised below.this is a dangerous thing for a court to do,and wholly unnecessary.the case can and should be decided on the issues presented by the parties.because i can not join in the court analysis,i concur only in the result.
a.the majority opens with the following question which law,state or federal,governs the creation of an implied,nonexclusive copyright license op.at.it is an interesting question that deserves exploring in the right case.it is also a difficult question that bears some analysis.instead,the majority cites effects associates,cohen,cir,and then proceeds to apply state law.given the importance of the question,one might have hoped for some explanation of how the majority got there.
as best i can tell,the majority assumes that anything that is called a an implied be governed by state law.but not every implied contract is,in fact,a contract.certainly,some implied contracts are governed by state law.those contracts really are contracts they are actual agreements between parties,albeit imperfectly articulated.the cases on which the majority relies all involve this type of contract.op.at.
but there is another type of implied contract,one that is created otherwise than by assent and without any words or conduct that are interpreted as promissory.arthur linton corbin,corbin on contracts,at.such an implied contract is not a contract at all it is a legal obligation the law imposes between certain parties where there is no actual agreement between them.id.if the implied contract that gives rise to the nonexclusive license discussed in effects associates is this kind of contract,then it has nothing at all to do with contract law.rather,it is an incident of the copyright and is therefore governed by federal law.
in effects associates,we imposed a license as an incident of the transfer of the copyrighted work but did not expressly say that it was a creation of federal law.i believe that this was the clear implication of our ruling,but i would leave resolution of the question to a case where the issue is properly raised below and the parties have briefed and argued it before us.in this case,i would decide the question as a matter of federal law,as the parties and district court assumed it is.
purporting to apply state law,the majority infers from the terms of the contract that foad and gencom agreed to a nonexclusive license.op.at.yet there is nothing in the written contract between foad and gencom that remotely touches upon the plans copyright.the contract says nothing about whether gencom had the right to modify or distribute the plans.it says nothing about the circumstances in which gencom can use the plans to build the project.the parties seem to have negotiated,written and signed the contract without ever discussing or perhaps being aware of these copyright issues.the majority acknowledges as much when it concedes that neither contract was sufficient to provide for a written transfer of copyright ownership because t here is nothing in either contract between gencom and foad which purports to transfer any of foad exclusive rights to gencom.op.at.
which leads to the question exactly which terms of the contract give rise to the license the majority never says,relying instead on what the contract does not say.the majority notes that foad failed to spell out explicitly in the agreement a requirement that gencom seek foad permission before using the plans to build the project.op.at.in other words,foad failure to expressly reserve its rights raises an implication that foad licensed those rights.this makes intuitive sense but,as we are applying state law,i would have expected to see state caselaw or a state law treatise cited on this point.the majority offers no state law authority to support its conclusion that a court can infer an agreement from the absence of a contrary agreement.id.
even more troubling is the majority reliance on the penumbras emanating from an indemnification clause.the majority says that the written contract indemnification clause plus the absence of any prohibition against modification by others indicates that the contract granted gencom an implied license to hire others to create derivative works using the revised plot plan for the purpose of completing the project.op.at.the majority cites no state law authority for this point,either,and i doubt it can be found.indemnification is not authorization.usually,it the other way around a party seeks indemnification against another party unauthorized actions.for example,rental car companies routinely require customers to indemnify them against harm caused by underage drivers,but this does not mean they authorize their customers to give the car keys to children.the majority conclusion that an indemnification clause creates a presumption that the act is authorized is almost certainly inconsistent with state law.
part iii of the opinion devotes considerable effort to figuring out whether the implied copyright license previously found to exist is nonetheless defeated by parol evidence.this makes about as much sense as calculating how high is up.
parol evidence consists of words or conduct outside the contract that tends to vary or explain the contract written terms.the majority correctly recognizes that california has a particularly broad version of the parol evidence rule,which permits a court to examine such evidence even when the contract appears to be clear on its face other states have a narrower version of the rule,which prohibits reference to parol evidence unless the contract terms are ambiguous.in either event,however,the parol evidence is used to shed light on words actually used in the contract.
the implied copyright license here is not a term in the contract rather,as the name suggests,it a term that is implied from the relationship of the parties.in such circumstances,it makes no sense at all to talk about parol evidence,or to consider whether california applies a broad or narrow parol evidence rule.there are no words of the contact that the parol evidence here can be used to interpret or clarify.
evidence extrinsic to the contract is,of course,not irrelevant.because the implied license is derived from the relationship of the may well extend beyond the is entirely appropriate to look at any words or conduct that bear on whether a copyright license should be implied.but that is not a question of parol evidence rather,it goes to whether such a license exists in the first place.
d.the majority preemption analysis is incomplete.the copyright act has a specific preemption provision,but the majority does not cite it.normally,of course,section is the start of any preemption analysis in a copyright case,see,kodadek mtv networks,cir anderson nidorf,cir,so the majority assertion that i n enacting the copyright act,congress did not preempt the field,is at least incomplete.op.at.other courts have devoted considerable discussion to section in resolving the tension between state contract law and federal copyright laws.see wrench llc taco bell,cir holding that the copyright act does not preempt a state breach of contract claim selby new line cinema,d,holding that the copyright act preempts a state breach of contract claim endemol entm t twentieth television,wl same.
this analysis is also beside the point.the majority purports to hold that application of the parol evidence rule is not preempted by the copyright act but,for reasons pointed out above,the parol evidence rule has no relevance to our case,so we have no occasion to speak to the issue.see part supra.however,the parol evidence rule may well be quite relevant in a case where the contract contains an express copyright license and the parol evidence is being offered to undermine or vary the terms of that license.i am not at all sure whether,in such a case,applying california broad version of the parol evidence rule is consistent with the federal copyright laws,which are designed to ensure certainty and predictability in the transfer of copyright.it is a question i would leave for a case where it is actually presented,rather than answering it in a case like ours,where no certainty is possible in any event because the written contract does not deal with the issue.i can only hope that future courts will not give undue deference to the majority answer to a question that was neither posed by the parties nor presented by the facts of the case before us.
for my part,i would answer the question actually presented by the parties,which presupposes that the implied license in effects associates is a matter of federal law.because i find the majority analysis inapposite,i offer my own 
a.while an exclusive copyright license must be in writing,a nonexclusive license may be granted orally,or may even be implied from conduct.effects,at citing melville nimmer david nimmer,nimmer on copyright a,at.in effects associates,we found that a special effects studio granted a nonexclusive implied license when it handed over film footage to the producer who had commissioned it.see effects,at.the studio had created and delivered special shots knowing they were to be incorporated into a film,and were of little value for anything else.see id.we held that the transaction had to be understood as contemplating a license to use the footage for the purpose for which it was created otherwise,the producer payment of a large sum of money would have been senseless.see id.at.two other circuits have applied the teachings of effects associates to situations very similar to the one now before us,each involving the completion of building plans by someone other than the original architect.see johnson jones,cir,shaver,cir.
in shaver,an architect had created schematic design drawings for an air cargo building.see at.the owners of the project hired another firm to finish the architectural work,and shaver threatened to sue for copyright infringement.see id.at.the owners sought a declaratory judgment that they were not infringing,and won summary judgment.as the district court in that case put it,shaver granted the airport a nonexclusive license to use his drawings as the basis for preparing working drawings and completing the project.shaver argument that the airport can use the drawings only as pieces of paper wallhangings placemats is untenable.id.at.the seventh circuit affirmed.
the architect in johnson was hired to draw up plans for a client dream house.at.after these plans had been submitted to the city for approval,the parties reached an impasse,and the client fired the architect.see id.at.when successor architects used the drawings to complete the project,johnson successfully sued for copyright infringement,defeating defendants claim that they had an implied license to use the drawings.see id.at.
in each of these cases,the architect,having agreed to provide the basic plans for a project,later asserted that the client had no right to make the derivative works necessary to complete that project without the architect continued involvement.see johnson,at shaver,at.if accepted,such a claim would allow the architect to hold the entire project hostage,forcing the owner either to continue to employ the architect or to forego the value of all work completed so far and start from scratch.even assuming the client willingness to incur this cost,going back to the drawing board may not be an option where necessary government approvals have already been obtained and the approving authority is unwilling to reconsider the issue,as happened here.
while shaver and johnson reach different results,they are not necessarily inconsistent.as i read the cases,the result in each turned on its facts.in shaver,the court found no evidence that the implied nonexclusive license normally expected in such a situation had been withheld.see at.the certificates of registration on shaver drawings stated that they were to be used for the airport facility.see id.at.the contract shaver drew up demonstrated that he was hired to create preliminary drawings,but it reflected no expectation of further participation in the project.see id.shaver had delivered his designs without any warning that their use would constitute copyright infringement,and even expressed hope that the ideas exhibited in his work would assist in successful realization of the project.see id.at.
in johnson,the parties had never come to agreement on a final contract that why the client fired the architect.see at.johnson,however,had twice presented the client with a contract which expressly provided that the copyrighted drawings shall not be used by the owner or others on other projects,for additions to this project or for completion of this project by others,unless the architect is adjudged to be in default under this agreement,except by agreement in writing with appropriate compensation to the architect.id.at.while the client never signed this contract,she asked johnson to continue working after he had given it to her,and she led him
