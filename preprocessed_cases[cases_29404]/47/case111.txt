in january,fox acquisition,inc,merged with new world communications group,purchasing all of its stock,including all stock in the new world entities.following the merger,fox entertainment group,fox entertainment,a delaware corporation with its principal place of business in new york,listed the new world entities,twentieth century fox film fox film,and twentieth century fox international television fox television as its subsidiaries.fox film is a delaware corporation,fox television is a new york corporation,and both have their principal places of business in california with secondary offices in new york.news,a delaware corporation with its principal place of business in new york,is the ultimate parent corporation of these defendants.
on november,an attorney for musical composer aeone watson notified counsel for fox film,fox television,and new world television productions,of claims for copyright infringement arising out of the unlicensed use of watson compositions in the television program santa barbara.on july,a class action against fox film,fox television,and the new world entities was filed in the united states district court for the central district of california.captioned east et twentieth century fox film corporation et,no.cv,wl,the action was brought on behalf of all owners of copyrighted musical compositions and sound recordings used on santa barbara without the owners permission.on march,counsel for several major record labels and music publishing companies informed randall kender of fox legal group that they were entitled to over million in damages for willful copyright infringement on santa barbara.
in may,eighteen months after it first received the watson letter,fox entertainment faxed copies of the watson and kender letters and the east complaint to insurance,the claims manager for the insurers.the letters were dated may,and printed on fox entertainment letterhead with a return address in beverly hills,california.
response came in october,when its claims counsel requested information relating to fox entertainment relationship to the new world entities.in the interim,both sides retained coverage counsel and the parties exchanged lengthy correspondence.this culminated on february,when fox entertainment provided the agreement and plan of merger between fox and new world.
eighteen days later,on february,the insurers commenced the instant action by filing a complaint in the united states district court for the southern district of new york,naming fox entertainment,fox film,and fox television,but not the new world entities,as defendants.the insurers sought a declaratory judgment that they had no obligations to the three named defendants relating to the east action because they had breached provisions of the policies requiring prompt notice and cooperation.on march,the day after filing suit,defendants sent a letter to claims counsel for the insurers inquiring as to the status of the insurers coverage investigation.the following day,the insurers denied coverage and informed defendants of their new york action.
on march,fox film,fox television,and the new world entities filed a complaint of their own in the superior court of california,seeking damages for breach of contract and tortious breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing,and a declaration that the insurers were obligated to provide coverage for the east action.that action was subsequently removed to the united states district court for the central district of california on april.on may,the insurers filed an amended complaint in the new york declaratory judgment action,adding the new world entities and news as defendants.
the insurers suffered a string of setbacks in the summer of.first,on july,the district court in the new york action granted defendants motion to dismiss.see employers ins.of wausau news,d.the court noted that w here essentially the same lawsuit involving the same parties and the same issues is pending in two different federal courts,the rule creates a presumption that the case filed earliest will take priority.id.at quoting factors,pro arts,cir,abrogated on other grounds by pirone macmillan,cir.the later of the two cases will only take priority where there is a showing of balance of convenience or special circumstances.id.without balancing the conveniences,the court concluded that special circumstances existed,in large measure based on two operative facts.first,the insurers filed suit before appellees requested coverage and before coverage was denied to them.second,the insurers selectively excluded the new world most logical parties against which to bring a coverage action,and entities with strong ties to california.id.at.according to the district court,the insurers desired a new york forum to enjoy the advantage of new york law,which,unlike california law,allows an insurer to disclaim coverage based on late notice without requiring a showing of prejudice id.
the insurers were handed a second defeat on august,when the district court in appellees california action denied the insurers motion to transfer venue to the southern district of new york.see new world television,cas,no.cv.finally,on september,judge mukasey denied the insurers motion for reconsideration.see employers ins.of wausau news d.the insurers appeal,arguing that the district court erred in not applying the rule and dismissing their complaint.
