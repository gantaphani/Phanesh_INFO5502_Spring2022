this writ proceeding raises weighty questions of first impression,which illuminate tensions between federal homeland security provisions and our state open public record laws.this proceeding also requires us to consider a state law exemption allowing nondisclosure in the public interest the impact of copyright claims on disclosure and the extent to which charges for electronic public records may exceed reproduction costs.after analyzing these important and novel issues,we conclude that the law calls for unrestricted disclosure of the information sought here,subject to the payment of costs to be determined by the trial court.
introduction 
the writ proceeding before us was instituted by the county of santa clara and its executive,peter kutras,collectively,the county.the county seeks extraordinary relief from a superior court order filed in may,requiring it to disclose its geographic information system basemap to the real party in interest,california first amendment coalition cfac.having stayed the order,we issued an order to show cause in march,to which cfac and the county responded.
the county petition in this court rests on three main legal arguments,which are asserted in the alternative paramount federal law promulgated under the homeland security act protects the information from disclosure the requested information is exempt from disclosure under the california public records act even if disclosure is required,the county can place restrictions on disclosure under state law provisions recognizing its copyright interests,and it can demand fees in excess of reproduction costs.
after considering the extensive record,the arguments raised by the parties,and the submissions by numerous amici curiae,we conclude that the county is not entitled to the relief sought.we therefore deny the county writ petition on the merits.however,we will remand the matter to the superior court for a determination of whether and to what extent the county may demand fees in excess of the direct costs of reproducing the electronic record requested by cfac.
factual and procedural background 
on june,cfac submitted a request for a copy of the county geographic information system gis basemap the request was made under the california public records act cpra,government code sections et.two weeks later,the county denied the request,citing statutory exemptions and copyright protection.
on august,cfac renewed its request for the gis basemap,with some modifications.later that month,the county denied the renewed request.
proceedings in the superior court 
on october,cfac filed a petition for writ of mandate,seeking to compel the county to produce the gis basemap.among the exhibits attached to the petition was the county gis basemap data request form,which details the procedure and the required fees for obtaining that data.based in part on the fee schedule contained in that form,cfac asserted that the cost of obtaining parcel information alone would be approximately.as legal support for its petition,cfac relied on the cpra,and on the california constitution,article,section.the county answered,then cfac filed its replication to the answer.
in january,cfac moved for judgment on its petition.the county opposed the motion,and cfac replied.at a hearing held in february,the court authorized the county to file a supplemental response,which it did the following month.cfac successfully sought an opportunity to reply.
the trial court thereafter conducted two further hearings in april.a substantial volume of evidence and argument was presented to the trial court.
on may,the trial court filed a written order.
in its factual findings,the court described gis and the basemap.the court determined that the county sells the gis basemap to members of the public for a significant fee and requires all recipients to enter into a mutual agreement.later in its order,the court observed that the county had actually entered into agreements with different entities,of those being government entities.
addressing the legal issues,the court noted both parties agreement that the resolution of this dispute turns on whether the public record is exempt.the court then discussed various proffered cpra exemptions,ultimately rejecting them all for different reasons.
having found that no exemption was available under the cpra,the court ordered the county to provide cfac with the gis basemap,at the county direct cost.the court stayed the order until june,to permit the parties to pursue appellate review.
proceedings in this court 
on june,the county initiated this writ proceeding it filed a petition accompanied by a memorandum of points and authorities.at the county request,we issued a temporary stay.cfac filed preliminary opposition,to which the county replied.
order to show cause responses 
in march,we issued an order to show cause to the respondent superior court,inviting opposition by cfac as the real party in interest.
cfac filed a return in april,to which the county replied the following month.
numerous amici curiae applied for leave to file five separate briefs in this court.we granted all five applications 
the record 
in connection with its june petition in this court,the county filed an petitioner appendix consisting of nearly pages.the following month,we granted the county request to augment the record with transcripts of the two hearings conducted by the superior court in april.
in,we received and granted three requests for judicial notice despite having taken judicial notice of these documents,we need not rely on them in resolving this proceeding.doers golden gate bridge.dist.cal d,fn,see also,windham at carmel mountain ranch superior court th,fn,d kaufman broad communities,performance plastering,th,d.
contentions 
as indicated above,the county offers three grounds to support its petition,which asserts trial court error in mandating disclosure of its gis basemap.
the county first argument relies on federal law,including the critical infrastructure information act of.according to the county,that statute and its accompanying regulations preempt state law.and under those superseding federal provisions,disclosure of the gis basemap is prohibited,because it has been validated by the united states department of homeland security as protected critical infrastructure information.
the county second argument is based on state law,the cpra.according to the county,even if the cpra is not preempted by federal law,its catchall exemption shields the gis basemap from public disclosure.
as the third ground for its petition,the county posits that even if neither preemption nor exemption supports nondisclosure,it should be allowed a to demand end user agreements,because the gis basemap is copyrightable,and b to recover more than its direct cost of providing the record,based on a provision of the cpra.
discussion 
addressing each of the county three contentions in turn,we first provide an overview of the relevant general principles of law.we then set forth the parties arguments in greater detail,followed by our analysis.
federal homeland security law 
the statute 
the federal statute at issue here is the critical infrastructure information act of cii act.the cii act is part of the homeland security act of,which established the department of homeland security dhs.see,a.within the dhs,congress established an office of intelligence and analysis and an office of infrastructure protection.a.the statutory responsibilities associated with those offices include carrying out comprehensive assessments of the vulnerabilities of the key resources and critical infrastructure of the united states,and developing a comprehensive national plan for securing the key resources and critical infrastructure of the united states,including power production,generation,and distribution systems,information technology and telecommunications systems including satellites,electronic financial and property record storage and transmission systems,emergency preparedness communications systems,and the physical and technological assets that support such systems,d.
at the heart of the cii act is the protection of critical infrastructure information cii,statutorily defined as information not customarily in the public domain and related to the security of critical infrastructure or protected systems.the cii act authorized dhs to accept information relating to critical infrastructure from the public,owners and operators of critical infrastructure,and state,local,and tribal governmental entities,while limiting public disclosure of that sensitive information under the freedom of information act and other laws,rules,and processes.fed.reg.september.
the cii act contains a section aimed at protecting voluntarily shared critical infrastructure information.concerning the disclosure of such information,it provides in pertinent part notwithstanding any other provision of law,critical infrastructure information including the identity of the submitting person or entity that is voluntarily submitted to the dhs for use by that agency regarding the security of critical infrastructure and protected systems a shall be exempt from disclosure under the freedom of information act and e shall not,if provided to a state or local government or government agency be made available pursuant to any state or local law requiring disclosure of information or records,a a,e i see,federal information disclosure westlaw update describing this provision as a clause that was hotly contested as the bills were debated.
the cii act directs the department of homeland security to establish uniform procedures for the receipt,care,and storage by federal agencies of critical infrastructure information that is voluntarily submitted to the government.e.it further provides that those procedures shall include mechanisms for the protection and maintenance of the confidentiality of such information so as to permit the sharing of such information within the federal government and with state and local governments,and the issuance of notices and warnings related to the protection of critical infrastructure and protected systems,in such manner as to protect from public disclosure the identity of the submitting person or entity,or information that is proprietary,business sensitive,relates specifically to the submitting person or entity,and is otherwise not appropriately in the public domain,e d.
regulations 
the federal regulations implementing the cii act are found in the code of federal regulations,volume,part.those regulations are intended to implement the federal statute through the establishment of uniform procedures for the receipt,care,and storage of critical infrastructure information cii voluntarily submitted to the department of homeland security dhs.a.
as stated in the regulations consistent with the statutory mission of dhs to prevent terrorist attacks within the united states and reduce the vulnerability of the united states to terrorism,dhs will encourage the voluntary submission of cii by safeguarding and protecting that information from unauthorized disclosure and by ensuring that such information is,as necessary,securely shared with state and local government pursuant to the cii act.as required by the cii act,these rules establish procedures regarding the receipt,validation,handling,storage,proper marking and use of information as pcii.a.
pcii protected critical infrastructure information is cii that has been validated by dhs.g.
among the regulations is one relied on by the county,which states that pcii shall be treated as exempt from disclosure under the freedom of information act and any state or local law requiring disclosure of records or information.g.
preemption 
the county reliance on federal law rests on its contention that the cii act and accompanying regulations preempt the cpra.
as a general principle,federal law preempts state law where congress has said so explicitly,where congress has said so implicitly,as when federal regulation occupies the field exclusively,and where federal and state law conflict.lorillard tobacco reilly,d.unless congress has demonstrated a clear and manifest purpose to the contrary,the presumption is that federal law does not preempt the states historic police powers.id.at.jevne superior court cal th,d.moreover,a federal agency literally has no power to act,let alone the validly enacted legislation of a sovereign state,unless and until congress confers power upon it.lousiana public serv.comm.fcc,d.
b.the parties contentions 
preemption 
the county claims express federal preemption under code of federal regulation,part g,which exempts pcii from the operation of federal,state,and local laws requiring the disclosure of public records.as the county points out,the preamble to the final rule promulgated by department of homeland security notes the preeminence of pcii status under the cii act and these regulations in relation to any state,territorial,or tribal public disclosure laws or policies,supra,at.that same document also states this rulemaking,as required by the underlying statute,preempts state,local and tribal laws that might otherwise require disclosure of pcii id.at see also,federal information disclosure,supra.
the county also asserts that congress has implicitly preempted state law,arguing that the federal regulations set forth a scheme for pcii validation that is so pervasive,it is unreasonable to infer that congress intended the states to occupy the field.see jevne superior court,supra,cal th at,d.
cfac disputes the county preemption claim.in its view,the cii act does not preempt the cpra,but merely creates a rule of nondisclosure that has no application to this case.
statutory arguments 
according to cfac,the county position rests on a misreading of the federal act as it relates to cii that has been voluntarily submitted to the federal government,such as the gis basemap at issue here.see a.in cfac view,the provisions in the federal statute limiting disclosure apply only to those entities receiving pcii from dhs,not to those submitting it.furthermore,cfac argues,the federal protection for cii has been incorporated into state law as an exemption in the cpra,but that exemption was waived by the county sale of the gis basemap to entities.see,subd.ab provision exempting cii,subd.k provision incorporating federal law exemptions waiver provision.
the county disputes this view of the cii act,arguing that it imposes an artificial distinction between submitting and receiving entities.the county also dismisses cfac waiver argument,calling it irrelevant given federal preemption of the cpra.
we agree with cfac that the pertinent question here is not whether federal homeland security law trumps state disclosure law.instead,the analysis in this case turns on whether the federal act and accompanying regulations apply at all.as we now explain,we conclude that the cii act does not apply here because the county is a submitter of cii,not a recipient of pcii.given that conclusion,we need not consider whether the cii act preempts the cpra.
federal law distinguishes between submitters and recipients of pcii.
in undertaking our statutory analysis,we begin by examining the language of the relevant provisions.smith superior court cal th,d.statutory interpretation presents a legal question,which we decide de novo.los angeles unified school dist.superior court th,d.
the cii act provides that critical infrastructure information that has been voluntarily submitted shall be exempt from disclosure under the federal freedom of information act.a a.as more particularly relevant here,it also prohibits disclosure of pcii pursuant to any state or local law requiring disclosure of information or records but only if provided to a state or local government,a e i,italics added.
we are not aware of any case law interpreting this provision.but the regulations promulgated under the cii act bear out the statute apparent distinction between the submission of cii and the receipt of pcii,as we now explain.
we begin with the specific regulation cited by the county,code of federal regulations,part.subdivision g of that regulation provides in part that pcii shall be treated as exempt from disclosure under the freedom of information act and any state or local law requiring disclosure of records or information.g.we acknowledge that subdivision g does not distinguish between cii submitters and pcii recipients.but another subdivision of this regulation does reflect that distinction.
subdivision b of code of federal regulations,part thus states in pertinent part pcii may be provided to a state or local government entity for the purpose of protecting critical infrastructure or protected systems b,italics added.the provision of pcii to a state or local government entity will normally be made only pursuant to an arrangement with the pcii program manager providing for compliance and acknowledging the understanding and responsibilities of the recipient.state and local governments receiving such information will acknowledge in such arrangements the primacy of pcii protections under the cii act and agree to assert all available legal defenses to disclosure of pcii under state,or local public disclosure laws,statutes or ordinances,italics added.
this emphasis on recipients of pcii also appears at subdivision d of the next regulation,which provides state and local governments receiving information marked protected critical infrastructure information shall not share that information except as allowed by the regulations.d,italics added.on the subject of enforcement,subdivision d continues if the pcii program manager determines that an entity or person who has received pcii has violated the provisions of this part or used pcii for an inappropriate purpose,the pcii program manager may disqualify that entity or person from future receipt of any pcii or future receipt of any sensitive homeland security information,d,italics added.
other regulations reflect the same dichotomy between the submission of cii and the receipt of pcii,as the following excerpts demonstrate.the regulations in this part apply to all persons and entities that are authorized to handle,use,or store pcii or that otherwise accept receipt of pcii.b,italics added.the regulations help ensure that cii is securely shared with state and local government pursuant to the cii act,a,italics added.a federal,state or local agency that receives pcii may utilize the pcii only for purposes appropriate under the cii act,including securing critical infrastructure or protected systems,b,italics added.all federal,state and local government entities shall protect and maintain information as required by these rules or by the provisions of the cii act when that information is provided to the entity by the pcii program manager,c,italics added.
the preamble to the final regulations likewise confirms the distinction.for example,it clarifies that state,local and tribal contractors are not precluded from receiving pcii and it notes a change in the final regulations to permit employees of federal,state,local,and tribal contractors who are engaged in the performance of services in support of the purposes of the cii act,to communicate with a submitting person when authorized by the pcii program manager or designee,supra,at,italics added.
taken as a whole,this consistent and pervasive regulatory language supports our construction of the relevant provision of the cii act,united states code section a e i.as we interpret that provision,it draws a distinction between the submission of cii and the receipt of pcii.in the hands of the submitter,the nature of the information remains unchanged in the hands of the governmental recipient,it is protected from disclosure 
this interpretation is also consonant with other aspects of the statute and regulations,particularly those that limit the uses of pcii in the hands of governmental recipients.as provided in the statute,pcii provided to a state or local government or agency shall not be used other than for the purpose of protecting critical infrastructure or protected systems,or in furtherance of an investigation or the prosecution of a criminal act.a e iii.the regulations are to the same effect a federal,state or local agency that receives pcii may utilize the pcii only for purposes appropriate under the cii act,including securing critical infrastructure or protected systems.b.if the gis basemap constitutes pcii in the county hands,as it maintains,then federal law strictly restricts use of that data to the narrow purposes enumerated in the cii act.
in sum,we conclude that the cii act distinguishes between submitters of cii and recipients of pcii,with the result that the federal statute prohibition on disclosure of protected confidential infrastructure information applies only when it has been provided to a state or local government or government agency a e i,italics added.
because the county did not receive pcii,the federal provisions do not apply.
in this case,the information at issue was submitted by the county,not to it.because the county is a submitter of cii,not a recipient of pcii,neither the cii act nor the accompanying regulations apply here.
having concluded that federal homeland security law does not apply in this case,we turn to the county contention that the cpra exempts the gis basemap from disclosure.
ii.state law disclosure exemption 
as before,we summarize the governing law,then we describe and analyze the parties contentions.
in,the legislature clarified the scope of the public right to inspect records by enacting the cpra.county of los angeles superior court th,d.the cpra replaced a hodgepodge of statutes and court decisions relating to disclosure of public records.los angeles unified school dist.superior court,supra,th at,d.the cpra is codified in the government code,starting at section 
policy favoring disclosure 
the cpra was enacted for the purpose of increasing freedom of information by giving members of the public access to information in the possession of public agencies.filarsky superior court,supra,cal th at,d.legislative policy favors disclosure.san lorenzo valley community advocates for responsible educ.san lorenzo valley unified school dist.th,d san lorenzo.all public records are subject to disclosure unless the public records act expressly provides otherwise.brv,superior court th,d.
california voters endorsed that policy in by approving proposition,which amended the state constitution to explicitly recognize the right of access to information concerning the conduct of the people business and to provide that the writings of public officials and agencies shall be open to public scrutiny.cal,subd.b see brv,superior court,supra,th at,d los angeles unified school dist.superior court,supra,th at,d.
exemptions 
the right of access to public records under the cpra is not absolute.copley press,superior court cal th,d.the cpra states a number of exemptions that permit government agencies to refuse to disclose certain public records.ibid.to a large extent,these exemptions reflect legislative concern for privacy interests.commission on peace officer standards and training superior court cal th,d.the cpra features two categories of exemptions materials expressly exempt from disclosure pursuant to section and the catchall exception of section city of san jose superior court th,d,fn.omitted san lorenzo,supra,th at,d.
enumerated exemptions 
the legislature has assembled a diverse collection of exemptions from disclosure in section.haynie superior court cal th,d,see also.for example,public records need not be disclosed if their disclosure is exempted or prohibited pursuant to federal or state law,subd.k rim of the world unified school dist.superior court th,d.but this exemption is not an independent exemption.it merely incorporates other prohibitions established by law.copley press,superior court,supra,cal th at,d.also listed among the express exemptions is critical infrastructure information,as defined in section of title of the united states code,that is voluntarily submitted to the california office of homeland security for use by that office,subd.ab.
catchall provision 
section allows a government agency to withhold records if it can demonstrate that,on the facts of a particular case,the public interest served by withholding the records clearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure.san lorenzo,supra,th at,d.this catchall exemption contemplates a balancing process,with the burden of proof on the proponent of nondisclosure to demonstrate a clear overbalance on the side of confidentiality.michaelis,montanari johnson superior court cal th,d.where the public interest in disclosure of the records is not outweighed by the public interest in nondisclosure,courts will direct the government to disclose the requested information.city of san jose superior court,supra,th at,d.
since disclosure is favored,all exemptions are narrowly construed.cal,art.i,subd.b board of trustees of california state university superior court th,d.the agency opposing disclosure bears the burden of proving that an exemption applies.board of trustees of california state university superior court,at,d.
moreover,if only part of a record is exempt,the agency is required to produce the remainder,if segregable,subd.a.in other words,the fact that a public record may contain some confidential information does not justify withholding the entire document.state bd.of equalization superior court,supra,th at,d see connell superior court th,d the superior court limited disclosure order eliminated the controller legitimate security concern.the burden of segregating exempt from nonexempt materials,however,remains one of the considerations which the court can take into account in determining whether the public interest favors disclosure under section.american civil liberties union foundation deukmejian cal d,fn.
exemptions can be waived.county of los angeles superior court th,d.disclosure to one member of the public would constitute a waiver of the exemption citation,requiring disclosure to any other person who requests a copy,citing.city of san jose superior court,supra,th at,d.
b.the parties contentions 
at issue here is whether the gis basemap is exempt from disclosure under the cpra.as stated in the trial court decision given county admission that the gis basemap and data elements are a public record,both parties agree that the resolution of this dispute turns on whether the public record is exempt.
in this court,the county proffers only one exemption,the catchall provision of section that provision reads in pertinent part the agency shall justify withholding any record by demonstrating that the record in question is exempt under express provisions of this chapter or that on the facts of the particular case the public interest served by not disclosing the record clearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure of the record,subd.a.when this exemption is invoked,the court undertakes a balancing process.michaelis,montanari johnson superior court,supra,cal th at,d.the court assesses whether on the facts of the particular case,the public interest served by withholding the records clearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure.san lorenzo,supra,th at,d.
addressing the disclosure prong of the balancing test,the county asserts that the public interest in obtaining the gis basemap is both minimal and hypothetical.concerning the nondisclosure prong,the county asserts two reasons for withholding the record one related to straitened public finances and the other arising from security concerns.weighing the two prongs,the county says,the balance clearly favors the county position of nondisclosure because concerns over security and the risk of undermining the county ability to continue providing valuable services to county residents clearly outweighed cfac hypothetical interest.
cfac disagrees,with particular emphasis on countering the county security argument.
in analyzing the availability of this exemption,we accept the trial court express and implied factual determinations if supported by the record,but we undertake the weighing process anew.connell superior court,supra,th at,d.as our high court has explained,although a reviewing court should weigh the competing public interest factors de novo,it should accept as true the trial court findings of the facts of the particular case citation,assuming those findings are supported by substantial evidence.michaelis,montanari johnson superior court,supra,cal th at,d.
in this case,the trial court considered the evidence,made factual findings,and engaged in the weighing process before concluding that the balance of interests favored disclosure.though it described both parties competing interests as somewhat hypothetical,the court nevertheless concluded that the county had not shown a clear overbalance in favor of.
on independent review of the competing interests,we agree with the trial court conclusion.in our view,the county has both understated the public interest in disclosure and overstated the public interest in nondisclosure.
public interest in permitting disclosure 
according to the county,cfac interest in disclosure of the gis basemap is hypothetical,and it is also minimal since acquiring the information can be accomplished by lesser means.we disagree.
a.the public interest in disclosure is not hypothetical.
in pressing its characterization of cfac interest as hypothetical,the county cites the trial court concerns about cfac standing,since it represents no citizen.the county paraphrases the trial court observation other than a generalized proclamation of the public right to know,cfac has no interest in the gis basemap.
in making that argument,the county misapprehends the focus of the inquiry.as cfac points out,the motive of the particular requester is irrelevant the question instead is whether disclosure serves the public interest.the public records act does not differentiate among those who seek access to public information.state bd.of equalization superior court,supra,th at,d see also,american civil liberties union foundation deukmejian,supra,cal d at,connell superior court,supra,th at,d.
if the records sought pertain to the conduct of the people business there is a public interest in disclosure.the weight of that interest is proportionate to the gravity of governmental tasks sought to be illuminated and the directness with which the disclosure will serve to illuminate.connell superior court,supra,th at,d.the existence and weight of this public interest are conclusions derived from the nature of the information.ibid.as this court put it,the issue is whether disclosure would contribute significantly to public understanding of government activities.city of san jose superior court,supra,th at,d.
here,the trial court summarized some of cfac proffered examples as to how access to the gis basemap will contribute to its understanding of government activities including comparison of property tax assessments,issuance of permits,treatment of tax delinquent properties,equitable deployment of public services,issuance of zoning variances.as these examples show,the public interest in disclosure is very real,given the gravity of governmental tasks sought to be illuminated and the directness with which the disclosure will serve to illuminate.connell superior court,supra,th at,d.
b.the public interest in disclosure is not minimal.
in support of its second point,the county cites a decision of this court for the principle that public interest in disclosure is minimal where the requester has alternative,less intrusive means of obtaining the information sought.city of san jose superior court,supra,th at,d.the trial court explicitly recognized that principle,saying the availability of alternate sources of obtaining the information is relevant in weighing the public interest in disclosure.the court also stated that cfac could obtain the same information found in the gis basemap by performing a more laborious search of other publicly available records.
the county misplaces its reliance on our decision in city of san jose superior court,supra,th,d.that case is factually distinguishable,since it involved privacy concerns that are not in play here.in city of san jose,we determined that airport noise complainants have a significant privacy interest in their names,addresses,and telephone numbers as well as in the fact that they have made a complaint to their government,and that disclosure of this information would have a chilling effect on future complaints.id.at,d.concerning the cpra catchall exemption,we explained in determining whether the public interest in nondisclosure of individuals names and addresses outweighs the public interest in disclosure of that information,courts evaluate whether disclosure serves the legislative purpose of illuminating the performance of public duties.id.at,d.where disclosure of names and addresses would not serve this purpose,denial of the request for disclosure has been upheld.ibid.courts have also recognized that the public interest in disclosure is minimal,even when the requester asserts that personal contact is necessary to confirm government compliance with mandatory duties,where the requester has alternative,less intrusive means of obtaining the information sought.id.at,d.conversely,where the disclosure of names and addresses is necessary to allow the public to determine whether public officials have properly exercised their duties by refraining from the arbitrary exercise of official power,disclosure has been upheld.ibid.
while the availability of less intrusive means to obtain the information may be a factor in the analysis,particularly in privacy cases,the existence of alternatives does not wholly undermine the public interest in disclosure.city of san jose superior court,supra,th at,d.even where a requester has an alternative means to access the information,it should not prohibit it from obtaining the documents under the cpra.los angeles unified school dist.superior court,supra,th at,fn,d.the records at issue here pertain to the conduct of the people business so there is a public interest in disclosure.connell superior court,supra,th at,d.for the reasons proffered by cfac and summarized by the trial court,it also appears that disclosure would contribute significantly to public understanding of government activities.city of san jose superior court,at,d.
in sum,we conclude,the public interest in disclosure of the gis basemap is neither hypothetical nor minimal.that brings us to the second prong of the balancing test,assessing the public interest in nondisclosure.
public interest in preventing disclosure 
the county proffers two interests to support nondisclosure.first,the county cites financial issues,positing its continuing effort to provide the public with a high level of service during challenging economic times and emphasizing the threatened impact on first responders.second,the county raises public safety concerns,stressing the need to protect sensitive infrastructure information not customarily in the public domain.we consider and reject each in turn.
a.the county financial interests do not compel nondisclosure.
according to the county,it developed the gis basemap at a significant cost in terms of time,effort and resources.if forced to provide the gis basemap to all requesters at the direct cost of production,the county contends,it will lose its ability to sell the technology,with the result that the county alone will have to shoulder the obligation of maintaining the gis difficult task during times of ever increasing budget deficits.the end result will be a reduction in service levels to the public.the county also asserts that losing control over its intellectual property copyright interests in the gis basemap with the dissemination of electronic copies will negatively impact the tools used by first responders in the county.it argues this is no hypothetical scenario,but is based upon actual experiences of other counties.
in support of this claim in the trial court,the county submitted a declaration stating that san diego and ventura counties saw their programs wither away once outside funding disappeared due to providing the gis maps at little or no cost to the public.
cfac countered below with a declaration that san diego county gis basemap program is alive and thriving and ventura county gis operation is robust and growing.that declaration also averred that fourteen counties in california provide their gis basemap data in electronic format to the public free of charge while another counties in california provide their gis basemap data in electronic format to the public for the cost of reproduction.
addressing the financial issues,the trial court expressed concern that county will have difficulty recouping the expense incurred in creating the gis basemap,but it noted the dearth of evidence that this was county initial plan.additionally,as just noted,cfac offered evidence that other counties disclosing their gis basemap programs had suffered few ill fiscal effects.the trial court apparently credited this evidence.applying the deferential substantial evidence review standard,we do so as well.connell superior court,supra,th at,d.
beyond the state of the evidence in this particular record,there are other reasons to accord little weight to the financial concerns.as has been said there is nothing in the public records act to suggest that a records request must impose no burden on the government agency.state bd.of equalization superior court,supra,th at,fn,d see also connell superior court,supra,th at,d.thus,for example,the cost of compiling an accurate list of names was not a valid reason to proscribe disclosure of the identity of such individuals.cbs broadcasting superior court th,d american civil liberties union foundation deukmejian,supra,cal d at,courts should not ignore any expense and inconvenience involved in segregating nonexempt from exempt information.
b.the proffered security concerns do not compel nondisclosure.
the county also asserts a public safety interest in guarding against terrorist threats,based on its contention that the gis basemap contains sensitive information that is not publicly available,such as the exact location of hetch hetchy reservoir components.the county cites the precision of its georeferenced parcel map described as accurate within foot in the developed areas and feet in the hilly areas in arguing that disclosure of the basemap would allow anyone to locate the parcels overlaying the hetch hetchy water lines.matching the gis basemap with orthophotographs,which are in the public domain,would allow anyone to pinpoint weak spots in the system and quickly and effectively plan a terrorist attack.by contrast,the county maintains,other publicly available maps are not georeferenced,do not contain gps coordinates,do not include orthophotographs,and are not a continuous representation of the hetch hetchy water supply elements to disclosing precise locations of the critical infrastructure.
to prove this claim in the trial court,the county submitted the declaration of robert colley,acting gis manager for its information services department,which includes these statements requiring the county to provide the gis basemap in electronic format to the public will jeopardize public safety because it will provide the public with access to sensitive information that is not otherwise publicly available.for public safety reasons,it is critical that geospatial information such as the gis basemap stay out of the public domain.the actual location of the hetch hetchy water lines are generally known,but not provided in any detail for obvious minimize the threat of terrorist attack on the water system.the exact location of hetch hetchy water lines is an integral part of the gis basemap and not easily segregable.
to refute that claim,cfac offered the declaration of bruce joffe,a member of the geospatial working group,which is organized by the department of homeland security and is comprised of gis professionals from various federal agencies and the private sector who discuss issues of gis technology and national security.joffe declared based on my knowledge,skill,experience,training and education in the areas of gis,the lines identified by the county in each of the documents as hetch hetchy water pipelines are actually not the pipelines themselves,but the land easement areas or.the easements cover an area greater than the pipelines themselves,and do not indicate the specific location of pipes,which are buried underground.the location of the hetch hetchy easements can be obtained from other sources joffe opined that the location of the hetch hetchy easement s is not the kind of information that would uniquely aid terrorists restricting public access to the county gis basemap data is unlikely to be a major impediment for terrorists in identifying and locating their desired targets.joffe also addressed segregability,declaring the county could easily disclose the data elements and descriptive attribute data requested by cfac in its june,public record act request without also disclosing the location of the hetch hetchy easements,if it chose to do so.he then described how that could be done.
addressing these issues,the trial court explained that not everything in the gis basemap has security implications.as the county conceded and the trial court found,some of the information in the gis basemap is a matter of public record that has nothing to do with critical infrastructure.by way of example,the court cited the assessed value of a single family home in san jose and questioned why it should be cloaked with the protection of simply by submission to ohs the california office of homeland security.the court continued it appears county has belatedly focused on to the information pertaining to water lines and used that as its primary,if not sole,basis for obtaining the designation without any concession that the gis basemap consists of any other publicly available information.the court concluded county has not made the initial effort to establish that all information contained in the gis basemap is cii.having failed to meet its initial burden,county assertion of this particular exemption fails.the record supports these findings,williams superior court cal th,d,a public agency may not shield a record from public disclosure,regardless of its nature,simply by placing it in a file label ed investigatory.
furthermore,the trial court observed,it does not appear this has been an overriding concern to county,as shown by the dissemination of the gis basemap to others,albeit relying on a form of agreement.as noted above,the county sold the gis basemap to purchasers,including three private entities.in the trial court view if the security issue were of greater importance,one would think there would be no dissemination of the gis basemap whatever.we see no reasoned basis for overturning that inference,subd.e no waiver of exemption where disclosure is made to government agency that agrees to treat the disclosed material as confidential county of los angeles superior court,supra,th,d this section provides a means for governmental agencies to share privileged materials without waiving the privilege.
security may be a valid factor supporting nondisclosure.see,times mirror superior court cal d,governor private appointment schedule procunier superior court d.diagrams depicting correctional facility,disapproved on other grounds in shepherd superior court cal d,same.but the mere assertion of possible endangerment does not clearly outweigh the public interest in access to these public records.cbs,block cal d,accord,commission on peace officer standards and training superior court,supra,cal th at,d.while we are sensitive to the county security concerns,we agree with the trial court that the county failed to support nondisclosure on this ground.
weighing the competing interests 
the balancing test is applied on a basis.michaelis,montanari johnson superior court,supra,cal th at,d,cbs broadcasting superior court,supra,th at,d.as the party seeking to withhold the record,the county bears the burden of justifying nondisclosure.board of trustees of california state university superior court,supra,th at,d los angeles unified school dist.superior court,supra,th at,d.
independently weighing the competing interests in light of the trial court factual findings,we conclude that the public interest in disclosure outweighs the public interest in nondisclosure.we thus agree with the trial court that the county failed to demonstrate a clear overbalance on the side of confidentiality.michaelis,montanari johnson superior court,supra,cal th at,d.
iii.limitations on disclosure 
having concluded that neither federal nor state law provides a basis for withholding the gis basemap,we turn to the county arguments for limitations on disclosure.as previously noted,the county argues for the right a to demand end user agreements,because the gis basemap is copyrightable,and b to recover more than its direct costs of production,based on section,subdivision b,of the cpra.
copyright protection 
background 
in arguments below,the county raised similar copyright arguments,relying on section.section permits the nondisclosure of computer software,defined to include computer mapping systems,subds.a,b.this statutory exemption is based on a legislative determination that software is not a public record,subd.a.nevertheless,as subdivision d explains nothing in this section is intended to affect the public record status of information merely because it is stored in a computer.public records stored in a computer shall be disclosed as required by this chapter,subd.d.subdivision e addresses copyright as follows nothing in this section is intended to limit any copyright protections,subd.e.relying on that last subdivision,the county argued that it could require end users to execute an agreement not to violate its copyright interest in the gis basemap.
cfac disagreed.it asserted no reported california decision has ever concluded that a public agency may refuse to release copies of public records to protect its own purported copyright.
the trial court agreed with cfac.the court briefly explained its reasoning in footnote of its may order.the court first quoted section,subdivision e,then stated cfac is correct in its interpretation that,when read in conjunction with subdivision d,copyright protection is not appropriate here.
the parties contentions 
in this court,the county raises both procedural and substantive arguments concerning copyright.
procedurally,the county complains that the trial court did not reach its copyright claim.the county acknowledges the court holding in footnote.but it maintains that the court made its ruling in the context of deciding that the gis basemap is not computer software and thus does not qualify for exemption under section,subdivision a.in the county view,the trial court should not have summarily dismissed the county request for an end user agreement,without first examining the creativity and compilation issues.see defining compilation feist publications,rural telephone service,d recognizing a low threshold of creativity for copyright protection.
in its substantive arguments,the county maintains that copyright law protects its compilation of data as a unique arrangement.the county seeks the right to demand an end user agreement upon disclosure of the gis basemap,to protect its rights as the rightful owner of copyrightable intellectual property in the map.
cfac disputes both the procedural and substantive arguments interposed by the county.countering the county procedural claim,cfac points to footnote of the trial court order,characterizing it as an explicit rejection of the county copyright arguments.substantively,cfac argues,the cpra does not recognize copyright interests in public records such as these,and it thus precludes the imposition of an end user agreement upon their release.
at the outset,we reject the county procedural claim that the trial court should have examined the creativity and compilation issues involved in its copyright claim.for one thing,the county did not brief those specific issues in its papers below.it simply made the bald assertion that it owns a copyright interest in the gis basemap followed by a citation to the federal copyright statute.et and that assertion was addressed and rejected by the trial court,as shown by its citation to authority.in any event,the county preserved its substantive copyright claim,which we now review.
state law question 
state law determines whether a public official may claim a copyright in his office creations.microdecisions,skinner so d,see county of suffolk,new york first american real estate solutions,building officials code adm rs,code tech.each state may determine whether the works of its government entities may be copyrighted.microdecisions,skinner,at.
in some states,statutes explicitly recognize the authority of public officials or agencies to copyright specific public records that they have created.see microdecisions,skinner,supra,so d at,florida state law authorized certain agencies to obtain copyrights and permitted certain categories of public records to be copyrighted,but it gave county property appraisers no authority to assert copyright protection in the gis maps,which are public records county of suffolk,new york first american real estate solutions,supra,at new york public record law did not specifically address the impact on a state agency copyright.
at issue here is how california public records law treats the county copyright claim.that is a question of first impression in this state.because it requires statutory interpretation of the cpra,it is also a question of law,which we review de novo.los angeles unified school dist.superior court,supra,th at,d.we begin our analysis with the specific provision cited by the county in support of its copyright interest.
the cpra references copyright protection in a single provision,section,subdivision e.as previously noted,that provision states nothing in this section is intended to limit any copyright protections,subd.e.
as the county reads that statutory language,it expressly provides for copyright protection despite production of public records.furthermore,the county says,copyright protection is not limited to computer software,which has its own discrete exemption in section,subdivision a 
we reject the county interpretation.at the outset,we reiterate the principle that restrictions on disclosure are narrowly construed.cal,subd.b board of trustees of california state university superior court,supra,th at,d.with that principle in mind,we consider the county contentions,applying settled rules of statutory construction.as the california supreme court recently reaffirmed,our fundamental task is to ascertain the legislature intent so as to effectuate the purpose of the statute.smith superior court,supra,cal th at,d.
i statutory language 
in undertaking our analysis,we start with the language of the provision.smith superior court,supra,cal th at,d,los angeles unified school dist.superior court,supra,th at,d.we again quote that language,emphasizing two words that guide our construction nothing in this section is intended to limit any copyright protections,subd.e,italics added.
first,the provision uses the word section,subd.e.it does not employ the broader term chapter,which would encompass the entire cpra.that word choice directs our focus to the subject of section,which is computer software.given this context,use of the word section strongly suggests that the referenced copyright protection is limited to computer software.
second,the provision states that it does not limit copyright protection,subd.e.in our view,that phrasing operates only as a legislative recognition that copyright protection for software is available in a proper case it can not be read as an affirmative grant of authority to obtain and hold copyrights.the legislature knows how to explicitly authorize public bodies to secure copyrights when it means to do so.for example,the education code includes a number of provisions authorizing copyrights,including this one any county board of education may secure copyrights,in the name of the board,to all copyrightable works developed by the board,and royalties or revenue from such copyrights are to be for the benefit of the board securing such copyrights,see also.the health and safety code contains this provision,which references the statute at issue here copyright protection and all other rights and privileges provided pursuant to title of the united states code are available to the department of toxic substances control to the fullest extent authorized by law,and the department may sell,lease,or license for commercial or noncommercial use any work,including,but not limited to,videotapes,audiotapes,books,pamphlets,and computer software as that term is defined in section of the government code,that the department produces whether the department is entitled to that copyright protection or not.health,subd.a see also,subd.c.here,by contrast,section contains no such express authorization to secure copyrights.
ii legislative history 
if the statutory terms are ambiguous,we may examine extrinsic sources,including the legislative history.smith superior court,supra,cal th at,d,accord,los angeles unified school dist.superior court,supra,th at,d.
on the other hand,where legislative intent is expressed in unambiguous terms,we must treat the statutory language as conclusive no resort to extrinsic aids is necessary or proper.equilon enterprises consumer cause,cal th,d,see also,kaufman broad communities,performance plastering,supra,th at,d.that is the situation here.by the express terms of section,the legislature has demonstrated its intent to acknowledge copyright protection for software only.
in sum,while section recognizes the availability of copyright protection for software in a proper case,it provides no statutory authority for asserting any other copyright interest.
end user restrictions 
having found no specific statutory copyright authorization,we now consider whether the county may demand licensing agreements or otherwise impose restrictions on end users.
while no california court has addressed this question,courts in two other jurisdictions have,reaching opposite conclusions.applying new york law,the court in county of suffolk found end user agreements permissible.county of suffolk,new york first american real estate solutions,supra,at.there,the court construed the plain language of new york public records law to permit the county to maintain its copyright protections while complying with its obligations under the statute.id.at.three years later,applying florida law,the court in microdecisions rendered a contrary decision.microdecisions,skinner,supra,so d at.there,the court decided that a county property appraiser could not require prospective commercial users of the records created in his office to first enter into a licensing agreement.ibid.
as a matter of first impression in california,we conclude that end user restrictions are incompatible with the purposes and operation of the cpra.in arriving at that conclusion,we find ourselves in agreement with the florida decision in microdecisions,skinner,supra,so d.that case addressed similar statutory provisions,and its reasoning is persuasive.id.at.by contrast,we find the county of suffolk case less consistent with our state law.see county of suffolk,new york first american real estate solutions,supra,at.
as the discussion in microdecisions reflects,florida public records law is similar to california in at least two important respects.microdecisions,skinner,supra,so d at.for one thing,under florida law a requester motive for seeking a copy of documents is irrelevant.ibid.the same is true in california.by express legislative mandate,the cpra does not allow limitations on access to a public record based upon the purpose for which the record is being requested,if the record is otherwise subject to disclosure.see city of san jose superior court,supra,th at,d.in addition,california shares a second key similarity with florida law both states limit the fees that may be charged for producing a public record.in florida,the fee prescribed by law is generally the cost of reproduction.microdecisions,skinner,at.california law incorporates the same general limitation,subd.b.
beyond these factual similarities,we find the florida court reasoning persuasive.the microdecisions court discussed the interplay between the federal copyright act and florida public records law.microdecisions,skinner,supra,so d at.it explained the copyright act gives the holder the exclusive rights to reproduce and distribute a work and to authorize others to do so,citing.as such,a copyright owner may refuse to provide copies of the work or may charge whatever fee he wants for copies of the work or a license to use the work.ibid.the florida public records law,on the other hand,requires state and local agencies to m
