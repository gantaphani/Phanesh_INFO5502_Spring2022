this case arises from ergonome claim that compaq safety and comfort guide scg unlawfully infringed on a copyright held by ergonome in preventing computer injury the hand book thb,a teaching text describing ergonomically correct hand positions for computer users and ways to avoid repetitive stress injuries.on july,after a trial,the jury concluded that any copying by compaq was de minimis and constituted fair use according to.the district court subsequently held that the doctrines of laches and equitable estoppel also barred ergonome claim.based on these findings,the district court awarded compaq its attorneys fees of million.additionally,the district court deemed defendant stephanie brown to be the alter ego of ergonome as a sanction for repeated discovery violations throughout the litigation process.
ergonome,brown,and her husband mowrey appeal on multiple grounds and argue,inter alia,that the jury verdict should be set aside,the district court erred in finding that laches and equitable estoppel bar their suit,the district court erred in shifting attorneys fees to ergonome,and brown and mowrey are not the alter egos of ergonome and should not be held jointly and severally liable for the attorneys fee award.
to prevail,ergonome would have to persuade this court that each of the four independent bases for finding in compaq favor de minimis,fair use,laches,and equitable estoppel is legally erroneous.ergonome has not succeeded in this formidable task,and,focusing exclusively on the jury finding of fair use,we affirm the finding of no infringement.we reach no other substantive copyright issues raised by the parties.additionally,we affirm the district court decision to shift attorneys fees and its discovery sanction against brown.however,because no such sanction was imposed on mowrey,we reverse this aspect of the judgment.
background 
in,stephanie brown began writing thb and subsequently registered the manuscript with the copyright office.brown and mowrey formed ergonome in to publish and market the book.brown assigned all her rights in thb,including the copyright,to ergonome.thb was formally published in.
in,compaq decided to update a booklet entitled creating a comfortable work environment that was packaged with each compaq computer.during the revision process,compaq manager of the human factors group,cynthia purvis,referenced thb.the finished booklet,renamed the safety and comfort guide,contained four illustrations and seven phrases that were similar to photographs and phrases in thb like its predecessor,the scg was packaged and included with every compaq computer.
meanwhile,brown and mowrey had been attempting to market thb to various computer companies,including compaq.mowrey initially spoke to purvis on the telephone in march and thereafter sent purvis a letter detailing volume discount prices for thb.in november,brown and mowrey attended a meeting with compaq personnel in houston to demonstrate key moves,a software derivative of thb.during this meeting,purvis gave brown a copy of the scg.according to brown,while leafing through the scg,she became aware of the similarities between the four illustrations and seven phrases and thb.she said nothing of the alleged infringement,however,choosing instead to pursue the possibility of a software license with compaq.brown and mowrey returned to compaq again in january for another key moves demonstration.
in december,mowrey notified purvis of ergonome infringement claims.in,compaq filed suit in federal district court in houston seeking a declaration that the scg did not infringe on thb.ergonome subsequently filed an infringement action in federal district court in new york,which was transferred and consolidated with compaq declaratory judgment action in houston.both parties filed motions for summary judgment,and the district court concluded as a matter of law that the portions of thb at issue were copyrightable.however,the district court ultimately denied the motions because genuine issues of material fact remained as to compaq affirmative defenses of de minimis and fair use.see compaq computer ergonome,d.the jury trial and resulting appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
to establish copyright infringement,a plaintiff must prove ownership of a valid copyright and copying of constituent elements of the work that are copyrightable.eng g dynamics,structural software,cir citing feist publications,rural.serv,d.copyright ownership is shown by proof of originality and copyrightability and compliance with the applicable statutory requirements.id.compaq does not dispute that ergonome possessed a statutorily compliant copyright.in addition,the district court held as a matter of law that the portions of thb allegedly copied by compaq reflected the necessary originality to qualify as copyrightable compaq computer ergonome,d.the jury found that compaq actually copied portions of thb.
not all copying amounts to copyright infringement,however.eng g dynamics,at.specifically,congress has excepted from infringement of copyrighted materials copying that amounts to fair use under.when determining fair use,congress has provided a list of factors that must be considered 
the purpose and character of the use,including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes 
the nature of the copyrighted work 
the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole and 
the effect of the use on the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.
in the instant case,compaq pleaded fair use as an affirmative defense,the jury was instructed on the four factors enumerated above,and they ultimately concluded that compaq copying of the four illustrations and seven phrases from thb amounted to fair use.on appeal,ergonome does not challenge the fair use jury instruction.instead,the company argues that the district court erroneously excluded evidence relevant to the fair use defense and erred in refusing to grant ergonome motion for judgment as a matter of law as to fair use.
exclusion of evidence 
this court reviews a district court decision to admit or exclude evidence for abuse of discretion.green administrators of tulane educ.fund,cir.even if an abuse of discretion is found,the harmless error doctrine applies unless a substantial right of the complaining party was affected.id.
ergonome contends that the district court excluded evidence relevant to the first statutory fair use factor.specifically,ergonome complains about the exclusion of evidence relating to past lawsuits against compaq for repetitive stress injuries rsi,the exact number of the offending copies of the scg distributed with compaq computers,and the proposed volume discount quoted to compaq by mowrey.the district court apparently premised exclusion on federal rule of evidence,finding that its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.fed.evid.
ergonome asserts that the evidence concerning past rsi lawsuits is necessary to prove compaq commercial motive for copying from thb,that is,compaq desire to defray potential rsi liability.the first statutory fair use factor asks the court or jury to consider the purpose or character of the use.while compaq did not produce the scg for individual sale or profit,the supreme court has noted that t he crux of the distinction is not whether the sole motive of the use is monetary gain but whether the user stands to profit from exploitation of the copyrighted material without paying the customary price.harper row,publishers,nation,d.thus,the inclusion of the scg with each compaq computer constitutes a commercial use of the copied material.
the rsi evidence would be relevant to ergonome motive theory.however,the district court concluded that ergonome true reason for seeking to introduce the evidence was to paint compaq as a bad company.the court did not abuse its discretion by concluding that any probative value the rsi evidence might hold was outweighed by its prejudicial and inflammatory nature and by its tendency to confuse the jury with tangential litigation.in any event,the exclusion was harmless,because even without the rsi lawsuit evidence,the jury was presented with ample evidence of compaq commercial use,or motive,relevant to the first statutory fair use factor.
ergonome also contests the exclusion of the number of compaq guides distributed to customers and evidence concerning the details of a proposed volume discount price submitted by mowrey such evidence is claimed to be relevant to compaq commercial use of thb under the first statutory fair use factor.the district court did not abuse its discretion by excluding this evidence as cumulative or prejudicial.see fed.evid.again,any error that may have occurred was harmless,as compaq commercial use of thb was evident from the fact that a copy of compaq scg was bundled with every compaq desktop computer sold,and the jury was aware that compaq sold millions of computers.the jury was also apprised of ergonome desire to sell thb to compaq and of the sales calls and meetings to that end.ergonome substantial rights were not affected by the exclusion of this evidence.
judgment as a matter of law 
we review a district court ruling on a motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo.ins.of am.aberdeen ins,cir.this court views the evidence and inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.id.judgment as a matter of law is appropriate only when the facts and inferences point so strongly and overwhelmingly in favor of one party that the c ourt believes that reasonable men could not arrive at a contrary verdict.rubinstein administrators of the tulane educ.fund,cir see also fed.civ.a.
ergonome argues sketchily that the evidence as to each of the four statutory fair use factors points so overwhelmingly in ergonome favor that the district court erred in denying its motion for judgment as a matter of law.as discussed supra,compaq use of thb was commercial in the sense that compaq scg was packaged with every desktop computer.while commerciality generally weighs against finding fair use,it does not end the inquiry rather,the fair use determination depends on the totality of the factors considered.see campbell music,d sundeman seajay soc y,cir.
the second statutory factor asks the factfinder to determine the nature of the copyrighted work.the supreme court has noted that fair use is more likely to be found in factual works than in fictional works.stewart abend,d.ergonome argues that because the district judge found at summary judgment that portions of thb were sufficiently original to warrant a copyrightability finding,the second factor must favor ergonome.in order to be copyrightable,a work must contain a certain modicum of originality.originality relatively low hurdle may be cleared when the selection and arrangement of sometimes uncopyrightable facts evinces a minimal degree of creativity.feist publications,rural.serv,d.at summary judgment,the district court concluded that thb possessed the requisite amount of originality.
ergonome argument proves too little,however,because fair use excuses otherwise actionable infringement.thus,a work will always be found original for copyrightability purposes before the fair use analysis is applied.the second statutory fair use factor,then,refers to the nature of the work beyond this initial inquiry.at trial,brown herself stated that thb was a factual teaching text.based on the evidence submitted at trial,the jury could have easily concluded that thb was a factual work,as opposed to a highly creative fictional work,and that the second fair use factor favored compaq.
the third statutory factor considers the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole.the copied portions of thb at issue in this case amount to four illustrations and seven phrases.the evidence at trial revealed that thb is approximately pages long and contains over photographs.based on the evidence adduced at trial,the jury could have reasonably concluded that the minimal portions of thb used in compaq scg were insubstantial in relation to thb as a whole.
finally,the copyright act focuses on the effect of the use on the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.the supreme court states that this factor represents the most important aspect of fair use.harper row,at.at.this factor requires courts to consider not only actual harm to the market for the original,but also whether widespread use of the work,like the sort complained of by the,would impair the potential market for the original work and any derivative works.campbell,at.at.
in this case,ergonome could not show that the distribution of compaq scg deprived ergonome of any sales.in fact,brown and mowrey conceded that in june,six months before compaq began distributing its scg,they decided to cease actively marketing thb.mowrey testified that because of the increased demand for computer software,he and brown decided to focus on marketing key moves as opposed to thb.in addition,he stated that it was simply too easy for company managers to read thb and instruct employees on its techniques rather than buy numerous copies of the book.based on this evidence,the jury could have reasonably concluded that the distribution of compaq scg had little or no impact on the market for thb.moreover,mowrey stated that the potential market for thb was essentially thwarted by an uncontrollable market phenomenon,namely,managerial consumption and dissemination of thb techniques.the jury could also have reasonably concluded that compaq use of portions of thb had little or no impact on the potential market.the evidence presented at trial and the reasonable inferences therefrom,when viewed through the lens of the statutory fair use factors,support the jury fair use finding 
attorneys fees 
the copyright act provides that 
i n any civil action under this title,the court in its discretion may allow the recovery of full costs by or against any party other than the united states or an officer thereof.except as otherwise provided by this title,the court may also award a reasonable attorney fee to the prevailing party as part of the costs.
as the prevailing party,compaq requested an award of attorneys fees.in granting compaq request for attorneys fees of,the district court relied upon several factors,inter alia ergonome continuously failed to comply with discovery orders,which resulted in monetary sanctions and holdings of contempt ergonome filed a multitude of motions and had ergonome prevailed on its million claim for damages,its attorneys would have received a forty percent contingent fee,which represents an award times greater than the amount requested by compaq.appellants argue that the district court decision to award attorneys fees to compaq violates supreme court precedent and also represents an abuse of discretion.they do not,however,contest the quantum of the fee award.
whether the district court applied an incorrect legal standard in awarding attorneys fees is a question of law reviewed de novo.hogan,cybresource int l,cir.we review a district court decision to award attorneys fees,however,for abuse of discretion.id.
in deciding to award attorneys fees,the district court noted that t he fifth circuit has acknowledged that an award of attorneys fees in copyright cases is within the discretion of the trial court,but has held that the award of attorneys fees in copyright cases is the rule rather than the exception,and should be awarded routinely.see hogan,at mcgaughey twentieth century fox film,cir.appellants argue that the supreme court decision in fogerty fantasy,d,displaced this court discretionary but routinely awarded standard this argument is without merit.in hogan,this court considered and rejected the identical argument advanced by appellants here.at.specifically,this court held that both this circuit rule and the fogerty rule allow for district court discretion in the decision to award attorneys fees.id.the district court did not apply the incorrect legal standard.
appellants also argue that the district court failed to apply the correct factors,as announced in fogerty,when making its decision.however,the supreme court in fogerty stated that t here is no precise rule or formula for making a fee
