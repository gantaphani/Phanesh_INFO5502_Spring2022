defendant doe,whose identity is not known to plaintiffs arista records llc et,appeals from an order of the united states district court for the northern district of new york,glenn suddaby,judge,rejecting doe objections to the denial by united states magistrate judge randolph treece of doe motion originally brought by other anonymous defendants to quash a subpoena served on his internet service provider to obtain information sufficient to disclose his identity.the magistrate judge ruled that defendants qualified first amendment right of anonymity was outweighed by,inter alia,plaintiffs allegations that defendants were downloading distributing music over the internet in violation of plaintiffs copyrights and plaintiffs need for the information in order to enforce their rights.on appeal,doe contends principally that the allegations in the complaint are not sufficient to overcome his first amendment right of anonymity in addition,he contends that the reference of his motion to the magistrate judge and the district judge review of the magistrate judge decision were procedurally flawed.finding no merit in doe contentions,we affirm.
background 
plaintiffs are recording companies that commenced the present action in july,alleging that to plaintiffs at that time not by name but only by the internet protocol ip addresses assigned to them at certain specific times by their internet service provider isp had infringed plaintiffs copyrights by,without plaintiffs permission or consent,downloading distributing to the public various music recordings through an online network.see complaint.or or networks allow users to exchange files directly between their computers without intermediate servers.attached to the complaint is an exhibit a listing for each doe defendant,inter alia,his or her ip address at a stated date and time,the name of the network used gnutella or areswarez,the titles of songs downloaded from the ip address,and,for each song,which plaintiff was the copyright owner.the complaint requests,inter alia,damages and injunctive relief prohibiting further direct and indirect infringement of plaintiffs copyrights.
in order to identify the defendants,plaintiffs sought authorization to serve a subpoena on defendants common isp,the state university of new york at albany sunya,for disclosure of each defendant name,current and permanent address,telephone number,email address,and media access control address identifying the device engaged in the online communication.in support of their subpoena request,plaintiffs submitted a july,declaration by carlos linares linares decl,vice president for legal affairs,recording industry association of america,riaa,who was responsible for the collection of facts alleged in the complaint exhibit linares described,inter alia,the retention of a investigator that had proceeded to detect numerous copyrighted music files in the various doe defendants folders on networks,including the songs listed in exhibit a,and he described the riaa review of the investigator evidence to verify that each individual was infringing.see linares decl.the court issued the subpoena but required sunya to notify each doe defendant that it intends to disclose the requested isp identifying information to plaintiffs and send to each doe defendant a copy of the subpoena order dated july,at.
thereafter,plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the action against most of the defendants.the remaining defendants,eventually including doe,moved to quash the subpoena or,in the alternative,to have the court order a severance requiring that each defendant be sued separately.in support of the motion to quash,these defendants argued that the first amendment affords a qualified right to use the internet anonymously and that the court that has issued a subpoena must quash or modify the subpoena when it requires disclosure of privileged or other protected matter,if no exception or waiver applies.c a iii.while acknowledging that t he first amendment right to communicate anonymously is,of course,not a license to infringe copyrights,the moving defendants argued principally that their privilege can only be overcome by a substantial and particularized showing,sufficient to plead a prima facie case of copyright infringement.amended memorandum of law of doe defendants,and in support of motion to quash does amended memorandum at internal quotation marks omitted.they argued that the complaint fall s far short of that showing.id.
the moving defendants argued accordance with what they characterized as the heightened pleading standards imposed since bell atlantic twombly,does amended memorandum at in order to overcome the first amendment privilege,plaintiffs must state,on personal knowledge,a specific claim for copyright infringement against each and every doe defendant id.at.the moving defendants contended that plaintiffs were required 
to present specific evidence,including a declaration from whoever examined the files available for download from each defendant computer,listened to the files,verified that they were copyrighted songs,determined that the copyrights were registered and to which plaintiffs,to list the songs that a particular defendant made available for download,and to annex corresponding copyright registration certificates for the songs.
id.at.they also argued that the complaint fails to allege any actual distribution of song files to the public and hence does not state a claim upon which relief can be granted,id.at and that i n addition to establishing that plaintiffs action can withstand a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim,plaintiffs,in order to secure disclosure of the doe defendants identities,must produce sufficient evidence supporting each element of their claims,id.at emphasis and internal quotation marks omitted.
as amended,defendants notice of motion stated that the motion to quash would be returnable before district judge suddaby.however,the motion was referred to magistrate judge treece.
a.the magistrate judge denial of defendants motion to quash 
in a memorandum decision and order dated february,see arista records llc does,wl,arista i,the magistrate judge denied the motion to quash the subpoena.noting the need to balance the modest first amendment right to remain anonymous against a copyright owner right to disclosure of the identity of a possible trespasser of its intellectual property interest,arista i,wl,at,the magistrate judge looked to the test set out by judge denny chin in sony music entertainment does,d sony music,and evaluated the defendants expectation of privacy,the prima facie strength of plaintiffs claims of injury,the specificity of the discovery request,plaintiffs need for the information,and its availability through other means.
the magistrate judge found that all five factors counseled against quashing the subpoena.he noted that plaintiffs had sufficiently pleaded copyright infringement claims,alleging ownership of the copyrights,copying,and distribution of the protected works by the doe defendants without the consent of the owners.see arista i,wl,at.the court also noted that plaintiffs allegations of distribution were supported by exhibit a to the complaint,specifying their investigator sampl ing of some of the downloads from shared folders,id.at.the magistrate judge also found that the disclosure request was reasonable in scope,that identification of the alleged infringers was indispensable for the vindication of plaintiffs copyright rights,and that the identifying information was unavailable through alternative means.
the magistrate judge found that these factors were not outweighed by the first amendment rights of the doe defendants.he stated that the doe defendants have a minimal expectation of privacy,especially when they allegedly engaged in network sharing because the notion of allowing others to have access to one database by virtue of the internet in order to pluck from a computer information and data that the computer owner or user wishes to share renders void any pretext of privacy.id.at.accordingly,the magistrate judge denied the motion to quash.
b.the district court review of the magistrate judge order 
pursuant to,doe objected to the magistrate judge denial of the motion to quash,and sought de novo review,reversing and overruling that order.as a threshold procedural matter,doe argued that the motion to quash had been referred to the magistrate judge without the consent of either party,and without an actual order of referral from the district judge supporting declaration of richard altman dated march.he also argued that the motion should not have been referred to a magistrate judge for decision because t he motion,while styled as one to quash a subpoena,actually challenged the legal sufficiency of the complaint in the nature of a motion under.b.as such it is dispositive because the motion to quash would for practical purposes be determinative of the outcome of the present litigation doe objections to magistrate judge memorandum decision and order at.doe argued that the magistrate judge thus lacked jurisdiction to decide the motion to quash and that doe was entitled to have the district judge review the magistrate judge decision de novo.as to substance,doe contended,to the extent pertinent to this appeal,that the magistrate judge order erred in its conclusion that the complaint states a legally cognizable claim,and that making available music files is automatically copyright infringement.id.at.
in a decision and order dated march,arista ii,district judge suddaby rejected doe objections.the court first rejected doe contention that his had requested the quashing of the subpoena or the severance of the claims against the various a dispositive motion.see,arista ii at generally a motion to quash a subpoena is a matter id.at a motion for severance of claims is also properly viewed as a matter since the practical effect of the motion,if granted,would not be to terminate plaintiff claims against defendants nor would it be to necessarily terminate the current action.the court rejected the proposition that the motion to quash was in essence a motion to dismiss under rule b and hence was a dispositive motion,noting that that rule,by its terms,confers the right to move for dismissal for failure to state a claim on a party.id.at.the defendants,not having been served with process,were not yet parties and thus could not properly move for dismissal for failure to state a claim.id.at.given that the motion to quash or sever was a nondispositive motion,the court implicitly rejected doe contention that the magistrate judge lacked authority to rule on it.
further,because the motion to quash or sever was a nondispositive motion,the district judge concluded that the proper standard for reviewing the magistrate judge order was clear error,not de novo.id.at.the court found no clear error in the magistrate judge order.it also determined that it would reach the same conclusion even upon de novo review.id.
this appeal followed.the order is appealable under the collateral order doctrine,as the subpoena at issue is directed against a third party who is unlikely to risk being held in contempt to vindicate someone else rights.in re grand jury subpoena duces tecum dated may,cir quoting in re katz,cir brackets in in re grand jury omitted.on motion of doe,this court stayed sunya compliance with the subpoena with respect to information pertaining to doe pending resolution of the appeal.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,doe principally argues that the complaint does not state a claim sufficient to overcome his first amendment privilege of anonymity.he also pursues his contentions that his motion to quash was improperly referred to the magistrate judge and that the district court thus erred by not reviewing the magistrate judge decision de novo.we find no merit in doe contentions.
a.the procedural challenge 
the district court may designate a magistrate judge to hear and decide a pretrial matter that is not dispositive of a party claim or defense.a see b a.dispositive matters may be referred to a magistrate judge only for recommendation,not for decision such matters principally include motions for injunctive relief and motions for dismissal.see b b.b.matters concerning discovery generally are considered nondispositive of the litigation.thomas hoar,sara lee,cir,cert.denied.like most discovery requests directed to opposing parties,subpoenas to nonparties are designed to elicit information.a motion to quash a subpoena in an action seeking relief other than production of the subpoenaed information is not normally a dispositive motion.
as to a nondispositive matter,t he district judge in the case must consider timely objections and modify or set aside any part of the magistrate judge order that is clearly erroneous or is contrary to law.a.as to a dispositive matter,any part of the magistrate judge recommendation that has been properly objected to must be reviewed by the district judge de novo.see id.b.
in the present case,the doe defendants motion to quash plaintiffs subpoena to sunya was not a dispositive motion.although doe contends to the contrary,arguing that the magistrate judge necessarily had to decide whether the complaint stated a claim or not doe brief on appeal at,that argument ignores,inter alia,all factors other than the viability of the complaint.applying the sony music test,the magistrate judge could have granted the motion to quash despite the sufficiency of the complaint if it had found,for example,that the subpoena was unduly broad or that plaintiffs had easy access to the doe defendants identities through other means.quashing the subpoena on such a basis plainly would not have ended the action.
in addition,doe contention that the motion to quash was the equivalent of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim ignores arguments he made to the magistrate judge.he argued that in order to overcome the qualified privilege,a plaintiff must produce evidence supporting each element of its claim i n addition to establishing that its action can withstand a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.does amended memorandum at internal quotation marks omitted emphasis in memorandum.
finally,even if doe were correct in characterizing the motion to quash as a dispositive matter,the only consequence would have been that review by the district judge should have been de novo.given that the district judge stated that he would conclude that the motion should be denied even if he reviewed the matter de novo,doe procedural contention provides no basis for reversal.see generally.at every stage of the proceeding,the court must disregard all errors and defects that do not affect any party substantial rights.
b.the substantive challenge 
a district court ruling on a motion to quash a subpoena is reviewable for abuse of discretion.see,in re subpoena issued to dennis friedman,cir.a court abuses its discretion when its decision rests on an error of law or on a clearly erroneous factual finding,see,cooter gell.hartmarx,in re fitch,cir,or when its not necessarily the product of a legal error or a clearly erroneous factual be located within the range of permissible decisions,id.internal quotation marks omitted see,zervos verizon new york,cir.we see no abuse of discretion in the refusal to quash the subpoena in the present case.
the fundamental copyright principles are clear.the owner of a copyright has the exclusive right to license others,perform publicly,display publicly,prepare derivative works of,and distribute copies of,his copyrighted work.see.to establish infringement of copyright,two elements must be proven ownership of a valid copyright,and copying of constituent elements of the work that are original.feist publications,rural telephone service,see,harper row,publishers,nation enterprises.the word copying is shorthand for the infringing of any of the copyright owner five exclusive rights described in.a m records,napster,cir napster internal quotation marks omitted.
further,a lthough t he copyright act does not expressly render anyone liable for infringement committed by another,studios grokster,grokster quoting sony universal city studios,it is well established,based on the doctrine that one who knowingly participates or furthers a tortious act is jointly and severally liable with the prime tortfeasor,that one who,with knowledge of the infringing activity,induces,causes or materially contributes to the infringing conduct of another,may be held liable as a contributory infringer,gershwin publishing columbia artists management,cir gershwin internal quotation marks and footnote omitted emphases ours see,grokster,at.the knowledge standard is an objective one contributory infringement liability is imposed on persons who know or have reason to know of the direct infringement,napster,at emphasis added see,in re aimster copyright litigation,cir w illful blindness is knowledge,cert.denied,communication network productions,cir gershwin,at.such liability exists if the defendant engages in personal conduct that encourages or assists the infringement,napster,at quoting matthew bender west publishing,cir.the resolution of the issue depends upon a determination of the function that the alleged infringer plays in the total reproduction process.gershwin,at quoting fortnightly united artists television,alterations in gershwin.
the relevant first amendment principles are also well established.the supreme court has recognized that the first amendment provides protection for anonymous speech.see,buckley american constitutional law foundation,mcintyre ohio elections commission,see also naacp alabama,compelled disclosure of membership list would impinge on first amendment right of association.in the context of political speech,the supreme court has recognized that a nonymity is a shield from the tyranny of the majority,mcintyre,at.the court has also recognized that the internet is a valuable forum for the exchange of ideas.see,reno aclu,u,through the use of chat rooms,any person with a phone line can become a town crier with a voice that resonates farther than it could from any soapbox.to the extent that anonymity is protected by the first amendment,a court should quash or modify a subpoena designed to breach anonymity.see.c a the issuing court must quash or modify a subpoena when it requires disclosure of privileged or other protected matter,if no exception or waiver applies.
the first amendment does not,however,provide a license for copyright infringement.see,harper row,publishers,at,at w ith respect to copyright protection,t he first amendment is not a license to trammel on legally recognized rights in intellectual property quoting dallas cowboys cheerleaders,scoreboard posters,cir sony music,d at parties may not use the first amendment to encroach upon the intellectual property rights of others.thus,to the extent that anonymity is used to mask copyright infringement or to facilitate such infringement by other persons,it is unprotected by the first amendment.
as indicated in part above,the legal standard applied by the district court in the present case in denying the moving doe defendants motion to quash plaintiffs subpoena to sunya was the standard adopted by the court in sony music,d.in sony music,after discussing the above principles,as well as several cases that had dealt with the tension between first amendment rights and copyright rights,judge chin concluded that in the analysis of whether the qualified privilege requires that the subpoena be quashed,the principal factors include 
the concrete ness of the plaintiff showing of a prima facie claim of actionable harm,the specificity of the discovery request,the absence of alternative means to obtain the subpoenaed information,the need for the subpoenaed information to advance the claim,and the objecting party expectation of privacy.
sony music,d at.we agree that this constitutes an appropriate general standard for determining whether a motion to quash,to preserve the objecting party anonymity,should be granted.
on this appeal,doe does not contend that the sony music standard used by the district court here was an erroneous legal standard.although he asserts that downloading,distributing,or making music available constitutes protected first amendment speech doe brief on appeal at,he expressly acknowledges that t he first amendment right to communicate anonymously is,of course,not a license to infringe copyrights nor is it an absolute bar against disclosure of one identity in a proper case id.
nor does doe articulate any challenge to the court evaluation of most of the five factors of the sony music standard,the specificity of the information request,the plaintiffs need for and the limited availability of the information requested,and the anonymous person expectation of privacy.rather,doe contends that the court should have found that plaintiffs did not make a particularized showing doe brief on appeal at sufficient to overcome his qualified privilege.in support of his position,doe contends that the supreme court recent decisions in bell atlantic twombly,twombly,and ashcroft iqbal.iqbal,imposed heightened pleading standards,doe brief on appeal at,such that plaintiffs were required 
to present specific evidence,including a declaration on personal knowledge from the person who examined the files available for download from each defendant computer,listened to the files,verified that they were copyrighted songs,determined that the copyrights were registered and to which plaintiffs,and determined what songs a particular defendant downloaded 
id.at.neither doe reliance on nor his contention that plaintiffs allegations are insufficiently specific has merit.
first,the notion that twombly imposed a heightened standard that requires a complaint to include specific evidence,factual allegations in addition to those required by rule,and declarations from the persons who collected the evidence is belied by the twombly opinion itself.the court noted that rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure requires only a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief,in order to give the defendant fair notice of what the claim is and the grounds upon which it rests,twombly,at other internal quotation marks omitted see also swierkiewicz sorema,holding that,at the pleading stage,an employment discrimination plaintiff who alleges facts that provide fair notice of his claim need not also allege specific facts establishing a prima facie case,for such a heightened pleading standard conflicts with federal rule of civil procedure a.the twombly court stated that a complaint attacked by a rule b motion to dismiss does not need detailed factual allegations,but mere labels and conclusions or formulaic recitation s of the elements of a cause of action will not do rather,the complaint f actual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level,twombly,at emphasis added,enough to make the claim plausible,id.at.applying these standards to the complaint before it,which claimed violations of of the sherman act,prohibiting contracts,combinations,and conspiracies in restraint of trade,the twombly court concluded that stating such a claim requires a complaint with enough factual matter taken as true to suggest that an agreement was made.at emphasis added.because the twombly complaint factual allegations described only actions that were parallel,and were doctrinally consistent with lawful conduct,the conclusory allegation on information and belief that the observed conduct was the product of an unlawful agreement was insufficient to make the claim plausible.see id.at.the twombly plausibility standard,which applies to all civil actions,see iqbal.at,does not prevent a plaintiff from pleading facts alleged upon information and belief where the facts are peculiarly within the possession and control of the defendant,see,boykin keycorp,cir,or where the belief is based on factual information that makes the inference of culpability plausible,see iqbal.at a claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.the twombly court stated that a sking for plausible grounds to infer an agreement does not impose a probability requirement at the pleading stage it simply calls for enough fact to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal
