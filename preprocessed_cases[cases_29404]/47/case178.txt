this appeal arises out of an insurance coverage dispute.in,state auto property and casualty insurance company state auto sued travelers indemnity company of america and farmington casualty company collectively,travelers seeking a declaration that travelers was obligated to participate in the defense of nissan computer corporation ncc in a california civil action.on cross motions for summary judgment,the district court concluded that travelers was not obligated to defend ncc.the court awarded summary judgment to travelers,and state auto appeals.state auto prop.cas.ins.travelers indem.of,order,the order.for the reasons explained below,we vacate and remand.
ncc,a north carolina corporation owned by uzi nissan,is engaged in the business of computer sales and services.on december,nissan motor company,and nissan north america,collectively,nissan filed suit against ncc in the central district of california.in its complaint the nissan complaint,nissan alleges several causes of action,each asserting ncc wrongful utilization of the nissan trademark 
nissan contends that ncc,knowing that nissan owned the nissan trademark,nonetheless registered the domain in and the domain name in.nissan complaint.nissan further alleges that a domain name incorporating a company trademark is a valuable asset that allows potential consumers to communicate with a particular company.id.according to the nissan complaint,ncc ultimately received between and visits per month to its websites from consumers searching for nissan.id.
in,nissan learned that ncc was selling advertising space on its website to automobile and other merchandising companies.nissan alleges that,in so doing,ncc intended to consumers into thinking that these ads and links were affiliated with nissan.id.according to the nissan complaint,ncc efforts at confusion included the utilization of a logo bearing the nissan name that closely resemble d nissan logo,including the same highly distinctive typeface.id.
with respect to the website,nissan alleges that ncc utilized the nissan trademark in registering the domain name,and that ncc designed the website to maximize confusion and trade off of nissan identity and goodwill.id.according to the complaint,ncc sought to profit from this confusion by offering internet access,hosting,and networking capabilities to visitors of the website.id.
during the period from july of until december of,ncc was insured under an insurance policy issued by state auto the state auto policy.for the next three years,from december of until december of,ncc was insured under four policies issued by travelers collectively,the travelers policy the travelers policy provides for any a dvertising injury caused by an offense committed in the course of advertising ncc goods,products or services.it defines advertising injury to include,among other things,harm caused by ncc m isappropriation of advertising ideas or style of doing business.id.at 
the travelers policy contains several provisions that limit travelers duty to provide coverage to ncc.three of those provisions are relevant to the present controversy.first,the travelers policy excludes coverage for any advertising injury a rising out of oral or written publication of material,if done by or at the direction of the insured with knowledge of its falsity the falsity exclusion.id.at.second,it excludes coverage for advertising injuries arising out of an offense committed by an insured whose business is advertising the business of advertising exclusion.id.finally,the travelers policy provides that ncc must,as soon as practicable,notify travelers of an occurrence or an offense which may result in a claim the notice provision.id.at.
the nissan complaint was filed on december.four days later,on december,ncc notified travelers thereof.travelers then refused to defend ncc,maintaining that the travelers policy did not provide coverage for the claims asserted in the nissan complaint.state auto,by contrast,agreed to defend ncc on the nissan complaint,though it did so under a reservation of rights 
in january of,state auto filed this declaratory judgment action in the eastern district of north carolina,invoking the court diversity jurisdiction and seeking a declaration that travelers is obligated to participate in ncc defense.state auto contends that the nissan complaint alleges an advertising injury,as that term is defined in the travelers policy,and that travelers is thus contractually bound to defend ncc.
at the close of discovery,state auto and travelers filed cross motions for summary judgment.after briefing on the motions,the district court ruled in favor of travelers,concluding that the nissan complaint did not allege an advertising injury,and that,in any event,nissan alleged injuries were not the result of ncc advertisement of ncc own goods,products,or services,as required under the travelers policy.order at.accordingly,the court denied state auto motion for summary judgment and awarded summary judgment to travelers.id.state auto thereafter filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment,which was denied.state auto prop.cas.ins.travelers indem.of,order.state auto has appealed,and we possess jurisdiction pursuant to.
we review de novo a district court award of summary judgment.see felty,cir.at the summary judgment stage,we construe the underlying facts in the light most favorable to the party.lone star steakhouse saloon,alpha of,cir.we may uphold an award of summary judgment only if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.
state auto contends that the nissan complaint alleges an advertising injury,as that term is defined in the travelers policy,and that travelers is thus obligated to participate in ncc defense.travelers,by contrast,maintains that the nissan complaint fails to allege an advertising injury.in the alternative,travelers contends that the falsity exclusion and the business of advertising exclusion apply,and that it is thus not obligated to provide coverage.moreover,travelers asserts that ncc failed to comply with the notice provision,and that it thereby forfeited its right to a defense.in order to determine whether travelers is obligated to participate in ncc defense,we first review some basic principles of north carolina insurance law.
an insurance policy is a contract,and its provisions govern the rights and duties of the parties thereto.fid.bankers life ins.dortch.pursuant to north carolina law,the interpretation of an insurance policy is a question of law that is appropriate for resolution on summary judgment.see generally royal ins.of am.cato,app.further,provisions in a policy which extend coverage to the insured must be construed liberally so as to afford coverage whenever possible by reasonable construction.farm bureau mut.ins.stox.
any ambiguity as to the meaning of a policy term must be resolved in favor of the policyholder,or the beneficiary,and against the company.wachovia bank trust westchester fire ins.an ambiguity exists where the language of the policy is fairly and reasonably susceptible to either of the constructions for which the parties contend.waste mgmt.of carolinas,peerless ins.a difference of judicial opinion regarding proper construction of policy language is some evidence that a policy provision is ambiguous.brown lumbermens mut.cas,see also maddox colonial life acc.ins,we feel the fact that the courts of other jurisdictions have reached conflicting interpretations emphasizes the ambiguity inherent in the policy provision.where a term is not defined in an insurance policy,the court must define the term in a manner consistent with the context in which it is used and the meaning accorded it in ordinary speech.id.at.where a policy term has more than one meaning,and the context does not indicate clearly the one intended,it is to be given the meaning most favorable to the policyholder.wachovia,at.
generally,an insurer duty to defend the insured is broader than its duty to indemnify.waste,at.in particular,the duty to defend is ordinarily measured by the facts alleged in the pleadings its duty to pay is measured by the facts ultimately determined at trial.id.importantly,in assessing an insurer duty to defend,the ultimate focus is on the facts that are pled,not how the claims are characterized,fid.guar.moreover,where a complaint alleges multiple claims and injuries,some of which are covered and some of which are not,an insurer is obligated to defend its insured against all claims made in the lawsuit.wa.hous.auth.hous.auth.risk retention pool.
as noted above,the travelers policy defines advertising injury to include the m isappropriation of advertising ideas or style of doing business.further,it provides coverage only for those advertising injuries caused by an offense committed in the course of advertising ncc goods,products or services.accordingly,in assessing whether travelers is obligated to defend ncc,we must determine whether any injury alleged in the nissan complaint constitutes an advertising injury as that phrase is defined by the travelers policy and whether nissan injuries occurred in the course of ncc advertisement of its own goods,products,or services.we address each of these questions in turn.
in assessing whether any of nissan injuries constitutes an advertising injury under the travelers policy,we must determine whether the nissan complaint alleges the misappropriation of advertising ideas or style of doing business.travelers maintains that the term misappropriation,as used in the travelers policy,refers only to the common law tort of misappropriation,which does not protect against injuries resulting from the wrongful use of a trademark.independently,travelers contends that a trademark is neither an advertising idea nor a style of doing business.given these contentions,we must,in assessing whether the nissan complaint alleges the misappropriation of advertising ideas or style of doing business,make two inquiries whether misappropriation under the travelers policy is limited to common law misappropriation,or whether it encompasses any claim related to the wrongful use of a trademark and whether a trademark can constitute an advertising idea or a style of doing business.
the common law tort of misappropriation provides a remedy for the appropriation of some item or creation of the plaintiff which is not protected by trademark law.thomas mccarthy,mccarthy desk encyclopedia of intellectual property.thus,common law misappropriation does not provide any remedy for an injury related to trademark infringement.travelers contends that the travelers policy implicitly adopted the common law definition of misappropriation.travelers therefore asserts that,because the nissan complaint relates solely to ncc wrongful use of the nissan trademark,nissan is not suing for misappropriation,as that term is defined in the travelers policy.state auto maintains,on the other hand,that misappropriation refers to any wrongful acquisition of property.
although north carolina has not had occasion to construe the term misappropriation in this context,it has broadly interpreted a similar phrase unfair competition in the insurance to limit that phrase to its common law definition.see henderson fid.guar.in its henderson decision,the supreme court of north carolina decided that the term unfair competition,as used in a commercial insurance policy,encompasses statutory claims of unfair and deceptive trade practices,as well as the tort of common law unfair competition.the court observed that a person reading the term unfair competition as a category of advertising injury within an insurance policy would not necessarily understand the term to be limited to a common law definition.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.in the court view,there was no valid reason to exclude conduct described in the statute simply because it might not be regarded as unfair competition in a common law sense.id.at.in light of the henderson decision,the supreme court of north carolina is unlikely to construe the term misappropriation,as used in the travelers policy,to be limited to the common law definition.
furthermore,the majority of those courts which have interpreted the term misappropriation,in this context,conclude that misrepresentation refers to wrongful acquisition generally,rather than to common law misappropriation only.ernest martin,et,insurance coverage for the new breed of infringement claims,smu,t he vast majority of courts have concluded that trademark infringement falls within the meaning of misappropriation of advertising ideas or style of doing business.for example,the eleventh circuit was unconvinced by the insurer argument that misappropriation covers only injuries actionable under the common law tort of misappropriation.hyman nationwide mut.fire ins,cir.the court reasoned that there was no indication in the policy that the phrase was intended to be so limited,and that the ordinary meaning of the term misappropriation encompasses a wider spectrum of harms.id.similarly,in adolfo house distributing travelers property casualty insurance,d,the court reasoned that,even assuming that misappropriation could refer solely to common law misappropriation,it was at least equally reasonable to conclude that the term referred more generally to wrongful acquisition.id.at.accordingly,the court decided that the term must be given the interpretation which provide d the most coverage.cat internet,providence washington ins,cir holding that policy covering misappropriation of advertising ideas entitled insured to coverage for trademark infringement claim bay supply,travelers lloyds ins,d,same am.employers ins.delorme publ g,d,delorme interpreting misappropriation in this context to refer to wrongfully tak ing or mak ing use of without authority or right quoting webster new collegiate dictionary,ed.
finally,the term misappropriation is necessarily ambiguous although it could refer specifically to the common law tort of misappropriation,it also could refer more generally to the wrongful acquisition of property significantly,the courts in other jurisdictions are unable to agree on how to interpret the term misappropriation.compare hyman,at,with advance watch,kemper ins,cir.and perhaps most compelling,the insurance companies involved in this coverage dispute disagree on the interpretation to be accorded the term misappropriation in this context.although the state auto policy and the travelers policy define advertising injury identically,state auto acknowledges that it is obligated to defend ncc against the nissan complaint,while travelers takes the contrary position.under north carolina law,such an ambiguity must be resolved in favor of the policyholder.wachovia,at 
in sum,we conclude,for several reasons,that the term misappropriation in the travelers policy refers generally to the wrongful acquisition of property.first,and most importantly,the supreme court of north carolina has indicated that it would adopt this view.see henderson,at.second,most of the courts interpreting the term misappropriation in the advertising injury context have interpreted the term as we do here.finally,the ambiguity in the term misappropriation must be interpreted in favor of coverage.
we must next decide whether the nissan trademark can be construed either as an advertising idea or as a style of doing business.this is the next step in our inquiry because,as noted above,the travelers policy provides coverage only for the misappropriation of advertising ideas or style of doing business.in these circumstances,the nissan complaint alleges the wrongful use by ncc of the nissan trademark.thus,if travelers is to be obliged to defend ncc,the nissan trademark must qualify as an advertising idea or a style of doing business.
a trademark serves at least four distinct functions it identifies and distinguishes a seller goods it indicates that all goods bearing the mark derive from the same source it signifies that all goods bearing the mark are of the same quality and it serves as a prime instrument in the advertisement and sale of the seller goods.thomas mccarthy,mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition ed.accordingly,a trademark plays an important role in advertising a company products.thus,at the very least,a trademark has the potential to be an advertising idea.see,cat internet,at concluding that trademarks can qualify as advertising ideas or style of doing business frog,switch,travelers ins,cir a trademark can be seen as an advertising idea it is a way of marking goods so that they will be identified with a particular source.lebas fashion imports of usa,itt hartford ins.group,th,d,o ne of the basic functions of a trademark is to advertise the product or services of the registrant.emphasis in original 
in this situation,we have a quintessential example of a trademark functioning to advertise a company products.the nissan mark promotes nissan vehicles to the public.as the nissan complaint states,nissan vigorously advertised,promoted and developed its nissan spending hundreds of millions of dollars each year.nissan complaint.as a result of nissan promotion of the nissan mark,the mark has become instantly recognizable throughout the united states and the world as a symbol of automobiles.id.thus,the nissan trademark is an advertising idea and,as a consequence,the injuries alleged in the nissan complaint fall within the travelers policy definition of an advertising injury.
having determined that the injuries nissan alleged constitute advertising injuries,our next inquiry is whether those injuries were caused by an offense committed in the course of advertising ncc goods,products or services,as the travelers policy requires.on this point,travelers contends that,because the allegations in the nissan complaint relate to ncc utilization of the nissan trademark in ncc registration of domain names,and because domain names are simply website addresses,nissan injuries did not occur in the course of ncc advertising.further,travelers maintains that,even assuming that the offenses alleged were committed in the course of advertising,the advertising was not of ncc own goods,products,or services,but rather the goods,products,or services of other companies.
travelers first contends that nissan injuries did not occur in the course of advertising.the term advertising normally refers to a ny oral,written,or graphic statement made by the seller in any manner in connection with the solicitation of business.elan pharm.research employers ins.of wausau,cir quoting black law dictionary ed.travelers asserts,and the district court agreed,that because the injuries suffered by nissan relate solely to ncc use of the and domain names,and because a domain name is nothing more than an address or a locator for accessing a web site,ncc injurious conduct did not itself constitute advertising.order at.as explained below,we disagree with the court conclusion that nissan injuries did not occur in the course of advertising.
first,although the primary thrust of the nissan complaint relates to ncc use of the nissan trademark in ncc domain names,nissan also challenges ncc use of the trademark in its logo on the website.nissan complaint.the logo easily qualifies as a graphic statement and,because it was on the website,where ncc was soliciting business for itself and for others,it was utilized in connection with the solicitation of business.elan,at.as a result,any injuries that nissan suffered by virtue of ncc use of the logo on the website were injuries that occurred in the course of advertising.
even if the nissan complaint had been limited to challenging ncc registration of domain names,we would nevertheless conclude that nissan injuries occurred in the course of ncc advertising.the phrase in the course of extends coverage beyond those injuries that resulted from ncc actual advertisements.the use of a domain name to lead consumers to advertisements on ncc websites is clearly an act that occurs in the course of advertising.here,the nissan complaint alleged that ncc infringed the nissan trademark when it used the domain names and,and that ncc then employed the offending websites for advertisement purposes.nissan complaint.as such,the injuries complained of by nissan occurred in the course of ncc advertising 
because the nissan complaint alleges injuries that were caused by an offense committed in the course of advertising,we must next assess whether the advertising was of ncc own goods,products,or services,as required for coverage under the travelers policy.the district court premised its summary judgment ruling in favor of travelers,in part,on its determination that the nissan complaint fails to allege that ncc infringing conduct occurred during the course of advertising its own goods,products,or services.the court concluded that nissan complains of ncc conduct in relation to its selling advertisements for someone else goods,products or services.order at emphasis in original.
although a significant portion of the allegations in the nissan complaint relate to advertisements on the website for automobile and other merchandising companies,nissan complaint,nissan also alleges injuries that relate to ncc advertisement of its own services,namely its offering of internet access,hosting,and networking capabilities to visitors of its website.id.seeking to profit from this confusion,ncc purports to offer internet access,hosting,and networking capabilities to visitors to the website.see also id.it is therefore apparent that,in registering the domain names and,and using them in connection with ad links to car and other merchandising websites,or to offer internet services,ncc falsely represented and warranted to network solutions,that it had the right to register these domain names.emphasis added.accordingly,the nissan complaint alleges that nissan injuries arose,at least in part,from ncc advertisement of ncc own goods,products,and services.
travelers next contends that,even if the injuries alleged in the nissan complaint fall within the definition of advertising injury in the travelers policy,and even if those injuries occurred in the course of ncc advertisement of its own goods,products,and services,we should affirm the award of summary judgment because of the falsity exclusion,the business of advertising exclusion,and ncc failure to comply with the notice provision.we address each of these contentions in turn.
travelers first asserts that,under the falsity exclusion,it is not obligated to defend ncc in the suit brought by nissan.pursuant to the travelers policy,ncc is not entitled to coverage for an advertising injury a rising out of oral or written publication of material,if done by or at the direction of the insured with knowledge of its falsity.travelers maintains that each cause of action in the nissan complaint alleges that ncc acted intentionally and willfully in misleading consumers,and that the falsity exclusion therefore applies.
because the travelers policy fails to define the policy term falsity,we must define the term in a manner consistent with the context in which it is used and the meaning accorded in ordinary speech.maddox,at.as the eleventh circuit observed in assessing a similar contention,the term false is generally understood to mean untrue or failing to correspond to a set of known facts.hyman,at.there is no allegation in the nissan complaint that the advertisements contained on the and websites were untrue.nor is there anything untrue about the domain names themselves.rather,nissan contends that the website gave a false impression or misled visitors to believe that its contents were sponsored by nissan.as the eleventh circuit observed,although a court could construe the term false to encompass conduct or statements arguably giving rise to a false or misleading impression,s uch a definition is significantly broader than one including only direct assertions of untrue facts,and it is no more plausible.id.at.because north carolina law directs us to construe ambiguous policy provisions in favor of coverage,we can not read the falsity exclusion so broadly as to encompass allegedly misleading conduct.accordingly,it does not apply in this situation 
travelers next contends that it has no duty to defend ncc against the nissan complaint because ncc business is advertising,and the business of advertisi
