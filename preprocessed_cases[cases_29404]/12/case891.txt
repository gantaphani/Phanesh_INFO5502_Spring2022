procedural history 
on february,plaintiff dana bruns filed a suit against a number of defendants for allegedly transmitting advertisements by telephone facsimile machine that violated the telephone consumer protection act of.b c.
on november,one defendant moved to dismiss plaintiff fifth amended complaint because the period for plaintiff to bring her action to trial had elapsed.the other defendants joined the motion.in response,plaintiff argued that certain periods of time had to be excluded from the period under subdivision b or c,or both,of section on january,after hearing the motion to dismiss,the court stayed all proceedings and requested briefing regarding the specific litigation that had taken place during the periods plaintiff claimed should be excluded from the period.ultimately,the trial court granted the motion to dismiss.
plaintiff appealed.the court of appeal reversed the dismissal and remanded the matter to the trial court.it held that periods of time in which there was a partial stay of proceedings had to be excluded from the period under b,which reduced the total elapsed time to less than five years.the dissenting justice concluded that the legislature intended the stay language in section to involve only a complete,as distinguished from a partial,stay.we granted review.
ii.discussion 
an action shall be brought to trial within five years after the action is commenced against the defendant.section,the statute at issue here,provides as relevant in computing the time within which an action must be brought to trial pursuant to this article,there shall be excluded the time during which any of the following conditions existed b prosecution or trial of the action was stayed or enjoined.c bringing the action to trial,for any other reason,was impossible,impracticable,or futile.we must construe both subdivision b and subdivision c of this section.
the parties do not dispute that this lawsuit is an action within the meaning of these provisions.as used in this chapter,unless the provision or context otherwise requires a action includes an action commenced by or other pleading that asserts a cause of action or claim for relief,subd.a.this action was commenced on february,when plaintiff filed the original complaint.see bank of america superior court d,an action is commenced within the meaning of section upon the filing of the plaintiff original complaint.it is also undisputed that this action was not brought to trial within five years of this date.a trial within the meaning of section is the determina tion of an issue of law or fact which brings the action to the stage where final disposition can be made.citation.briley sukoff d.a case is brought to trial if it has been assigned to a department for trial,it is called for trial,the attorneys have answered that they are ready for trial,and proceedings begin,even if the proceeding is a motion for judgment on the pleadings.katleman katleman d.in an action tried to a jury,the action is brought to trial when the jury is impaneled and sworn.hartman santamarina cal d.none of this had happened by the time defendants filed their motion to dismiss under section,more than five years after plaintiff filed the complaint.
but plaintiff argues that certain periods should have been excluded from the statutory time,reducing the elapsed time from commencement of the action to less than five years.the court of appeal agreed with plaintiff.it held,and plaintiff argues,that a partial stay of an action constitutes a stay of the prosecution of the action within the meaning of section,subdivision b.
we will first discuss the proper interpretation of section b.because we conclude it applies only when a stay encompasses all proceedings in the action and does not include partial stays,we will also discuss the extent to which section c may apply.
code of civil procedure section b 
we must decide whether section b applies to a stay of any part of the proceeding or only to a complete stay of the entire action.statutory interpretation is a question of law that we review de novo.regents of university of california superior court cal th.our fundamental task in interpreting a statute is to determine the legislature intent so as to effectuate the law purpose.we first examine the statutory language,giving it a plain and commonsense meaning.we do not examine that language in isolation,but in the context of the statutory framework as a whole in order to determine its scope and purpose and to harmonize the various parts of the enactment.if the language is clear,courts must generally follow its plain meaning unless a literal interpretation would result in absurd consequences the legislature did not intend.if the statutory language permits more than one reasonable interpretation,courts may consider other aids,such as the statute purpose,legislative history,and public policy.coalition of concerned communities,city of los angeles cal th.
section b language does not definitively answer whether partial stays generally are excluded from the period under section.it provides that those times must be excluded from the time period in which p rosecution or trial of the action was stayed or enjoined.b.nothing was enjoined in this case,so the operative word here is stayed.the term stay,by itself,could refer to either a partial or a complete cessation of proceedings.a stay freezes a court proceedings at a particular point.black law dict.ed.it can be used to stop the prosecution of the action altogether,or to hold up only some phase of it,such as an execution about to be levied on a judgment,italics added.
in holland dave altman center d,the court of appeal addressed the meaning of the term stay in section b.t he term stay appears to have a commonly understood meaning as an indefinite postponement of an act or the operation of some consequence,pending the occurrence of a designated event.thus,in people santana d,a case involving the stay of a sentence,the court concluded that a stay is a temporary suspension of a procedure in a case until the happening of a defined contingency.black law dictionary,supra,at page defines the term as a suspension of the case or some designated proceedings within it.holland,supra,d at.relying on holland,plaintiff argues that a stay under subdivision b is an indefinite suspension of the entirety of the case or designated within it that yield the practical inability as opposed to complete or absolute inability to proceed to trial.but holland does not support this position.holland gave examples of time periods during which the case could not be brought to trial.they included the absence of trial court jurisdiction to try the case and a court order barring the trial by a stay or injunction.id.at.holland did not address whether the prosecution of the action was stayed within the meaning of section when only a designated proceeding in a case,other than a trial,was stayed or suspended until the happening of a defined contingency.people santana,supra,d at.
because the word stay is ambiguous in this context,we turn to what must be stayed.only when the prosecution or the trial of the action is stayed does running of the period halt under b.the trial was never stayed in this case we therefore focus on the meaning of the word prosecution.the word originally meant the carrying out of any action,scheme,or purpose,with a view to its accomplishment or attainment.garner,dict.of modern legal usage ed.as relevant here,webster new world law dictionary defines prosecution as a pursuing of a lawsuit.webster new world law dict.in a legal context,prosecution has been defined,a s applied to actions or suits generally,as the following up or carrying on of an action or suit already commenced until the remedy be attained cyclopedia of law procedure.in its broadest sense the term would embrace all proceedings for the protection or enforcement of a right or the punishment of a wrong,whether of a public or private character.id.at,fn,italics added see ray wong earle anthony,cal,wong the term prosecution is sufficiently comprehensive to include every step in an action from its commencement to its final determination,citing cyclopedia of law procedure,supra,at melancon superior court cal d,melancon same.
wong involved an action for malicious prosecution stemming from the alleged malicious filing of a criminal complaint against wong,the ensuing issuance of an arrest warrant in sacramento county,wong arrest in san joaquin county,and his criminal trial in sacramento county.in concluding that venue was proper in both sacramento and san joaquin counties because prosecution of the underlying criminal action had occurred in both counties wong,supra,cal.at,the court explained that t he term prosecution is sufficiently comprehensive to include every step in an action from its commencement to its final determination.id.at,italics added.relying on wong,the melancon court noted that the taking of depositions constitutes a step in the prosecution of an action.melancon,supra,cal d at.
the court of appeal majority,agreeing with plaintiff argument,construed melancon as standing for the proposition that the prosecution of an action is a broad concept encompassing all of the various steps in an action,including,but not limited to,pleading,discovery,and law and motion.it then reasoned that e ach of the various steps in an action constitutes prosecution of that action under section b.however,melancon stands only for the proposition that the entire action,including every step in it such as the taking of depositions,is stayed when a motion to post security is filed.neither wong nor melancon considered the issue here.
accordingly,in isolation,section b language is ambiguous.a stay of prosecution under subdivision b reasonably could mean either a stay of any individual or incremental step in an action or a stay of all the proceedings in an action.however,w e do not examine statutory language in isolation,but in the context of the statutory framework as a whole in order to determine its scope and purpose and to harmonize the various parts of the enactment.coalition of concerned communities,city of los angeles,supra,cal th at.
we granted review in this case not to consider the language of section b in isolation rather we are resolving whether only a complete stay of all the proceedings operates to toll the running of the period by which a case must be brought to trial,or whether partial stays of proceedings are sufficient.to answer this inquiry,we must read subdivision b together with subdivision c.when the statute is read as a whole,it becomes apparent that subdivision b contemplates a,nondiscretionary rule that excludes from the time in which a plaintiff must bring a case to trial only that time during which all the proceedings in an action are stayed.subdivision c gives the trial court discretion to exclude additional periods,including periods when partial stays were in place,when the court concludes that bringing the action to trial was impossible,impracticable,or futile.obviously,if a complete stay is in effect,bringing the action to trial is impossible.it makes sense for the legislature to state a rule in this situation.the effect of a partial stay,however,can vary from stay to stay and from case to case.a partial stay might,or might not,make it impossible,impracticable,or futile to bring the action to trial.as discussed below,when the effect of a partial stay is raised by a plaintiff under section,the trial court must determine whether or not subdivision c applies to that partial stay.
this conclusion is bolstered by comparing and harmonizing section b language with the language of a different but related statute,as well as by reviewing section legislative history.
when it enacted section,the legislature also enacted provisions governing the time within which service of summons must be made.see bill reg.sess,enacted as stats,ch.section provides generally that the summons and complaint shall be served upon a defendant within three years after the action is commenced against the defendant.this mandatory provision is similar to section period within which to bring an action to trial.the legislature enacted exclusions to the computation of this period similar to the exclusions in section.specifically,section provides in computing the time within which service must be made pursuant to this article,there shall be excluded the time during which any of the following conditions existed b the prosecution of the action or proceedings in the action was stayed and the stay affected service.b,italics added.the italicized language shows the legislature knows how to specifically reference a partial stay,in addition to a complete stay,when that is its intent.the legislature failure to include in section b an express consequence for staying a specific proceeding within an ongoing prosecution is significant,given the presence of such an expression in section.see martinez regents of university of california cal th,failure to include a requirement in one statute is significant when the legislative body has included that requirement in other statutes bernard foley cal th,legislature failure to include an express friendship exception in statutory scheme was significant because legislature has shown it knows how to craft one.when one provision in a bill refers to the stay of prosecution or proceedings in the action,and another provision refers only to a stay of the prosecution,the inference is compelling that the latter reference is only to a complete stay and does not encompass a limited stay.
this inference is especially strong given that section b and section were adopted as part of the same senate bill.see county of san bernardino city of san bernardino cal th,faulder mendocino county board of supervisors th,when legislature uses materially different language in statutory provisions addressing related subjects,the normal inference is that the legislature intended a difference in meaning.to embrace plaintiff position that section b encompasses individual steps or proceedings in a prosecution,we would have to engraft onto subdivision b an exception that the legislature explicitly included in section but did not include in section b.we decline to rewrite the statute to exclude from the mandatory time in which an action must be brought to trial the time during which individual proceedings are stayed.
the legislative history of section and related statutes enacted in also supports this conclusion.the legislature enacted section in when it added chapter to title of part o
