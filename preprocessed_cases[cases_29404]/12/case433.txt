minnesota public utilities commission and intervenors clec coalition and at t communications of the midwest,collectively,mpuc or commission appeal the district court decision that mpuc lacks the authority under minnesota law to order qwest corporation qwest to comply with restitution for competitive local exchange carriers that were not parties to unfiled interconnection agreements.qwest,challenging the decision affirming the liability order and penalty orders million penalty.we conclude that mpuc lacks the authority to order restitution under minnesota law.however,we find that mpuc properly ordered the million penalty.therefore,we affirm.
mpuc issued a liability order and two penalty orders against qwest for alleged violations of the telecommunications act act.the act was intended to create competition between carriers in local telecommunication service markets,which had been traditionally dominated by a single monopoly carrier.incumbent local exchange carriers ilecs,such as qwest,own the network infrastructure necessary to provide local telephone service.the act allows competitive local exchange carriers clecs to access this infrastructure by entering into agreements with an ilec.interconnection agreements icas between an ilec and clecs must be submitted to the mpuc for approval.a,e.the terms of these icas must be made available to other clecs that are not parties to the original agreement.see id.i.clecs can then opt in and incorporate the provisions of the original agreement in their entirety into their own icas.a.
on february,the minnesota department of commerce filed a complaint against qwest alleging that qwest had formed secret icas with clecs that were not properly submitted to mpuc.the complaint asserted that qwest failure to disclose discriminated against other clecs because these clecs were not given access to the terms contained in the secret icas.on march,the commission referred the case for contested case proceedings before an administrative law judge alj.
on november,mpuc issued a liability order adopting the alj findings that qwest knowingly and intentionally violated and of the act by failing to file twelve icas.the unfiled icas included six agreements with eschelon telecom,three with mcleodusa telecommunications service,and one each with covad communications company,uslink,and a group of ten smaller clecs.mpuc found that qwest knowingly and intentionally violated both federal and state law by failing to file the twelve icas,thereby creating discriminatory conditions on resale and infringing state statutes.the mpuc imposed a million penalty against qwest and granted restitutional relief for the injured clecs based upon its interpretation of state statutes.
qwest brought suit in district court,challenging the liability order and the penalty order.the district court vacated the order for restitutional relief,holding that mpuc lacked either the express or implied authority under minnesota law to grant restitution.however,the district court upheld the million penalty,finding that it was valid under.

mpuc asserts that it has statutory authority to order restitution under,and.mpuc,being a creature of statute,has only those powers given to it by the legislature.peoples natural gas minnesota pub.util.comm n,internal quotation omitted.mpuc may not impose restitutional remedies absent express or implied statutory authority.a review of the statutory language and applicable minnesota case law shows that mpuc has neither.nothing in the statutory language expressly grants mpuc the authority to order restitution.moreover,minnesota case law supports the conclusion that we should not find implied statutory authority to order restitution,absent a clear grant of authority by the legislature.
mpuc argues that it has express authority to order restitutional relief under,which authorizes mpuc to make an order respecting an unreasonable,insufficient,or unjustly discriminatory act,omission,practice,or service that is just and reasonable and to establish just and reasonable rates and prices,subd.mpuc also claims the authority to order restitution is encompassed within.and section is a competitive enforcement statute that permits mpuc to seek criminal prosecution,recover civil penalties,compel performance,or take other appropriate action,subd.section is also an enforcement statute which states that t he imposition of administrative penalties in accordance with this section is in addition to all other remedies available under statutory or common law.the payment of a penalty does not preclude the use of other enforcement provisions,subd.mpuc asserts that this statutory framework supports a finding that mpuc possesses the express or implied authority to order restitution in this case.
while we agree that these statutes give mpuc broad statutory authority to regulate the telecommunications market in minnesota,none of them vest mpuc with the express authority to order remedial relief.we therefore agree with the district court that because none of these statutes expressly refer to relief,the relevant inquiry is whether mpuc has the implied authority to order restitution.we conclude that no such authority exists.
in peoples natural gas,the minnesota supreme court observed that,w hile express statutory authority need not be given a cramped reading,any enlargement of express powers by implication must be fairly drawn and fairly evident from the agency objectives and powers expressly given by the legislature.at.the minnesota court then held that mpuc lacked the implied authority under.and to order a public utility to refund revenues collected from its customers in violation of a mpuc order,rejecting mpuc argument that the commission duty to assure rates that are just and reasonable vested mpuc with the authority to order a refund.id.at.
in holding that mpuc lacked this authority,the minnesota supreme court observed that i t is of some significance that the legislature has not seen fit expressly to grant refund powers to the commission,although it could have done so and in one instance has at least recognized its use.id.the court was reluctant to interpret the statute as providing implied authority of this kind because this is not the kind of agency authority that can or should be implied in the absence of more explicit legislative action.it is not enough that the power to order refunds would be useful to the commission as an enforcement measure.id.at.
the same holds true in this case.mpuc attempts to distinguish peoples natural gas by asserting that the statutory framework has changed significantly since this decision.however,mpuc claims authority under statutory language that is quite similar to that construed by the minnesota supreme court in peoples natural gas.given the minnesota court reluctance to infer authority to grant refund powers in peoples natural gas,we conclude the power to make orders or set rates that are just and reasonable or to take appropriate action is not a grant of authority to order restitution.the minnesota legislature has had twenty years to respond to peoples natural gas,yet the legislature has not seen fit expressly to grant restitution powers to the commission.peoples natural gas,at.
moreover,in in re new ulm telecom,a minnesota court of appeals panel applied peoples natural gas to uphold a commission decision that it lacked the authority under,subd,to estop a utility from providing service absent a finding of inadequate se
