opinion of the court 
the zoning hearing board zhb of easttown township township appeals the district court order directing it to allow omnipoint communications enterprises,omnipoint to erect a telecommunications tower at a designated site within the township.the zhb contends that the district court erred in finding that the zhb decision denying omnipoint application was not supported by substantial evidence as required by the telecommunications act of tca,c b iii.omnipoint argues that the district court was correct on that score and the district court decision denying it damages and attorneys fees under the civil rights act.we conclude that the district court erred in its analysis of the relevant state law.accordingly,we will reverse its order and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
omnipoint,a wireless personal communications service pcs provider,entered into a lease with the or shalom synagogue synagogue,located in easttown township,to erect and operate a communications tower on a portion of its property.the proposed white fibreglass tower was to be approximately feet tall,with a diameter of inches at its base and tapering to inches at the top.omnipoint planned to enclose the base of the tower in a by structure and surround it with an tall fence topped with barbed wire.to reduce the aesthetic impact of the tower,omnipoint suggested using it as a flagpole,though it conceded that the tower would be taller and wider than a normal flagpole.
because the synagogue property was located in a district zoned and the township zoning ordinance imposed a height limitation of feet in such areas,omnipoint submitted an application to the zhb for a use variance in order to erect its tower.see.in the alternative,omnipoint also submitted a challenge to the validity of the ordinance under the pennsylvania constitution and the tca.see.omnipoint alleged that the ordinance was invalid under the pennsylvania constitution because it excluded wireless facilities and under the tca because it had the effect of prohibiting wireless service.
the zhb held public hearings on three separate dates over the course of several months to discuss omnipoint application.at these hearings,omnipoint contended that the tower was necessary to fill a gap in its service in the southern portion of the township and offered the testimony of several expert witnesses in support of its application.the township,on the other hand,called only one witness,its manager,who testified that the challenged ordinance was not exclusionary because it had been interpreted to permit special exceptions for cellular facilities in certain areas of the township,such as the districts numerous township residents also attended the hearings and expressed their opposition to the siting of the tower,largely on the basis that it would be an eyesore in the residential community in which it was to be situated.
at the conclusion of the hearings,the zhb denied omnipoint application,stating its decision orally at one of its meetings and issuing a page statement of findings and conclusions on a later date.with regard to the use variance request,the zhb found that local zoning law places a high burden on the applicant to demonstrate why a variance is necessary and that omnipoint had failed to do so with regard to the validity challenge under state law,the zhb found that the ordinance had been interpreted to allow facilities in certain appropriate zoning districts within the township and that,in fact,there were several cellular or pcs towers or sites operating within the township borders and in contiguous areas.as a result,the ordinance could not be said to be exclusionary.the zhb also observed that the township justification for the challenged,preservation of the residential nature of the aa residential districts falls within the traditional purposes of zoning regulation,and enforcement of zoning regulations is not negated by the telecommunications act of or by pennsylvania law.finally,the zhb rejected the challenge under the tca,concluding that the ordinance did not effectively prohibit wireless service.
in the district court,omnipoint did not challenge the zhb conclusion that it had failed to justify a use variance it did,however,continue to argue that the ordinance was unconstitutional because it was exclusionary.omnipoint further insisted that the zhb decision upholding the validity of the zoning ordinance was violative of the tca because it was not supported by substantial evidence,c b iii,and because it had the effect of prohibiting wireless service.c b i ii.finally,omnipoint sought damages and attorneys fees under the civil rights act.
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of omnipoint and ordered the zhb to grant omnipoint application.it found that the zhb decision was based solely on the negative aesthetic impact of the tower and did not make any findings that the tower would affect the health,safety,or general welfare of the township in any manner other than that of aesthetics.omnipoint communications enterprises,zoning hearing board of easttown township,d.the court further concluded as a matter of pennsylvania law that aesthetic concerns alone were not sufficient to uphold the validity of the ordinance.id.since the court found there was no evidence other than of negative aesthetic impact to support the ordinance,it held that the zhb decision violated the substantial evidence requirement of the tca 
having found the ordinance unconstitutional on this ground,the district court deemed it unnecessary to address whether omnipoint had shown the ordinance to be impermissibly exclusionary under pennsylvania law or whether the zhb decision was in violation of subsection c b i ii of the tca because it had the effect of prohibiting wireless services.see id.at.with regard to omnipoint civil rights claims based on the tca violation,the court found that the tca remedial scheme is sufficiently comprehensive to infer congressional intent to foreclose a remedy.id.at quoting omnipoint newtown township,wl,at.the court also concluded that omnipoint claim for section relief under a substantive due process analysis failed because it found no evidence of an improper motive and because the zhb decision was neither arbitrary nor capricious.id.
subsection c b iii of the tca requires that a ny decision by a state or local government or instrumentality thereof to deny a request to place,construct,or modify personal wireless service facilities shall be in writing and supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record.substantial evidence is a legal term of art.it does not mean a large or considerable amount of evidence,but rather such evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.pierce underwood,d quoting consolidated edison nlrb.a court reviewing under the substantial evidence standard is not to weigh the evidence contained in that record or substitute its own conclusions for those of the fact finder,but rather is to determine whether there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the challenged decision.wireless zoning board of adjustment of the borough of,cir.
the district court in this case correctly observed that s ection c b iii is not intended to supplant the substantive standards to be applied under state or local law.easttown,d at see also omnipoint corporation zoning hearing board of pine grove township,cir apt pittsburgh penn township,butler county,cir.accordingly,the first step for the court in a case in which the provider of wireless services is relying on state or local law is to identify the relevant issues under that law.if those issues require findings of adjudicative fact,the local authority resolution of those factual issues must be supported by substantial evidence.otherwise,any conclusion based on those findings violates subsection c b iii and can not stand.
thus,as we pointed out in penn township 
i t seems apparent that subsection c b iii is intended to provide procedural protections with respect to the determination of factual issues made by a state or local authority in the course of applying state and local zoning
