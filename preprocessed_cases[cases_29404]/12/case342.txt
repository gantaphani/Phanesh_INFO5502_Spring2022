this is a junk fax case,and like most such cases,the facts are not especially juicy.in prism business media,sent ce design,limited,a fax advertising a trade show that it.but that small act sparked a lawsuit that presents some interesting jurisdictional and regulatory questions.ce design sued prism under the telephone consumer protection act tcpa,which prohibits the use of fax machines to send unsolicited advertisements.see b c.prism sought summary judgment on the ground that it shared with ce design an established business relationship ebr a status which,prism argued,provided a complete defense under the federal communications commission fcc orders implementing the tcpa.in response,ce design asked the district court to ignore the fcc orders because,according to it,congress did not authorize the fcc to establish an ebr defense.because ce design request sounded a lot like one to enjoin,set aside,suspend in whole or in part,or to determine the validity of a final fcc which the administrative orders review act places within the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of appeals,see a the district court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the validity of the ebr defense.after determining that the relationship between prism and ce design met the fcc definition of an ebr,the court granted prism motion for summary judgment.ce design appeals.
the few facts in this case are undisputed.prism describes itself as a media company that publishes trade magazines and sponsors trade shows.ce design,a civil engineering and design firm,is among the more than five million subscribers to prism publications.between and ce design subscribed to three of prism publications.for each subscription,ce design president and sole shareholder,john pezl,filled out prism subscription card.on at least two of the subscription cards,pezl provided ce design fax number among the required contact information.
on august,prism sent ce design the fax that set this lawsuit in motion.prism sent the fax to pezl attention at the fax number he provided in his subscription requests.the fax advertised an upcoming trade show.it included a notice inviting pezl to write remove on the face of the advertisement and fax it back to a number if he believed he received the fax in error or if he wished to unsubscribe.instead of accepting that invitation,ce design filed this putative lawsuit 
in its complaint,ce design alleged that prism violated the tcpa provision prohibiting the use of any telephone facsimile machine to send an unsolicited advertisement to a telephone facsimile machine.b c.in prism sent the fax but before ce design filed this passed the junk fax protection act jfpa,which amended the tcpa to exempt from the ban on unsolicited fax advertisements any faxes sent from a sender with an established business relationship with the recipient.b c i.but the version of the tcpa applies in this case,and the ebr exemption does not appear in that version of the statute.instead,before the ebr exemption appeared only in fcc reports and orders implementing the tcpa.see,in re rules regulations implementing the.consumer prot.act of report and order.specifically,the fcc report and order states that facsimile transmission from persons or entities who have an established business relationship with the recipient can be deemed to be invited or permitted by the recipient.id.
in its summary judgment motion,prism argued that the fcc report and order provides a complete defense to ce design tcpa claim.prism argued that ce design status as a subscriber to prism publications meant that they had an ebr at the time prism faxed the advertisement,and accordingly,the fax it sent ce design should be deemed invited.in response,ce design argued that the district court should ignore the report and order,as well as subsequent fcc orders demonstrating that before congress passed the jfpa,the fcc considered the ebr exemption to apply to faxed advertisements.see,in re rules regulations implementing the.consumer prot.act of,in re rules regulations implementing the.consumer prot.act of report order,july.ce design argued that the fcc was not authorized to interpret the tcpa to include an ebr exemption,and that even if it were,the fcc interpretation is unreasonable.
in its thorough and thoughtful opinion granting prism summary judgment,the district court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to consider ce design argument that the fcc was not authorized to establish an ebr defense.specifically,it noted that the administrative orders review act,better known as the hobbs act,reserves to the courts of appeals the power to enjoin,set aside,suspend in whole or in part,or to determine the validity of all final fcc orders,see a,and that before seeking relief from an appellate court,a party aggrieved by the fcc final order must petition the fcc for reconsideration,see a.the district court observed that ce design characterization of the ebr exemption as unauthorized amounted to an indirect challenge to the fcc rule,and accordingly,it concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the validity of the ebr exemption.instead,the district court considered only whether the ebr exemption applies to the facts of this case after carefully considering the fcc ebr definition,the district court determined that at the time prism faxed ce design its advertisement,the parties had an ebr.accordingly,the fax was deemed to have been invited,and prism was entitled to summary judgment on ce design tcpa claim.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.see covell menkis,cir.ce design presses two main arguments on appeal first,that the district court jurisdictional analysis is erroneous because,according to ce design,the court had no need to consider the ebr exemption at all and second,that even if the ebr exemption applies,an ebr exists only where the recipient is a residential subscriber.because ce design characterizes itself as a business subscriber,it argues that its relationship with prism does not qualify as an ebr.
in challenging the district court jurisdictional analysis,ce design argues that under the familiar analytical framework established in chevron,natural resources defense council,there was no need for the court to consider the fcc rules or the hobbs act jurisdictional bar in evaluating its tcpa claim.the familiar chevron framework is a tool for judicial review of an agency construction of the statute which it administers.chevron,at see also fda brown williamson tobacco.in applying the chevron framework,the court first asks whether the statute is silent or ambiguous on the question at issue,and if it is,the court will look to the agency regulations to determine whether they are based on a reasonable construction of the statute.chevron,at castro chi.hous,cir.according to ce design,the district court needed to consider its jurisdiction to review the ebr defense only if it found the tcpa ambiguous and moved past step one of the chevron analysis.specifically,ce design argues that the ebr defense conflicts with the tcpa plain language,which prohibits businesses from faxing unsolicited advertisements and defines unsolicited advertisement as one which is transmitted to any person without that person prior express invitation or permission.see a.ce design asserts that the phrase prior express invitation or permission is unambiguous,and accordingly,it argues that under the chevron framework,there was no need for the district court to even consider the ebr defense.ce design therefore concludes that the hobbs act proscription of district court review of final fcc orders should never have come into play in this case.
ce design argument presents something of a egg question what comes first,the hobbs act jurisdictional restrictions or step one of chevron but while one can go around and around on the dilemma,an article iii court obligation to ensure its jurisdiction to resolve a controversy precedes any analysis of the merits.see davis fed.election comm n.ashcroft,cir.in arguing that the district court can put off considering its jurisdiction until after step one of chevron,ce design turns that traditional approach on its hea
