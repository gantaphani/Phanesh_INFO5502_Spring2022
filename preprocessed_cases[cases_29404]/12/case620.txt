agencies play an important role in rational governance because they develop expertise in specialized areas.principles of checks and balances,however,demand that agencies provide full explanation for their actions to enable effective judicial review.
in the cases before us,we reverse and remand the ninth order of the federal communications commission fcc because it does not provide sufficient reasoning or record evidence to support its reasonableness.the order established a federal funding mechanism to support universal telecommunications services in areas.the consolidated petitions for review challenge the sufficiency of this funding mechanism in view of certain statutory principles,such as achieving reasonably comparable rates for basic telephone services in rural and urban areas.we do not decide the underlying issue of whether the funding is in fact sufficient rather,we conclude that the fcc has not supported why the funding is sufficient.in particular,the fcc did not define key statutory terms adequately set forth a rational basis for the particular benchmark it selected adequately induce state mechanisms to support universal service or explain how this piece of federal support for universal service relates to other funding mechanisms.in this posture,we must reverse and remand the ninth order for further agency proceedings.
we review and uphold the fcc computer model of the costs of providing service in a given area.several technical aspects of the model have been challenged,but we find that these fall squarely within the fcc discretion as an expert agency.none of the alleged problems undermine the utility of the model for estimating costs.we also uphold the fcc practice of fixing minor errors in the computer model without full procedures.accordingly,we affirm the tenth order.
background 
introduction 
the goal of universal service is that customers in all regions of the nation have access to telecommunications services.ninth report order and eighteenth order on reconsideration,fcc,cc docket,hereinafter ninth order.universal service is an evolving level of telecommunications services considering such factors as whether a service has,through the operation of market choices by customers,been subscribed to by a substantial majority of residential customers.c.it comprises,among other things,local telephone service and access to emergency,and services.see a.
the cost of providing these services to customers varies widely.for example,it is generally more expensive for a telephone company to provide service in a rural area,where customers are dispersed,than it is to provide the same service in an urban area,where customers are more concentrated.ninth order.to address this disparity,states and the federal government have established policies that support access to basic services in areas.id.
when the local telephone markets were regulated monopolies,these policies relied on a combination of explicit monetary payments to local phone companies and implicit subsidies through rate designs.id.for example,many states set uniform rates throughout a company service area,which enabled the company to charge rates in urban areas to support rates in rural areas.id.similarly,the federal interstate access charge system was designed to subsidize local service through rates.id.these implicit subsidies are suited to a monopoly environment,but become difficult to sustain as competition increases.id.
telecommunications act of 
the telecommunications act of sought to introduce competition to local telephone markets.see telecommunications act of,stat,codified as amended at.at the same time,however,congress codified its continued commitment to preserving universal service.see.several provisions of are relevant to this case.
the act established a federal state joint board to recommend changes to the federal regulations on universal service,which the fcc then implements in its own proceedings.see a.the joint board and the fcc must base their policies on seven enumerated principles.id.b.the two principles directly relevant to this case are that consumers in rural,insular,and high cost areas should have access to services that are reasonably comparable to those provided in urban areas at reasonably comparable rates,id.b,and t here should be specific,predictable and sufficient federal and state mechanisms to preserve and advance universal service,id.b.
every company that provides interstate telecommunications services must contribute to the federal mechanisms.id.d.federal funding should be explicit and sufficient to achieve the purposes of universal service.id.e.
fcc orders 
the fcc attempted to implement these provisions in its report and order,fcc,cc docket as amended june,hereinafter first order,which on review was affirmed in part,reversed in part,and remanded in part by the fifth circuit.texas office of public utility counsel,cir,cert.dismissed sub nom.gte serv.fcc,d.since then,the fcc has received further recommendations from the joint board and has reconsidered and refined its policies in a series of orders.this case involves challenges to the ninth and tenth orders,released on the same date.see ninth order tenth report and order,fcc,cc docket,hereinafter tenth order.
the orders at issue in this case concern universal service support for carriers only.rural carriers,discussed more fully below,are carriers that serve only rural areas or that are small in size.see infra section.carriers such as qwest are larger and serve at least some urban areas.for rural carriers,the fcc has recently adopted an interim funding mechanism for the next five years and continues to develop a plan.see fourteenth report and order,twenty second order on reconsideration,and further notice of proposed rulemaking,cc docket,may,hereinafter fourteenth order.
the challenges by the petitioners concern whether the fcc has provided sufficient funding to meet the statute principle that rates and services for universal services be reasonably comparable.before the ninth order,the fcc had established several aspects of its universal service policy.first,states would bear the responsibility to marshall state and federal support resources to achieve reasonable comparability of rates.seventh report order and thirteenth order on reconsideration,fcc,cc docket,may,hereinafter seventh order second,the federal mechanism would not consider rates directly rather,it would use costs as an indicator of a state ability to maintain reasonable comparability of rates within the state and relative to other states because rates are generally based on costs.id.finally,funding would be available in areas where the average cost of providing service exceeded some national benchmark defined in terms of the average cost across the nation.id.
the fcc also had begun developing an algorithm to estimate the costs of providing service,which is available in the form of a computer program on the fcc web site.see fifth report order,fcc,cc docket,hereinafter fifth order.in the fifth order,the fcc adopted a model platform,which determined aspects of the model that are essentially fixed,such as assumptions about soil and terrain.id.it did not select inputs for the model,such as the cost of cables and switches.id.
ninth order 
in the ninth order,the fcc finalized its federal funding mechanism.to determine the amount of money that a state may receive,the fcc employs a method.first,using its cost model,it set a benchmark at of the national average cost per line ninth order.second,it computes the average cost per line within a given state.id.if the statewide average cost exceeds the benchmark,then the fcc provides funding for costs in excess of the benchmark id.once the fcc determines a state level of support,it generally distributes the money directly to carriers.the funding is targeted based on the costs at the level,with each carrier receiving its proportionate share,although a state may ask that the targeting rules be waived.id.the state must certify that a carrier is using the funding appropriately.id.
the fcc found that this methodology would implement its goal of enabl ing states to ensure the reasonable comparability of carriers intrastate rates.id.emphasis added.it reiterated that the states have the primary responsibility for ensuring reasonable comparability of rates within their borders.the federal mechanism leaves this state role intact,but provides support to carriers in states with average costs substantially in excess of the national average.id.
tenth order 
in the tenth order,the fcc selected input values for its cost model,thereby completing the model.tenth order.the fcc found that the model provides reasonably accurate estimates of costs.id.the fcc anticipates updating the model as technology and other conditions change.id.in addition,the fcc has delegated to the common carrier bureau the authority to make changes to the model as necessary and appropriate to ensure that the platform of the federal mechanism operates as described in the orders.id.
petitions for review 
we have consolidated three petitions for review filed against the ninth and tenth orders.in,qwest challenges several aspects of the ninth order.in particular,qwest argues that the fcc must itself provide full funding for universal services instead of relying on the states to take action the use of statewide averages and a benchmark set at of the national average do not satisfy the principle that rates in rural and urban areas be reasonably comparable or that federal funding be sufficient to achieve the purposes of the act and the fcc failed to explain adequately its decisions.in,the states of vermont and montana argue that the combination of a national average and a benchmark provides too little funding and the fcc failed to make adequate factual findings to justify its funding mechanism in,qwest attacks the model finalized in the tenth order as violating the administrative procedure act and the telecommunications act.the wyoming public service commission filed a notice of joinder in qwest brief.other parties,including vermont,maine,and at t,have intervened to defend some or all of the fcc decisions.
discussion 
jurisdiction and standard of review 
we have jurisdiction to review final orders of the fcc under.our task is to determine whether the fcc orders are arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.to meet this standard,the agency must examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.motor vehicle mfrs.ass state farm mut.auto.ins,d.
if the agency has failed to provide a reasoned explanation for its action,or if limitations in the administrative record make it impossible to conclude the action was the product of reasoned decisionmaking,the reviewing court may supplement the record or remand the case to the agency for further proceedings.it may not simply affirm.

when it appears that congress delegated lawmaking authority to an agency,we review the agency statutory interpretation promulgated in the exercise of that authority under the two steps set out in chevron nrdc,d.see united states mead,d.if the statute is clear,we apply its plain meaning.chevron,at.if it is silent or ambiguous,however,we apply the agency construction so long as it is a reasonable interpretation of the statute.id.at.
ii.challenges to the ninth order 
statutory language 
both sets of petitioners argue that the ninth order does not provide enough money to support universal service.they assert this level of support will not achieve the statutory principle of providing sufficient support such that rates in rural and urban areas are reasonably comparable.the fcc denies that b imposes such a duty.we begin by examining the relevant statutory provisions.
section b provides that the fcc shall base its policies on a number of listed principles.two of these principles are relevant to this case 
access in rural and high cost areas 
consumers in all regions of the nation,including consumers and those in rural,insular,and high cost areas,should have access to telecommunications and information services,including interexchange services and advanced telecommunications and information services,that are reasonably comparable to those services provided in urban areas and that are available at rates that are reasonably comparable to rates charged for similar services in urban areas.
specific and predicable support mechanisms 
there should be specific,predictable and sufficient federal and state mechanisms to preserve and advance universal service.
the fcc may balance the principles against one another,but must work to achieve each one unless there is a direct conflict between it and either another listed principle or some other obligation or limitation on the fcc authority.alenco communications fcc,cir noting that the fcc may ignore a listed principle t o satisfy a countervailing statutory principle we reach this conclusion by using basic principles of statutory interpretation.
the plain text of the statute mandates that the fcc shall base its universal policies on the principles listed in b.this language indicates a mandatory duty on the fcc.see forest guardians babbitt,cir.however,each of the principles in b internally is phrased in terms of should.the term should indicates a recommended course of action,but does not itself imply the obligation associated with shall.see united states maria,cir citing webster third new international dictionary,ed,and black law dictionary,ed.thus,the fcc must base its policies on the principles,but any particular principle can be trumped in the appropriate case.we hold the fcc may exercise its discretion to balance the principles against one another when they conflict,but may not depart from them altogether to achieve some other goal.
the fcc and at t suggest that the goal of limiting federal expenditures provides a competing principle.alenco,at e xcessive funding may itself violate the sufficiency requirements of the act e xcess subsidization in some cases may detract from universal service by causing rates unnecessarily to rise,thereby pricing some consumers out of the market.arguably b encompasses the principle that services,as well as universal services,should be kept affordable,and thus excessive subsidization of universal services by long distance may violate the principle found in b.however,at most that means that the principles of universal service have to be balanced against the burden on long distance of providing contributions toward universal service 
the fcc also contends that it can have no duty to ensure the reasonable comparability of rural and urban rates because it lacks ultimate jurisdiction to set those rates.see b ninth order congress would not have imposed on the commission obligations regarding intrastate rates that the commission does not have the legal authority to effectuate.this argument misconstrues the nature of the fcc duty under b.the fcc may not have jurisdiction with respect to intrastate rates,but it is nevertheless obligated to formulate its policies so as to achieve the goal of reasonable comparability by inducing sufficient state mechanisms to do so.we explain this further below,in section.
the other relevant provision of the act is e,which provides in part that any federal support for universal service should be explicit and sufficient to achieve the purposes of this section.the fifth circuit held that the plain language of e makes sufficiency of universal service support a direct statutory command.topuc,at see also id.at.this holding has been criticized cogently,we think for overstating the force of the word should.see comsat fcc,cir pogue,concurring.we need not decide in this case whether to reject the fifth circuit interpretation,however.even assuming e sets forth a principle that can be overcome by competing statutory concerns rather than an absolute command,we ultimately conclude the fcc has not explained how its funding mechanism is sufficient.
problems with the ninth order 
for the reasons set forth below,we hold the fcc has not articulate d a satisfactory explanation for its decisions,motor vehicle mfrs.ass n,at,that would enable us to review the rationality of the ninth order.as we indicated in olenhouse,when the agency has failed to provide a reasoned explanation for its action,it is appropriate to remand to the agency for further proceedings.at.we do so here to allow the fcc to establish an adequate legal and factual basis for the ninth order and,if necessary,to reconsider the operative mechanism promulgated in that order.
we find four significant problems with the ninth order the fcc did not define adequately key terms including reasonably comparable and sufficient it did not sufficiently justify setting the funding benchmark at of the national average it did not provide any inducements for the state mechanisms that it concedes are necessary to implement universal service and it did not explain how this funding mechanism will interact with other programs.
failure to define key terms adequately 
one of the main points of contention in this case is whether the fcc has endeavored to ensure that rates in rural and urban areas for universal services are reasonably comparable.the fcc definition of reasonably comparable is inadequate a fair range of rates both within a state borders,and among states nationwide.seventh order ninth order this definition does not help answer the questions that arise about reasonable comparability.for example,vermont and montana assert that some rural rates will be higher than urban rates under the fcc funding mechanism.we fail to see how the fcc definition of reasonably comparable illuminates this dispute.does the fcc contend,for example,that a discrepancy is within a fair range of rates we doubt that the statutory principle of reasonabl e comparab ility can be stretched that far.
at least twice,the fcc has provided what purport to be further definitions of reasonably comparable s upport levels must be sufficient to prevent pressure from high costs and the development of competition from causing unreasonable increases in rates above current,affordable levels.seventh order.s ome reasonable level above the national average cost per line.ninth order.even if these definitions were more precise than the first one given which we doubt,we do not believe they can be considered reasonable interpretations of the statutory language.the act calls for reasonable comparability between rural and urban rates these definitions simply substitute different standards.
the fcc also has not defined what it means for federal support for universal service to be sufficient.it simply asserted without explanation that the mechanism it chose would be sufficient.see ninth order.this conclusory statement is inadequate to enable appellate review of the sufficiency of the federal mechanism and,if accepted,would provide only a circular argument in support of the fcc position.
assuming that the terms reasonably comparable and sufficient are ambiguous,we would be obligated under chevron to defer to the fcc definitions if they were reasonable constructions of the statute.when the fcc has failed to define the terms at all or has provided a definition that replaces a statutory command with some other standard,however,deference is inappropriate.without a limiting standard,rationally related to the goals of the act,at t iowa utils,d,we are unable to conclude that the fcc actions are rational.on remand,we require the fcc to define these terms more precisely in a way that can be reasonably related to the statutory principles,and then to assess whether its funding mechanism will be sufficient for the principle of making rural and urban rates reasonably comparable.
failure to justify benchmark 
in a related vein,the fcc has failed to explain how its benchmark will help achieve the goal of reasonable comparability or sufficiency.as noted above,the fcc has substituted a comparison of national and statewide averages for the statutory comparison of urban and rural rates.if,however,the fcc benchmark actually produced urban and rural rates that were reasonably comparable,however those terms are defined,we likely would uphold the mechanism various parties submitted information to the fcc during the proceedings below comparing rural and urban costs under the fcc proposal.there is no record of the fcc evaluation of this data it apparently adopted the benchmark without explicit empirical findings in this regard.see ninth order.indeed,the agency may very well have a difficult time making such findings because,as explained in the next section,it has no assurances that the states will do anything to support universal service.
the fcc gave four justifications for setting the benchmark at it falls within the range recommended by the joint board,such a level is consistent with the precedent of the existing support mechanism,which uses a range of that level is near the midpoint of the current range and it is a reasonable compromise of commenters proposals.ninth order.we find these justifications insufficient to support the benchmark.the fcc is not a mediator whose job is to pick the midpoint of a range or to come to a reasonable compromise among competing positions.as an expert agency,its job is to make rational and informed decisions on the record before it in order to achieve the principles set by congress.merely identifying some range and then picking a compromise figure is not rational.
we recognize that the fcc determination of a benchmark will necessarily be somewhat arbitrary.that recognition might justify arbitrarily picking a point within a narrow range,but does not justify doing so in the wide range present here.we also acknowledge that the agency is entitled to deference in its when it makes a reasoned decision.here,however,the fcc has not established that it made an informed and rational choice.the ninth order contains conclusory statements that a benchmark will provide sufficient support to enable reasonably comparable rates,ninth order,but does not reference any of the data on rural and urban averages that the states presented to the agency and before us.on remand,the fcc should address the relevant data and provide adequate record support and reasoning for whatever level of support it ultimately selects upon remand.
lack of state inducements 
the fcc acknowledges that the ninth order will result in reasonably comparable rates only if the states implement their own policies,ninth order we believe that this level of federal support will provide states with the ability to provide for a fair range of urban and rural rates within their borders.yet there is nothing in the ninth order to induce such state mechanisms,and there is nothing in the order requiring such inducements in the future if the states fail to provide for reasonable comparability between urban and rural rates as required by the statute.to the contrary,the ninth order expressly adopts the joint board recommendation that the fcc abstain from requiring any state action as a condition for receiving federal universal service support other than the certifications required by e ninth order emphasis added as noted above,the act requires the fcc to base its policies on the principle that there should be sufficient state mechanisms to promote universal service.thus,the fcc must ensure that these mechanisms exist.
we recognize that the fcc may not be able to implement universal service by itself,since it lacks jurisdiction over intrastate service.see b.indeed,the fifth circuit has held that the fcc may not consider intrastate revenues in assessing a carrier contribution to the federal support mechanism.topuc,at.it would be impossible for the fcc alone to ensure reasonably comparable rates in urban and rural areas unless it were willing to commit massive federal support toward ensuring that rates in rural areas are no higher than those currently in place in urban areas.
the telecommunications act plainly contemplates a partnership between the federal and state governments to support universal service.see,b there should be specific,predictable and sufficient federal and state mechanisms to preserve and advance universal service.f every telecommunications carrier that provides intrastate telecommunications services shall contribute,on an equitable and nondis
