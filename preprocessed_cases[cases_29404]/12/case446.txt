roy neset appeals from a final order entered in the district for the district of north dakota granting declaratory and injunctive relief in favor of the united states the government,acting on behalf of the federal communications commission fcc.united states neset,d.for reversal,neset argues that the district court erred in finding that he lacked standing to raise his first amendment defenses,requiring him to exhaust administrative remedies before he could raise his first amendment defenses,and applying the doctrine of primary jurisdiction to preclude him from raising his statutory defenses.for the reasons discussed below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
the government asserted that the district court had subject matter jurisdiction under,and a civil applications to enjoin violations of communications act of.this court has appellate jurisdiction under.neset filed a timely notice of appeal under fed.a b.
the facts in the present case are not disputed.neset is a farmer in tioga,north dakota,a small town in the upper northwest corner of the state.tioga only radio station,ktgo,broadcasts country music.neset likes to listen to talk radio and received permission from a colorado radio station to broadcast that station talk and news programming.neset used a transmitter with a watt amplifier to broadcast primarily over his own property,that is,from his house to his tractor while working in his fields.the signal could be heard at a range of about miles from neset property.about other individuals also listened to his broadcasts.the signal did not interfere with any other broadcasts or stations or threaten public safety.
except for certain special broadcasts and extremely broadcasts,it is unlawful to transmit radio signals within the united states without a license or waiver from the fcc.see.in september the station manager of ktgo complained to the fcc that neset was operating an unlicensed radio station in the tioga area on a frequency of approximately mhz.fcc engineer frank evans investigated the complaint and sent neset a letter advising him of the communications act radio broadcast licensing requirements and the penalties for unlicensed operation.neset replied by letter.he admitted making unlicensed radio broadcasts,but asserted that his first amendment rights were at stake and that he could not obtain a license because the fcc no longer issued licenses for radio broadcasts.
in october,evans traveled to tioga and measured the field intensity of neset radio broadcasting signal.the signal significantly exceeded the maximum intensity allowable under fcc regulations for unlicensed broadcasting.see b mhz fm transmissions not exceeding per meter at distance of meters.in late november neset stopped broadcasting for about days,but then resumed broadcasting on a different frequency mhz.in march evans returned to tioga to measure the field intensity of the radio transmissions coming from neset property.he again found that the signal significantly exceeded the maximum intensity allowable under the regulations.
in march,the government brought this action against neset in federal district court for declaratory and injunctive relief.the government sought to enjoin neset from making radio transmissions without a license or a waiver in violation of.see a civil action to enjoin noncompliance.in his answer,neset admitted making the radio transmissions and that he had not applied to the fcc for a radio broadcast license or a waiver.however,he asserted several affirmative defenses raising constitutional and other challenges to the fcc microbroadcasting regulations.the district court consolidated the preliminary and permanent injunction proceedings.
first,neset argued that the fcc microbroadcasting regulations are invalid because the fcc failed to comply with the paperwork reduction act or the administrative procedures act.the district court found that it did not have subject matter jurisdiction over these statutory violation defenses because the doctrine of primary jurisdiction required that neset first challenge an fcc policy or practice before the fcc and then seek judicial review exclusively in the courts of appeals.see neset,d at.
neset also argued that the fcc microbroadcasting regulations are unconstitutional and violated his free speech rights and those of others who listen to his broadcasts.neset relied upon a recent decision from the northern district of california in which a microbroadcaster raised similar affirmative defenses challenging the constitutionality of the microbroadcasting regulations.see united states dunifer,aff on other grounds,cir holding district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction under applicable statutory framework to decide microbroadcaster constitutional challenges to licensing regulations.neset argued that the regulations were overbroad,were not narrowly tailored to further the government interests in preserving the available broadcast spectrum or preventing signal interference,and interfered with the first amendment rights of his listeners to receive valuable information.the district court adopted the ninth circuit view that a defendant must establish standing to assert an affirmative defense.see d at in raising an affirmative defense,a defendant is seeking the jurisdiction of the court to hear its claims as much as a plaintiff and,therefore,standing becomes an issue for the defendant as well.citing ninth circuit cases.but see wynn carey,cir holding standing applies only to plaintiffs.the district court also found persuasive the dunifer court constitutional analysis and decided that,like dunifer,neset lacked standing to raise his constitutional defenses because he had not applied for a radio broadcast license or a waiver and thus the regulations have never been applied to him.see d at thus failing to show causal connection between injury and conduct of which complained dunifer.at.
the district court then found that neset violated the license requirement of.see d at.neset admitted that he was responsible for unlicensed radio transmissions on mhz in october and on mhz in march.the record showed that he continued to broadcast after being notified of the violation.the district court rejected his asserted defenses.the district court enjoined neset and all persons in active concert or participation with him from making radio transmissions within the united states without first obtaining a license or other appropriate authorization such as a waiver from the fcc.see id.at noting that violation of law supports finding of irreparable injury and no adequate remedy at law exists.the district court subsequently denied neset motion to alter or amend the judgment.this appeal followed.
during the pendency of this appeal,the fcc essentially reversed its position on microbroadcasting and adopted rules authorizing the licensing of two new classes of fm radio stations,one operating at a maximum power of watts and one at a maximum power of watts.see in re creation of low power radio service,fcc,mm docket,wl,at released,to be codified at pts.under the new regulations the fcc will issue licenses to microbroadcasters to operate fm stations.however,it is not clear whether former unlicensed microbroadcasters like neset will be eligible for a broadcasting license under the new regulations.see id.at rejecting amnesty for unlicensed broadcasters and announcing acceptance of applicants who,if at some time in the past they broadcast illegally,certify that they voluntarily ceased broadcasting illegally no later than,without specific directions to terminate by the fcc,or they ceased broadcasting illegally within hours of being advised by the fcc to do so.see united states any all radio station transmission equipment,cir strawcutter noting fcc change in position on microbroadcasting.
in addition,this court struggled with and finally resolved similar difficult jurisdictional issues in an unrelated enforcement action brought by the government against another unlicensed microbroadcaster.see united states any all radio station transmission equipment.fried i,aff,cir fried iii on rehearing by the panel the initial panel opinion was reported at cir frie
