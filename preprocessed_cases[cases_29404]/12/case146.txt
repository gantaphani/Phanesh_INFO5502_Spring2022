opinion of the court 
until late,sprint nextel corporation collectively with its operating subsidiaries,including sprint spectrum,sprint included a early termination fee etf provision in its cellular telephone contracts,which allowed it to charge a set fee to customers who terminated their contracts before the end date stated in the contract.because many consumers believed that etfs were illegal penalties,various class action lawsuits were brought against cellular phone service providers who charged etfs,including sprint.in the case before us now the larson action,the plaintiffs entered into negotiations with sprint,and,after five months of mediation,the parties decided to settle the matter for million,pursuant to the terms of their agreement the settlement agreement.over objections lodged by several class members,the united states district court for the district of new jersey certified the settlement class and approved the settlement agreement.objectors lina galleguillos,antranick harrentsian,and michael moore collectively,the galleguillos objectors,along with jessica hall,appealed because the district court did not adequately protect the rights of absent class members,we will vacate its order and remand the matter for further proceedings.
background 
class action and settlement agreement 
a etf is one that does not vary during the term of the contract at the time the larson class action was filed,if a sprint customer terminated a contract prior to the end of the contract term,sprint would impose a etf of approximately.the larson plaintiffs filed their suit in the district court on november,alleging that the etfs charged by at t mobility,llc at t and sprint were illegal penalties that violated the federal communications act and state consumer protection laws.the complaint was amended twice,with the second amended complaint,as discussed in greater detail herein,being filed by five plaintiffs the class representatives.each of the class representatives was charged a etf by sprint 
sprint moved to dismiss the larson action pursuant to rules b and b of the federal rules of civil procedure,but before the district court rendered a decision on that motion,the class representatives and sprint entered into mediation of the dispute,under the guidance of a retired judge of the district court.after approximately five months of negotiations,on december,the parties agreed to settle the matter for million,comprised of million in cash and million in activation fee waivers,bonus minutes,and credit forgiveness collectively,the common fund in addition to the monetary relief,the settlement agreement also enjoined sprint from entering into new subscriber agreements containing etfs for a period of two years,effective january,along with ending the larson action,the settlement agreement expressly resolved ten other lawsuits pending in various state courts,but it excepted certain claims that were being asserted in a state court class action against sprint captioned ayyad sprint spectrum,llp ayyad.

appellants joint appendix aja at.
the settlement agreement released sprint from all claims,including claims arising from or relating to any decision by sprint to impose or collect an early termination fee,regardless of the basis for the customer claim that the fee should or should not be imposed or collected.aja at.the settlement agreement defined the claim period that is,the time frame in which eligible claimants are entitled to file a claim to acquire the relief set forth in the settlement agreement as the period beginning days after entry of the preliminary approval order and ending days after entry of the final approval order and judgment related to the class settlement.aja at.however,the claim period d id not apply to category iv benefits,as the deadline for submitting a category iv benefit claim form was january.aja at.
class certification and settlement approval 
on december,the district court entered an order preliminarily approving the settlement agreement and conditionally certifying the class under federal rule of civil procedure b the settlement class was defined as follows 
all persons in the united states who are or were parties to a personal subscriber agreement for a sprint nextel wireless service account for personal or mixed use,whether on the sprint cdma network or nextel iden network,or both,excluding accounts for which the responsible party for the wireless service account is a business,corporation or a governmental entity,entered into between july,and december,and whose claims relate in any way to an early termination fee or use of an early termination fee in a subscriber agreement,use or propriety of a subscriber agreement whether the term was for the initial subscriber agreement or subsequent extensions or renewals to the subscriber agreement for whatever reason who were charged by or paid an early termination fee to sprint nextel,excluding only the ayyad class claims and persons whose right to sue sprint nextel as a settlement class member is otherwise barred by a prior settlement agreement prior final adjudication on the merits.the settlement class includes persons who were subject to an etf,whether or not they paid any portion of the etf either to sprint nextel or to any outside collection agency or at all,and includes persons who are prosecuting excluded claims to the extent such persons have claims other than those expressly excluded.
aja at internal footnote omitted.
after preliminarily approving the settlement agreement,the district court set forth a schedule for the final approval process,including allowing class members to lodge objections to the class certification and the settlement agreement.
initial fairness hearing 
the district court held an initial approval hearing the initial fairness hearing over a period in march of.in papers filed prior to that hearing,the galleguillos objectors attacked many aspects of the adequacy of notice given to potential class members about the class action.in particular,they complained about the efforts undertaken by sprint to produce a class member list for use in providing individual notice to class members following that hearing,on april,the court issued an opinion agreeing with the galleguillos objectors that the initial notice plan inp did not comply with rule c,which requires the best notice that is practicable.c b.accordingly,the court issued an order denying final approval of the settlement without prejudice,and ordered counsel for the class representatives class counsel and sprint to submit a new notice plan within days.
in its opinion holding the inp deficient,the district court instructed sprint to attempt to identify subclasses of individuals who paid an etf and include individual notice to those persons.aja at.the court determined that,based on data provided by sprint,it would be unreasonable for sprint to compile a full list of class members from because it would require six to twelve months of work at a cost of at least one million dollars.however,also based on records provided by sprint,the court found that sprint could conduct an inquiry as to whether it can identify specific subsets of customers whether by year,geographic region,etf paid,or type of contract that are members of the class,and the court concluded that,therefore the galleguillos objectors assert ion that partial class lists are as noticeable as complete ones has merit.aja at.
the district court meticulously reviewed case law discussing what constitutes a reasonable effort at sending individual notice to class members,and it held that rule c could not be so easily circumvented by undertaking only an analysis of identifying each and every class member,rather than some or most class members.aja at.instead,the court said that 
sprint must do more than it has done thus far because those subclasses capable of reasonable identification require individual notice.this especially holds true in a case such as this one,where those who paid an etf are entitled to recover the lion share of the settlement but are generally unlikely to be current sprint customers.
aja at.the court instructed class counsel and sprint to construct a new notice plan that included,inter alia,an indication from sprint as to what subclasses of subscribers are reasonably identifiable and a corresponding plan to provide individual notice to those subscribers.aja at.because the court found notice to be insufficient,it concluded that it lack ed jurisdiction over the absent class members,and,u ntil notice was properly administered,it could not evaluate the reasonableness of the settlement.aja at.
amended notice plan 
in response to the district court april,opinion and order,sprint and class counsel submitted a proposed amended notice plan anp on may,although it addressed several of the concerns that the court had with the inp the proposed anp stated that it would be unreasonable to search any of sprint billing records to identify subclasses of individuals who had been charged a etf.to support that contention,sprint and class counsel attached as an exhibit to the proposed anp a declaration from sprint vice president of customer billing services,scott rice the rice declaration.the rice declaration detailed the efforts that would be required to search sprint billing records for class members who were charged a etf.specifically,it noted that,without unforeseen interruptions or data losses aja at,it would take one to two months to capture information for class members who were charged a etf between april,and june,at an estimated cost of,and it would take four to five months to capture information for class members who were charged a etf between april,to march,at an estimated cost of.because,in the view of sprint and class counsel,such efforts would require an unreasonable amount of time at a substantial cost,the anp they proposed did not provide for any search of sprint billing records aja at.
twelve days later,on june,the district court entered an order approving the anp.the court explained that it was satisfied upon examining the rice declaration that it would be unreasonable to require sprint to engage in further efforts to individually identify additional class members because t he time,cost,and effort associated with poring through and analyzing the various sprint databases were not reasonable.aja at.therefore,the court found that individual notice,as outlined in the anp,was sufficient to satisfy rule.id.the district court set the second final approval hearing the second fairness hearing for october,and set october,as the d eadline for any member of the settlement class to file specific objections to the settlement.id.
second fairness hearing 
the galleguillos objectors submitted a brief on the october,deadline,arguing,among other things,that the anp was inadequate under rule c b and that the class representatives themselves were inadequate to satisfy the requirements of rule a with respect to the anp,the galleguillos objectors said that sprint wrongly failed to provide individual notice to million reasonably identifiable class members who had been charged etfs between april,and june.with respect to the class representatives,they asserted that the interests of class members who were current sprint customers were not adequately protected because the class representatives had no interest in stopping the etf charges because,as former customers,they were no longer subject to them.aja at.
on october,sprint submitted a memorandum in response to the objections related to the adequacy of notice it contended that the million number cited by the galleguillos objectors was overstated because the sprint document on which that number was based included etfs charged to government and corporate accounts as well as individual accounts.although sprint acknowledged that the number of settlement class members who were charged an etf could measure into the tens of millions,and a search of its billing records could result in the identification of millions of settlement class members,sprint argued that the court had already properly concluded that the effort to identify those settlement class members would not be reasonable.aja at.on october,two days before the second fairness hearing,the galleguillos objectors conceded that the million number was overstated and submitted the testimony of an expert who examined sprint databases from the ayyad case to provide a corrected estimate.that expert indicated that,using a widely available statistical software package aja at,he was able to quickly sort the data to find that of the customers from those databases were individual accounts.therefore,the galleguillos objectors revised their initial figure of million individual class members to million 
the second fairness hearing went forward as scheduled on october.
order approving class certification and settlement 
in an opinion dated january,the district court overruled all objections certified the proposed settlement class,and approved the settlement agreement.regarding adequacy of representation under rule a,the district court stated that two factors must be considered the plaintiff attorney must be qualified,experienced,and generally able to conduct the proposed litigation,and the plaintiff must not have interests antagonistic to those of the class.aja at quoting in re prudential ins.of am.sales practices.the court noted that n o objection has been lodged specifically as to the qualification and capabilities of class counsel,and it also determined that the interests of the class representatives were not antagonistic to those of other members of the class.aja at.acknowledging the galleguillos objectors contention that the class representatives were not adequate because none of them were current subscribers subject to a etf and thus did not negotiate or attempt to enjoin sprint from enforcing its etf against current customers,the court said that,if current subscribers who were subject to a etf were otherwise harmed because of the existence of the etf,such class members would fall into category iv and would be entitled to the relief afforded therein.aja at.the court further noted that the type of injunctive relief that the galleguillos objectors sought allowing current subscribers to terminate without paying a etf could potentially expose such class members to a counterclaim for damages from sprint.aja at citing garrett coast fed.sav.loan ass n,cal d,we do not hold herein that merely because the late charge provision is void and thus can not be used in determining the lender damages,the borrower escapes unscathed.he remains liable for the actual damages resulting from his default.
the district court then addressed the galleguillos objectors claims.concerning the reach of individual notice,the district court rejected the contention that sprint failed to provide notice to million identifiable class members the court said that the crux of that objection was that sprint could have identified millions of additional class members through sprint own billing records.aja at.the response was that e ven if such speculation were correct,the court ha d already examined the rice declaration and found that the time,cost and effort necessary to do so would be unreasonable in light of all the circumstances.id.
the court concluded that it was satisfied that it would be unreasonable to require sprint to engage in further efforts to identify class members beyond the approximately additional individuals who received individual notice of the settlement for the first time through the anp.aja at.the court noted that,just prior to the anp,only claim forms for lines of service had been submitted.since the implementation of the anp,however,an additional claim forms for lines of service had been submitted.because the court viewed the notice plan as robust,thorough,and includ ing all of the essential elements to properly apprise absent class members of their rights,it concluded that the parties ha d now fully complied with the stringent requirements set forth by rules c b and e.aja at.
the court entered a final order certifying the proposed settlement class under rule a and b and granting final approval to the settlement agreement.appellants then timely filed the present appeals.
the galleguillos objectors renew on appeal many of the objections they made before the district court,asserting,among other things,that the district court abused its discretion by finding that it would be unreasonable to require sprint to perform any search of its billing records to provide individual notice to class members who had been charged a etf,and that the court further abused its discretion by holding that the class representatives were adequate.our disposition of these appeals focuses on the first of those issues,though we think the second warrants comment as well.
as the framing of the objectors arguments indicates,we review a district court decision to certify a class and approve a settlement for an abuse of discretion.in re pet food prods.liab,cir citation omitted.an abuse exists where the district court decision rests upon a clearly erroneous finding of fact,an errant conclusion of law or an improper application of law to fact.id.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
billing records search 
the rice declaration was the sole basis on which the district court determined that it would be unreasonable for sprint to search its billing records to identify class members who had been charged a etf.even accepting the contents of the rice declaration the galleguillos objectors claim that the district court failed to properly exercise its discretion when it determined that it would be unreasonable to require any such search of those records for the purpose of providing individual notice to those class members.we agree.
the rice declaration estimated that,to capture contact information for class members who were charged a etf between april,and june,a search would take approximately four to five months at an estimated cost of sprint candidly acknowledged before the district court,and likewise represents to us that the search efforts described in the rice declaration could result in the identification of millions of class members.after examining the rice declaration,however,the district court,both in its order approving the anp and in its opinion approving the final settlement,concluded that it would be unreasonable for sprint to undertake the search of its billing records because of the time,cost and effort necessary to do so.aja at see also aja at the time,cost,and effort associated with poring through and analyzing the various sprint databases are not reasonable.given the requirements of rule c and of our precedents,and in light of the record before the district court,that decision can not stand.
as noted earlier,rule c b requires individual notice to all members who can be identified through reasonable effort.c b.the supreme court discussed what constitutes reasonable effort in eisen carlisle jacquelin,which involved a prospective class consisting of nearly six million individuals who had engaged in stock purchases,d.the district court in that case had noted that at least two million of those individuals could be identified by names and addresses b y comparing the records and tapes of the firms with the wire firm tapes which contain the name and address of each customer,eisen carlisle jacquelin,rev,cir,aff,d,and that an additional persons who had participated in special investment programs involving trading could also be reasonably identified,at.including the price of first class postage,the district court determined that individual notice to all identifiable class members would cost.id.at.it held,however,that such a substantial expenditure was not required at the outset of the litigation,and ordered limited individual notice,of the cost to be paid by petitioner.id.the united states court of appeals for the second circuit reversed,holding that rule c required individual notice to all identifiable class members,with the entire cost to be paid by petitioner as the representative plaintiff.id.at.
the supreme court agreed with the second circuit and said that the names and addresses of class members were easily ascertainable,and there was nothing to show that individual notice could not be mailed to each.id.at.the court expressly rejected petitioner argument that the requirement of individual notice should be dispense d with in this case because of the prohibitively high cost of providing individual notice to class members.id.as the court put it,individual notice to identifiable class members is not a discretionary consideration to be waived in a particular case.it is,rather,an unambiguous requirement of rule accordingly,each class member who can be identified through reasonable effort must be notified id.at.the court noted that t here is nothing in rule to suggest that the notice requirements can be tailored to fit the pocketbooks of particular plaintiffs.id.and the court also stated that notice by publication had long been recognized as a poor substitute for actual notice.id.at.citation omitted.thus,eisen stands for the proposition that individual notice must be delivered to class members who can be reasonably identified,and that the costs required to actually deliver notice should not easily cause a court to permit the less satisfactory substitute of notice by publication.
in oppenheimer fund,sanders,the supreme court again had occasion to consider the individual notice requirement,d.to identify class members in oppenheimer fund,the representative plaintiffs sought to require the defendants,an investment fund,its management corporation,and a brokerage firm,to help compile a list of names and addresses of class members from records kept by the transfer agent for one of the defendants,so that the individual notice required by rule c could be sent.at.the class was estimated to include approximately persons.id.at.the transfer agent employees testified that 
i n order to compile a list of the class members names and addresses,they would have to sort manually through a considerable volume of paper records,keypunch between and computer cards,and create eight new computer programs for use with records kept on computer tapes that either were in existence or would have to be created from the paper records.
id.at.the cost of those operations was estimated in to exceed.id.having learned of the cost and efforts required,the representative plaintiffs sought to redefine the class to include only persons who had bought fund shares during a specific time period and still held shares in the fund,so that individual notice could be sent in one of the fund periodic mailings to its current shareholders.id.that redefinition would have had the effect of excluding individual notice to former fund shareholders who were class members,and reaching current shareholders who were not class members.id.the district court rejected the proposed redefinition because it arbitrarily reduced individual notice to the class.id.at.the district court explained that it was the responsibility of defendants to cull out from their records a list of all class members and provide that list to plaintiffs.id.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.the district court also held that the cost of that endeavor was the responsibility of the defendants,though it did note that the representative plaintiffs would then have the responsibility to prepare the necessary notice and mail it at their expense.id.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
the second circuit,en banc,affirmed,id.at,and the supreme court granted certiorari on the underlying problem,id.at.although the supreme court held that the district court abused its discretion in requiring defendants to bear the expenses of identifying the class members the court affirmed,sub silentio,the decision requiring the additional search efforts.id.at.in particular,the supreme court concluded that the information from the transfer agent must be obtained to comply with the representative plaintiffs obligation to provide notice to their class.id.
in the course of discussing the underlying issue,the oppenheimer fund court relied heavily on the decision of the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit in in re nissan motor.antitrust litigation,cir.see oppenheimer fund,at.the fifth circuit there discussed rule c individual notice requirement in the context of identifying a class of original retail purchasers of new datsun cars.the plaintiffs in nissan had argued to the district court that the defendants,including nissan motor and every datsun dealer nationwide,were obligated to conduct and bear the costs of an examination of million retail delivery report rdr cards that recorded sales of new datsun motor vehicles between and so that individual notice could be sent to class members.at.the district court instead only ordered the defendants,at their own expense,to prepare and submit a computer listing containing the names and addresses of currently registered datsun owners,characterize ing the examination of the rdr cards to extract the class members names and addresses as an herculean task and an unnecessarily time consuming and burdensome process,id.at.
the fifth circuit,however,vacated the district court class notice order,explaining 
the source or sources providing the greatest number of names and addresses must be used.obviously,the word reasonable can not be ignored.in every case,reasonableness is a function of anticipated results,costs,and amount involved.a burdensome search through records that may prove not to contain any of the information sought clearly should not be required.on the other hand,a search,even though calculated to reveal partial information or identification,may be omitted only if its cost will exceed the anticipated benefits.here,we know that the rdr cards provide the court with the best available listing of the names and addresses of all class members.indeed,the parties agree on this.they only shy from undertaking the effort.while the search can not be made with ease,its advantages bring the effort required within the range of reasonableness.
id.at.the nissan court then expounded on reasonableness 
when the chore of examining defendants rdr cards is juxtaposed to the efforts required to identify the class members in eisen carlisle jacquelin,it pales by comparison.the district court characterization of the undertaking here as herculean is accurate only in relation to the class size.the key,though,is reasonable effort,and a large class requires a large effort.subdivision c mandates that each class member be given the best notice practicable under the circumstances.while the mechanical process of examining the cards may prove to be expensive and,the individual right of absentee class members to due process makes the cost and effort reasonable.
id.at.such effort was required because a bsentee class members generally have no knowledge of the suit until they receive initial class notice,and individual notice will be their primary,if not exclusive,source of information for deciding how to exercise their rights under r ule.id.at.accordingly,the fifth circuit ordered the district court to require individual notice to the class based on the information available on the rdr cards.id.at.
we have been similarly stringent in enforcing the individual notice requirement.in greenfield villager industries,we vacated a district court order approving a settlement because no effort was made to identify class members from the defendant stock transfer records for the purpose of giving individual notice rather,only publication notice was used,cir.we said that a procedure such as the class action,which has a formidable,if not irretrievable,effect on substantive rights,can comport with constitutional standards of due process only if there is a maximum opportunity for notice to the absentee class member id.at.citing supreme court precedent,we noted that publication notice failed to satisfy due process requirements since it was not reasonably calculated to reach those who could be informed by other means at hand.id.at quoting mullane central hanover bank trust.we explained that,w here names and addresses of members of the class are easily ascertainable,due process would dictate that the best notice practicable under the circumstances would be individual notice.id.at quoting.c.our holding,based on eisen,was straightforward a ctual notice must be given to those whose identity could be ascertained with reasonable effort.id.quoting eisen,at,aff.we also said that it was t he ultimate responsibility of the district court to ensure that the parties complied with notice requirements because the district court is the guardian of the rights of the absentees.id.
those cases notwithstanding,sprint cites a decision from the northern district of georgia,in re domestic air transportation antitrust litigation,to support its claim that it would be unreasonable to require it to search its billing records so that individual notice can be sent to more people.domestic air involved a class action on behalf of purchasers of domestic airline passenger tickets from one or more of the defendant airlines to from a defendant hub.id.at.initially,the defendants had argued to the court that class members could not be identified from the airlines records for the purposes of compiling a list to provide those members with individual notice.id.at.after the court certified the class,an evidentiary hearing was held regarding the proposed content,timing,and method of notice.id.at.at that hearing,the plaintiffs agreed with the defendants initial position that class members could not be identified with reasonable effort and thus there was no list of class members to which mandatory individual notice could be given.id.the defendants,however,in an abrupt about face,id.at,then insist ed that it was possible to identify a partial list of class members,and plaintiffs must,therefore,individually notify persons on the partial list,id.at.in support,the defendants said they had developed a list containing more than million names and addresses of possible class members.id.at.
the district court took a different view.it determined that the list developed by the defendants was not a list of class members,and it found as a fact that class members could not be identified at that time through reasonable effort.id.at.as the district court saw it,the defendants list was both and,and it was thus impossible to estimate how many absentee class members would receive individual notice.id.at quoting nissan,at.cautioning that reasonableness is a function of anticipated results,costs,and amounts involved,id.at quoting nissan,at,the court concluded that 
this was not the classic case where rule c individual notice was mandated.in cases such as eisen and nissan the records kept by the defendants indisputably contained the names and addresses of the universe of class members because the list at issue in domestic air was not a list of class members,there was no way to assure that notice to the list would definitely result in notice to a substantial number of class members.
id.at.thus,the district court did not direct individual mail notice to the list.id.
the decision in domestic air is no support for sprint here.on the contrary,as the district court in this action had initially noted in its order holding the inp deficient,domestic air does not stand for the proposition that partial class lists do not require individual notice rather,it adopted quite the opposite formulation.partial lists to the extent they are accurate would require c compliant notice.aja at.after relying on both eisen,see aja at given that eisen required notice to a partial class and that it pronounced constructive notice to be especially unreliable,this court is to find sprint arguments persuasive,and nissan,see aja at nor does the fact that a large effort is required to identify a subset of class members automatically render individual notice inapplicable.citing nissan,at,the district court found 
that sprint must do more than it ha d done so far.the fact that not every member of the class can receive the best notice does not mean that everyone gets the least notice.rather,those subclasses capable of reasonable identification require individual notice.this especially holds true in a case such as this one,where those who paid an etf are entitled to recover the lion share of the settlement but are generally unlikely to be current sprint customers.sprint shall attempt to identify subclasses of individuals and include individual notice to those persons.
aja at emphasis added.
despite that and thoroughly persuasive conclusion,the district court,much like the defendants in domestic air,did something of an about face when it approved the anp proposed by sprint and class counsel.other than a general reference to the rice declaration for the proposition that the time,cost,and effort necessary to conduct a partial search of its billing records to provide individual notice to a subset of class members who were charged etfs would be unreasonable in light of all the circumstances aja at,the court did not provide any support for its new and very different determination that sprint did not need to conduct a search of its billing records to provide individual notice to a larger group of class members.this is particularly puzzling given that the district court had said,in its order holding the inp deficient,that sprint can run targeted searches that pull relevant information for of individuals.aja at emphasis added.
viewing reasonableness as a function of anticipated results,costs,and amount involved,nissan,at,the district court changed determination,based solely on the rice declaration,that it would be unreasonable for sprint to undertake any search of its own billing records was an errant conclusion of law or an improper application of law to fact.in re pet food prods.liab,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.similar to eisen,where at least million class members could have been identified by names and addresses,sprint has acknowledged here that the database search outlined in the rice declaration could result in the identification of millions of settlement class members.aja at.the cost of identifying those millions of class members is approximately.if only two million people were identified through that billing records search,the search would have cost approximately cents per class member identified in.including the expense of mailing the individual notice,the cost would have been approximately cents per class member given the size of the class and the due process rights at stake,these are not troublingly high sums.
even if the costs had been higher,however,that would not automatically mean they were unreasonable.eisen expressly rejected the argument that costs are the primary driver in the judgment on notice,because individual notice to identifiable class members is not a discretionary consideration to be waived in a particular case.it is,rather,an unambiguous requirement of rule at.here,the costs per class member were projected to be less than the cost for individual notice in both eisen and oppenheimer fund,after adjusting for inflation 
sprint refers to the cumbersome process required to search its vast data environments sprint br.at and argues that e ven assuming that the efforts outlined in the rice declaration would yield million c lass members,it is simply another way of restating the already known fact that,with significant effort,a large number of c lass members could be identified,sprint br.at.instead,sprint asserts that t he question before the district court was whether that effort was reasonable,and the court reviewed the efforts outlined in the rice declaration and determined,within its sound discretion,that it would be unreasonable to have sprint undertake those efforts.sprint br.at.but,if the efforts detailed in the rice declaration,whereby a computer program would have to run search queries in certain databases,would identify million class members,we fail to see why running those search inquiries is unreasonable,and no explanation for that conclusion was provided by the district court.in fact,the effort that would be required here seems less significant than the efforts required in eisen,at identifying at least two million individuals b y comparing the records and tapes of the firms with the wire firm tapes which contain the name and address of each customer,or in oppenheimer fund,at.requiring transfer agent employees to sort manually through a considerable volume of paper records,keypunch between and computer cards,and create eight new computer programs for use with records kept on computer tapes that either were in existence or would have to be created from the paper records,or in nissan,at,undertaking examination of million rdr cards to identify names and addresses of original retail purchasers,an examination that the district court called herculean and unnecessarily time consuming and burdensome.
as did the parties in nissan,it appears that sprint and the class representatives would agree that the search of the billing records would provide the best available listing of the names and addresses of class members who were charged etfs they only shy away from undertaking the effort.id.at.while it may be that a search of the billing records to find class members who have been charged etfs can not be made with ease,its advantages,based on the admissions made by sprint itself,appear likely to bring the effort required within the range of reasonableness.id.because we have no way of knowing what in the rice declaration caused the district court to change its mind about the need for a search of the billing records,the individual right of absentee class members to due process under rule c may have been violated.id.at.in light of the principles outlined in eisen,oppenheimer fund,and nissan,and our own precedent calling for a maximum opportunity for notice to the absentee class member,greenfield,at see girsh jepson,cir noting our circuit strong policy in favor of maximum notice,the district court needs to do more to fulfill its duty as the guardian of the rights of the absentees to ensure that the parties complied with the individual notice requirement of rule c,greenfield,at.
we will therefore remand to the district court to again assess whether the anp passes muster under rule c.given sprint concession that a billing records search could result in identifying millions of class members who were charged a etf individuals who are in the sweet spot of the proposed class we are not sure how it can be said that it is unreasonable for sprint to search any of its billing records,but we leave that determination to the district court,to be made on a more complete record and with a fuller explanation.in that connection,we note the availability of statistical sampling of sprint billing records as a means to provide the district court with a better grounded estimate of the number of class members who could,through a search of those records,be identified during the relevant period once that estimate is made,the court,weighing the anticipated results,costs,and amount involved,nissan,at,should be able to determine whether a full search of the subject period would be reasonable,especially in light of the fact that the class members who were charged a etf were the ones who were entitled to recover the lion share of the settlement aja at but were unlikely to otherwise know of it.see nissan,at absentee class members will generally have had no knowledge of a suit until they receive the initial class notice,which will be their primary,if not exclusive,source of information.
adequacy of representatives 
although we remand to the district court to further address the notice issues,we also suggest that the court consider again whether the class representatives can adequately represent all class members.the galleguillos objectors allege that the class representatives are inadequate since none of them were current subscribers subject to sprint illegal etfs at the time that the settlement agreement was executed.galleguillos objectors opening br.at.one of the essential problems with the settlement,as those objectors see it,is the license it grants to sprint to continue making illegal etf charges against current subscribers.id.at.according to the galleguillos objectors,because t he claims of the class representatives are atypical of the claims of current subscribers,the class representatives are inadequate representatives.id.sprint responds that the class representatives satisfy the adequacy requirement of rule a because their interests were not antagonistic to those of the class.sprint br.at citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
as noted earlier,rule a provides that,in order to certify a class,a court must find that the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.a.the adequacy inquiry under rule a serves to uncover conflicts of interest between named parties and the class they seek to represent.amchem,windsor,d.more specifically,as we stated in in re community bank of northern virginia,the inquiry has two purposes to determine that the putative named plaintiff has the ability and the incentive to represent the claims of the class vigorously,and that there is no conflict between the individual claims and those asserted on behalf of the class,cir ellipsis in original quoting hassine jeffes,cir.this inquiry is vital,as class members with divergent or conflicting interests from the named plaintiffs and class counsel can not be adequately represented id.at alteration in original quoting in re diet drugs prods.liab,cir.
in its opinion approving the settlement here,the district court focused on the second purpose of the community bank inquiry as to rule a,the no conflict part the court stated that the plaintiff must not have interests antagonistic to those of the class,aja at quoting in re prudential ins.of am.sales practices,and it found that the class representatives did not.
if that were the complete test,we would perhaps be less concerned about the district court finding of adequacy under rule a,but the test cited by the district court fails to include the first and,in this instance likely the most important part of the community bank inquiry.that part requires that the class representatives have the ability and the incentive to represent the claims of the class vigorously.in re cmty.bank of,at citation omitted.here,it is difficult to understand how the class representatives,none of whom were sprint customers at the time that the settlement agreement was executed,had the interest,much less the incentive,to stop sprint from enforcing etfs against its current customers.id.at vacating decision to certify class because the settlement appear ed to lack structural assurance of fair and adequate representation for the diverse groups and individuals affected quoting amchem,at.super spuds,mercantile,cir th e justification for permitting the representatives to sue on behalf of the class has no application to claims of class members in which the representatives have no interest and which they are willing to throw to the winds in order to settle their own claims.
the district court rejected the objectors adequacy of representation argument,in part because it found that,even if class members who were subscribers at the time that the settlement agreement was executed were still subject to a etf,those members would be entitled to the relief afforded under category iv of the settlement agreement.we briefly note,however,the dissimilar treatment received by class members who only qualified for benefits under category iv,but who were similarly situated to class members who qualified for benefits either under category i charged and paid a etf or category ii charged but did not pay a etf those class members who were sprint customers as of march,the claim deadline for categories i and but terminated their contract between march and december,and were charged a etf only qualified for benefits under category iv,which provided for certain relief that relief is far different from the relief that other similarly situated class members were entitled to under category i or category ii see aja at providing a payment to class members under a two year contract who terminated any time between the seventh and month and paid a etf aja at providing a credit to class members under a two year contract who terminated any time between the seventh and month and were charged,but did not pay,a etf.
nevertheless,because that objection was not made before the district court with the clarity it has been pressed on us we will not opine on the district court conclusion that the class representatives can adequately represent all class members.that being said,because the case must be considered again on the notice issue,and because the adequacy issue is one of high significance,we urge the district court to consider again in greater detail whether the class representatives are adequate under rule a.
iii.conclusion 
with full appreciation for the considerable efforts that have been invested in the settlement of this class action,we emphasize again the judicial duty to act as the guardian of absent class members.for the reasons stated,we conclude that that duty was not fully met and,accordingly,vacate the district court january,order and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
two groups of attorneys also appealed,challenging the district court allocation of attorneys fees.because of the nature of our disposition,we will not address those appeals.
a etf stands in contrast to what is known as a prorated etf.a prorated etf is an etf contract provision that is structured such that the initial amount of the etf will decrease over the term of the contract in some incremental form,resulting in a termination fee at the end of the contract term which is lower than the initial termination fee.appellants joint appendix aja at.prorated etfs are not at issue in this case.
the plaintiffs named in the original complaint were three individuals who were charged a etf by sprint and one who was charged a etf by at t.the second amended complaint did not include the representative who was charged a etf by at t,and added two additional individuals who were charged a etf by sprint.thus,none of the class representatives in the second amended complaint were charged a etf by at t.at t was not part of the eventual settlement and is not a party to this appeal.
if the claims paid out of the cash portion of the common fund were to exceed the amount available in the common fund,all cash benefits would be reduced pro rata.any cash that remained in the common fund after the close of the claim period was to be converted into a cy pres award for distribution to an organization qualifying as tax exempt under c of the internal revenue code,or any other organization or institution agreed upon by the parties.after execution of the settlement agreement,the parties agreed that any money remaining in the common fund would be used to purchase prepaid long distance calling cards for use by members of the armed forces and their families.
at oral argument,sprint indicated that it had not collected etfs since december of.in a letter submitted pursuant to federal rule of appellate procedure j,counsel for the class representatives confirmed that fact,indicating that the last etf contract expired on december.thus,even after the settlement agreement injunction prohibiting sprint from including etfs in subscriber agreements ended on january,it appears that sprint has not yet resumed including etfs in customer contracts.
category iii is entitled claimants who claim their wireless term contract s including amendments,changes extensions to the contract s or the assessment or potential assessment of an etf,or is sic improper,invalid,unlawful or otherwise unenforceable for any reason whatsoever.aja at.no one contends that the issues on appeal affect the claimants who would have rights under category iii,and,by the terms of the category,we do not see that they would.
the settlement agreement defined an etf as any charge described,imposed,charged,or collected pursuant to a provision in a subscriber agreement calling for the payment of a amount for terminating the agreement prior to expiration of the agreement specified term.aja at.
under rule b,and assuming compliance with rule a,a court may certify a class when questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members.b.
appellant hall also objected to the settlement prior to the initial fairness hearing,alleging that the settlement agreement was the product of a reverse auction.a reverse auction is generally the practice whereby the defendant in a series of class actions picks the most ineffectual class lawyers to negotiate a settlement with,in the hope that the district court will approve a weak settlement that will preclude other claims against the defendant.aja at quoting in re cmty.bank of,cir.that claim and another one that class notice was deficient because the costs of notice and administrative expenses were to be paid from the common fund,see infra note were rejected by the court.see infra note.
more fully,rule c b provides,in relevant part for any class certified under rule b,the court must direct to class members the best notice that is practicable under the circumstances,including individual notice to all members who can be identified through reasonable.c b.
the court also instructed that the new notice plan should include at least five other items a new form of individual notice that contain ed the c elements a plan to supply that notice to members of the robertson class a related litigation in california where sprint had compiled a list of all members of a class that had paid etfs a plan to supply that individual notice to all current sprint subscribers a new form of notice publication that is fully compliant with c and e and a full publication plan that,in conjunction with individual notice,will provide the best notice practicable.aja at.
the day before the anp was submitted,the court granted sprint and class counsel motion for reconsideration regarding publication notice,finding the publication notice complied with rule.that order,however,specifically noted that the portions of the court april,opinion addressing lack of proper individual notice remained in effect.
specifically,the proposed anp included the following modifications from the inp a bill insert to send to its current customers which was rule compliant,at an estimated cost of individual notice to subscribers of the robertson class,at an estimated cost of and individual notice to approximately subscribers that it could identify without searching its billing records,at an estimated cost of approximately.
sprint and class counsel did note that i f the court believe d that it would be reasonable for sprint to engage in any of the further efforts set forth in the rice declaration,sprint was willing to do so.however,the dates for the final approval hearing and the exclusion and objection deadlines would have to be pushed out by at least a few months.aja at.
rule a provides,in part,that,in order to certify a class,a court must find that the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.a.although the galleguillos objectors did not specifically cite to rule a in their october brief,they cited to a case,hassine jeffes,cir,that specifically discussed the proper inquiry that a court should make to determine whether class representatives are adequate under rule a,see infra part,and they couched their claim as challenging various prerequisites of rule a that they alleged were not satisfied.
that memorandum did not respond to the galleguillos objectors contention that the class representatives could not adequately represent the interests of all class members.
objector hall also renewed her objection that the settlement was the product of a reverse auction.additionally,hall claimed that the class notice was still deficient because class counsel and sprint provided that the costs of notice and administrative expenses,including the anp,were to be paid from the common fund,and hall asserted that those costs should instead be borne by sprint class counsel.
the court thus also overruled both of hall objections.with regard to the reverse auction claim,the court stated that it had been presented with no evidence of collusiveness a side from the mere overlap of time when counsel for jessica hall and class counsel were apparently negotiating with sprint.aja at.in contrast,the court pointed out that the retired district judge,who oversaw five months of intense settlement negotiations,specifically dismissed the idea that the settlement was the product of a reverse auction or collusion.id.thus,the court determined that the reverse auction claim was baseless.id.the court then turned to hall argument that payment for additional notice should not come from the common fund but rather be borne by either sprint or class counsel.though noting hall objection was well taken,the court cited to the settlement agreement,which contemplated that all costs of providing notice would come out of the common fund.id.the court also cited to the anp,which provided that sprint and class counsel would seek reimbursement from the common fund for the costs.accordingly,the court did not accept hall notice has raised those same two objections to us on appeal,her claim as an attack on the court approving a settlement that was neither fair,reasonable,nor adequate,as required under rule e.see.e if the propos ed settlement would bind class members,the court may approve it only after a hearing and on finding that it is fair,reasonable,and adequate.we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting hall first objection.regarding the reverse auction claim,as the district court noted,hall assertion was directly contradicted by the retired district judge who oversaw five months of negotiation between the parties.concerning the attack as to the adequacy of the settlement,in evaluating whether the settlement was fair,reasonable,and adequate,the district court utilized the proper test by analyzing each of the nine factors as laid out in girsh jepson,cir.after such analysis,it determined that the settlement was fair,reasonable,and adequate.because notice issues remain to be resolved and because we also question whether the class representatives were adequate under rule a,see infra part,we make no comment on whether the settlement was fair,reasonable,and adequate.
the district court made that remark after specifically referring to a group known as the california subscriber class claims,class members that were sprint customers who had not allege d that they had been charged paid an etf,but instead alleged simply that they were subject to an etf in their subscriber agreement.aja at.for purposes of relief afforded under the settlement agreement,the members of the california subscriber class were in the same position as all class members who were current customers and still subject to a etf and had not been charged a etf.accordingly,we assume the court analysis here was meant to apply to all class members that were current sprint subscribers.
that statement was also made in the context of referring to the california subscriber class claims,and we make the same inference here as stated in note,supra.
the district court noted that the galleguillos objectors now concede that the million figure was,at the very least,based on outdated data and therefore unreliable.aja at.the court did not mention that the galleguillos objectors submitted a revised estimate of million class members.in a footnote,the court pointed out that the galleguillos objectors made no effort to obtain additional data from sprint or class counsel until two weeks before the second fairness hearing,and the court was not aware of such matters until less than a week before the second fairness hearing.aja at.as a result,their belated efforts to obtain such data were denied by the court as untimely.id.
the district court also emphasized that,after sprint and class counsel proposed the anp on may,the court received no opposition to it prior to approving the plan on june.similarly,the court rejected the galleguillos objectors claim that the rice declaration was inadmissible,reasoning that that claim was waived because no action was taken on that objection until october,the deadline to file objections,over four months after the court had approved the anp.
after that analysis,the district court analyzed the nine girsh factors,see supra note,to evaluate whether the settlement was fair,reasonable,and adequate under rule e,and determined that it was so.the court also approved the attorneys fee award,as well as addressed the allocation of that award.
the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to d,and we have jurisdiction pursuant to.
the galleguillos objectors also challenge the district court ruling that their objections to the rice declaration were waived because that objection was not made in a timely manner.the galleguillos objectors had alleged that the rice declaration was inadmissible under federal rules of evidence,and.sprint and the class representatives argue that the court properly determined the objections to the rice declaration were waived because the galleguillos objectors did not object until october,more than four months after the anp june,implementation.the galleguillos objectors respond that they filed the objection by the october,deadline set in the district court order implementing the anp.moreover,they argue that there was no prior deadline to adhere to since the proposed anp had not been heard on a noticed motion,and thus there was no briefing schedule setting the date by which the district court expected a response.furthermore,they contend that the days between the filing of the rice declaration and the order approving the anp was not an adequate amount of time to respond.without deciding the matter,we accept for purposes of this opinion that the rice declaration was admissible.
specifically,the rice declaration estimated that it would take one to two months to acquire information for class members who were charged a etf between april,and june,at a cost of approximately,and four to five months to obtain that information for class members who were charged a etf between april,and march,at a cost of about.see supra part.
class counsel,on behalf of the class representatives,filed a letter indicating that the class representatives join the arguments made by sprint in sprint brief responding to the claims made by the galleguillos objectors in their opening brief.thus,when we refer hereinafter to arguments made by sprint in response to the opening brief filed by the galleguillos objectors,it should be understood that such arguments are also advanced by the class representatives.
when the galleguillos objectors provided the district court with the revised million estimate of class members that could be identified through sprint billing records,they noted that,using the inflation calculator on the united states department of labor website,the cost incurred to identify the class members in oppenheimer fund would be approximately in dollars.those search efforts amounted to approximately cents per class member using dollars,or approximately cents per class member in dollars,adjusting for inflation.
the supreme court reached that conclusion because the plaintiffs could obtain the information by paying the transfer agent the same amount that the defendants would have to pay and that no special circumstances existed that warranted requiring the defendants to bear the expense.id.at.
sprint confirmed that fact in both its brief,see sprint br.at stating a t the time the district court conducted its analysis,the record was clear that the efforts that sprint described in the rice declaration could result in the identification of millions of class members albeit at an unreasonable expenditure of time,effort and money,and at oral argument,see oral argument transcript tr.answering that it was without question that there were potentially millions of class members in the billing database.
using the million estimate given by the galleguillos objectors,the search would have cost less than cents per class member.if,however,there were actually million class m
