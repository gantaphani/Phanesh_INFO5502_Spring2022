background 
communications patents,is the owner of the patent,while intellectual property development,is the exclusive licensee of the patent.we refer to communications patents,and intellectual property development,collectively as ipd.
the patent is directed to broadcasting systems with fibre optic transmission lines.the patent recognizes that conventional wired broadcasting systems are generally of two types.in the first type of system,television signals are distributed between a central station and each of a plurality of subscribers over a single signal path,usually a coaxial cable.this type of a system commonly employs frequencies between megahertz mhz.patent,ll.in the second type of system,television signals are distributed between a central station and each of a plurality of subscribers over separate signal paths,usually twisted pairs of conductors contained within a common cable.this type of a system commonly employs frequencies between and mhz.patent,ll.the patent notes that the first type of system suffers from transmission losses and problems,while the second type of system suffers from interference,or crosstalk,as well as maintenance problems.patent,ll.
to solve the problems with these prior art systems,the patent discloses a wired broadcasting system in which a signal path between a central station and at least some of a plurality of subscribers includes an optical fibre patent,ll.the patent discloses several different embodiments of such a system.figure of the patent,which is reproduced below,illustrates one of those embodiments.
as shown in this embodiment,a central station is connected to each of a plurality of subscriber stations and by means of an optical fiber.the optical fiber extends between an transducer located at the central station and a detector or located at the subscriber station patent,ll.
claim,the only independent claim of the patent and the only claim at issue in this appeal,is as follows 
a broadcasting system conveying signals by a signal path between a central station and a plurality of subscribers,comprising in combination,
a common optical fibre in said signal path carrying signals to said plurality of subscribers from said central station,said fibre extending between an transducer at said central station producing a light beam and detector means at a reception position near the subscribers station,
transmission means at the central station modulating the light beam for transmission through said optical fibre,said transmission means including modulation means producing a light beam modulated by a high frequency carrier which itself is modulated with video broadcast signals,
conventional television receivers at the subscriber stations responsive to receive said high frequency carrier modulated with video broadcast signals,
light beam demodulation means at said reception position responsive to said detector means to convert said light beam into demodulated high frequency carrier radio wave signals modulated with video broadcast signals,and 
means coupling said demodulated signals from said reception position to said subscriber stations in a form suitable for direct application to said conventional television receivers without further signal processing.
cablevision of westchester,and,tci own operate cable television systems.is related to tci through a series of subsidiaries of tci.we refer to and tci collectively as cablevision.cablevision has systems that operate in the very high frequency vhf range,mhz.
on september,ipd sued cablevision for infringement of the patent cablevision answered and counterclaimed for declaratory judgments of invalidity,and unenforceability.
in june,the district court conducted a claim construction hearing.on march,then district judge sonya sotomayor issued an opinion in which she construed claim of the patent,including the claim term high frequency carrier.intellectual prop,cablevision of westchester,wl,claim construction ruling.judge sotomayor ruled that high frequency as used in the p atent would have been understood by a person skilled in the art to mean the vhf range,to mhz,received by conventional television receivers of the time.id.at.
on september,the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation transferred the case to the united states district court for the central district of california.on june,however,that court granted ipd motion for a remand and the case was returned to the southern district of new york.at this point,the case was assigned to district judge william pauley,iii,judge sotomayor having been elevated to the second circuit.
on february,cablevision moved for reconsideration of judge sotomayor construction of the term high frequency carrier in claim of the patent and for,inter alia,summary judgment of and invalidity.cablevision argued that judge sotomayor should have construed high frequency to be limited to mhz.ipd opposed,arguing that judge sotomayor correctly construed the claim term high frequency carrier and that the district court should not reconsider her construction.in addition,ipd argued that cablevision was not entitled to summary judgment of or invalidity.
the district court granted both of cablevision motions.summary judgment order at.exercising its discretion to review judge sotomayor construction of the term high frequency carrier,the court concluded that a person of ordinary skill in the art of wired broadcasting systems would have understood high frequency to be limited to mhz.id.at.based on this construction,the court granted summary judgment of in favor of cablevision,noting that since the accused systems operate in the vhf range,mhz,they can not literally infringe claim of the patent id.the court also granted summary judgment of under the doctrine of equivalents in favor of cablevision on the ground that prosecution history estoppel precluded ipd from arguing that the transmission means limitation of claim is infringed under the doctrine of equivalents.id.at the same time,the court granted cablevision motion for summary judgment on its request for a declaratory judgment of invalidity with respect to the patent.it did so on the ground that claim fails to meet the definiteness requirement of,paragraph id.at.ipd timely appealed both rulings.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.

the determination of infringement is a process.first,the court construes the claims at issue to determine their scope.second,it compares the properly construed claims to the accused device.cybor fas,en banc.claim construction is a question of law that we review de novo.id.at.a determination of infringement is a question of fact.insituform,cat contracting.
as noted,the district court granted summary judgment of on the ground,inter alia,that cablevision systems do not operate with a high frequency carrier,as required by claim of the patent.summary judgment order at.the court construed high frequency to refer to the range of mhz.id.cablevision accused systems operate in the vhf range of mhz.on appeal,ipd does not dispute that cablevision systems operate in the mhz range.neither does ipd argue that cablevision infringes the patent if the district court construction of the term high frequency stands.accordingly,the issue of infringement turns solely on claim construction.
ipd argues that the district court erred in reconsidering judge sotomayor construction of the term high frequency carrier.specifically,it asserts that the intrinsic evidence,including the claim language,the specification,and the prosecution history,establishes that high frequency encompasses any frequency at which a conventional tv receiver can receive and display a signal.it also contends that the district court erroneously resorted to selected extrinsic evidence,including dictionaries,to construe the term high frequency.
cablevision argues that the district court properly construed the term high frequency carrier in claim.it asserts that the intrinsic as well as extrinsic evidence supports the district court construction.in the alternative,it argues that if ipd is correct that high frequency includes mhz,then the patent is invalid under f for lack of inventorship.as explained below,we agree with cablevision that the district court did not err in construing high frequency to mean a frequency in the range of mhz.
we begin our claim construction analysis with the words of the claim.vitronics conceptronic.in construing claims,the analytical focus must begin and remain centered on the language of the claims themselves,for it is that language that the patentee chose to use to particularly point out and distinctly claim the subject matter which the patentee regards as his invention.interactive gift express,compuserve,citing.the words used in the claims are examined from the perspective of a person skilled in the art.tegal tokyo electron.in the absence of an express intent to impart a novel meaning to claim terms,the words are presumed to take on the ordinary and customary meanings attributed to them by those of ordinary skill in the art.see,teleflex,ficosa am.the ordinary and customary meaning of a claim term may be determined by reviewing a variety of sources,llc intuitive surgical.some of these sources include the claims themselves,see process control hydreclaim,dictionaries and treatises.digital,telegenix,and the written description,the drawings,and the prosecution history,see,demarini sports,worth.
the district court noted that because claim of the patent does not specify a frequency range,one skilled in the art would presume that high frequency would have its ordinary meaning,unless the patentee clearly assigned a different meaning to the term.summary judgment order at.starting from that premise,the court concluded that one skilled in the art at the time of the patent application december,would have understood high frequency in the patent to mean a frequency between mhz.id.the court noted two dictionary definitions that defined high frequency as covering frequencies between mhz 
a technical dictionary published in defines the term as federal communications c ommission designation for the band from to mhz in the radio spectrum.abbreviated hf.sirota decl.ex.dictionary of scientific and technical terms daniel lapedes.similarly,a radio frequencies table lists high frequency as covering to megacycles.sirota dec l.ex.webster seventh new collegiate dictionary merriam.
ipd argues that the district court put the cart before the horse by looking at dictionary definitions first instead of the specification to determine the meaning of the term high frequency.we disagree.as we have noted,c onsulting the written description and prosecution history as a threshold step in the claim construction process,before any effort is made to discern the ordinary and customary meanings attributed to the words themselves,invites a violation of our precedent counseling against importing limitations into the claims.digital,at citations omitted.in fact,we have noted that dictionaries,encyclopedias,and treatises,publicly available at the time the patent is issued,are objective resources that serve as reliable sources of information on the established meanings that would have been attributed to the terms of the claims by those of skill in the art 
such references are unbiased reflections of common understanding not influenced by expert testimony or events subsequent to the fixing of the intrinsic record by the grant of the patent,not colored by the motives of the parties,and not inspired by litigation.indeed,these materials may be the most meaningful sources of information to aid judges in better understanding both the technology and the terminology used by those skilled in the art to describe the technology.
id.at.accordingly,the district court did not err in looking to dictionary definitions before consulting the written description or the prosecution history to determine the meaning of the term high frequency.indeed,we agree with the district court that,based on the dictionary definitions of high frequency,one skilled in the art at the time of the patent application would have understood high frequency in the patent to mean a frequency between mhz.
in addition,ipd argues that the use of dictionaries as a claim construction tool in this case is inappropriate because there are different dictionary definitions of high frequency,some of which place high frequency outside a range of mhz.ipd relies on the oxford english dictionary and notes that it defines high frequency as a frequency having a relatively large number of cycles in a second.ipd further notes that the oxford english dictionary refers to the dictionary of electronics and that the dictionary of electronics defines high frequency as a general term used to distinguish signals of radio frequency from those of audio frequency.
we have noted that b ecause words often have multiple dictionary definitions,some having no relation to the claimed invention,the intrinsic record must always be consulted to identify which of the different possible dictionary meanings of the claim terms in issue is most consistent with the use of the words by the inventor.digital,at citation omitted.in this case,as will be seen next,the dictionary definition that is most consistent with the specification and the prosecution history is the definition that defines high frequency as including frequencies in the range of mhz.see dictionary of scientific technical terms defining high frequency as federal communications commission designation for the band from to megahertz in the radio spectrum webster seventh new collegiate dictionary defining high frequency as to megacycles 
the patent written description supports the district court conclusion that high frequency in the claim term high frequency carrier refers to a frequency in the range of mhz.the written description should be examined in every case to determine if the presumption of ordinary and customary meaning is rebutted,at citing renishaw plc marposs societa per azioni.the presumption will be rebutted where the patentee,acting as his or her own lexicographer,has clearly set forth a definition of a claim term that is different from the term ordinary and customary meaning.id.at citing in re paulsen,intellicall,phonometrics.it also will be rebutted if the inventor has disavowed or disclaimed scope of coverage,by using words or expressions of manifest exclusion or restriction,representing a clear disavowal of claim scope.id.citing teleflex,at.
the district court noted that the specification of the patent does not define high frequency in a way that is at variance with the ordinary meaning of mhz.summary judgment order at.the court stated that the specification does not clearly imply or express a special definition for the term high frequency.id.at.we agree.nowhere in the specification does the patentee,acting as his or her own lexicographer,clearly set forth a definition of high frequency different from its ordinary and customary meaning.if anything,the specification of the patent supports the ordinary meaning of high frequency as being mhz.it does so because it provides a definition for very high frequency,or vhf,as mhz.patent,ll.stating that c ommonly the range of frequencies employed extends throughout the vhf spectrum,for example,from about mhz emphasis added.under these circumstances,we conclude that since the patentee defined a range for vhf,it certainly could have defined a range for high frequency and that,since it did not,high frequency should be given its ordinary and customary meaning of mhz.
we have noted that,like the specification,the prosecution history may demonstrate that the patentee intended to deviate from a term ordinary and accustomed meaning,if it shows that the patentee characterized the invention using words or expressions of manifest exclusion or restriction before the united states patent and trademark office.teleflex,at.the prosecution history limits the interpretation of claims so as to exclude any interpretation that may have been disclaimed or disavowed during prosecution in order to obtain claim allowance.id.in this case,however,nothing in the prosecution history demonstrates that the patentee intended to deviate from the term high frequency s ordinary and accustomed meaning of mhz.
lastly,ipd argues that the following language in claim supports its construction that high frequency also includes frequencies in the vhf range conventional television receivers at the subscriber stations responsive to receive said high frequency carrier modulated with video broadcast signals.patent,ll.emphasis added.ipd relies on judge sotomayor earlier claim construction ruling in support of this argument.judge sotomayor stated that the use of the phrase conventional television receivers in connection with high frequency transmission would have meant to a person skilled in the art that the inventor was referring to a vhf system operating in at least a range of to mhz.claim construction ruling at.judge sotomayor reached this conclusion by noting that a person skilled in the art in the united states would have understood a reference to a conventional television receiver in the claim to mean a vhf television receiver.id.at.we do not agree.in our view,the ordinary meaning of high frequency helps define the term conventional television receivers,not the inverse.that is so because claim refers to conventional television receivers at the subscriber stations responsive to receive said high frequency carrier.patent,ll.emphasis added.the quoted language establishes that conventional television receivers are properly read as a subset of all television receivers,those responsive to a high frequency signal.
in sum,we hold that the district court correctly construed high frequency as including only any frequency between mhz.because we agree with the district court construction of the term high frequency carrier,we affirm the court grant of summary judgment of in favor of cablevision.the accused systems operate in the vhf range,in the mhz range,and thus fall outside the literal scope of the patent 
ipd also appeals from the district court grant of summary judgment of invalidity.even though we conclude that the patent is not infringed,we still must review the district court holding that the patent is invalid.in cardinal chemical morton international,d,the supreme court noted that t hough the decision of disposes of the bill and answer,it does not dispose of the counterclaim which raises the question of validity.id.at.citation omitted.thus,our affirmance of the district court judgment of does not moot the district court ruling on cablevision counterclaim for a declaratory judgment of invalidity.id.at.if we do not address the ruling on validity,we deprive ipd of the appellate review that is a component of the one full and fair opportunity to have the validity issue adjudicated correctly.id.at.
the district court held claim to be invalid under,paragraph.summary judgment order at.the court concluded that the patent failure to disclose a structure clearly linked to the light beam demodulation means rendered claim indefinite.id.at.the court also determined that the common optical fibre limitation in claim was indefinite.id.at.
section states,inter alia the specification shall conclude with one or more claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject matter which the applicant regards as his invention.a determination that a patent claim is invalid for failure to meet the definiteness requirement of,paragraph,is a legal conclusion that is drawn from the court performance of its duty as the construer of patent claims,and therefore,like claim construction,is a question of law that we review de novo.atmel info.storage devices,emphasis in original.
light beam demodulation means 
claim recites,inter alia light beam demodulation means at said reception position responsive to said detector means to convert said light beam into demodulated high frequency carrier radio wave signals modulated with video broadcast signals patent,ll.emphases added.as the district court pointed out,the parties do not dispute,and it is clear from the specification,that the detector means is linked to the detector described in the specification and shown in the drawings of the patent for example,structure in figure of the patent.summary judgment order at.the court noted,however,that the parties disputed whether the specification discloses a structure associated with the light beam demodulation means.id.at.it observed that the specification contains no language that clearly links a structure to the light beam demodulation means.id.the court concluded that the patentee was required to disclose with particularity the structure corresponding to the light beam demodulation means.id.at.the court also concluded that since the claim language requires that the detector means and the light beam demodulation means be responsive to each other,they could not,as urged by ipd,be contained in the same structure,the detector.id.at.otherwise,according to the court,the words responsive to would be read out of the claim.id.the court observed that while two limitations hypothetically could read on the same structure,such was not the case here,as no language in the specification clearly linked the detector to the light beam demodulation means.id.accordingly,it held that the patent failure to disclose a structure clearly linked to the light beam demodulation means rendered claim indefinite.id.
ipd argues that the district court erred in finding that the patent fails to disclose a structure that is clearly linked to the light beam demodulation means.it asserts that the specification does disclose such a structure,the detector.moreover,ipd argues that one claim limitation,light beam demodulation means can be responsive to another,detector means even if the two limitations exist in a single common structure.for its part,cablevision contends that the specification of the patent fails to clearly link or associate any structure with the function of light beam demodulation,thereby rendering the claim indefinite.cablevision asserts that even assuming ipd is correct,its construction nonetheless renders the claim indefinite because ipd construction would read responsive to out of the claim.
the determination of whether a claim is invalid as indefinite depends on whether those skilled in the art would understand the scope of the claim when the claim is read in light of the specification.see am.vaccine,am.cyanamid,citation omitted.the limitation at issue here is written in format pursuant to,paragraph,which provides 
an element in a claim for a combination may be expressed as a means or step for performing a specified function without the recital of structure,material,or acts in support thereof,and such claim shall be construed to cover the corresponding structure,material,or acts described in the specification and equivalents thereof.
in construing claim limitations,a court must first define the particular function claimed.sage,devon.then,the court must identify the corresponding structure,material,or acts described in the specification,see sage,at.
whether a patent adequately sets forth structure corresponding to a claimed function necessitates consideration of the disclosure of the specification from the viewpoint of one skilled in the art.see budde,citing,am.cyanamid,at.failure to disclose adequate structure corresponding to the recited function in accordance with,paragraph,results in th
