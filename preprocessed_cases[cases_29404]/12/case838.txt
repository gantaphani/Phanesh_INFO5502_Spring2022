the association of communications enterprises appeals from an order of the federal communications commission approving the transfer of commission licenses from ameritech to sbc communications in connection with the merger of the two companies.the order allows the merged company to avoid statutory resale obligations on certain advanced telecommunications services by providing those services through a subsidiary.we vacate.
as all observers of the american telecommunications system are well aware,when a consent decree dismantled the bell monopoly over many telecommunications services,the bell system local exchange operations were severed from its other operations and split geographically among seven regional bell operating companies rbocs.ameritech and sbc were both rbocs and provided various states with local exchange and exchange access services,which depend critically on maintenance and operation of the local loop,the physical infrastructure by which telephone service is provided.because the local loop is a natural monopoly,control over it allowed the bell system,and then rbocs,to control telecommunications access to most homes and businesses.
today the telecommunications act of governs the obligations of telecommunications carriers such as ameritech and sbc the act imposes on carriers certain duties intended to open telecommunications markets to competition.the act strictest obligations are levied on incumbent local exchange carriers ilecs,which are those local exchange carriers lecs that were providing a given area with monopoly or telephone exchange service on the act enactment date,as well as their successor and assigns.
ilecs are subject to stringent duties.of particular relevance to this appeal is the act ilec resale obligation,c,which requires ilecs to offer for resale at wholesale rates any telecommunications service that the carrier provides at retail to subscribers who are not telecommunications carriers.section c also requires ilecs to negotiate in good faith,to provide interconnection with other telecommunications carriers,to provide unbundled access to network elements where technologically feasible,and to allow physical collocation of equipment necessary for interconnection or access to unbundled network elements.
for some time,various ilecs have argued that ilecs c resale obligations should not extend to their provision of advanced services because ilecs do not exercise market power over those services.the act defines advanced services,regardless of transmission medium or technology,as,switched,broadband telecommunications capability that enables users to originate and receive voice,data,graphics,and video telecommunications using any technology.ilecs contended before the commission both that ilecs are not subject to c in their provision of advanced services and that,even if c does apply to ilec advanced services,the commission should simply forbear from applying it.the commission rejected both arguments.the commission determined that advanced services are telecommunications services like any others and may not be provided by an ilec unless the ilec complies with c it also determined that it lacked authority to forbear from applying c to advanced services.it concluded that exempting advanced services from c obligations is at odds with the technology neutral goals of the act and with congress aim to encourage competition in all telecommunications markets.emphasis added.
in ameritech and sbc proposed a merger that would make ameritech a wholly owned subsidiary of sbc.the merging companies filed a joint application requesting commission approval to transfer control to sbc of licenses and lines owned and controlled by ameritech.the commission determined that this application compelled it to consider whether the merger as a just the transfer of individual consistent with the act.appellant association of communications enterprises ascent a national trade association representing telecommunications providers and resellers,opposed the application.ascent alleged that the merger of two of the largest ilecs would hinder competition and urged that certain conditions be imposed on the merged company,after which ameritech and sbc supplemented their application to include a package of voluntary commitments.
the commission approved the merger and permitted the new company to offer advanced services through a separate affiliate and,by doing so,avoid c duties although the act extends an ilec obligations,including the requirement that an ilec sell its telecommunications services to a reseller at wholesale prices,to an ilec successor or assign,the commission adopted a presumption that the advanced services affiliate is not such a successor or assign so long as it complies with various structural and transactional safeguards these include independent operations,separate officers,directors,employees,books,records,and accounts,and transactions with conducted on an arm length basis.it is important to note that although this case arises out of a merger proceeding,the commission order has a broader application.any ilec would be entitled,according to the commission logic,to set up a similar affiliate and thereby avoid c resale obligations.
appellant primary argument is that the commission order is simply a device to accomplish indirectly what the statute clearly forbids the commission exercise of forbearance authority over an ilec provision of advanced services.under the order ilecs can circumvent c requirement that they offer advanced services at wholesale prices by merely creating a a subsidiary that must operate somewhat separately from the ilec.and according to appellant,congress manifested a clear intent that the commission not forbear from regulating any ilec telecommunications services,including advanced services,unless certain market conditions are met.intervenor trains its fire on the commission interpretation of the phrase successor or assign,claiming that its construction of those terms is inconsistent with a number of cases in which those terms are defined as used in other statutes.the commission insists that it is not actually utilizing its forbearance authority and that the phrase successor or assign is sufficiently ambiguous so that under chevron natural resources defense council,d,we are obliged to defer to the commission interpretation.as should be obvious,these arguments are quite interrelated.for even if we conclude that the commission has not formally used its forbearance authority and that the phrase successor or assign is ambiguous,the meaning of the statute,as revealed by its structure,may render the commission successor or assign construction unreasonable.
section of the act provides in relevant part 
t he commission shall forbear from applying any regulation or any provision of this chapter to a telecommunications carrier or telecommunications service,or class of telecommunications carriers or telecommunications services,in any or some of its or their geographic markets,if the commission determines that 
enforcement of such regulation or provision is not necessary to ensure that the charges,practices,classifications,or regulations by,for,or in connection with that telecommunications carrier or telecommunications service are just and reasonable and are not unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory 
enforcement of such regulation or provision is not necessary for the protection of consumers and 
forbearance from applying such provision or regulation is consistent with the public interest.
a.but the commission may not forbear from applying the requirements of section c until it determines that those requirements have been fully implemented.d.because those requirements have not been fully implemented here,the fcc as it concedes may not forbear 
appellant argues that the merger order is the legal and practical equivalent of forbearance.in other words,to apply c as narrowly as the commission has done is akin to forbearing from regulating.the commission insists that it is not actually forbearing but rather interpreting c not to apply to this affiliate structure.in other words,the definition of ilec in h does not explicitly mention a
