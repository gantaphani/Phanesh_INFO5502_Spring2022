this case presents issues of first impression concerning the relationship between various washington municipalities and a major telecommunications provider,qwest corporation.we are called upon to decide whether an ambiguous tariff filed with the state utilities commission trumps the common law and statutory rule that the utility company,rather than the municipality,bears the expense for a facility relocation made necessary by improvements,and whether state law and the federal telecommunications act of preempt certain city ordinances that establish a franchise system to manage telecommunications facilities in.we conclude that the tariff does not require the municipalities to shoulder the relocation costs,and that the ordinances are preempted.

the district court granted summary judgment to the cities on the relocation costs claim,and dismissed as unripe qwest counterclaim challenging the franchise ordinances.both the counterclaim cities and qwest appealed.these consolidated appeals involve two distinct costs and the preemption of city we discuss separately.
discussion 
relocation costs 
under washington common and statutory law,when city street improvements require the displacement of telecommunications equipment located in the city,the utility company bears the expense of relocating the equipment this has been the rule in washington since before statehood.on february,qwest then u s west,notified cities and counties in western washington that it would no longer bear these relocation costs.in support of its announcement,qwest took the position that its tariff of rates and services,filed with the washington utilities and transportation commission wutc in and adopted without objection in,shifted the payment burden to the cities.that tariff,wn,has been revised and amended over the years the current version reads in relevant part 
when relocation or aerial to underground conversion of existing facilities is requested or required by law,the cost of constructing the new and removing the old facilities will be borne by the customer or others requesting the relocation or conversion.
relying on this language,qwest refused to relocate or pay for relocation of its facilities to accommodate street improvement or relocation.this resulted,in at least one instance,in a telephone pole standing in the middle of a road.later,qwest agreed to relocate its equipment,but notified the cities of its intent to seek reimbursement for related costs.
after this appeal was filed and partially briefed,the washington legislature passed major telecommunications legislation,entitled,an act relating to the use of city or town rights of way by telecommunications and cable television providers.engrossed substitute senate bill essb.the parties agree that essb,codified at.code rcw et,supersedes qwest tariff and prospectively imposes the cost of relocating telecommunications facilities in city streets on the utility company therefore,the question before us is limited to who bears the costs of relocation prior to the effective date of the new statute.we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment.weiner san diego county,cir.
statutory and common law background 
we begin with the which both parties under washington common law,the utility must pay the cost of relocation if required by public necessity.this stems from the conditional nature of a utility right to have facilities in the public.when the government allows a telecommunications company to place facilities in that,the facilities presence is contingent on the company cooperation with maintenance and improvement of the street.mcquillin,municipal corporations ed it is generally held that the municipality may require a change in the location of pipes or other underground facilities of the grantee of a franchise,where public convenience or security require it.this general rule is followed in virtually every jurisdiction,id.at noting that only arkansas is in conflict,and has been embodied in washington common and statutory law since before statehood in.
the statutory rule can be traced to the old federal post roads act,which required telegraph companies to maintain their lines so as not to obstruct or interfere with the ordinary travel on such military or post roads.stats,stat.the territorial legislature similarly provided that the right to construct telegraph lines was subject to the requirement that such lines not unnecessarily obstruct.laws,approved january.
this rule continued to apply after statehood.although the washington constitution recognized the right of telecommunications companies to construct and maintain facilities,it specifically authorized the legislature to adopt reasonable regulations relating to those facilities.const.art.xii.indeed,the state legislature in its first session adopted a statute allowing telecommunications companies to construct facilities in in such manner and at such points as not to incommode the public use of the highway.laws now codified at rcw.
the as not to incommode the public use language of has been interpreted by the washington supreme court to allow a city to require the utility company to pay for relocation costs when a public street is improved or altered.city of seattle union,city of edmonds.the washington supreme court has continued to hold that any right accorded to a utility company to maintain structures in public streets is subject to the state police power,and the company must bear the expense of changes required by public convenience and necessity unless otherwise agreed.see.natural gas city of seattle,at.
today,the classic statement of the rule in washington is that public utility companies operating under a franchise must bear the cost of removing and of relocating their facilities,as it is made necessary by highway improvements,at.this rule may be changed by contract between the utility and a municipality so that relocation expenses are borne by the municipality,or may be changed by statute so that relocation expenses in certain cases are borne by the state,or the municipality.city of bothell,quoting mcquillin a.
evolution of qwest tariff 
qwest argues that this rule was changed by tariff wn,originally filed by qwest in and adopted by the wutc in.the original tariff read,in relevant part 
i f the company is requested to relocate its facilities underground,or if the company is required by law to relocate its facilities underground,the cost of such relocating construction shall be borne by the owners of the real property served or by others requesting such relocation construction.
pacific northwest bell telephone.rules and regulations 
the current language,first adopted in than twenty years 
when relocation or aerial to underground conversion of existing facilities is requested or required by law,the cost of constructing the new and removing the old facilities will be borne by the customer or others requesting the relocation or conversion.
the difference between the two versions is significant the original tariff is directed solely at undergrounding that is,locating utility facilities underground,which has been encouraged in recent decades for aesthetic and safety reasons.tariff wn,however,has a different scope it is not restricted to undergrounding,but purports to apply to all relocation.this broader language first appears in nothing in the record explains the purpose or intent of the change,and qwest acknowledges that it first invoked the tariff to demand relocation costs in its letter to the cities.
the question,then,is whether qwest current tariff altered its common law and statutory obligation to foot the bill for relocation costs.qwest takes the position that the tariff language stating that relocation costs will be borne by the customers or others requesting the relocation or conversion includes the cities within the term others.qwest further argues that this tariff is equivalent to statutory law,and therefore alters the prior rule.
it is true that a tariff properly filed and authorized by law can alter the common law,at least between a utility and its customers.in moore pac.northwest bell,the washington court of appeals noted that t hese tariff schedules have the force of law and bind telephone customers.in allen,the court of appeals concluded that a tariff limiting the telephone company liability for misprinting a directory becomes a part of the law of this state.
it is well settled,however,that tariffs are read to be consistent with preexisting statutory law,and can not repeal or supersede a statute.see people org.for washington energy res.washington util.and transp.comm n,tariff may not set terms that conflict with statute union ins.puget sound power light,holding that a tariff that purported to absolve utility from liability was ambiguous,and should not be interpreted in conflict with statutes.in this case,rcw authorized the city to require the utility to pay relocation costs.qwest tariff can not,by itself,nullify that statute.this is especially true where,as here,the tariff is ambiguous.
general telephone bothell,the case that qwest views as dispositive,does not hold otherwise.bothell involved a city ordinance that purported to exempt a city from the provisions of a utility tariff relating to undergrounding.in,the wutc adopted wac,providing that e ach telephone utility shall set forth in its tariff its conditions for providing underground facilities.in,pursuant to that regulation,general telephone filed a tariff passing the costs to the owners of real property served along the route of the constructed facility or to others requesting such relocation construction.bothell,at.bothell,in and,enacted ordinances requiring the utility company to pay for undergrounding of aerial is,purporting to supersede the statewide tariff authorized by the regulation.general telephone challenged the validity of the ordinances and argued that the tariff required bothell,not general telephone,to pay for undergrounding.the washington supreme court first recognized that the tariff in that case was the law of the state before bothell passed its ordinances.bothell,at.stating that a city may not usurp the functions of the state public service commission,bothell held that the city ordinances were invalid where they conflicted with the tariff.id.
qwest argues that bothell statement that t ariffs enacted pursuant to such wutc regulation have the force of state law and are preemptive authority over subsequently enacted city ordinances,at,requires us to hold that qwest tariff supersedes or preempts statutory law.bothell does no such thing.first,the tariff in bothell was adopted pursuant to a specific administrative code provision directing the utility to include undergrounding costs in its tariff.unlike relocation costs,neither washington common law nor rcw encompassed allocation of undergrounding costs.bothell did not involve the tension between the unambiguous common law later codified and an ambiguous tariff.second,the bothell opinion makes perfect sense when viewed in would be absurd for a city to be able,by ordinance,to exempt itself from a prior tariff that was validly enacted and authorized by regulation.but that is not the case here,where the tariff at issue was not required by regulation,and where the cities do not seek,by ordinance,to avoid compliance with a tariff.
because it is well settled that a tariff can not repeal a statute,we need not reach the question whether qwest tariff has the force of law or whether the tariff does in fact purport to change the prior rule we hold that qwest tariff did not alter the and unbroken rule established at common law and in rcw that the utility company must pay relocation costs.
ii.preemption of the cities ordinances 
the next issue that confronts us is the question of state and federal preemption of local ordinances regulating telecommunications.
we begin with the telecommunications act of the act or the telecom act,stat,which was passed to promote competition among and reduce regulation of telecommunications providers to this end,the act prohibits state and local governments from creating barriers to entry,legal requirements that prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting a company from providing telecommunication service.supp.iv.section begins with a broad prohibition against state and local regulation,followed by certain narrow exceptions that leave a safe harbor for limited local regulation.one of these safe harbors,established by c,allows a local government to manage and collect fees for the use of public by telecommunication providers.
after the passage of the act,the counterclaim cities auburn,olympia,tacoma,des moines,and university place passed ordinances that govern the use of public by telecommunications companies by requiring companies to obtain a franchise,or permit.these ordinances are not identical,but are substantially similar.under each ordinance,any telecommunications service provider that wishes to operate in the city must apply to the city for a franchise.only franchised telecommunications companies may obtain permits to install facilities in public.franchised companies are subject to extensive cost reporting obligations and controls over such matters as changes of stock ownership.the ordinances also require the company to provide excess capacity,and to offer services to the city at rates.three of the counterclaim cities charge a fee of between and to apply for a franchise.each city reserves the right to grant,deny,or revoke a franchise for unnamed criteria,and in the discretion of the city.finally,the ordinances provide that a city may remove the facilities of a company operating without a franchise,and a company operating without a franchise is subject to civil and criminal penalties.
qwest counterclaim seeks a declaratory judgment that the counterclaim cities ordinances are preempted by state law and by the telecom act.
the district court dismissed qwest counterclaim as unripe,primarily on the grounds that the analysis would be better conducted following specific attempts by the counterclaim cities to enforce their telecommunications ordinances.auburn u s west,d.we review de novo the district court dismissal of the counterclaim for lack of ripeness.natural res.def.council houston,cir.
the basic rationale of the ripeness requirement is t o prevent the courts,through avoidance of premature adjudication,from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements.abbott lab.gardner,d,abrogated on other grounds by califano sanders,d.to determine whether qwest counterclaim is ripe for review,we evaluate whether the issues are fit for judicial decision,and whether the parties will suffer hardship if we decline to consider the issues.san diego county gun rights comm.reno,cir citing abbott,at.
the ripeness inquiry has a constitutional component rooted in the case or controversy requirement of article iii,and a prudential component that focuses on whether the record is adequate to ensure effective review.see thomas anchorage equal rights comm n,cir en banc.we address the constitutional component first,as it is jurisdictional,then proceed to the prudential inquiry required by abbott laboratories.
constitutional component 
we may not hear a case unless there exist s a constitutional case or controversy,that the issues presented are definite and concrete,not hypothetical or abstract.thomas,at quoting railway mail ass corsi.this tenet of ripeness requires us to consider whether the plaintiffs face a realistic danger of sustaining a direct injury as a result of the statute operation or enforcement,or,by contrast,if the alleged injury is too imaginary or speculative to support jurisdiction.babbitt united farm workers union,d.we have little trouble concluding that this case satisfies the case or controversy requirement,and therefore the constitutional component of ripeness.
the case before us is remarkably similar to abbott laboratories and its companion cases,decided the same day.there,the supreme court held,the very promulgation of a law may itself affect a party enough to satisfy the constitutional requirement t here is no question in the present case that petitioners have sufficient standing as plaintiffs the regulation is directed at them in particular it requires them to make significant changes in their everyday business practices if they fail to observe the commissioner rule they are quite clearly exposed to the imposition of strong sanctions.abbott,at.if p romulgation of the challenged regulations present s plaintiffs with the immediate dilemma to choose between complying with newly imposed,disadvantageous restrictions and risking serious penalties for violation,the controversy is ripe.reno catholic soc,d construing abbott lab.this is particularly true when the regulations are burdensome and immediate.gardner toilet goods ass n.noting the immediate severity of the regulations impact upon the plaintiffs id.at.i t is quite clear that if respondents,failing judicial review at this stage,elect to comply with the regulations and await ultimate judicial determination of the validity of them in subsequent litigation,the amount of preliminary paper work,scientific testing,and recordkeeping will be substantial.
qwest faces exactly this conundrum.as in abbott laboratories,the ordinances have a direct effect on the business of telecommunications companies.there can be no question that qwest is violating the owns and maintains facilities in the cities,and neither possesses nor has applied for a franchise.this is not a case like thomas,where we held that a landlord intent to violate a law was not enough.as we explained in thomas,a lthough we do not always require plaintiffs to await arrest or prosecution before entertaining a challenge to the constitutionality of a statute the threat of enforcement must be at least credible,not simply imaginary or speculative.thomas,at citation omitted.see also san diego,at distinguishing hypothetical violation from situation where party has previously engaged in and would continue to engage in acts regulated under the challenged legislation and where prosecution is under agency control.only an by the counterclaim cities would save qwest from civil or criminal penalties.nothing about this situation makes qwest dilemma any less severe than that faced by abbott laboratories.nor is qwest dilemma speculative or conjectural.abbott laboratories does not require damocles sword to fall before we recognize the realistic danger of sustaining a direct injury that is the heart of the constitutional component of ripeness.babbitt,at.
in sum,the enactment of these regulations puts qwest in a dilemma that it was the very purpose of the declaratory judgment act to ameliorate.abbott,at.the decision to comply will surely be costly,and t he alternative to compliance may be even more costly.that course would risk serious criminal and civil penalties.id.at.this hobson choice suggests the ripeness of the issue for review 
fitness of the issues for judicial decision 
under the test laid out in abbott laboratories,we must examine the fitness of the issues for review.if a controversy is essentially legal in nature,oil gas ass sonoma county,cir,it is fit for judicial decision.this is the case when no further factual amplification is necessary.see also abbott,at.issue was ripe where parties agreed that it was purely legal.
qwest counterclaim presents a pure question of law are the counterclaim cities ordinances preempted by state or federal law see industrial truck ass henry,cir stating that preemption is a matter of law.no further factual record would narrow or clarify that issue.as in abbott laboratories,there is no factual dispute about the activity conducted by qwest,nor the applicability of the ordinances to its activity.therefore,the controversy is essentially legal in nature.
although we ordinarily do not consider an issue not passed upon below,the decision to resolve a question for the first time on appeal is one left primarily to the discretion of the courts of appeals.singleton wulff,d.i t is sometimes appropriate for an appellate court to pass on issues of law that the trial court did not consider.bibeau pacific northwest research foundation,cir.
in this case,we are faced with pure issues of law that were briefed extensively before the district court and again before the court of appeals.as such,there is a solid basis on which to consider the merits of the counterclaim.
hardship to the parties 
for the second,or hardship,prong of abbott laboratories to favor the party seeking relief,p ostponing review must impose a hardship on the complaining party that is immediate.anchorage united states,cir.qwest contends that the hardship in this case is the costly and cumbersome requirement to apply for and comply with a franchise,as the failure to do so exposes it to civil and criminal penalties.we agree that the franchise ordinances impose multiple obligations upon qwest.for example,qwest is required to pay an application fee of up to file an application containing detailed information unrelated to the negotiate certain terms of the franchise with the cities undergo extensive reporting and approval processes for transfers of ownership,including stock provide excess capacity and offer the cities favorable rates.were we to decline to hear the case on grounds of ripeness,qwest would be forced to obtain a franchise and then return to court to argue that state and federal laws preempt the city the same argument that it makes here.this was precisely the situation in abbott laboratories,which the supreme court found ripe for review where the legal issue presented is fit for judicial resolution,and where a regulation requires an immediate and significant change in the plaintiffs conduct of their affairs with serious penalties attached to noncompliance,the case is justiciable.at.
having determined that this case is ripe,we proceed to consider the preemption claims on the merits.
preemption by state law 
qwest argues that the local ordinances are preempted by state law,and further contends that it is exempted from any municipal franchise requirement by virtue of its statewide constitutional franchise the counterclaim cities counter that washington public utility laws do not preempt their management of municipal.
const.art.xi,requires that a local law yield to a state statute on the same subject matter if that statute preempts the field,leaving no room for concurrent jurisdiction,or if a conflict exists such that the two can not be harmonized.brown city of yakima.see also employco personnel,city of seattle,invalidating ordinance conflicting with state law.
four days after qwest filed its opening brief in this case,the washington legislature enacted essb,codified at rcw et.that law significantly altered the ability of municipalities to regulate telecommunications utilities,especially wireline facilities of those who hold statewide grants or franchises.
the new law establishes a system by which cities may grant master permits,or franchises,to telecommunications companies.the scope of the master permits is described in some detail,and limited in several ways.importantly,essb excludes from its scope a service provider asserting an existing grant based on a predecessor telephone or telegraph company existence at the time of the adoption of the washington constitution to occupy the right of way.rcw defining master permit emphasis added see also rcw a city or town may request,but not require,that a service provider with an existing grant to occupy the right of way obtain a master permit,franchise for wireline facilities.in addition,essb bars municipalities from adopting franchise systems that regulate the services or business operations of the service provider,except where otherwise authorized in state or federal law.rcw a.each of these provisions affects the present case.
first,as noted above,essb specifically exempts companies asserting a grant from any requirement to obtain a municipal franchise for wireline facilities.at oral argument,both parties agreed that qwest asserts such a grant.because essb exempts a company asserting a statewide constitutional grant from municipal franchises,the relief sought in qwest far as it deals with wireline been granted by statute.
the ordinances regulation of qwest wireline facilities clearly conflicts with rcw and.we therefore hold that essb preempts the franchise ordinances insofar as they purport to require a telecommunications company asserting a statewide constitutional grant to obtain a franchise for its wireline facilities 
having addressed wireline facilities,we are still faced with the issue of preemption with respect to wireless facilities.the remainder of the state and municipal franchise scheme is not so simple to resolve,in part because of the recent nature of essb.the new law prohibition on ordinances that regulate the services or business operations of the service provider,rcw a,could be interpreted to preempt ordinances that,for instance,require excess capacity or control stock transfers.in addition,some provisions of the ordinances might be preempted by state statutes regulating in the same subject area further,the new law incorporates certain requirements of the telecom act by limiting the authority of cities and towns to regulate the placement of facilities if the regulation v iolate s section of the telecommunications act of.rcw c.any analysis of state preemption,then,requires us to look to federal law.
for these reasons,we decline to interpret as a matter of first impression the interplay between prior state laws and essb,as applied to the counterclaim cities ordinances regulating qwest wireless facilities.no washington court has published an opinion involving any aspect of the new law neither the wutc nor the washington state attorney general has published any guidance as to its meaning or scope.because we believe that a state court is better equipped to first interpret essb and its relationship with other state laws,and because the federal preemption issue is placed squarely before us by the new state law,we choose not to resolve the issue of whether other aspects of washington state law preempts the ordinances regulation of wireless facilities.
preemption by federal law 
qwest also argues that the telecom act preempts the ordinances,a claim that the district court dismissed as unripe.the question before the district court and on appeal is whether,on the facts alleged,qwest is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see enron oil trading transp.walbrook ins,cir.we conclude that it is.
the supremacy clause,const.art.vi,cl,invalidates state laws that interfere with,or are contrary to,federal law.gibbons ogden,wheat.within constitutional limits,congress is empowered to preempt state law in several ways,including by expressly stating its intention to do so.jones rath packing,d.in this case,there can be no doubt that the act preempts expressly it states that n o state or local statute or regulation,or other state or local legal requirement,may prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the ability of any entity to provide any interstate or intrastate telecommunications service.a.the question for the court,then,is whether the ordinances interfere with,or are contrary to the act.hillsborough county automated med,d.
section a regulations prohibiting or having the effect of prohibiting service 
section a bars all state and local regulations that prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting any company ability to provide telecommunications services unless the regulations fall within the statute safe harbor provisions of which only c,related to local regulation of,is relevant here.the preemption is virtually absolute and its purpose is aspects of telecommunications regulation are uniquely the province of the federal government and congress has narrowly circumscribed the role of state and local governments in this arena.municipalities therefore have a very limited and proscribed role in the regulation of telecommunications.at t communications city of dallas,d.
section a preempts regulations that not only prohibit outright the ability of any entity to provide telecommunications services,but also those that may have the effect of prohibiting the provision of such services.bell atl.prince george county,d,vacated and remanded on other grounds,cir.a number of courts have held that certain requirements imposed by local ordinances constitute a prohibition within the meaning of a.for example,an onerous application process,bell,d at a ny process for entry that imposes burdensome requirements on telecommunications companies and vests significant discretion in local governmental decisionmakers to grant or deny permission to use the public may have the effect of prohibiting the provision of telecommunications services in violation of the act.a requirement to obtain a franchise,see at t communications city of dallas,d,a representation by the city that without a new franchise at t may not offer services is sufficient proof of the requisite prohibitive effect that triggers the preemptive force of a,vacated and remanded on other grounds,cir threat of penalties for failure to obtain a franchise,at t communications city of austin,the threat of criminal sanctions and fines for the failure of an entity to obtain municipal consent can indubitably only be described as a prohibition.or a combination of these factors,tcg new york,city of white plains,d regulations coupled with long approval process are a prohibition,may constitute a prohibitive effect.taken together,these cases persuasively indicate that a regulatory structure that allows a city to bar a telecommunications provider from operating in the city prohibit s or ha s the effect of prohibiting the company ability to provide telecommunications services under a.
the ordinances at issue in the present case include several features that,in combination,have the effect of prohibiting the provision of telecommunications services.in order to obtain a franchise,telecommunications companies must submit a lengthy and detailed application form,including maps,corporate policies,documentation of licenses,certain specified items,and s uch other and further information as may be requested by the city.auburn mun.code j.after application,two of the cities auburn and olympia require a public hearing before granting or revoking a franchise.each of the franchise systems authorizes the cities to consider discretionary factors that have nothing to do with the management or use of the.the ordinances all regulate transferability of ownership,even requiring franchises to report to stock sales.some fees charged under the franchise agreements are not based on the costs of maintaining the right of way,as required under the telecom act and,the ultimate cudgel is that each city reserves discretion to grant,deny,or revoke the franchises and the cities may revoke the franchise if the terms in the ordinance are not followed,even allowing the cities to remove the company facilities.civil and criminal penalties are authorized as well.
taken together,these requirements have the effect of prohibiting qwest and other companies from providing telecommunications services,see city of dallas,d at,and create a substantial and unlawful barrier to entry into and participation in the counterclaim cities telecommunications markets.nearly identical city or county franchise structures have been found to constitute prohibitions under a.see,bell,d at city of dallas,d at bellsouth telecommunications city of coral springs,d 
section c management of public 
of course,a franchise requirement per se is not preempted by the telecom act.only regulations that do not fall within a safe harbor provision,such as c,are preempted.as noted above,c permits local regulations that manage the public and require fair and reasonable compensation for the use thereof.the counterclaim cities argue that each of the contested ordinances has a specific purpose that is related to the cities ability to evaluate,permit,and manage telecommunications facilities in the.
the telecom act does not define manage ment of the public,but we are not completely without guidance.a number of federal courts have relied upon the federal communications commission fcc,the agency charged with interpreting and enforcing the act,for interpretive assistance.see,tcg new york,d at peco township of haverford,wl,bellsouth telecommunications town of palm beach,d,city of coral springs,d at bell,d at city of dallas,d at.as the fcc has explained,management means control over the itself,not control over companies with facilities in the 
s ection c preserves the authority of state and local governments to manage public.local governments must be allowed to perform the range of vital tasks necessary to preserve the physical integrity of streets and highways,to control the orderly flow of vehicles and pedestrians,to manage gas,water,cable both electric and cable television,and telephone facilities that crisscross the streets and public t he types of activities that fall within the sphere of appropriate management include coordination of construction schedules,determination of insurance,bonding and indemnity requirements,establishment and enforcement of building codes,and keeping track of the various systems using the to prevent interference between them.
in re tci cablevision of oakland county.the fcc,in turn,has looked to the legislative history for additional examples of management.senator dianne feinstein,during the floor debate on c,offered examples of the types of restrictions that congress intended to permit under section c,including requirements that 
regulate the time or location of excavation to preserve effective traffic flow,prevent hazardous road conditions,or minimize notice impacts require a company to place its facilities underground,rather than overhead,consistent with the requirements imposed on other utility companies require a company to pay fees to recover an appropriate share of the increased street repair and paving costs that result from repeated excavation enforce local zoning regulations and require a company to indemnify the city against any claims of injury arising from the company excavation.

applying these guidelines,coupled with common sense,it is apparent that the ordinances establish franchise systems that regulate the telecommunications companies themselves,not merely the.we focus on four significant features of the ordinances that violate c.
first,the ordinances require qwest to undergo an extensive application process that is not directly related to management of the public.as described above,companies must submit a lengthy and detailed application form.auburn mun.code j.this application includes data gathered by the cities in order to determine the financial soundness,technical qualifications,and legal ability to provide telecommunications services a description of all services provided currently or in the future and unnamed discretionary factors that may have nothing to do with the management or use of the 
regulations requiring the applicant to submit proof of its financial,technical,and legal qualifications do not regulate the public.town of palm beach,d at.see also city of dallas,d at dallas also does not have the power to require a comprehensive application and consider such factors as the company technical and organizational qualifications to offer telecommunications services.city of coral springs,d at financial,technical and legal qualifications tcg new york,d at.in addition,a description of telecommunications services to be provided does not directly relate to management of the.see city of coral springs,d at t he city does not have the authority to request information regarding systems,plans,or purposes of the telecommunications facilities.the upshot of the application process is to regulate the provision of telecommunications services rather than to regulate the.
second,the ordinances impose reporting requirements or other controls over matters not directly related to management of the.for example,the ordinances regulate ownership and certain transfers of shares of ownership of telecommunications companies,regardless of whether ownership affects the although the counterclaim cities may wish to have a right to know who owns shares in the telecommunications companies that use the public,the municipal regulation of stock transfers extends far beyond management of the.because these regulations are more than necessary to manage the,they do not fall within the safe harbor of section c.
third,the ordinances require,either through the application process or by other means,that franchise agreements contain certain conditions unrelated to management of the.for example,three of the cities require that franchisees offer is,the best available rates and terms these ordinances bear no relation to management of the,but focus solely on rates,terms and conditions of service.see,tcg new york,d at holding that a clause is more akin to a regulation of rates,terms,and conditions of service unrel
