background 
kay is an amateur and commercial broadcaster who operates commercial radio systems.kay operates transmission facilities throughout southern california.in he purchased a residence located in rancho palos verdes,california.the house had two vertical radio antennae mounted on the roof it has remained unoccupied since.in january,the city sent kay a notice of violation claiming that he was using his rooftop antennae for commercial purposes.kay denied using the rooftop antennae commercially.but,in april,he installed antennae for commercial use inside an upstairs bedroom of the house.then,at some point,kay installed three more vertical antennae on the roof.on august,kay filed an application with the city seeking approval for use of the antennae on the roof.on july,the city notified kay that his five antennae were exempt from regulation because they were intended for amateur use.
on april,the city filed suit against kay in state court,seeking an injunction compelling him to obey the city municipal code and requiring him to obtain approval from the city before using any of his antennae for commercial purposes.on february,the state court entered a permanent injunction in favor of the city.it held that the interior antennae operated on commercial frequencies and that the use of any antenna for commercial purposes without having first obtained city approval,including but not limited to a conditional use permit,was a public nuisance per se.the state court enjoined kay from erecting any new antennae or using his existing antennae for commercial purposes without city approval.this decision was affirmed by the california court of appeal in an unpublished opinion on december.
on june,kay applied to the city for a conditional use permit to allow commercial use of the existing five antennae.in an october,report,city planning staff recommended a conditional grant of his application.at a city planning commission meeting on the same day,the commissioners determined that kay had lied about his past commercial use of the antennae,but took no further action on the application.in a november,report,city planning staff again recommended granting kay application.the report also noted that after the application was filed,more antennae were added to the roof of the house.a draft resolution granting kay application for only the five antennae was proposed.on november,the city planning commission issued a resolution denying commercial use of the rooftop antennae,requiring removal of three of the five antennae,and allowing commercial use of only the internal antennae.
kay appealed to the city council.before his appeal could be heard,a district court decision on another challenge to the city commercial broadcast policies caused the city to amend its antenna regulations on march,city planning staff again recommended that all five antennae be approved for commercial use.finally,on april,the city council approved a resolution granting kay the right to commercially broadcast from only two of the rooftop antennae.this approval was conditioned on,inter alia,kay removal of the other three antennae.
kay filed suit in the united states district court for the central district of california seeking an order that would vacate the city conditional use permit decision and compel it to allow him to broadcast commercially from all five antennae.he invoked both the tca and california state law.he also asserted a number of other claims in the complaint,three of which were dismissed by the district court.kay sought remedies including an injunction,a writ of mandate,damages resulting from the partial denial of the conditional use permit,and attorney fees under b.the district court analyzed the city cup decision and determined that it was not supported by substantial evidence as required by the tca,c b iii,and california law.it issued a writ of mandate requiring that the city permit commercial use of all five of kay antennae.the district court denied damages under both california and federal law.kay appeals the dismissal of three claims,the denial of damages under the tca and state law,and asks that a new judge be assigned on remand.
ii.discussion 
dismissed claims 
kay argues that the district court erred by dismissing three of his claims without prejudice,rather than staying them under younger harris,d abstention by a district court is required under younger when three criteria are satisfied state judicial proceedings are ongoing the proceedings implicate important state interests and the state proceedings provide an adequate opportunity to raise federal questions.commc ns telesys.int l cal.pub.util.comm n,cir.the parties do not dispute the district court determination that younger applies to kay claims.nor do they disagree that w hen damages are at issue,and comity dictates,courts should defer by staying,rather than dismissing,under younger.gilbertson albright,cir en banc.we agree that the district court should have stayed the claims,but conclude that the dismissed claims are now barred as a result of the state proceedings that precipitated the district court abstention.
a federal court must give to a judgment the same preclusive effect as would be given that judgment under the law of the state in which the judgment was rendered.migra warren city sch.dist.bd.of,d.thus,to determine the preclusive effect of the california state court decision,we apply california law.the application of claim preclusion in california focuses on three questions was the previous adjudication on the merits,was it final,and does the current dispute involve the same claim or cause of action robi five platters,cir citing slater blackwood,cal d.in city of rancho palos verdes kay,no,wl,the california court of appeal squarely addressed the merits of the three claims dismissed by the district court it held that neither the city conditional use permit rules nor its antenna ordinance runs afoul of the first amendment or of the california constitution.id.at.the decision is also final.unlike the federal rule and that of several states,in california the rule is that the finality required to invoke the preclusive bar of res judicata is not achieved until an appeal from the trial court judgment has been exhausted or the time to appeal has expired.franklin franklin owners for fair franchising,th,d citation omitted.the california court of appeal issued the remittitur in kay case on march.the issuance of the remittitur indicates that the appellate process,including a potential petition for review to the california supreme court has been thus that the decision has become final.see rare coin galleries,coin,d.discussing remittitur in the context of tolling the statute of limitations.
the first two requirements for claim preclusion are clearly satisfied,leaving the third and final question whether the state case involved the same claim or cause of action.in this vein,california has consistently applied the primary rights theory,under which the invasion of one primary right gives rise to a single cause of action.as we recently observed,california primary rights theory does not mean that different causes of action are involved just because relief may be obtained under either of two legal theories.robi,at citations and quotation omitted.res judicata claim preclusion prevents litigation of all grounds for,or defenses to,recovery that were previously available to the parties,regardless of whether they were asserted or determined in the prior proceeding.id.quoting state bd.of equalization superior court,cal d,emphasis and alteration in original.
the primary right at issue here is kay right to be free of unconstitutional restrictions imposed on his free speech by the city through its regulation of antennae and the conditional use permit process.in rejecting kay claims,the california court of appeal addressed various theories by which the city might be liable for violation of kay first amendment and california constitutional rights.kay alleged violations of those same rights in his federal complaint,thus implicating the same primary right.to the extent that the dismissed causes of action here could be creatively construed to be different from those that were addressed in kay state action,the claims could and should have been raised by kay in that action.thus,we hold that kay is now barred from asserting his three dismissed claims before the federal courts.
damages under california law 
kay submits that the district court erred by holding that he was not entitled to compensatory damages under california law.the district court granted kay only injunctive relief in the form of a peremptory mandate commanding the city to adopt a new resolution allowing kay to use his five mast antenna structure for commercial purposes,subject to reasonable conditions.writs of mandate are used under california law for the purpose of inquiring into the validity of any final administrative order cal.code civ.proc.a.here,the district court reviewed the final administrative order in response to kay conditional use permit application,and enter ed judgment commanding the city to set aside the order or decision.id.f.under a companion provision of california law,i f judgment be given for the applicant,the applicant may recover the damages which the applicant has sustained and a peremptory mandate must also be awarded without delay.id.section emphasis added.
the availability of damages under section,however,is limited by california government code sections and.state superior court,cal d.section provides that a public entity is not liable for an injury caused by the denial of any permit or similar authorization where the public entity or an employee of the public entity is authorized by enactment to determine whether or not such authorization should be issued,denied,suspended,or revoked.section is a corollary that immunizes public employees for their roles in the discretionary permit decisions governed by section.the immunity applies only to discretionary activities.richards dep t of alcoholic beverages control,th,d.the decision whether to issue a conditional use permit is discretionary by definition.breakzone billiards city of torrance,th,d citation omitted.
kay claims that because he sought only to change the frequency from amateur to commercial use on the antennae,the city had no discretion to deny the cup this assertion is premised on the tca preclusion of municipalities from regulat ing the placement,construction,and modification of personal wireless service facilities on the basis of the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent that such facilities comply with the commission regulations concerning such emissions.c b iv.because the city had already approved his antennae for use,and the switch to commercial use entailed only a change in radio frequency,kay argues the city lacked discretion because it could not consistently with the tca ever deny the cup even in part.
kay argument is largely based on thompson city of lake elsinore,th,d.there,the plaintiff renovated a building in compliance with all the appropriate building codes,regulations and requirements,and received a final inspection okay.id.at,d.lake elsinore nevertheless withheld the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the building,allegedly in an attempt to cause the plaintiff to comply with city demands related to other properties he owned.id.the thompson court explained that because lake elsinore had already exercised its discretion during the building permit process,it had no discretion to refuse to perform the purely ministerial duty of issuing the occupancy permit.id.at,d.
thompson is inapposite.there,lake elsinore had already found that the building at issue complied with all regulations,and was thus required by law to issue a certificate of occupancy.id.at,d citing uniform building code.for that reason,the city lacked discretion to deny the certificate,and damages were available.here,the city was considering an application for a permit to use a home in a residential neighborhood to engage in commercial operations.as the contentious transcripts from the city hearings demonstrate,decisions like this are freighted with concerns from neighbors and city officials intent on maintaining the residential character of the neighborhood.see breakzone billiards,th at,d in considering applications for such permits,a city is obligated to examine permit applications on an individual basis,applying sound principles of planning and zoning administration in a fair manner.the conditions attached to the city partial approval of the cup reflect these sound principles.for example,the city imposed limits on the times for maintenance work,number of vehicles present at the property,noise levels,and yard maintenance.
kay also relies on city of rancho palos verdes abrams,th,d,to support his argument that the city was compelled to grant him a cup.there,the court of appeal struck down an injunction against abrams using a amateur antenna for commercial purposes.the court of appeal reasoned that the only change in abrams operation would be the commercial use of frequencies allocated and assigned by the fcc.because the trial court injunction prohibits that use,it is by the tca.id.at,d.while we agree with the california court of appeal that regulation based solely on the transmission frequency is verboten,we do not read that as giving amateur broadcasters immunity from local permit requirements if they decide to switch to commercial broadcasting on existing antennae.as discussed in breakzone billiards and reflected in the use permit conditions above,there are numerous legitimate local concerns implicated by a commercial operation that do not attach to amateur use,and which have nothing to do with the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions.c b iv.there are situations in which a municipality may deny,for reasons related to the impact of a commercial operation on the neighborhood,a permit for an amateur broadcaster to operate commercially.ex rel.wireless income,llc city of chattanooga,cir the tca does not preempt all authority of state or local governments over the regulation of wireless towers.tower,llc plainville zoning bd.of appeals,cir the tca attempts,subject to five limitations,to preserve state and local authority over the placement and construction of facilities.
while the record suggests that the denial of kay permit may have been driven at least in part by animus on the part of city officials,the record also shows that the city was exercising its discretion as part of its planning and administrative duties.for that reason,we hold that the city decision to deny kay cup was discretionary,and that his remedies under california law are limited to the peremptory writ already granted by the district court.
damages under the telecommunications act 
nor did the district court err by holding that kay was not entitled to compensatory damages under the tca.congress explicitly created,and kay sued under,a private right of action in the tca 
any person adversely affected by any final action or failure to act by a state or local government or any instrumentality thereof that is inconsistent with this subparagraph may,within days after such action or failure to act,commence an action in any court of competent jurisdiction.the court shall hear and decide such action on an expedited basis.any person adversely affected by an act or failure to act by a state or local government or any instrumentality thereof that is inconsistent with clause iv may petition the commission for relief.
c b v.the district court held in kay favor on his tca claim,but did not explicitly grant him a remedy under the tca section of the tca does not specify the remedies available to successful litigants,and no circuit court of appeals has squarely addressed the availability of compensatory damages as a remedy.the supreme court,however,has provided some guidance,both in the context of attempted use of the civil rights act of,to enforce of the tca,and more generally in the context of statutes that are silent on available remedies.
the supreme court recently held that the providing a judicial remedy different from in c resort to,to enforce violations of.city of rancho palos verdes abrams,d.the court of appeals decision had reached the opposite conclusion,holding that money damages and attorney fees were available for tca violations enforced through a action.id.at.discussing abrams city of rancho palos verdes,cir.writing for the court,justice scalia briefly noted portions of that create a window for appeals and the requirement of expedited judicial review as examples that the tca adds no remedies to those available under,and limits relief in ways that does not.id.at.the remedies available under,moreover,perhaps do not include compensatory damages the lower courts are seemingly in disagreement on this point,and certainly do not include attorney fees and costs.id.at.footnotes omitted the court noted that l iability for attorney fees would have a particularly severe impact in the c context,making local governments liable for the often substantial legal expenses of large commercial interests for the misapplication of a complex and novel statutory scheme.id.at.citing nextel partners kingston township,cir tca plaintiffs are often large corporations or affiliated entities,whereas tca defendants are often small,rural municipalities.justice breyer,joined by justices,souter,and ginsburg concurred,and pointed out that the nature of review under meant that to permit actions would undermine the purely federal and purely local the statute reflects.id.at.finally,justice stevens,writing alone,concurred and expressed the view that there is not a shred of evidence in the legislative history suggesting that congress intended plaintiffs to be able to recover damages and attorney fees.id.at.justice stevens further stressed the fact that awards of damages and attorney fees could have potentially disastrous consequences for the likely defendants in most private actions under the tca.id.at.
while the supreme court has not ruled on the availability of damages in suits directly under,the concerns expressed in abrams about the structure and nature of the tca and congress intent in passing the law pertain as much to suits directly under as they do to suits seeking remedies via.with these concerns in mind,we examine the availability of compensatory damages.
tca remedies 
i t is well settled that where legal rights have been invaded,and a federal statute provides for a general right to sue for such invasion,federal courts may use any available remedy to make good the wrong done.bell hood.the court has subsequently explained that the federal courts have the power to award any appropriate relief in a cognizable cause of action brought pursuant to a federal statute,franklin gwinnett county pub,d,and that denial of a remedy is the exception rather than the rule,id.at the same time,it is critical that when deciding which remedies are appropriate in a given situation,we attempt to infer how congress would have addressed the issue if it had done so at the time the law was passed.gebser lago vista indep.sch,d quoting cent.bank of denver,first interstate bank of denver,d.in franklin,the court examined a district court dismissal of a title ix damages action for failure to state a claim,at,and remanded after holding that a damages remedy was appropriate and consistent with the intent of title ix,id.at.the court narrowed this broad rule in gebser,again examining the purpose and intent behind title ix,and limiting the circumstances under which damages were an appropriate remedy.at.to determine whether damages are appropriate here,we examine congress intent and the structure of.
stated intent 
as in franklin,we first examine whether congress intended to limit the remedies available for violations of.at.we have no statement of congressional intent on the question of remedies in the legislative history.see abrams,at.stevens,concurring.however,unlike the implied title ix cause of action in franklin and gebser,here we have some legislative history discussing the remedial structure created by the statute.section c,captioned p reservation of local zoning authority,was intended to minimize federal interference with state and local land use decisions.see conf,at,cong,hereinafter conference report the conference agreement preserves the authority of state and local governments over zoning and land use matters except in the limited circumstances set forth in the conference agreement.
because tca plaintiffs are often large telecommunications companies,it is likely that the damages attributed by them to adverse zoning or permitting decisions will be substantial,particularly from the viewpoint of a municipality.see abrams,at.this potential for large damages claims,even if they are not ultimately awarded,suggests that congress did not intend to create a damages remedy.just like the attorney fees addressed by the court in abrams,there is a real danger here that a damages remedy would have a particularly severe impact in the c context,making local governments liable for the often substantial damages of large commercial interests for the misapplication of a complex and novel statutory scheme.id.the specter of large damages claims,and the expensive litigation recognized in abrams,could easily intimidate local authorities into effectively abdicating their zoning and permitting powers when confronted with an application from a wireless service provider 
nor do we find that the requirement that courts hear and decide such action on an expedited basis,c b v,cuts against this view,as the nextel partners court mused in passing.at for defendants,assuming for the sake of argument that damages may be recovered under the tca itself,quick review may diminish the amount that may be recovered.footnote omitted.in the central district of california,where kay filed his action,the median time from the filing of a complaint to disposition of the case after a trial is months.administrative office of the united states courts,federal judicial caseload statistics tbl.march.partially due to the intervening abrams decision,the city took almost a year to decide kay permit application,and the district court took another two years to hold a bench trial and rule on the merits of the permit issue.this kind of schedule for the resolution of a civil case,even on an expedited basis,is typical.it is unrealistic to expect any case involving administrative review to wend its way through our district courts,let alone the appellate process,in a manner that is speedy enough to meaningfully stave off the accumulation of damages.
congress sought to preserve local authority while also providing a federal forum for the review of certain zoning and permitting decisions without further need to exhaust any independent state court remedy otherwise required.conference report at.a damages remedy does not further that purpose,and could potentially frustrate it.
administrative nature of review 
several features of section c are borrowed from state zoning and administrative review laws.zoning and permitting decisions are made by municipalities like the city or other regional authorities.every state provides for review of such agency decisions through an appeal or writ of certiorari to the state courts,and most provide a short time frame in which to file an appeal of those states have a appeal period the tca adopts a similar appeal period.c b v.the language used by congress closely mirrors m
