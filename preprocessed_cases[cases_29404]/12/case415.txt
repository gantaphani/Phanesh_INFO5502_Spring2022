the act categorizes telecommunications carriers and,depending on the classification,imposes duties.pursuant to the act,firstcom and qwest are both local exchange carriers lecs,of which there are two types incumbent local exchange carriers ilecs,and competitive local exchange carriers clecs qwest is an ilec,and firstcom is a clec.the act requires that qwest,as an ilec,provide access to its network to firstcom,a clec through interconnection agreements,and,in exchange,qwest is allowed to charge reasonable and nondiscriminatory rates for this access.quick commc ns.bell,cir see d.pursuant to the act,interconnection agreements must be submitted for approval to the state commission,e,which,in minnesota,is the minnesota public utilities commission mpuc,see.
firstcom and qwest entered into interconnection agreements.under those agreements,qwest sold telephone services to firstcom.firstcom did not remain profitable and ceased its normal business operations in.at that time,al jaffe associates aja purchased all or substantially all of firstcom assets.in,firstcom formally dissolved.aja later assumed the firstcom name.
in,twelve shareholders of the original firstcom filed an action against qwest,alleging violations of the act and the mta as well as minnesota common law claims of negligence,promissory estoppel,and fraudulent misrepresentation.the action related to secret interconnection agreements between qwest and two clecs,eschelon telecom eschelon and mcleod usa telecommunications mcleod specifically,the plaintiffs alleged that qwest provided eschelon and mcleod with voicemail services and a greater level of customer service relative to billing,despite qwest representations to firstcom that this was not the case.the plaintiffs further asserted that,as a result of qwest wrongful conduct,the original firstcom was unable to continue its business.on september,the district court granted qwest motion for summary judgment as the shareholders lacked standing because aja had purchased the original firstcom legal rights.see firstcom,qwest,wl,at.the shareholders did not appeal.
on november,aja,under the name of firstcom brought this action against qwest asserting the same claims as the lawsuit and adding a claim of negligence.qwest moved to dismiss the action,and the district court granted the motion.as to firstcom federal claim,the district court found that the claim was and that equitable tolling did not apply.the district court determined that,even assuming the mta granted a private cause of action,firstcom could not pursue it because the mta expired three months before this action was filed.finally,the district court found that firstcom alleged state law claims were preempted by the act.firstcom brings this appeal.
firstcom contends that the district court erred because none of its claims were properly dismissed.we review the district court grant of qwest motion to dismiss de novo.see owen motors,cir.
firstcom contends the district court improperly dismissed its federal claim because the longer limitations period in a,rather than the limitations period in section of the act,applies so that the claim is timely even if section applies,the claim is timely under the doctrine of equitable tolling.firstcom asserts that the claim was tolled until september,when it first learned that it had a cause of action against qwest via the district court dismissal of the shareholders suit for lack of standing.firstcom further asserts that equitable tolling applies here because the interests that statutes of limitations seek to protect have been afforded to qwest as it received timely notice of the claim when it was asserted in in the shareholders lawsuit.
we find unpersuasive firstcom argument that the limitations period in a applies to its claim under the act.section a provides that e xcept as otherwise provided by law,a civil action arising under an act of congress may not be commenced later than years after the cause of action accrues.a emphasis added.section a is a fallback provision that applies only where no specific statute of limitations governs the particular claim at issue.am.cellular dobson cellular,see star steel thomas.describing section as a general,limitations period for any federal statute enacted after,without one of its own campbell amtrak,d,characterizing section as the federal default statute of limitations.
section b of the act mandates a limitations period for a ll complaints against carriers for the recovery of damages b.because firstcom claim for damages under the act is specifically governed by the limitations period set forth in section b of the act,section a has no application here.see am.cellular,at holding that section provided a limitation on a ll complaints against carriers for the recovery of damages under the act see also at t commc ns of the mountain states,qwest,wl,at may,unpublished holding that a damages claim under the act is subject to limitations period at t commc of the midwest qwest,wl,at,unpublished same.thus,the limitations period of section b governs firstcom federal claim.according to firstcom complaint,qwest alleged wrongful conduct occurred no later than,more than two years prior the filing of the complaint in.
however,firstcom also contends that its claim is rendered timely by the doctrine of equitable tolling.we review de novo the district court determination that equitable tolling is inapplicable to the statute of limitations here.see united states,cir.the doctrine of equitable tolling permits a plaintiff to sue after the statutory time period has expired if he has been prevented from doing so due to inequitable circumstances.pecoraro diocese of rapid city,cir quotation omitted.because statutes of limitations protect important interests of certainty,accuracy,and repose,equitable tolling is an exception to the rule,and should therefore be used only in exceptional circumstances.motley united states,cir quotation omitted see riddle kemna,cir equitable tolling is an exceedingly narrow window of relief.quotation omitted pecoraro,at courts generally require strict compliance with a statute of limitations and rarely invoke doctrines such as equitable tolling to alleviate a plaintiff from a loss of his right to assert a claim.
firstcom,as t he party claiming the benefit of an exception to the operation of a statute of limitations,bears the burden of showing that it is entitled to equitable tolling.motley,at.this generally involves establishing two elements that it has been pursuing its rights diligently,and that some extraordinary circumstance stood in its way.riddle,at quoting walker norris,cir.according to firstcom complaint,b eginning in the fall and winter of representatives of firstcom first became aware of improper,illegal,and conduct by qwest in relation to its business dealings with clecs generally,and firstcom specifically.compl.in,shareholders of the former firstcom brought suit alleging the same wrongdoing challenged here.firstcom argues that equitable tolling applies because it did not learn that it possessed legal rights which had been violated by qwest until september,when the district court dismissed the shareholders suit for lack of standing.however,firstcom argument merely demonstrates that its delay in bringing this action is attributable to its own actions.firstcom was a party to,and in possession of,the asset purchase agreement,and the fact that firstcom did not for whatever reason understand its rights under that agreement does not warrant the application of equitable tolling.see tucker kingston,cir s tanding alone,the lack of legal expertise is not a basis for invoking equitable tolling.further,it demonstrates that the circumstances that prevented firstcom from filing the act claim were not truly beyond the control of firstcom see pecoraro,at quotation omitted.accordingly,the doctrine of equitable tolling does not apply.because firstcom federal claim was not timely filed,it was properly dismissed.
firstcom also alleges that qwest violated the mta.specifically,firstcom alleges that qwest willfully and intentionally violated firstcom rights to receive the same contractual terms as those provided by qwest to firstcom competitors as said rights are guaranteed by the mta.compl.firstcom further contends that section of the mta gives rise to a private cause of action,expressly and impliedly.
subdivision of section,entitled private remedies,provided that nothing in this section affects the ability of a telephone company,telecommunications provider,telecommunications carrier,or subscriber to bring a private cause of action in court against a provider of local exchange telephone service based on conduct for which a penalty is imposed under this section.however,subdivision of section expired,in its entirety,on august,more than three months before firstcom filed its complaint.therefore,under minnesota law,subdivision can not provide the basis for firstcom cause of action.see granville minneapolis pub,special sch.dist,providing that a statute had permanently expired where t he legislature allowed that section to expire and made no provision for revival state ex rel.bennett brown,stating that the repeal of a statute upon which a cause of action is based moots the action.
further,section entitled enforcement remains in effect.see.section provides for an action to recover civil penalties,id.however,it specifically states that t he civil penalties provided for in section may be recovered by a civil action brought by the attorney general in the name of the state.amounts recovered under this section must be paid into the state treasury,id.the expiration of subdivision of section coupled with the continued vitality of section demonstrates that firstcom can not bring a private cause action against qwest pursuant to the mta.
firstcom acknowledges the expiration of subdivision but then argues that it is irrelevant because it was in force at the time of both qwest allegedly wrongful conduct and the shareholders suit.however,firstcom has offered no authority for its position,and we find none.on the contrary,expiration,in the context of a statute,means coming to an end esp ecially,a formal termination on a closing date,black law dictionary ed,similar to repeal,meaning abrogation of an existing law by legislative act,id.at.it is well established that when a statute is repealed or otherwise becomes inoperative no further enforcement proceedings can take place unless competent authority has kept the statute alive for that purpose.united states van den berg,cir quoting pipefitters local union united states,d see simpson miller,w hen a statute is repealed,claims for declaratory and injunctive relief against continued adherence to the statute are rendered moot.firstcom has offered no competent authority that enforcement proceedings pursuant to subdivision,such as firstcom mta claim in this case,can take place after the expiration of subdivision.see van den berg,at.therefore,firstcom mta claim fails and was properly dismissed.
firstcom asserts that the district court erred in determining that its promissory estoppel,fraudulent misrepresentation,and negligence claims were dependent on the act and thus preempted by federal law.firstcom contends that these claims rest on minnesota law and that they are timely under the limitation period for such actions under minnesota law.see.firstcom also claims that the filed rate doctrine is inapplicable as its claims do not challenge qwest rates 
we determine whether firstcom state common law claims are preempted by the act based on a reading of the complaint,ordinary preemption.see stuart weitzman,llc microcomputer,cir o rdinary preemption provid es a substantive defense to a state law action on the basis of federal law.in order to make this determination,we first outline the contours of sections and.
section of the act imposes duties on telecommunications carriers,sometimes varying according to the specific type of carrier.section obligates all telecommunications carriers both firstcom and qwest to interconnect directly or indirectly with facilities and equipment of other telecommunications carriers,a all local exchange carriers both firstcom and qwest to resell telecommunications services without unreasonable or discriminatory conditions or limitations,id.b all ilecs qwest to negotiate interconnection agreements in good faith with clecs firstcom,id.c and all ilecs qwest to provide interconnection on rates,terms,and conditions that are nondiscriminatory,id.c d.

the act provides nothing in chapter of title shall in any way abridge or alter the remedies now existing at common law or by statute,but the provisions of this chapter are in addition to such remedies.emphasis added.therefore,section merely preserves existing remedies and does not create state law remedies for breaches of duties imposed by the act.premiere network,sbc commc ns,cir emphasis added see mci telecomms.garden state inv,cir section preserves causes of action for breaches of duties that are not created under the communications act.emphasis added comtronics,puerto rico,cir the existing remedies congress had in mind under section would scarcely be remedies so closely dependent upon the act itself rather,we read section as preserving causes of action for breaches of duties distinguishable from those created under the act.accordingly,if firstcom purported state law claims,in actuality,seek recovery for qwest alleged breach of duties imposed by sections and of the act,then firstcom recourse was to bring claims pursuant to the act,not minnesota common law.see premiere,at mci,at comtronics,at.
with respect to firstcom negligence claim,firstcom alleges that 
qwest owed firstcom a duty of care to abide by applicable federal and state telecommunications laws,to refrain form sic discriminating against firstcom relative to other clecs,and to refrain from acting in a wrongful and deceitful manner which placed firstcom in a position of competitive disadvantage relative to qwest and other clecs.based upon the facts identified herein,and with deliberate disregard for the rights of plaintiff,on numerous occasions qwest negligently breached its duty of care to firstcom.
compl.because firstcom negligence claim is seeking recovery for breach of a duty imposed by the act,the claim is preempted.see premiere,at mci telecomm ns,at comtronics,at.
in terms of promissory estoppel,firstcom alleges that 
qwest assured firstcom that firstcom competitors would not,and did not,receive preferential contract terms relative to the interconnection agreements between the parties by such promises qwest intended,and should have reasonably expected,to induce firstcom to rely upon those promises.firstcom reasonably relie
