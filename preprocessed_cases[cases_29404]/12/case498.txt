the telecommunications act of act or act,stat.codified in part at,created a complex federal scheme to encourage competition in local telephone service markets previously dominated by local exchange carrier monopolies.at t iowa utils,d.sections and of the act require former monopoly local carriers to enter into interconnection agreements that provide the new competitors with access to some of their telecommunications components on an unbundled basis and on terms favorable to the competitors.meanwhile,section allows local phone companies that used to be subsidiaries of at t,previously barred by an antitrust decree from entering the market,to supply services if their interconnection agreements contain certain access provisions.the act explicitly authorizes state commissions to play a crucial,but restricted,role in this process,while reserving the power to administer various parts of the act exclusively to the federal communications commission.
section of the act invites carriers engaged in negotiating an interconnection agreement to petition a state commission to arbitrate unsettled issues.in this case,we address whether a state commission overstepped its authority in arbitrating the terms of an interconnection agreement.the act language,history,and purpose,in addition to the overwhelming majority of judicial and administrative decisions on the matter,persuade us that state commissions may not impose section access or pricing requirements in the course of arbitrating interconnection agreements.we further conclude that state commissions are preempted from forcing carriers to make parts of their networks available on a separately purchasable basis when the fcc has determined that they are not required to do so.
the arizona corporation commission acc and dieca communications,covad communications company,appeal the district court entry of summary judgment in favor of qwest corporation in its action under the act challenging the acc arbitration order.we affirm the district court decision and hold that the act bars the acc from insisting qwest interconnection agreement with covad include section access or pricing obligations or provide for element unbundling that the fcc has lifted.
background 
a.the statutory framework 
congress rang in a new era of telecommunications regulation with the passage of the communications act of.at the time,at t controlled the telephone service market while its subsidiary bell operating companies bocs,of which qwest is a descendant,enjoyed a virtual monopoly over local telephone service,at.for the next years,telephone service regulatory issues mainly revolved around rates,with the fcc setting interstate rates and state commissions setting intrastate rates.verizon new england,maine public utils.comm n,cir.
in,a federal antitrust consent decree was entered to promote competition in services by disconnecting at t from its subsidiary bocs,which were in turn initially barred from dialing into the market.see at t,at.breyer,concurring in part and dissenting in part united states am,aff sub nom.maryland united states,d mem.see also sbc commc ns,fcc,divestiture was called for,in large part,because it was thought that a corporation that enjoyed a monopoly on local calls would ineluctably leverage that bottleneck control in the interexchange long distance market.internal quotation marks omitted.the framers of the decree envisioned a dual telephone service universe at t was expected to compete with new entrants in the market,and the bocs would continue as local service monopolies verizon new england,at.
the retreat from this illusion of wholly separate spheres began in earnest with the telecommunications act.id.at.the bocs wanted to provide services,while established and new carriers alike wanted to gain access to local boc facilities to use for long distance services,competing local services,or both.id.the act established a complex regulatory regime for both entry and competition in both spheres.id.under the act,bocs and other incumbent local exchange carriers ilecs must provide competitive local exchange carriers clecs access to certain elements of their local facilities.bocs,meanwhile,are permitted to enter the market if certain prerequisites are met.
sections and of the act define the required access to ilec facilities,while section speaks to longdistance entry conditions for bocs.the overlap between these two parts of the act sends a mixed message as to what regulatory authority state commissions retain.
specifically,section a compels every telecommunications carrier to interconnect directly or indirectly with the facilities and equipment of other telecommunications carriers.section c requires an ilec like qwest to engage in good faith negotiations with a clec like covad to form an interconnection agreement to fulfill the various duties imposed on all local exchange carriers under section b 
section c also requires ilecs to offer clecs certain network elements on an unbundled basis at,regulated rates.these unbundled network elements are commonly referred to as unes.the fcc designates unes by determining if access to a given une is necessary and if the failure to provide such access would impair clecs in providing services.d covad commc ns fcc,see also telecom ass fcc,concluding the fcc can not delegate the authority to classify unes to state commissions.the fcc shortened its list of mandatory unes in following a series of circuit cases holding that the fcc impairment standard was overly broad.see covad commc ns,at.state commissions set une rates by applying the fcc total element incremental cost telric pricing methodology.d see verizon commc ns,fcc,d upholding the fcc telric rate regulations,local competition order.these telric prices are highly favorable to clecs 
section a permits carriers to negotiate an interconnection agreement voluntarily without regard to the duties otherwise imposed under section b or c.if,like here,negotiations fail,pursuant to section b either party may petition a state commission to arbitrate any open issues.the state commission may only consider issues identified in the arbitration petition and must ensure section requirements are met.b a,c.all interconnection agreements,whether adopted through negotiation or arbitration,must be submitted to the appropriate state commission for approval e.
section only applies to those ilecs like qwest that are,or incorporate,former bocs.section c allows bocs to provide interlata services roughly meaning services only if two conditions are met first,the boc must either have in place an interconnection agreement approved under section or,if no clec has requested such an agreement,it must have filed a statement of generally available terms approved by the state commission under section f.see c a.second,independent of section c une duties,the boc must make a list of elements available on an unbundled basis in addition to complying with section and other requirements set forth in the competitive checklist.see c b.in contrast to section unes,the fcc decided network elements that are unbundled by bocs solely because of the requirements set forth in section do not have to be offered at rates.triennial review order tro,concluding the basic just,reasonable,and nondiscriminatory rate standard of sections and and not the section d pricing standard applies to section checklist network elements see telecom ass n,at.in practical terms,that means bocs like qwest can charge higher rates for elements unbundled under section than they could if the approach to rates for elements unbundled under section applied.
procedural history 
pursuant to sections and of the act,covad entered into negotiations with qwest to secure an interconnection agreement.a complete agreement was not reached,so in accordance with section,covad petitioned the acc to arbitrate several disputed interconnection agreement issues.adopting the recommendations of an administrative law judge,the acc issued an arbitration order resolving the disputed interconnection agreement issues.
the acc order interpreted the section approval process as authorizing it to require that section elements be placed in arbitrated interconnection agreements.the acc also held it had jurisdiction to impose unbundling requirements under arizona law that the fcc tro or the circuit usta ii decisions struck down.finally,the acc ruled that the previous rates would remain in effect for section elements pending a further proceeding within days to set just and reasonable rates consistent with state and federal law.
qwest and covad filed their arbitrated interconnection agreement implementing the terms of the arbitration decision with the acc,which was approved by operation of law under section e.one of the arbitrated interconnection agreement provisions stated qwest will continue providing access to certain network elements as required by section or state law,regardless of whether access to such unes is required by section of the act.the acc deferred holding the section rate proceeding at qwest and covad request after they reached an interim agreement regarding the pricing issue.
qwest brought this action in federal district court under the act seeking declaratory and injunctive relief from the acc arbitration resolution.treating the parties briefs as for summary judgment,the district court ruled in favor of qwest.the court held that the acc has no power to enforce section obligations.the court concluded that because the acc lacks authority to arbitrate section terms,it can not set prices for those elements and may not use the pricing scheme the fcc rejected regardless.the court decided that conflict preemption prohibits the acc from imposing unbundling requirements under arizona law that the fcc explicitly withdrew.the acc and covad both timely appealed.

state authority under section 
we join the first,seventh,eighth,and eleventh circuits in holding that the act does not authorize state commissions to implement section terms and rates in interconnection agreements see verizon new england,at concluding the authority to determine which elements bocs are required to provide under section and the rates for those elements is granted exclusively to the fcc illinois bell,box,cir t he state commission power over an interconnection agreement is limited to the terms in the agreement relating to access under section.southwestern bell,missouri public serv.comm n,cir rejecting the claim that states have implied authority to ensure ilecs comply with in interconnection agreement arbitration proceedings bellsouth,georgia public serv.comm n,wl cir,per curiam deciding state commissions are not authorized to implement section.as the first circuit explained in addressing an analogous claim,the contrary position the acc and covad have taken is at odds with the statutory language,history and policy of section and most relevant precedent.verizon new england,at.
the structure of section confirms that the fcc possesses sole authority to determine the access and pricing bocs must satisfy to enter the services market.bocs submit their application to provide interlata services directly to the fcc.d.the fcc then consults with the attorney general,whose evaluation of the application must be given substantial weight.d a.the fcc must also consult with the state commission to verify that the boc has complied with the requirements of section c.d b see also sbc commc ns,at although the commission must consult with the state commissions,the statute does not require the fcc to give the state commissions views any particular weight.finally,the fcc decides whether the boc meets section c terms and issues a written determination approving or rejecting the interlata application.d.
once an interlata application is approved,enforcement responsibilities rest exclusively with the fcc.it is the fcc that determines whether a boc has ceased to meet any of the conditions required for interlata service approval,and it may issue orders,impose penalties,or retract its approval in response.d a.the fcc also establish es procedures for the review of complaints of boc noncompliance with section c approval conditions.d b.and the fcc is the one obligated to act on such complaint within days.id.
the acc limited section consultation role cuts against holding that it may impose section terms based on its authority under section.see russello united states,d where congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same act,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.internal quotation marks and alterations omitted verizon new england,at that the states have an explicit consultative role under section works against,rather than for,their claim of other powers.the fact that the fcc is expressly prohibited from extending or limiting section competitive checklist terms by rule or otherwise likewise presupposes the fcc alone has the power to administer section.d.
section framework also undermines the acc claim of power to impose section requirements.a state commission may only arbitrate issues after an ilec receives a request for negotiation pursuant to section.see a,b see also qwest public utils.comm of colorado,cir a clec may only compel arbitration of issues that the ilec is under a duty to negotiate pursuant to c.mci telecomms.bellsouth,cir per curiam concluding that a state commission arbitration authority is coextensive with the ilec duty to negotiate the terms and conditions necessary to fulfill section duties.section c,defining the standards for arbitration,explicitly requires state commissions to ensure section requirements are met,without mentioning section.the state commission must also establish any rates for interconnection,services,or network elements according to section d c.section d,meanwhile,only authorizes the setting of just and reasonable rate s for facilities and services offered pursuant to section.section e b allows a state commission to reject an arbitrated agreement only if the agreement does not meet the requirements of section.in short,all state commission arbitration authority under section is inextricably tied to the duties imposed under section.
implementing other federal law requirements is beyond the scope of section authority savings clause,which states that nothing in this section shall prohibit a state commission from establishing or enforcing other requirements of state law in its review of an agreement,including requiring compliance with intrastate telecommunications service quality standards or requirements.e emphasis added see also f providing a nearly identical savings clause for state commissions reviewing statements of generally available terms accord sbc commc ns,at i nterlata service is typically interstate.perhaps most tellingly,section contains no similar state commission authority savings clause.see verizon new england,at section has no such clause reserving state power,again underscoring intended federal supremacy and the absence of state power under section.
nor is there any historical support for the acc interpretation of its power to implement section.suits challenging the authority of state commissions to impose section access and pricing terms did not arise until because the fcc previous expansive interpretation of section c une requirements coincided with section c requirements.see southwestern bell,at.moreover,the act was passed,in part,to address the concern that the huge telecommunications industry should no longer be governed by an antitrust consent decree administered by a single federal district judge.sbc commc ns,at.when the act replaced the decree,congress aimed to transfer this authority to the the states.verizon new england,at.
state law authority 
while arizona law grants the acc broad powers to make unbundling and pricing determinations,federal preemption restricts that power here.we conclude that,due to conflict preemption,state law can not empower state commissions to prescribe
