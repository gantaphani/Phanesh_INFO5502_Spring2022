petitioner bdpcs,was the high bidder on several licenses in a federal communications commission spectrum auction,but,at the appointed hour,was unable to make the required down payments.the commission wireless telecommunications bureau promptly declared bdpcs to have defaulted on the licenses,set them for reauction,and,consistent with fcc auction rules,assessed a default penalty.bdpcs now appeals from a final order of the commission dismissing in part and denying in part bdpcs application for review of the default penalty order.we conclude that the commission acted within the bounds of reasonableness and therefore deny the petition for review.
in,the fcc auctioned the c block of spectrum,distributing geographic licenses to provide wireless personal communications services.consistent with a congressional mandate to distribute spectrum licenses to small businesses,see j b,the commission limited the c block auction to businesses falling beneath certain revenue and asset thresholds,see.winning c block bidders were required only to make a down payment of five percent of their winning bid within five days of the close of the auction,and a second payment after the commission officially awarded the license.id.a.the remaining percent of the winning bids could be paid in installments over the term of the license.id.e,b.
the c block auction rules,though,were not all carrot and no stick.in order to deter insincere bidding,the auction rules set out penalties for bidders who withdrew high bids during an auction or defaulted on winning bids after the auction close.a bidder who withdrew a high bid during an auction was subject to a withdrawal penalty a penalty equal to the difference between the amount bid and the amount of the winning bid.id.a.if the ultimate winning bid exceeded the high bid of the withdrawing bidder,no withdrawal penalty would be assessed.id.a winning bidder who defaulted after the close of an auction was subject to a default penalty equal to the withdrawal penalty plus an additional penalty equal to three percent of the subsequent winning bid.id.a.if the winning bid on reauction exceeded the defaulting bidder,the additional penalty would be three percent of the defaulting bidder winning bid.id.
bdpcs was the high bidder for c block licenses with bids totaling nearly million.pursuant to c block auction rules,bdpcs thus owed its initial down payment million within five business days.id.a on the fifth day,however,bdpcs found itself without financing and unable to make the down payment.instead of million,bdpcs sent the commission an emergency petition for waiver seeking a extension of the down payment deadline.bdpcs petition cited the unexpected inability to obtain a bridge loan from west,one of the baby bell companies,as the cause of its failure to pay.in re bdpcs,emergency petition for waiver of bdpcs,may,at.bdpcs stated that its parent company had made arrangements for west to fund bdpcs down payment obligations until bdpcs anticipated public offering.id.at.these financing arrangements suddenly collapsed,according to bdpcs,on may,four days before the close of the c block auction and despite what it describes as herculean efforts to find a new source of funding making every effort to raise the necessary funds through numerous contacts with different entities bdpcs could not come up with the goods.id.at.bdpcs needed more time.
the commission wireless telecommunications bureau wtb was unmoved.noting the important role that down payment obligations play in ensur ing that an applicant is financially qualified to satisfy its obligations as a licensee,the wtb denied bdpcs waiver petition.see in re emergency petition for waiver of deadline for submission of down payment for the broadcast pcs c block auction filed by bdpcs,order,wl.by the end of may,the wtb had denied bdpcs request for reconsideration,see in re emergency petition for waiver of deadline for submission of down payment for the broadband pcs c block auction filed by bdpcs,order on reconsideration,wl,and the commission had announced that bdpcs licenses would be reauctioned,see public notice,defaulted pcs licenses to be reauctioned,wl.
after the july reauction,the wtb tabulated bdpcs default penalty in accordance with rule a.see in re bdpcs,order,wl for each of the licenses,the wtb first calculated the withdrawal penalty the difference between the amount bid by bdpcs and the winning bid on reauction and then added three percent of the lower of bdpcs winning bid or the winning bid on reauction.bdpcs incurred withdrawal penalties for the eight licenses for which the winning bid at reauction was lower than bdpcs winning bid,penalties totaling see id.at attachment a.the wtb then tacked on the default penalty for all licenses bringing the grand total to.id.the commission then credited bdpcs for its million upfront payment,leaving a balance due of.id.at.
after the wtb denied reconsideration,see in re bdpcs,order,wl,bdpcs applied to the commission for review of the wtb default payment order.bdpcs application repeated the arguments it had made before the wtb on reconsideration bdpcs was unable to make its down payment only because us west abruptly refused to go forward with the bridge loan,and,in any event,the assessment of such a large default payment on a small entrepreneurial company is inequitable and contrary to the public interest,because the treasury ha d been made whole by the reauction of the bdpcs licenses.in re bdpcs,application for review of bdpcs,june,at.bdpcs requested that the default penalty be reduced either to the million upfront payment,or to the charge of million.id.at.
the commission did not immediately act on bdpcs application for review.in october,bdpcs filed a supplement to its application,raising several new arguments to support its position that bdpcs has no outstanding financial obligation to the fcc and that bdpcs is entitled to a reimbursement of its million upfront payment.letter to magalie roman salas,secretary of fcc,from leonard kennedy,counsel for bdpcs,at,first supplement.bdpcs acknowledged that the supplement had not been timely filed and requested that the commission exercise its discretion to consider its arguments,but did not otherwise offer any excuse for the pleading tardiness or for the fact that its arguments had not been first presented to the wtb.id.at.less than two months later,bdpcs followed with a second supplemental pleading.this pleading ostensibly requested a waiver of the default penalty the same relief requested in bdpcs initial application for review but,this time,presented as reasons for granting the waiver yet more new arguments that the default penalty was invalid or unenforceable.
in july,the commission denied all of bdpcs requests for relief,rejecting on the merits bdpcs initial application for review and the waiver request presented in the second supplement,and dismissing all the other legal arguments raised in the first and second supplements as procedurally barred.see in re bdpcs,memorandum opinion and order,wl order.the commission agreed with the wtb that the sudden collapse of bdpcs financing arrangements did not warrant a waiver or reduction of the default penalty.id.at.the commission took special note of the fact that bdpcs ha d admitted that four days prior to the close of the auction,it began to experience financial difficulties,and yet it remained active in the auction.id.at.bdpcs,the commission concluded,should have been cognizant of the risk that it was assuming by not withdrawing.id.at.
concerning the legal arguments first raised in the first and second supplements,the commission found that they were untimely and had not been first presented to the wtb,as required by commission rules.see id.at citing.the commission therefore concluded that bdpcs supplements to its application for review were procedurally deficient and warrant ed dismissal on their face.id.at see also id.at it is further ordered that the first supplement and the second supplement are dismissed.the commission then considered and rejected bdpcs supplemental legal arguments on their merits,assum ing that the first and second supplements were timely filed i
