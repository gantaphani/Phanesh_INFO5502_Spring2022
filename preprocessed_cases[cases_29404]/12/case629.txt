the telecommunications act of,stat,codified at et the act,aims to encourage competition in the telephone services industry.among other things,the act requires telephone companies competing within the same area to interconnect their networks to ensure that callers who subscribe to one local telephone service can receive calls from,and place calls to,those who subscribe to a different local telephone service.see c a.the federal communications commission fcc is authorized to establish regulations implementing the requirements of.id.d.
the terms under which the networks are connected are contained in interconnection agreements.the act directs telephone companies to attempt to agree upon the terms of interconnection through negotiation.id.a.if they can not agree,the act directs the governing state commission to arbitrate or mediate disputed issues.id.b.the duties which the act imposes are only minimum requirements,and telephone companies may enter into interconnection agreements without regard to the act requirements.id.a.the state commission must,however,approve the final agreement.id.e.in this case,plaintiff southwestern bell telephone company and defendant brooks fiber communications agreed upon all the terms of interconnection.the oklahoma corporation commission occ subsequently approved their interconnection agreement agreement or interconnection agreement.
meanwhile,b of the act imposes a duty on local exchange carriers lec to establish reciprocal compensation arrangements for the transport and termination of telecommunication.reciprocal compensation is designed to compensate an lec for completing a local call from another lec.the act requires that the originating caller lec,in this case southwestern bell,compensate the lec who completed the call,in this case brooks fiber.id.b.in its local competition order,the fcc ruled that the act b obligations should apply only to traffic that originates and terminates within a local area.accordingly,the agreement between brooks fiber and southwestern bell requires reciprocal compensation only when they exchange local traffic.the agreement defines local traffic as follows 
calls originated by one party end users and terminated to the other party end users shall be classified as local traffic under this agreement if the call originates and terminates in the same southwestern bell exchange area or originates and terminates within different southwestern bell exchanges which share a common mandatory local calling scope.calls not classified as local under this agreement shall be treated as interexchange for intercompany compensation purposes.
application of the reciprocal compensation provisions of the agreement between southwestern bell and brooks fiber is the subject of this lawsuit.in june,after performing under the agreement for nearly nine months,southwestern bell declared it would no longer pay reciprocal compensation for calls to internet service providers isps doing business with brooks fiber because,according to southwestern bell,calls to isps are interstate communications which the agreement reciprocal compensation provisions do not cover.brooks fiber then filed an application with the occ requesting a determination that calls delivered from southwestern bell customers to an isp located within the same local exchange are local traffic and subject to the act reciprocal compensation requirements.
a state administrative law judge ruled in favor of southwestern bell,determining that calls to isps are not subject to reciprocal compensation.brooks fiber appealed the alj decision.the occ reversed the alj decision,reasoning that such traffic is local,terminates at the isp,and is subject to reciprocal compensation.southwestern bell sought review of the occ order in federal district court southwestern bell argued that the occ order rested on the erroneous conclusion that federal law characterizes calls to isps as local traffic.according to southwestern bell,this conclusion conflicted with the plain language of the agreement,state and federal precedent regarding what constitutes local traffic,and the reciprocal compensation provisions of the act.
the district court concluded that its jurisdiction to review the occ order was limited to determining compliance with federal law,and did not extend to review of oklahoma state contract law issues.accordingly,the court upheld the occ order as consistent with federal law,but declined to review the occ application of state contract law to the agreement.southwestern bell appeals the district court decision.we exercise jurisdiction pursuant to.while we disagree with the district court conclusion that it had no jurisdiction to review the occ application of state contract law,we ultimately affirm the court judgment in favor of brooks fiber as modified because the occ interpretation of the interconnection agreement is consistent with both federal and state law.
the substantive questions that southwestern bell and brooks fiber ask us to decide are whether the occ properly interpreted the interconnection agreement as requiring reciprocal compensation for calls to isps,and whether the interconnection agreement,as interpreted by the occ,complies with federal law.at the outset,however,we must address several issues regarding the district court subject matter jurisdiction over this litigation.see bender williamsport area sch,d every federal appellate court has a special obligation to satisfy itself not only of its own jurisdiction,but also that of the lower courts in a cause under review.specifically,this appeal raises important issues regarding the proper role of state commissions and federal courts in making and reviewing determinations under the act.as noted,the district court limited its review to whether the occ decision complied with federal law.southwestern bell argues we have plenary authority to review all aspects of the occ decision.therefore,we are compelled to analyze the occ jurisdiction to interpret the agreement under federal law,the district court jurisdiction to review the state commission interpretation,and the proper scope of federal review.
we begin by recognizing that the occ acted within its jurisdiction in interpreting the previously approved interconnection agreement between southwestern bell and brooks fiber.the act authorizes state commissions to mediate and arbitrate disputes over interconnection agreements during the parties negotiations.a b.the act also specifies that the appropriate state commission must approve each interconnection agreement.id.e.courts have held that this grant to the state commissions to approve or reject and mediate or arbitrate interconnection agreements necessarily implies the authority to interpret and enforce specific provisions contained in those agreements.southwestern bell.public util.comm n,cir see also iowa util.bd.fcc,cir the enforcement decisions of state commissions would also be subject to federal district court review under subsection e,aff in part,rev in part on other grounds sub nom.iowa util,d.
moreover,the fcc has concluded that inherent in state commissions express authority to mediate,arbitrate,and approve interconnection agreements under is the authority to interpret and enforce previously approved agreements.in the matter of starpower communications.we must defer to the fcc view because it is a reasonable interpretation of.see chevron natural resources defense council,d.accordingly,the occ properly exercised its jurisdiction in interpreting the agreement to resolve a dispute between the parties.
we next conclude that the district court had jurisdiction to review the decision of the occ interpreting the interconnection agreement.section e of the act states,i n any case in which a state commission makes a determination under this section,any party aggrieved by such determination may bring an action in an appropriate federal district court to determine whether the agreement or statement meets the requirements of and.in addition,congress expressly eliminated state court jurisdiction to review actions of state commissions in approving or rejecting interconnection agreements.e no state court shall have jurisd
