plaintiff travel group,appeals the circuit court entry of summary judgment for defendant mediterranean shipping company usa,msc on travel complaint seeking damages under the telephone consumer protection act of the tcpa for advertisements sent to travel by facsimile.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
background 
this appeal involves the widespread practice of sending advertisements to the fax machines of businesses and consumers,who often view these documents as the more modern equivalent to junk mail.this method of distribution became prevalent in the last years as a less expensive alternative to regular mail,especially because the cost of printing the advertisement necessarily is borne by the recipient.
at the time of this litigation,travel group operated travel agencies in chicago and kenilworth,illinois.on july,travel brought a class action lawsuit against msc,alleging that msc sent or was responsible for sending an unsolicited advertisement by fax on or around june,to travel and other members of the class as part of a mass broadcast of unauthorized faxes.travel asserted that by sending such advertisements by fax,the documents were printed by using the paper and toner of travel and other class members,converting those resources for msc benefit and shifting to the recipients the cost of printing the messages.furthermore,travel stated it could not use its fax line while receiving the ad.
attached to the complaint was a copy of the faxed advertisement describing winter cruises nights sic south america cruises from per person.the advertisement lists dates,destinations and prices for various trips,broken down by deck and type of cabin.the bottom of the page states msc italian cruises with a telephone number,fax number and web site address.at the top of the page is a line stating if you no longer wish to receive faxes,please call.
in response to travel complaint,defendant msc filed a complaint against,among others,captaris,the company that marketed msc cruises through its medialinq services division,which provides high volume fax broadcast services.msc stated that captaris obtained the list of fax recipients from northstar travel media northstar,which owned the database.
msc and the defendants moved for summary judgment pursuant to section of the code of civil procedure ilcs west.the defendants argued that travel had been a member of the international airlines travel agent network iatan since and routinely had supplied its contact information to iatan and other entities to enable airlines,hotels,cruise lines such as msc,and other travel suppliers to direct information to travel about availability and promotions.
the defendants contended that travel provided iatan with its contact information,including its fax number,and agreed to the inclusion of that information in iatan membership database.iatan then licensed its database for use by nfo plog research,plog,the company that compiled the database.plog and its assets,including the database,subsequently were purchased by northstar.
in response to travel assertion that it received faxes between january,and july,msc raised the affirmative defenses of laches and estoppel.msc pointed out that travel never contacted the phone number listed on the faxes from msc to request that it not be faxed advertisements about msc cruises.msc further asserted that travel did not inform iatan until may that it did not want to receive promotional faxes and that travel request only included the fax number of the kenilworth office.as affirmative defenses,msc claimed that travel damages were inconsequential because its actual cost of receiving each fax was approximately cents,and msc challenged the constitutionality of the tcpa as violative of due process.
on september,the circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of msc and the defendants,and travel now appeals.the other defendants are not parties to this appeal.
travel argues that the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment because the record raises a genuine issue of material fact as to whether travel agreed to receive advertisements from msc and other travel carriers by fax.
the tcpa prohibits the sending of an unsolicited advertisement to a telephone facsimile machine.b c.an unsolicited advertisement is defined as any material advertising the commercial availability or quality of any property,goods,or services which is transmitted to any person without that person prior express invitation or permission.a.the tcpa provides for monetary damage for each violation in the amount of the party actual monetary loss or,whichever is greater.b b.upon a finding by the court that the defendant willfully or knowingly violated the act,the court may award treble damages.b 
travel does not contest its membership in iatan or dispute that it provided contact information,including its fax number,for inclusion in iatan database.travel maintains that although it occasionally verified its contact information as requested by iatan,the documents did not grant travel express permission to receive advertisements from third parties such as msc or to receive those ads by fax.
affidavit of stacy fisher 
before reviewing the circuit court grant of summary judgment,we first consider the affidavit of travel office manager stacy fisher describing a questionnaire that fisher completed and returned to in december.travel moved to strike fisher affidavit,contending it was obtained in violation of illinois supreme court rule.the circuit court stated that its grant of summary judgment for defendants did not rely on fisher testimony.however,the circuit court discussed travel motion to strike the affidavit and addressed the manner in which the affidavit was procured,concluding that counsel for defendants did not violate the discovery rules.
evidence that would be inadmissible at trial may not be considered in support of or in opposition to a motion for summary judgment.see fabiano city of palos hills,d.therefore,it is necessary to review the circuit court denial of the motion to strike fisher affidavit to determine if the affidavit can be considered in our analysis of msc motion for summary judgment.
the parties first disagree on the standard of review to be applied to the denial of the motion to strike the affidavit.travel seeks de novo review of the circuit court ruling msc asserts that because travel moved to strike the affidavit as a sanction for an alleged discovery violation,the decision should be reviewed for an abuse of discretion.we agree with travel that de novo review is warranted because the circuit court ruling on the motion to strike was made in connection with the court ruling on a motion for summary judgment.see jackson graham,d.
in the affidavit,fisher stated that from about april to june,she was an office manager of travel chicago office.the office received a questionnaire from by fax.fisher completed the document and returned it by fax on december.the cover letter to the questionnaire stated,in part 
dear travel agency owner or manager 
we are in the process of updating your company profile in our traveledge research database,and would appreciate your taking a few minutes to fill out the update form.having current information enhances the quality of all our data on the travel agency market,and assures that suppliers will direct relevant promotions and fam familiarization trip information to our participants.
in moving for summary judgment,msc and the defendants argued that the december questionnaire,as well as other documents sent from travel to iatan,established travel express invitation and permission to receive advertisements by fax.
travel moved to strike fisher affidavit,contending that it was not given notice of the january,deposition of fisher by counsel for captaris.travel argues that the attorneys for captaris led fisher to believe she was being subpoenaed for a deposition at which she had no choice but to appear.travel asserted that what was represented to be a deposition actually amounted to an ex parte witness interview and that the affidavit should be stricken to punish the attorneys conduct.on appeal,travel renews that argument,asserting that the circuit court should not have allowed use of the affidavit because travel was not notified of fisher deposition and captaris improperly procured the affidavit as a result.
although the discovery rules are in place to govern the flow of information once a lawsuit has been filed,the rules do not bar all ex parte investigations after the filing of a complaint.fair automotive repair,service systems,d.fisher was terminated from her position at travel because the agency suspected her of engaging in unethical conduct.although travel asserts that fisher affidavit should be discounted due to her bias against the agency,travel was aware of fisher role in the pertinent facts,and counsel for travel deposed fisher before it responded to the motion for summary judgment travel therefore had the opportunity to explore and expose the motives for fisher testimony.we find no basis to reverse the circuit court denial of the motion to strike fisher affidavit.
ii.summary judgment for msc 
the proceeding in the circuit court involved several defendants however,msc is the only in this appeal.summary judgment is proper where the pleadings,depositions,admissions and affidavits on file,viewed in the light most favorable to the party,reveal no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.state farm mutual automobile insurance illinois farmers insurance.in reviewing the circuit court ruling on a motion for summary judgment,the appellate court considers anew the facts and law related to the case and determines whether the circuit court was correct in its decision.follis watkins,d.our review of a grant of summary judgment is de novo.see state farm,at,at.
the purpose of summary judgment is not to try a question of fact but,rather,to determine if a question of fact exists.forsythe clark usa.if the undisputed material facts could lead reasonable observers to divergent inferences,or where there is a dispute as to a material fact,summary judgment should be denied and the issue decided by the trier of fact.forsythe,at,at.summary judgment should not be entered unless the moving party right to judgment is clear and free from doubt.mydlach daimlerchrysler.
under the tcpa,an advertisement is unsolicited if it is transmitted without the recipient prior express invitation or permission.a a.travel argues that its inclusion in iatan database and the presentation of its contact information on various forms did not constitute its express invitation or permission for the transmission of advertisements.however,our analysis of the communications between travel and iatan reveals that travel approved the inclusion of its contact information in the iatan database,and travel representatives signed and returned documents that expressly stated the information would be provided to suppliers,thus inviting communications from those businesses.
to begin with,travel then doing business as ivory isle travel received a letter from iatan in may,which stated,in relevant part

iatan database is unique and plays an essential role within the industry to identify legitimate travel sales outlets.that is why we are currently in the process of updating our system so that we may better serve you,our valuable customer.

the survey was returned to iatan by ivory isle travel with the responses correlating to the agency clientele.the bottom of the page was labeled an information disclosure authorization and listed the address,phone number,fax number,address and web address of ivory isle travel and a place for corrections to be made to that information.the authorization was signed by howard scharf,then the vice president of travel 
the record reflects that between august and may,iatan requested on at least three occasions that travel verify its contact information for use by industry customers or industry participants.a representative of travel complied with each request by a form or release and returning it to iatan,often by fax.according to the discovery deposition of travel office manager rosemarie mcguire,mcguire completed and returned a form to iatan in august because travel wanted iatan to inform suppliers of travel contact information,including its iatan number.a similar communication in april stated that the contact information was for inclusion into the iatan database and that the database purpose was to aid in the administration of iatan programs to provide contact information to other industry participants.a form that travel received in may stated that t he applicant authorizes iatan to release the information contained herein to any industry supplier that may wish to use the applicant services.in addition,as we have previously discussed,fisher completed and returned a questionnaire to in december to ensure that our office would receive targeted materials from travel suppliers,including by fax.
on appeal,travel argues that the documents it executed did not establish its express consent under the tcpa.no illinois case has addressed the express invitation or permission language of the statute.the illinois supreme court only opinion involving the tcpa did not discuss the topic of consent.see valley forge insurance swiderski electronics,addressing insurer duty to defend lawsuit against insured brought under tcpa.the united states district court for the northern district of illinois recently denied a defendant motion to dismiss a tcpa claim.in sadowski online,llc,c,wl.february,the federal district court observed that it was required to accept as true the allegation of the plaintiff doctor that he had no prior business relationship with the defendant the court referred to an exception inserted in the tcpa in that classifies faxes between parties with an established business relationship as transactional and outside the statute scope.see b c i supp.
many published decisions regarding the tcpa have involved challenges under the first amendment and the commerce clause of the united states constitution and have included due process and equal protection arguments.see,missouri ex rel.nixon american blast fax,cir,cert.denied,d restrictions on unsolicited fax communications do not violate first amendment chair king,gte mobilnet of houston.
given this lack of direct precedent,travel compares its situation to that of the plaintiff in travel travel,kirkwood,jen.in that case,the plaintiff travel agency sued an airline ticket consolidator under the tcpa for sending unsolicited advertisements by fax.the missouri appellate court affirmed the trial court grant of summary judgment for the travel agency and an award of plus court costs.travel kirkwood,at.the agency executed a form identical to the iatan membership form in this case,which stated in pertinent part the applicant authorizes iatan to release the information contained herein to any industry supplier that may wish to use the applicant services.travel kirkwood,at.
on appeal,the defendant argued that the agency agreed to receive faxed advertisements by its affiliation with iatan and its completion of the membership form.travel kirkwood,at.the missouri appellate court concluded that whether the agency iatan membership constituted prior express invitation or permission under the tcpa was,as the trial court had determined,a question of law and that the agency had not given its express consent to receive faxes.travel k
