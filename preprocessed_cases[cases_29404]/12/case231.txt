in this appeal,mcimetro access transmission services llc mci challenges the legality,under the telecommunications act of the act,see west supp,of three aspects of the interconnection agreement between it and bellsouth telecommunications,bellsouth that the north carolina utilities commission ncuc arbitrated and approved.specifically,mci argues that the provision in the interconnection agreement allowing bellsouth to charge mci the incremental cost of transporting calls originating on bellsouth network from the originating caller local calling area to mci distant point of interconnection violates b that the provision in the interconnection agreement restricting mci use of bellsouth unbundled network elements under certain circumstances violates various fcc rules and that the provision in the interconnection agreement limiting bellsouth obligation to provide access to trunking to only those circumstances where there is insufficient traffic to support trunks violates f.mci initiated this action in the united states district court for the eastern district of north carolina pursuant to the act judicial review procedure.see e.the district court found the challenged provisions to be consistent with federal law and accordingly granted summary judgment in favor of bellsouth.mci appeals,and for the reasons that follow,we reverse in part,vacate in part,and remand for further proceedings.
prior to the passage of the act,the laws of the various states governed the provision of local telephone service,and almost without exception,each state conferred an exclusive franchise to a single company to provide such service.under the protection of these monopolies,each of these companies,called local exchange carriers lecs,built the infrastructure necessary to provide local telephone services,including elements such as the local loops wires connecting telephones to switches,the switches computerized equipment routing calls to their destinations,and the transport trunks high capacity wires transmitting traffic between switches.see at t iowa utils,d.thus,not only were these lecs the only entities allowed by law to provide local telephone service,they were the only entities with the networks necessary to do so.
through the act,congress sought to supplant the system of monopoly in favor of a system of free competition.in addition to the state laws that protected existing from competition,see,congress,recognizing both that the provision of local service required significant infrastructure and that the prohibitive cost of duplicating an incumbent lec infrastructure would be an insuperable barrier to entry,imposed on incumbents a number of affirmative duties intended to facilitate market entry by potential competitors.see c west.two of these duties are relevant to the issues mci raises in this appeal.
first,congress required incumbent lecs to interconnect their networks with the new networks constructed by the new entrants,known as competing lecs clecs.see c.such interconnection is necessary to the viability of the system envisioned by the act because,absent interconnection,customers of different lecs in the same local calling area would not be able to call each other,and clecs consequently would never attract customers.under this provision,an incumbent must allow a clec to select any point of interconnection poi with the incumbent network that is technically feasible,c b,and must provide interconnection on rates,terms,and conditions that are just,reasonable,and nondiscriminatory,c d.pursuant to the federal communications commission fcc regulations,just,reasonable,and nondiscriminatory interconnection requires incumbents to provide access to trunking upon request for interconnection where technically feasible.a trunk is a single trunk connecting the clec switch to the incumbent switch for transmission of traffic both to and from the incumbent,as opposed to two separate trunks,each dedicated to transmitting traffic in one direction.
second,congress required incumbents to lease the constituent elements of their local networks,loops,switches,to clecs on a separately priced,or unbundled basis.c.the incumbents also must allow the clecs to use leased unbundled network elements unes to provide any telecommunications service,see,a term defined by statute as the offering of telecommunications for a fee,west.as with interconnection,incumbents must make unes available on rates,terms,and conditions that are just,reasonable,and nondiscriminatory.c.
the act likewise imposes obligations on all lecs,incumbents and clecs alike,see b,one of which is relevant here.under b,each lec has the duty to establish reciprocal compensation arrangements for the transport and termination of telecommunications.reciprocal compensation agreements must provide for the mutual and reciprocal recovery by each carrier of costs associated with the transport and termination on each carrier network facilities of calls that originate on the network facilities of the other carrier.d a.in other words,for calls generated on one lec network and bound for a destination on another lec network,the receiving lec may charge the originating lec for the cost of transporting the call from the poi to its destination and terminating that call with the intended recipient.
in addition to imposing these and other substantive requirements,congress established a procedural framework through which incumbents and clecs are to negotiate the clecs entry into the incumbent market.first,the parties must attempt to establish terms of interconnection through negotiation.see a.to the extent they can not reach agreement,either lec may ask the governing state utility commission to conduct an arbitration to resolve the disputed issues.see b.the results of that arbitration are then memorialized in an interconnection agreement between the lecs,which is then submitted for approval to the state utility commission.e.a party aggrieved by the state utility commission resolution of disputed issues may seek review of that decision in federal district court,which has exclusive jurisdiction over such matters.e.
in this case,mci challenges aspects of its most recent interconnection agreement with bellsouth that resulted from arbitration before the ncuc.mci and bellsouth began negotiating their first interconnection agreement in north carolina in,shortly after passage of the act.as this interconnection agreement approached expiration,the parties began negotiating a new interconnection agreement,and on april,mci petitioned the ncuc to arbitrate unresolved issues.on april,the ncuc issued its recommended arbitration order.see in re petition of mcimetro access transmission services llc for arbitration of certain terms and conditions of proposed agreement with bellsouth telecommunications.concerning interconnection and resale under the telecommunications act of,docket no,sub,recommended arbitration order ncuc,first arbitration order.at.mci filed objections to the first arbitration order,contesting,inter alia,the issues it raises here.on august,the ncuc ruled on mci objections and required the parties to file a composite agreement.see in re petition of mcimetro access transmission services,llc for arbitration of certain terms and conditions of proposed agreement with bellsouth telecommunications.concerning interconnection and resale under telecommunications act of,order ruling on objections and requiring the filing of the composite agreement,docket no,sub.ncuc,second arbitration order.at.on november,following the aforementioned ruling,the parties filed their final composite interconnection agreement.
on november,mci filed suit in the district court challenging three aspects of the interconnection agreement that the ncuc had arbitrated and approved the ncuc decision to allow to charge mci the incremental cost of transporting calls generated on bellsouth network from the originating caller local calling area to mci distant poi the decision to restrict mci use of bellsouth unbundled network elements under certain circumstances and the decision to require bellsouth to provide access to trunking,if technically feasible,only where there is insufficient traffic to support trunking.after briefing on for summary judgment,the district court granted summary judgment to bellsouth on all issues.mci now appeals.
we review de novo both the district court grant of summary judgment and the ncuc interpretation of the act and the federal regulations enacted pursuant thereto,and accord no deference to the ncuc interpretations of federal law.at t comms.of,bell,cir.we note that the parties challenge neither the ncuc findings of fact nor the legality of the fcc regulations.
the first issue we consider is whether bellsouth can charge mci for the cost of transporting local calls originating on bellsouth network to mci chosen poi,when that poi happens to be outside of the local calling area where the call originated.because this issue is a of the differences between bellsouth and mci respective network architectures,a brief word about those architectures is helpful in understanding the legal question before us.according to the ncuc,
this issue exists because mci and bellsouth have each built and intend to utilize totally separate and different networks for the provision of local service in north carolina.each carrier local network was designed to be the most efficient and for that carrier.bellsouth stated that its system consists of a number of local networks that have developed over time and each local network is characterized by the use of multiple local switches.also,as commented on by bellsouth,mci has a single switch in north carolina.
first arbitration order at.at.
in exercising its right under c b to designate a technically feasible poi,mci decided to interconnect with bellsouth network at only one point in the north carolina local access and transport area lata,through its single north carolina switch.therefore,all traffic between mci and bellsouth customers must pass through that one poi,regardless of the locations of the two customers.this arrangement means,for example,that when a bellsouth customer wants to call her neighbor,an mci customer,bellsouth must transport that call through mci one poi,even though that poi might be hundreds of miles away.thus,as a consequence of mci independent decision respecting network construction and,the decision to use one switch in north carolina rather than multiple switches,and to interconnect through that one switch must incur greater costs for transporting routine local traffic.in arbitration before the ncuc,bellsouth proposed to resolve this perceived inequity by requiring mci to pay it the incremental of transporting traffic destined for mci network from the relevant local calling area to the poi.the ncuc adopted proposal and ordered the provision be included in the final interconnection agreement.
mci argues that this provision in the interconnection agreement is contrary to federal law.mci points specifically to fcc rule b,one of the several rules comprising the fcc regime governing reciprocal compensation for the transport and termination of telecommunications traffic as required by b.see.rule b states,a lec may not assess charges on any other telecommunications carrier for telecommunications traffic that originates on the lec network.b.because bellsouth provision is an assessment of charges for traffic that originates on bellsouth own network,mci argues,the provision is contrary to rule b and thus is illegal.moreover,mci notes,the wireline communications bureau the wireline bureau,a subdivision of the fcc,in a case concerning interconnection in virginia,has rejected a similar provision as being discordant with rule b.see in re petition of worldcom.pursuant to section e of the communications act for preemption of the jurisdiction of the virginia state corporation commission regarding interconnection disputes with verizon virginia,and for expedited arbitration,virginia arbitration order.
bellsouth counters that the proposed is not reciprocal compensation,but rather a form of reimbursement for the cost of interconnection that bellsouth submits is permissible under fcc rules.in support of its position,bellsouth points to the report and order wherein the fcc adopted initial rules to implement the act.see in re implementation of the local competition in the telecommunications act of,local competition order.bellsouth notes that,in paragraph of this order,the fcc,in concluding that cost was not a relevant factor in determining whether a clec requested point of interconnection was technically feasible,stated,o f course,a requesting carrier that wishes a technically feasible but expensive interconnection would,pursuant to section d,be required to bear the cost of that interconnection,including a reasonable profit.id.at.and,later in that same order,the fcc,in discussing its rules for the physical act of interconnection,noted that,because competing carriers must usually compensate incumbent lecs for the additional costs incurred by providing interconnection,competitors have an incentive to make economically efficient decisions about where to interconnect.id.at emphasis added.these statements,bellsouth argues,show that the fcc intended for incumbents to be able to shift the cost of interconnection to clecs.because the provision at issue here relates to the cost of interconnection,bellsouth argument goes,it is not governed by the reciprocal compensation regime at all,and rule b is thus inapplicable.
bellsouth points to a decision by the fcc in a proceeding arising under as evidence that its provision is acceptable.see in re application of verizon pennsylvania,et.for authorization to provide,interlata services in pennsylvania,pennsylvania order.the pennsylvania order addressed the application of verizon,a former bell operating company and incumbent lec in pennsylvania,under to provide long distance services in pennsylvania.this order is relevant,bellsouth argues,because under,former bell operating companies who intend to provide long distance service must satisfy a number of requirements,one of which being that they allow interconnection with their local exchange networks in accordance with and.c.in conducting its review of verizon application to provide service in pennsylvania,the fcc concluded that verizon had satisfied its interconnection obligations,even though verizon was imposing a charge like the one at issue here.this ruling,bellsouth asserts,proves the legality of its provision.
bellsouth attempts to evade the unambiguous language of rule b are ultimately unavailing.first,to accept bellsouth position that the provision here is a permissible charge for the cost of interconnection,the term interconnection must be interpreted broadly to include not only the physical act of connecting the networks,but also the ongoing state of interconnectivity.so interpreted,the cost of transporting traffic to a distant interconnection point is a cost of interconnection because it is necessitated by the ongoing state of interconnectivity at mci chosen poi.the fcc,however,squarely rejected such a broad interpretation of that term in the local competition order.see at.in its notice of proposed rulemaking nprm preceding the issuance of the local competition order,the fcc sought comment on whether the term interconnection might refer only to the physical linking of two networks or to both the linking of facilities and the transport and termination of traffic.id.at.the fcc adopted the former definition we conclude that the term interconnection under section c refers only to the physical linking of two networks for the mutual exchange of traffic.id.at.therefore,because the cost of interconnection is only the cost associated with the physical act of linking one network to another and not the recurring cost of transport and termination of traffic,the charge imposed by bellsouth here can not be characterized as a cost of interconnection that is permitted by fcc rules 
furthermore,contrary to bellsouth assertions,the fcc decision in the pennsylvania order does not validate the legality of its proposal.in the brief portion of pennsylvania order that addresses the issue,the fcc fails to mention rule b even once and addresses the propriety of only obliquely through reference to an intercarrier compe
