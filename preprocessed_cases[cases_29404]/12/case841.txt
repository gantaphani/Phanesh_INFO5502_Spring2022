this is an appeal from a decision of the patent trial and appeal board in an inter partes review.the board held various claims of a patent owned by wi fi one,llc wi fi,to be anticipated.we affirm.
the patent at issue in this case,patent the patent,is directed to a method for improving the efficiency by which messages are sent from a receiver to a sender in a telecommunications system to advise the sender that errors have occurred in a particular message.
in the technology described in the patent,data is transmitted in discrete packets known as protocol data units pdus.the useful data or payload in those packets is carried in what are called user data pdus d pdus.each d pdu contains a sequence number that uniquely identifies that packet.the sequence number allows the receiving computer to determine when it either has received packets out of order or has failed to receive particular packets at all,so that the receiver can correctly combine the packets in the proper order or direct the sender to retransmit particular packets as necessary.
the receiver uses a different type of packet,a status pdu s pdu,to notify the sender of the it failed to receive.the patent is concerned with organizing the information contained in s pdus efficiently so as to minimize the size of the s pdus,thus conserving bandwidth.
the patent discloses a number of methods for encoding the sequence numbers of missing packets in s pdus.some of those methods use lists that indicate which packets are missing by displaying the ranges of the sequence numbers of the missing packets.other methods are based on bitmaps that use binary numbers to report on the status of a fixed number of packets relative to a starting point.
depending on how many packets fail to be properly delivered and the particular sequence numbers of the errant packets,different methods can be more or less efficient for encoding particular numbers and ranges of errors.in order to leverage the benefits of the different encoding methods,the patent discloses an s pdu that can combine multiple message types in an arbitrary order,with no rule on the number of messages or the type of messages that can be included in the s pdu.patent,ll.using that technology,s pdus can be constructed with a combination of the encoding types best suited for the particular errors being encoded,so that the s pdu can be more compact than an s pdu that uses a single encoding type.
in,broadcom petitioned for inter partes review of the patent,challenging numerous claims.prior to the institution decision,wi fi argued that broadcom was barred from seeking review of the patent.wi fi argued that broadcom was in privity with certain entities that were involved in parallel district court litigation involving the patent,and that because those entities would be from seeking inter partes review of the patent,broadcom was as well.see b.
filed a motion seeking discovery designed to support its argument,but after briefing the board denied the motion.it found that wi fi has not provided evidence to show that there is more than a mere possibility that the discovery even exists or that the discovery has more than a mere possibility of producing useful evidence on the crucial privity factor control of the district court litigation by broadcom in a way that would foreclose it from seeking inter partes review.
after the board denied wi fi petition for rehearing,wi fi petitioned this court for a writ of mandamus.this court denied the petition.in re telefonaktiebolaget lm ericsson.fed.cir.
the board instituted inter partes review of the patent,finding that there was a reasonable likelihood that the challenged claims were anticipated by patent to seo.the board declined to institute review based on another reference because it found that reference would be redundant in light of seo.
seo teaches improvements to what are known as negative acknowledgement nak frames.nak frames are sent by the receiving unit to inform the transmitting unit that frames sent by the transmitting unit were misdelivered.the seo method uses a single packet to provide information about multiple misdelivered frames,so that only one nak control frame for all missed user data frames is transmitted to a transmitting station to require a retransmission of the missed user data when a timer for an nak is actually expired.seo,ll.
seo describes the structure of the disclosed nak frames.the frames include a field called that indicates how the nak frame represents missing frames.if the is set to,then the missing frames are encoded as a list,and the frame requests retransmission of all user data frames between the first missing frame and the last,represented by the first and last values.if the is set to,then the nak frame transmits information about the missing transmitted frames using a bitmap.in that case,the nak frame contains the field to identify the starting point of the bitmap and the field to transmit the bitmap.
before the board,wi fi argued that the field disclosed in seo is not a type identifier field and that seo therefore does not satisfy the type identifier field limitation of the patent.wi fi further argued that,even if seo discloses that feature,the field is not found within a message field,as required by the claims at issue.the board rejected those arguments,found that seo disclosed all the limitations of the challenged claims of the patent,and therefore held those claims to be unpatentable.the board also rejected wi fi argument that claim of the patent required some sort of length field,which seo did not disclose.finally,the board held that wi fi had not shown that broadcom was in privity with the district court defendants,and therefore broadcom was not barred from filing a petition for inter partes review.
on appeal,wi fi continues to press its argument that broadcom was barred from petitioning for inter partes review because it was in privity with a district court litigant.
the board may not institute inter partes review if the petition requesting the proceeding is filed more than year after the date on which the petitioner,real party in interest,or privy of the petitioner is served with a complaint alleging infringement of the patent.b.to determine whether a petitioner is in privity with a district court litigant,the board conducts a flexible analysis that seeks to determine whether the relationship between the purported privy and the relevant other party is sufficiently close such that both should be bound by the trial outcome and related estoppels.office patent trial practice guide,fed.reg.
this court has previously addressed whether a patent owner can argue on appeal that the board improperly allowed a privy of a district court litigant to pursue an inter partes review.the statute governing the board institution of inter partes review provides that t he determination by the director whether to institute an inter partes review under this section shall be final and nonappealable.d.in achates reference publishing,apple,fed.cir,we held that section d prohibits this court from reviewing the board determination to initiate ipr proceedings based on its assessment of the of b,even if such assessment is reconsidered during the merits phase of proceedings and restated as part of the board final written decision.
wi fi does not dispute that achates renders its challenge to the board timeliness ruling nonappealable if achates is still good law.what wi fi argues is that the supreme court recent decision in cuozzo speed technologies,llc lee,d,implicitly overruled achates in cuozzo the patent owner challenged the board institution decision,arguing that the board should not have instituted inter partes review,because the petition failed to identif y,in writing and with particularity,each claim challenged,the grounds on which the challenge to each claim is based,and the evidence that supports the grounds for the challenge to each claim.a.based on the language of section d,the supreme court held that the board decision on that issue was unreviewable.cuozzo.at.in the course of its opinion,the court clarified the scope of the preclusion of review 
i n light of d own text and the presumption favoring review,we emphasize that our interpretation applies where the grounds for attacking the decision to institute inter partes review consist of questions that are closely tied to the application and interpretation of statutes related to the patent office decision to initiate inter partes review.this means that we need not,and do not,decide the precise effect of d on appeals that implicate constitutional questions,that depend on other less closely related statutes,or that present other questions of interpretation that reach,in terms of scope and impact,well beyond this section.thus,contrary to the dissent suggestion,we do not categorically preclude review of a final decision where a petition fails to give sufficient notice such that there is a due process problem with the entire proceeding,nor does our interpretation enable the agency to act outside its statutory limits by,for example,canceling a patent claim for indefiniteness under in inter partes review.such shenanigans may be properly reviewable in the context of and under the administrative procedure act,which enables reviewing courts to set aside agency action that is contrary to constitutional right,in excess of statutory jurisdiction,or arbitrary and capricious.

we see nothing in the cuozzo decision that suggests achates has been implicitly overruled.the supreme court stated that the prohibition against reviewability applies to questions that are closely tied to the application and interpretation of statutes related to the patent office decision to initiate inter partes review.section is just such a statute.the set forth in section addresses who may seek inter partes review,while section governs what form a petition must take.both statutes govern the decision to initiate inter partes review.
wi fi arguments to the contrary are unavailing.wi fi argues that cuozzo tied the limitation of judicial review to the patent office ability to make its substantive patentability determination as embodied in a.to the extent that wi fi means to suggest that the court limited the statutory bar against judicial review to the board substantive determination at the time of institution,whether a particular reference raises a reasonable likelihood of anticipating or rendering a challenged claim obvious,we disagree.the supreme court extended the preclusion of judicial review to statutes related to the decision to institute it did not limit the rule of preclusion to substantive patentability determinations made at the institution stage,as the facts of cuozzo itself make clear.subsection a,which the court addressed in cuozzo,is not related to substantive patentability,but instead is addressed to the conditions for seeking review in that case,the level of specificity required in the petition.
wi fi also argues that the reviewability ban is limited to issues arising under section,because of the statutory text providing that a determination by the director whether to institute inter partes review under this section is not reviewable.d.this court explicitly rejected that argument in achates.see at finally,achates also contends that d does not limit this court review of the timeliness of apple petition under,because d says t he determination by the director whether to institute an inter partes review under this section shall be final and nonappealable emphasis added.achates reading is too crabbed and is contradicted by this court precedent.the words under this section in modify the word institute and proscribe review of the institution determination for whatever reason.nothing in cuozzo casts doubt on that interpretation of the statute,especially in light of the fact that the supreme court held that the particularity requirement,which is contained in section,is nonappealable.
wi fi next argues that issues should be reviewable because board practice allows parties to argue those issues at trial.that argument,too,was rejected in achates.at that the board considered the in its final determination does not mean the issue suddenly becomes available for review or that the issue goes to the board ultimate authority to invalidate the board is always entitled to reconsider its own decisions.wi fi has not pointed to anything in cuozzo that casts doubt on that reasoning.
finally,wi fi argues that the board denial of its request for discovery on the issue is an example of the shenanigans that the supreme court in cuozzo suggested would be reviewable.we disagree.the board simply declined to grant discovery because wi fi had not made a sufficient showing to support its request.to hold that such a ruling falls within the narrow exception to the supreme court unreviewability holding would render routine procedural orders reviewable,contrary to the entire thrust of the cuozzo decision.
wi fi also challenges the board substantive determination that seo anticipates the patent.wi fi brings three separate challenges that seo does not disclose a type identifier field,that seo does not disclose a type identifier field within a message field,and that the board misconstrued the term type identifier field.
claim of the patent,which is representative,provides as follows 
a method for minimizing feedback responses in an arq protocol,comprising the steps of 
sending a plurality of first data units over a communication link 
receiving said plurality of first data units and 
responsive to the receiving step,constructing a message field for a second data unit,said message field including a type identifier field and at least one of a sequence number field,a length field,and a content field.
wi fi argues that seo does not disclose a type identifier field because it discloses only a single type of message,and that the single type of message contains fields for encoding errors as both lists and bitmaps.wi fi relies on figure of seo,shown below 
based on figure,wi fi argues that the data structure in seo contains fields for the list type of coding,which are entitled first,last,fcs,and padding,and fields for the bitmap type of coding,which are entitled,and.
wi fi argues that in seo all fields are always present,either as useful values or as padded zeros,placeholders,regardless of the value of the field.therefore,wi fi argues,the field does not function as a type identifier field that identifies the type of coding used in seo data structure.
the board rejected that argument,relying on the disclosure in seo that certain fields exist depending on the value of the field.see seo,ll.when a value of the field is,the receiving station requests a retransmission of missed user data frames numbered a field first through a field last,ll.if a value of the field nak type is,the field exists.based on those portions of the seo specification,the board concluded that seo discloses a control frame that includes certain fields only when is and includes other fields only when is.accordingly,the board rejected wi fi argument that is not a type identifier field.
the board also credited the testimony of broadcom expert that it would not make sense to include unnecessary fields in a message.it was entirely reasonable for the board to read the term exist in seo in that way.substantial evidence therefore supports the board conclusion that seo discloses the type identifier field feature recited in the patent.
wi fi also argues that even if seo discloses a type identifier field,seo does not anticipate the patent,because the field in seo is part of the s pdu header rather than the message field,as required by the claims.
the board rejected that argument,finding that the patent does not require the type identifier field to be in any particular part of the message,and that,in any event,seo field was included in the message field.we agree with the board.nothing in the patent specifies whether the type identifier field must be located in the header or any other specific part of the message.
wi fi also argues that a prior amendment to claim shows that the claim is drawn to the distinction between the message body and the header.during the prosecution of the patent,wi fi offered the following amendment 
said message field including a type identifier fiel
