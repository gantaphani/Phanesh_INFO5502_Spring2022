robert biggerstaff and douglas mckenna filed petitions for review of a final rule of the federal communications commission implementing the junk fax prevention act of jfpa,stat.codified at,by adopting an exemption to the prohibition against unsolicited telephone facsimile advertisements for entities with whom the recipient has an established business relationship ebr.in the matter of rules and regulations implementing the telephone consumer protection act of junk fax protection act of,order.neither petitioner,however,challenges the final rule itself,but rather each focuses on either a past administrative action by the commission or the future effect of the wording of the order accompanying the final rule.biggerstaff concern is that a ebr exemption,in the matter of rules and regulations implementing the telephone consumer protection act of,report,is contrary to the express text and legislative history of the telephone consumer protection act of tcpa,stat.although biggerstaff has standing and his claim is ripe,his challenge to the ebr exemption is beyond the scope of the rulemaking,which was to implement the jfpa.therefore,we must dismiss his petition as untimely.mckenna concern is that permissive wording in the order wrongly implies that the jfpa grants statutory authority to send unsolicited faxes when an ebr only grants an exemption from federal liability under the statute.we must dismiss his petition because mckenna lacks standing.he proposes no substantive changes to the order that will affect the legal rights of those who send unsolicited faxes and only speculates that textual revisions to the order would reduce the number of unsolicited faxes he receives and thereby redress the harm he alleges.
in,congress enacted the tcpa,which prohibited the sending of unsolicited advertisement s to telephone facsimile machines.tcpa b c,stat.at.an unsolicited advertisement was defined as any material advertising the commercial availability or quality of any property,goods,or services which is transmitted to any person without that person prior express invitation or permission.id.a,stat.at.the tcpa provided a private right of action for injunctive relief and monetary damages in state court.id.b,stat.at.in a footnote to the report implementing the tcpa,the commission stated 
in banning telephone facsimile advertisements,the tcpa leaves the commission without discretion to create exemptions from or limit the effects of the prohibition thus,such transmissions are banned in our rules as they are in the tcpa.we note,however,that facsimile transmission from persons or entities who have an ebr with the recipient can be deemed to be invited or permitted by the recipient.

upon reconsideration in,the commission reaffirmed its recognition of the ebr exemption,explaining that the existence of an ebr establishes consent to receive telephone facsimile advertisement transmissions.in the matter of rules and regulations implementing the telephone consumer protection act of.however,in,the commission revers ed its conclusion that an ebr provides companies with the necessary express permission to send faxes to their customers,in the matter of rules and regulations implementing the telephone consumer protection act of,rule,and instead required that permission to send fax advertisements must be provided in writing,id.at.in the preamble to the rule the commission emphasize d that,prior to the effectuation of rules contained herein,companies that transmitted facsimile advertisements to customers with whom they had ebr s were in compliance with the commission existing rules.id.at.however,the rule never went into effect the commission extended the effective date on several occasions,eventually doing so i n light of the developments in congress in the matter of rules and regulations implementing the telephone consumer protection act of fax ban coalition petition for further extension of stay.
in july,congress enacted the jfpa,which amended the tcpa to codify an ebr exemption to the prohibition against unsolicited facsimile advertisements.b c i.the commission issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to implement the rule changes required by the jfpa,in the matter of rules and regulations implementing the telephone consumer protection act of junk fax protection act of,nprm,and further stayed the effective date of the rule until the conclusion of the new rulemaking,id.at.biggerstaff and mckenna filed comments in response to the nprm and now petition for review of the order promulgating the final rule.
on appeal,biggerstaff focuses on the lingering effect of the ebr exemption and seeks to have the court set aside that exemption on the ground that it contradicts the express text and legislative history of the tcpa.mckenna,in turn,focuses on the future effect of the jfpa ebr exemption and seeks to have the term permits changed to does not prohibit in the order in view of the statutory text,which merely exempts from federal liability those who send unsolicited facsimile advertisements on the basis of an ebr.for the following reasons,the court can not address the merits of either petitioner contentions.
as a threshold matter regarding the court jurisdiction,the commission challenges the article iii standing of both petitioners on the ground that neither can show injury in fact that was caused by the conduct of the commission and that can be redressed by judicial relief.see lujan defenders of wildlife,d.we agree as to mckenna,but not biggerstaff.
biggerstaff asserts that he has standing to challenge the final rule because he has junk faxes subject to the ebr administrative defense that he has refrained from suing on because of the likelihood he will face the defense.pet r br.at.the commission views his proffers of injury to be based on speculation both that he has a viable and timely claim under the tcpa for damages arising from a december,fax transmission appended to his brief and that the sender of that fax might raise an ebr defense.the commission relies on platte river whooping crane critical habitat maintenance trust ferc,where the court instructed that a llegations of injury based on predictions regarding future legal proceedings are too speculative to invoke the jurisdiction of an art icle iii court,id.at quoting whitmore arkansas,d second alteration in original.
biggerstaff states in a sworn declaration that he has confronted the ebr defense in previous lawsuits and is therefore likely to encounter it again 
in my previous junk fax cases,many defendant s have raise d established business relationship defenses.as a result,i have been subject to onerous discovery requests and depositions seeking complete records of all my business contacts and transactions,such as many years of bank receipts,credit card bills and the like.this has been done by defendants attempting to discover any form of an established business relationship with me.this produces the effect of a negative suit value and effectively renders the salutary purposes of the statute and the protection of the statute as written by congress as effectively useless to me.

unlike the standing claims presented in platte river and whitmore,which relied on predictions about court decisions,biggerstaff concern that future defendants will raise an ebr defense to facsimile transmissions rests on his personal experience that such a defense is,if not certain,definitely likely.biggerstaff assertion of injury is thus more akin to that in pennell city of san jose,d,where the supreme court concluded that t he likelihood of enforcement of an ordinance by tenants,with the concomitant probability that a landlord rent will be reduced below what he or she would otherwise be able to obtain in the absence of the ordinance,is a sufficient threat of actual injury to satisfy art.iii requirement that the plaintiff demonstrate a realistic danger of sustaining a direct injury as a result of the governmental action at issue,id.at.quoting babbitt united farm workers union,d.the court has recognized that a prediction of injury based on experience suffices to show injury in fact to the extent that p
