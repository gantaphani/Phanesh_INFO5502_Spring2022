jon and michelle sweeney owned and operated technology,a company that manufactured and sold cable television equipment.a federal grand jury charged the sweeneys with manufacturing and distributing cable descramblers intended for unauthorized interception of cable signals and conspiracy to do so,see,and currency structuring,see.the grand jury also charged sweeney with bankruptcy fraud,see.a jury found the sweeneys guilty on all the submitted counts,except the jury acquitted sweeney of the bankruptcy fraud charge.the district sentenced sweeney to months imprisonment and a fine and sweeney to months imprisonment and a fine.the sweeneys now appeal their convictions and sentences.for the following reasons,we affirm.
background 
from approximately to,the sweeneys owned and operated technology.manufactured cable television descramblers and other cable television equipment,which it then sold to wholesalers and distributors.cable television providers encrypt their cable signals,and the descrambler function contained in some cable boxes reverses that encryption,allowing for a clear picture to be viewed manufactured and sold several models of descramblers,and one of their models was the viewmaster.most of the descramblers sold were nonaddressable,meaning that they would not respond to signals from a cable provider that restrict the viewer access to encrypted programs.in this way,users of the viewmaster and other descramblers could obtain cable programming without paying for it.descramblers,whether addressable or not,also have legitimate uses they allow users to save descrambler rental fees by informing their cable provider that they already own a descrambler and asking to be charged only for programming,and they allow users to display one cable signal on several different televisions.
additionally,sold authorization control devices,such as the pio.these devices can be installed before a cable provider descrambler and block the cable provider access control signals.like a nonaddressable descrambler,they allow the user to view cable programming without paying for it.the authorization control devices too have a potentially legitimate function in that they can be used to block access to certain signals,thereby serving as a parental control device.
the sweeneys employed several people at to manufacture descramblers.for instance,sweeney recruited her neighbor,bonnie mertes,who assembled descramblers between and.initially,sweeney paid mertes in cash.later,although mertes was working for,her paychecks came from nurses,a company owned by sweeney.mertes daughters also worked for intermittently,testing the circuit boards that were used in the descramblers.
at trial,the government first presented evidence relating to the charges of assisting in the unauthorized interception of cable signals and conspiracy.mertes testified about operations,including its manufacturing process,its payroll,and the tasks of various employees.robert kramer testified that he earned between and each week repairing defective descramblers.he also described the technical advice he gave sweeney about competitors descramblers.additionally,daniel quade and abe paquette,who operated core innovation systems,testified about their weekly purchases of large numbers of viewmaster from and their distribution to other wholesalers and.quade testified that he believed most purchasers of the viewmaster intended to use the device to steal cable programming.he went on to say that his customers reported that the viewmaster devices were working as intended,successfully descrambling cable programs.
michael muller testified as an expert witness,providing technical information about descramblers based on his work as a product security specialist and manager at motorola.muller explained that nonaddressable descramblers,such as the viewmaster,ignore access restrictions included in a cable provider signal and that authorization control devices,such as the pios,remove the access control instructions that a cable box would otherwise receive.consequently,both types of equipment allow their users to view cable television programming without paying for it.muller also testified that the only purpose of the nonaddressable function in a descrambler is to allow for the theft of cable programming.
several law enforcement officers also testified at trial,including officer steve miller of the elk river police department,who testified about his involvement in executing a search warrant at facility.while police were executing the warrant,sweeney arrived.the following exchange took place during officer miller testimony 
q.did you see him sweeney or did you have interaction with him shortly after he arrived at the business 
i was in the front and he came in.he identified himself with a formal minnesota driver license.i asked him if he wanted to give a statement,read him his miranda warning.he requested to call an attorney 
sweeney objected and moved for a mistrial,citing doyle ohio.the government claimed that the disclosure of sweeney invocation of his right to counsel was inadvertent.the district court offered a curative instruction,but the defendants both declined that offer.the district court then denied the motion for a mistrial.
after presenting its evidence relating to the charges of assisting in the unauthorized interception of cable signals and conspiracy,the government turned to the currency structuring charges.the indictment alleged thirteen counts of currency structuring.count alleged that the sweeneys aided and abetted each other in illegally structuring the payment for a chrysler town and country minivan.steven carbone,the dealership finance manager,testified that he told the sweeneys that he was required to file a currency transaction report for any cash transaction over.sweeney responded,then let not put down.sweeney gave carbone in cash,and carbone immediately returned of it to sweeney.sweeney then wrote a check for the balance of.count alleged that sweeney illegally structured another transaction involving a vehicle,this time the purchase of a ford focus.having already paid a cash deposit,sweeney again paid in cash and the balance of by check.when the salesman,richard wolfe,commented that this was a large amount of cash,sweeney replied,yeah,if you spent in cash,you would have to report it to the irs.
counts through charged sweeney with illegally structuring transactions at first national bank of elk river.each count corresponded to a different cash withdrawal or deposit by sweeney between march,and december.the district court dismissed as multiplicitous all but one of these counts,leaving only count to be submitted to the jury.count described a cash withdrawal by sweeney on october.however,the district court allowed the government to introduce evidence of the other ten transactions,described in counts through and through,along with other cash transactions not specifically identified in the indictment.and several bank employees testified about an inquiry that sweeney made on march,regarding currency transaction reporting requirements.in response to sweeney inquiry,bank employees informed her that any cash transaction in excess of had to be reported.
the jury found the sweeneys guilty on the charges of assisting in the unauthorized interception of cable signals and conspiracy to do so.sweeney was acquitted on the bankruptcy fraud count.the jury further found sweeney guilty of illegally structuring currency transactions related to both vehicle purchases.sweeney was also found guilty of illegally structuring the purchase of the minivan and structuring a currency transaction at the first national bank of elk river.the district court denied the sweeneys motions for judgment of acquittal and for a new trial.
at sentencing,the parties agreed and the district court concluded that section of the united states sentencing guidelines applied to the sweeneys convictions for assisting in the unauthorized interception of cable signals and conspiracy.section provides for a base offense level of and for an enhancement based on the amount of loss,termed the infringement amount.the arguments at sentencing focused primarily on the proper method for calculating the infringement amount.the district court found that,the gross revenues of,was a reasonable estimate of the infringement amount.the district court also credited an alternative infringement amount of,based on calculations by fbi special agent dean chappell and brian richert,a director of financial planning and analysis for comcast,a large cable television provider.opting for the lower figure,the district court increased the defendants base offense levels by levels,the enhancement corresponding to an infringement amount between million and million.
after making other rulings and adjustments that sweeney does not challenge on appeal,the district court arrived at an advisory sentencing guidelines range for sweeney of to months.after considering the factors set out in a,the court varied downward and sentenced sweeney to months imprisonment and a fine.
in calculating sweeney guidelines range,the district court applied a increase under section b for manufacturing infringing items.the court denied sweeney request for a reduction under section for having a minimal role in the offense but granted a reduction for her minor role.finally,sweeney argued that her base offense level for the currency structuring offenses should be reduced to under the safe harbor provision of section b because the funds involved in the currency structuring offenses were not the proceeds of illegal activity and she did not act with reckless disregard as to the source of the funds.in contrast,the government argued that sweeney offense level should be increased by levels under section b a because sweeney knew that the funds were from the sale of descramblers intended to be used for the unauthorized interception of cable programming.the district court held that it did not have sufficient evidence regarding the source of the funds and,therefore,denied both sweeney requested reduction and the government requested enhancement.arriving at a total offense level of and a criminal history category of i,the district court found sweeney advisory guidelines range to be to months.the court again varied downward after considering the a factors and sentenced sweeney to months imprisonment and a fine.the sweeneys now appeal.
ii.discussion 
the sweeneys each raise several issues on appeal.both and sweeney argue that there was insufficient evidence to convict them of assisting in the unauthorized interception of cable signals and conspiracy to do so.they also challenge the sufficiency of the evidence on count,structuring the payment for the minivan.likewise,sweeney challenges the sufficiency of the evidence related to count,structuring the payment for the ford focus.sweeney challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support her conviction on count,structuring a transaction at first national bank of elk river.sweeney also argues that the government violated doyle ohio,in its questioning of officer miller.with respect to sentencing,both defendants challenge the district court calculation of the infringement amount under.in addition,sweeney challenges the increase for manufacturing infringing items,the denial of a reduction for having a minimal role in the offense,and the denial of a reduction under the safe harbor provision of section.we address each argument in turn.
sufficiency of the in unauthorized interception 
the sweeneys challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to support their convictions for violating a.section prohibits assist ing in intercepting or receiving any communications service offered over a cable system,unless specifically authorized to do so by a cable operator or as may otherwise be specifically authorized by law.the statute goes on to define assist ing in intercepting or receiving to include the manufacture or distribution of equipment intended by the manufacturer or distributor as the case may be for unauthorized reception of any communications service offered over a cable system.id.a.we review the sufficiency of the evidence de novo,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict.reversal of a conviction is proper only if no reasonable jury could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.united states pliego,cir quoting united states kent,cir,cert.denied.
the sweeneys do not dispute that the products manufactured and sold could be used to intercept cable signals illegally.they point out,however,that congress has not made the manufacture or distribution of such products illegal per se.rather,the statute only criminalizes the manufacture or distribution of equipment that the manufacturer or distributor intends to be used for the unauthorized interception of cable service.the sweeneys claim that the government presented insufficient evidence of such an intent on their part,pointing to the alternative,legal uses of descramblers and authorization control devices.
because d irect evidence of a defendant mental state frequently is unavailable,the jury is entitled to scrutinize and make reasonable inferences from the defendant conduct and from all facts surrounding the incident in question.united states peters,cir internal citation and quotations omitted.here,the government presented sufficient evidence to allow a reasonable jury to find that the sweeneys intended the descramblers and authorization control devices manufactured and sold to be used to steal cable programming.muller,the government cable industry expert,testified that he was aware of no purpose for the nonaddressable feature of the descramblers that produced and sold other than facilitating the theft of cable programming.see also cont l cablevision,poll,cir finding that nonaddressable nature of cable boxes was evidence of intent intermedia partners se.qb,llc,the court finds persuasive the uncontroverted testimony that the decoding devices manufactured and sold by defendants have no legitimate purpose.similarly,quade,one of the owners of core innovation systems,testified that he knew the descramblers he purchased from and resold would eventually be used to intercept cable programming illegally.employee mertes testified about using a descrambler in her home that sweeney personally sold to her to receive premium programming without paying for it,just as muller and quade described.finally,news articles found in the sweeneys home detailed other criminal and civil prosecutions against people similarly engaged in manufacturing and distributing descramblers.see united states mills,cir noting that newspaper articles of schemes similar to the defendant were relevant to the defendant intent united states ellis,cir considering articles as evidence of knowledge and intent.together,the government evidence was sufficient to allow a reasonable jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the sweeneys intended that the descramblers and authorization control devices manufactured and sold be used for the unauthorized interception of cable signals and that the sweeneys therefore violated.see also comcast of.x,cir rejecting,in a civil case,an argument that the potential legitimate uses of a descrambler showed a lack of intent.
sufficiency of the 
the sweeneys also challenge the sufficiency of the evidence supporting their convictions on the conspiracy count.to prove conspiracy under,the government must show beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendants knowingly entered into an agreement or reached an understanding to commit a crime,and that at least one of the defendants overtly acted in furtherance of the agreement.united states farrell,cir quoting united states bertling,cir.using a special verdict form,the jury found that sweeney conspired with quade,paquette,kramer,and sweeney and that sweeney conspired with sweeney.as before,we examine this issue de novo,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict,and we will not reverse if any reasonable jury could have found the defendants guilty.pliego,at.
the sweeneys argue that there was no conspiratorial agreement,so there was no conspiracy,or at least no conspiracy they agreed to join.see united states,cir the essence of the crime of conspiracy is the agreement to commit an unlawful act.quoting iannelli united states.sweeney contends that his relationship with kramer,quade,and paquette was merely a relationship,not a conspiracy.see united states pizano,cir mere proof of a agreement without any prior or contemporaneous understanding does not support a conspiracy conviction because there is no common illegal purpose in such circumstances,the buyer purpose is to buy the seller purpose is to sell.quoting united states prieskorn,cir.however,sweeney offers little argument about whether the evidence showed an agreement with sweeney.sweeney contends that her involvement in operations was simply too limited to show a conspiratorial agreement with sweeney.
there is ample evidence to support the jury finding that the sweeneys formed an agreement with each other and therefore to support their convictions.a formal agreement is not required to create a conspiracy,and the existence of a conspiracy can be proved by direct or circumstantial evidence.united states williams,cir.jon and michelle sweeney jointly operated indeed the company was originally named j m fulfillment.sweeney deep involvement in is undisputed.while sweeney points to evidence,such as her family commitments,suggesting that she had very limited opportunity to participate in operations,the testimony of mertes and others undermines her claims.in reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence,we must not weigh the evidence or assess the credibility of witnesses.united states littlewind,cir quoting united states raplinger,cir,cert.denied.mertes testified that sweeney recruited her to work at.several witnesses testified that sweeney spent time assembling descramblers,preparing them for shipping,and preparing billing.at times,sweeney paid employees.thus,while sweeney can point to other testimony that could support a finding that she played a somewhat limited role in the manufacturing and distributing of descramblers,there is sufficient evidence for a jury to conclude that she and sweeney entered a conspiratorial agreement with the illegal purpose of assisting in the unauthorized interception of cable signals.we therefore affirm the sweeneys conspiracy convictions 
sufficiency of the structuring 
the sweeneys next challenge their convictions on counts,and,the currency structuring charges.although our standard of review again requires us to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict,pliego,at,the relevant facts are virtually undisputed,so we will focus on the pertinent legal principles.
generally speaking,domestic financial institutions are required to file reports on certain transactions that exceed a threshold amount designated by the secretary of the treasury.a.the relevant treasury regulations set this threshold at.see b.there is no dispute that cash withdrawals from bank accounts and cash purchases at car dealerships exceeding the threshold are both typically subject to the reporting requirement.see id.a,b,d viii.
federal law prohibits persons from structuring cash transactions to evade this reporting requirement.see c.specifically,c provides that n o person shall,for the purpose of evading the reporting requirements of section a structure or assist in structuring,or attempt to structure or assist in structuring,any transaction with one or more domestic financial institutions.in turn,the treasury regulations interpreting define what it means to structure a transaction as follows 
a person structures a transaction if that person conducts or attempts to conduct one or more transactions in currency,in any amount,at one or more financial institutions,on one or more days,in any manner,for the purpose of evading the reporting requirements under section of this part.in any manner includes,but is not limited to,the breaking down of a single sum of currency exceeding into smaller sums,including sums at or below,or the conduct of a transaction,or series of currency transactions,including transactions at or below.the transaction or transactions need not exceed the reporting threshold at any single financial institution on any single day in order to constitute structuring within the meaning of this definition.
gg.the regulations define the term transaction to include purchase s and withdrawal s,among other things.id.ii.we find that the treasury regulations accurately describe the offense of structuring a transaction in violation of c.accord united states van allen,cir united states macpherson,cir 
there is no real dispute about the elements of the alleged offense.as the district court instructed the jury,
the crime of currency structuring,as charged in counts eight,nine,and fifteen,has three elements,which are 
one,the defendant conducted or attempted to conduct a financial transaction that involved a domestic financial institution 
two,at the time the defendant conducted or attempted to conduct the financial transaction,the defendant knew of the domestic financial institution obligation to report currency transactions in excess of and 
three,the defendant purposefully structured the transaction with the intent to evade that reporting requirement.
accord van allen,at macpherson,at.
the sweeneys do not argue that the evidence was insufficient to establish either their knowledge of the reporting requirement or their intent to evade that requirement.a review of the evidence presented at trial leaves no doubt that the sweeneys knew about the reporting requirement and intended to evade it.the question,the sweeneys insist,is whether their acts amounted to structuring a transaction.
the sweeneys make two principal arguments in this vein.the first argument,pressed exclusively by sweeney,is that neither the purchase of the minivan count nor her cash withdrawal from the first national bank of elk river on october,count,qualifies as a transaction under c.each of those events,she asserts,merely involved a single transfer of currency.and,according to sweeney,a transfer in an amount less than the reporting threshold can not be illegally structured.we are not persuaded.
initially,we note that sweeney argument about the meaning of the term transaction under c amounts to a succession of ipse dixits.this entire subsection of sweeney brief is conclusory and noticeably lacking in relevant legal authority.in any event,the key premise of her a purchase or withdrawal in an amount less than is not a transaction and therefore can not be decisively refuted by the treasury regulations.specifically,the term transaction is defined in ii to include purchase s and withdrawal s.moreover,gg provides that a person structures a transaction,a purchase or withdrawal if that person conducts or attempts to conduct one or more transactions,purchases or withdrawals in currency,in any amount,in any manner,for the purpose of evading the reporting requirements.emphasis added.see also id.the transaction or transactions need not exceed the reporting threshold at any single financial institution on any single day in order to constitute structuring within the meaning of this definition.emphasis added.we therefore reject the notion that neither the purchase of the minivan nor the october withdrawal qualifies as a transaction under c.on the contrary,both of those events are transactions,and the evidence shows that in both instances,sweeney acted with the intent to evade the reporting requirement 
the sweeneys second argument starts from the premise that the only way to commit the offense of structuring a transaction is to break up a single cash transaction that was above the reporting threshold into two or more separate transactions.see ratzlaf united states,stating in dictum that i t is illegal to structure,to break up a single transaction above the reporting threshold into two or more separate the purpose of evading a financial institution reporting requirement.the sweeneys assert that the evidence on counts,and failed to show that they broke up a single cash transaction that exceeded the reporting threshold into two or more separate transactions.it follows,we are told,that the evidence was insufficient to prove that or sweeney committed the offense of structuring a transaction.again,we are not persuaded.
the central flaw in the sweeneys second argument is its starting premise,which confuses a sufficient condition for a necessary condition.while breaking up a single cash transaction that exceeds the reporting threshold into two or more separate transactions is one way of committing the offense of structuring a transaction,it is not the only way.recall once more that the treasury regulations provide that a person structures a transaction if that person conducts or attempts to conduct one or more transactions in currency,in any amount,in any manner,for the purpose of evading the reporting requirements.gg emphasis added.the regulations explain that i n any manner includes,but is not limited to,the breaking down of a single sum of currency exceeding into smaller sums or the conduct of a transaction,or series of currency transactions,including transactions at or below.id.emphasis added.in our view,the regulations accurately describe the various ways that a person may commit the offense of currency structuring in violation of c.see united states hovind,fed.app x,cir per curiam by its plain language,the statute prohibits transactions of less than that are intended to evade reporting requirements.citing united states phipps,cir.the sweeneys would have us adopt a much narrower interpretation of the statute,but we see no sound basis for doing so.
any residual doubt about the sweeneys second argument is dispelled by the seventh circuit decision in united states van allen,cir,which we find persuasive.there,the defendant,relying on the seventh circuit ruling in united states davenport,cir,made a nearly identical argument to the one the sweeneys make here.in particular,the defendant argued that the only method of proving structuring is to demonstrate that a defendant held a unitary cash hoard over and then broke it up in to amounts under.van allen,at.the court recounted that in davenport it had upheld a conviction for structuring where the defendant made ten cash deposits,each under and had observed that the intent of the statute was to prevent individuals from evading the reporting requirement by breaking their cash hoard into enough separate deposits to avoid activating the requirement.id.at quoting davenport,f d at.the court in van allen made clear,however,that it never held that breaking up a cash hoard was the only method of proving structuring.id.at.in fact,the court noted,davenport further defined structuring as altering the form of a transaction in order to avoid activating the duty to file a currency transaction report.id.quoting davenport,at.this alternative definition of structuring,the court explained,meshes well with that in the treasury regulation,id.citing gg,which,of course,describes more than one way of structuring a transaction,see gg.
we hold that the evidence,viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict,was sufficient to support the sweeneys convictions on counts,and.as to counts and,the evidence showed that both and sweeney knew about the reporting threshold and conducted the vehicle purchases in a manner designed to evade the reporting requirement.see gg see also van allen,at noting that the court had previously defined structuring as altering the form of a transaction in order to avoid activating the duty to file a currency transaction report quoting davenport,at.as to count,the evidence showed that sweeney knew about the reporting threshold and conducted a series of cash the withdrawal of on october,a manner designed to evade the reporting requirement.see gg see also van allen,at finding that the defendant engaged in illegal structuring by conducting a series of deposits and withdrawals,and explaining that t he sheer volume of the transactions almost compels the conclusion reached by the jury because the evidence was sufficient on each count to prove that the sweeneys conducted one or more transactions in currency,in any amount,in any manner,for the purpose of evading the applicable reporting requirement,gg,we affirm their convictions on the currency structuring charges.
doyle ohio 
sweeney argues that the district court erred in failing to declare a mistrial after officer miller testified that sweeney invoked his right to counsel when officer miller began to question him.in doyle ohio,the supreme court held that the use for impeachment purposes of a defendant silence,at the time of arrest and after receiving miranda warnings,violate s the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment,id.at.this rule also applies to a defendant invocation of his right to an attorney.wainwright greenfield.the district court held that any potential doyle violation was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.we review claims of constitutional error de novo.united states washington,cir.
the government argues that no doyle violation occurred because the government did not deliberately elicit testimony regarding sweeney invocation of his right to counsel.we need not reach the question whether an inadvertent disclosure under these circumstances violates doyle if we find that any potential doyle violation was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.see united states martin,cir.
when analyzing whether doyle violations are harmless beyond a reasonable doubt,this court examines whether the government made repeated doyle violations,whether any curative effort was made by the trial court,whether the defendant exculpatory evidence is transparently frivolous,and whether the other evidence of the defendant guilt is otherwise overwhelming.united states gentry,cir quoting fields leapley,cir.here,it is undisputed that there was only a single alleged doyle violation.it is also undisputed that the district court offered to give a curative instruction to the jury,which the defendants declined.the government concedes that the exculpatory evidence that the sweeneys presented was not transparently frivolous.finally,as described earlier,the government otherwise presented overwhelming evidence of sweeney guilt.on balance,while the third factor counsels in favor of finding the violation was not harmless,we are convinced based on the other factors that this potential doyle violation was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.therefore,the district court did not err in denying the motion for a mistrial.
sentencing issues 
the sweeneys appeal the district court enhancement of their advisory sentencing guidelines ranges based on the court determination of the infringement amount,see generally,t he infringement amount is the retail value of the infringed item,multiplied by the number of infringing items.cmt.a.the district court found that it is not possible to determine the number of infringing items in this case,the descramblers or the number or value of the infringed items in this case,the stolen cable transmissions.the court therefore made a reasonable estimate of the infringement amount,using gross revenues,as a starting point.see cmt.e in a case in which the court can not determine the number of infringing items,the court need only make a reasonable estimate of the infringement amount using any relevant information,including financial records.based on that estimate,the court increased the defendants offense levels by levels,the enhancement corresponding to an infringement amount between million and million.see.b b,b.in reviewing a sentence for procedural error,we review the district court factual findings for clear error and its application of the guidelines de novo.united states barker,cir.
the sweeneys contend that because the government did not prove that any of the descramblers were actually used to intercept cable signals illegally,there were no infringed items and the correct infringement amount was therefore.this borders on sophistry.it should go without saying that we must here start from the premise that the sweeneys intended the descramblers they manufactured and sold to be used for the unauthorized interception of cable signals after all,the jury found them guilty of violating a.records seized from showed that the sweeneys sold descramblers between and.sales in the years,and could not be determined.it is perfectly reasonable to infer that the majority of these descramblers were in fact us
