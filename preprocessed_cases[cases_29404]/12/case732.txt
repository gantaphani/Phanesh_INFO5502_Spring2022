this case concerns new regulations issued by the federal communications commission fcc or the commission allowing terrestrial multichannel video distribution and data service mvdds,to share the ghz bandwidth ghz bandwidth spectrum with direct broadcast satellite dbs television services,as well as a decision by the fcc to auction mvdds use of that bandwidth.
the regulations are challenged by two sets of petitioners the incumbent providers,directv,satellite broadcasting and communications association,echostar satellite,and ses americom,dbs providers,and a competitor,northpoint technology,northpoint,which claims credit for inventing mvdds technology.for reasons stated more fully below,we deny both petitions for review.
background 
original allocation of the ghz bandwidth 
years ago,as satellite technology developed to the point at which direct broadcast satellite service to individual homes and businesses was feasible,the fcc began to investigate setting aside specific portions of the spectrum for dbs service.in the runup to an international radio conference in,the commission decided to seek international agreement to shift the international allocation of dbs to the ghz band in order to accommodate future dbs requirements.national association of broadcasters fcc.the next year,the commission began to consider how to protect and advance interests in dbs use of the ghz band.id.in,the commission issued a report and order authorizing the use of the ghz bandwidth to dbs use as in the public interest.report and order,in the matter of inquiry into the development of regulatory policy in regard to direct broadcast satellites for the period following the regional administrative radio conference,wl july.the report and order highlighted the commission conclusion that dbs has the potential to provide extremely valuable services to the american people,including the provision of improved service to remote areas,additional channels of service throughout the country,programming offering more variety and that is better suited to viewers tastes,technically innovative services,and expanded service.id.at.
in the same report and order,in order to effectuate the allocation of the ghz bandwidth to dbs service,the fcc announced a plan for any remaining terrestrial use of that bandwidth first,after a grace period of five years,terrestrial operations in the bandwidth would be required to operate on a strict basis to dbs services.id.at.second,terrestrial operations authorized after the report and order would receive conditional licenses,requiring that they not cause any harmful interference to dbs systems.id.
decision to propose rulemaking for sharing of ghz bandwidth 
this policy began to shift when,in the late,the fcc began to look at the possibility of allowing additional broadcast technologies to share the ghz bandwidth with dbs providers.in,skybridge,a provider of fixed satellite service,filed a petition for rulemaking with the fcc to allow it to operate in various wavelengths between and ghz.
the next year,in,northpoint filed a petition for rulemaking asking that it also be granted permission to use the ghz bandwidth for its terrestrial mvdds service,which can allow dbs subscribers to receive additional channels.as described by the fcc,the northpoint technology use s northward pointing receivers at a dbs subscriber location to receive signals transmitted from terrestrial towers whose directional antennas point southward.first report and order and further notice of proposed rulemaking first order,rcd,wl.
the commission responded to the and mvdds applications by issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking,rcd,wl,in which it proposed to allow providers to use those bands for uplinks and downlinks,and solicited comments on northpoint proposal,including further technical analyses of northpoint ability to share spectrum with dbs providers.the commission also issued a public notice soliciting competing applications from providers to share,inter alia,the ghz bandwidth,as a preliminary step to adopting rules for systems in those bandwidths.public notice,report no,wl.northpoint,apparently seeing its mvdds technology as equivalent to satellite service,even though it is terrestrial,submitted an application for usage of that bandwidth pursuant to the november public notice.
new congressional mandate 
before the fcc could act further,congress passed the rural local broadcast signal act of,pub div.b,app.i,tit.ii,stat,rlbsa,meant to give dbs found in small and rural television access to local broadcast stations,whose signals,at the time,typically were not carried by dbs service providers.specifically,the rlbsa directed the fcc to,within one year,make a determination regarding licenses or other authorizations for facilities that will utilize,for delivering local broadcast television station signals to satellite television subscribers in unserved and local television markets,spectrum otherwise allocated to special use.id.a.at the same time,the fcc was to ensure that no facility licensed or authorized under the rlbsa cause harmful interference to the primary users of that spectrum or to public safety spectrum use.id.b.
fcc rulemaking 
in its subsequent rulemaking,which it commenced by issuing the first report and order and further notice of proposed rulemaking in,the fcc authorized both and mvdds providers to operate in the ghz bandwidth alongside dbs providers.see first order,rcd.at.the fcc reasoned that t he use of innovative spectrum sharing techniques will facilitate a high level of frequency reuse in this band and provide a variety of broadband services to a vast number of customers.first order,rcd.at.the commission further reasoned that mvdds in particular w ould be capable of delivering local broadcast signals to satellite television subscribers in unserved and underserved local television markets as required by the rlbsa.id.at.
as for the rlbsa bar on harmful interference,in the first order,the fcc adopted the definition in c interference which endangers the functioning of a radionavigation service or of other safety services or seriously degrades,obstructs,or repeatedly interrupts a radiocommunication service,and found that we can develop operating requirements for mvdds that will ensure that dbs operations are not seriously degraded or subject to repeated interruptions due to mvdds operations first order,rcd.at.
the first order also served as a further notice of proposed rulemaking,for rules developing those operating requirements.the commission specified that for those rules to comply with its definition of harmful interference,we will propose that the maximum permissible increase in dbs service outage caused by an mvdds transmitter to any dbs subscriber be a value such that the increase would generally be unnoticed by the dbs subscriber.id.
the dbs providers petitioned for reconsideration,arguing,inter alia,that the decision to allow the mvdds operators to share the ghz bandwidth harmed their reasonable reliance interests in the bandwidth,and that at any rate,the commission had failed to justify its decision in light of the potential for harmful interference.
shortly thereafter,congress enacted section of the local tv act,which required independent testing of any terrestrial service technology proposed by any entity that has filed an application to provide terrestrial service in the ghz band,to ensure that there would not be harmful interference with dbs service in that bandwidth.an independent corporation engaged by the fcc to test northpoint mvdds technology concluded that although mvdds poses a significant interference threat to dbs,spectrum sharing would still be feasible,given a wide variety of mitigation techniques that can greatly reduce,or eliminate the interference.
with this information in hand,the fcc denied the dbs providers first petition for reconsideration,and issued the promised technical parameters that enabled mvdds to share the ghz bandwidth without causing harmful interference.see memorandum opinion and order and second report and order second order,rcd,wl.in the second order,the fcc laid out detailed technical requirements for the operation of mvdds service in the ghz bandwidth.these parameters followed the dictate for laid out in the first order,which was restated in the second order as a requirement that the presence of an mvdds signal would not be perceptible to the dbs customer in most cases.id.at.the parameters do not set a specific threshold for percentage increase in dbs signal outage that new mvdds transmitters may tolerably introduce in a given geographic area.according to the fcc,the parameters do,however,ensure that the establishment of mvdds service will lead to a less than increase in dbs signal outage in almost all cases.id.at.
also in the second order,the fcc dismissed northpoint and other applications for terrestrial mvdds licenses as premature,on the basis that the solicitation of applications for satellite service licenses had not given adequate notice to providers of terrestrial services that such licenses might be available.second order,rcd.at.in particular,the fcc in effect rejected northpoint,as set forth above,had been submitted alongside applications when those had been deciding not to grant northpoint various waivers through which the company sought to have its application considered alongside the satellite applications.id.at.this dismissal was,however,without prejudice northpoint was explicitly given permission to refile in a subsequent window for terrestrial applications.id.at.instead,the fcc announced that it would award mvdds licenses by auction pursuant to the authority granted to it by j,which requires the commission to allocate initial licenses for mutually exclusive,for use of a specific auction.second order,rcd.at.the commission rejected several arguments made by northpoint in the comment period preceding the second order,including two reasserted in this petition for review that the fcc could not auction that part of the spectrum under section of the reorganization for the betterment of international telecommunications act orbit act,which bars auctions of spectrum used for the provision of international or global satellite communications services,second order,rcd.at,and that the fcc could not invoke its section j auction authority,as northpoint was the only qualified mvdds applicant by operation of the local tv act testing requirement,and there was therefore no mutual exclusivity.id.at.
both the dbs providers and northpoint petitioned for reconsideration of the second order.see fourth memorandum opinion and order,rcd,wl fourth order.the dbs providers objected that the technical parameters mandated by the second order were insufficient to protect their service from harmful interference,because they failed to guarantee a fixed upper bound on service outages.they further objected to a provision in the second order that required dbs providers to bear the burden of adjusting their transmitters to prevent harmful interference when installed more than a month after a mvdds transmitter.northpoint reiterated its orbit act and local tv act challenges.the fcc rejected both petitions.
having lost its final administrative challenge,northpoint did not participate in the mvdds auction,which took place in january,and awarded ten mvdds licenses for the ghz bandwidth.
before this court,the dbs providers seek review of the provisions of the first order that embody the decision to allow mvdds to share the ghz bandwidth with dbs,as well as the denials of reconsideration of that decision in the second and fourth orders.the dbs providers argue,principally,that the commission did not conform with the rlbsa requirement that spectrum sharing cause no harmful interference.they express a general concern that the regulations represent the loss of two decades of protection from harmful terrestrial interference with their services in the ghz they say the commission provided beginning in,when it allocated the ghz bandwidth for dbs service to encourage competition with cable television operators.specifically,the dbs providers challenge the regulations as violative of section of the administrative procedure act apa on the basis that a the commission definition of harmful interference is arbitrary and capricious,and b the alleged lack of protections for new and existing subscribers are contrary to law in violation of the rlbsa.
northpoint,content with the fcc decision to force sharing of the ghz bandwidth,but not with its decision to auction the mvdds licenses for that bandwidth,petitions for review of the second and fourth orders,and appeals the licensing decision contained therein.northpoint argues that it should have been granted exclusive access without having to go through an auction process,as the first mvdds provider to apply to the fcc for use of that bandwidth.specifically,northpoint argues that the auction a violates the orbit act prohibition against auctioning spectrum used for the provision of international or global satellite communications services b was an arbitrary choice in violation of both section j of the communications act of,and principles enunciated in ashbacker radio fcc,when compared to the fcc decision to allow the providers to go through a simple licensing process,and c is not authorized by law,insofar as northpoint claims it is the only qualified mvdds provider under the local tv act,thus negating the commission authority to auction licenses under section j of the communications act.
we have jurisdiction over licensing decisions under a,and rulemaking orders of the fcc under.see at t fcc.because we conclude that the commission had a rational basis for concluding that mvdds providers could share the ghz bandwidth without causing harmful interference to dbs service providers,as prohibited by the rlbsa,and that the fcc decision was not arbitrary,capricious,or contrary to law under the apa,we deny the dbs providers petition for review.further,because we conclude that the mvdds auction was neither prohibited by the orbit act,nor arbitrary under ashbacker,nor in excess of the commission powers due to the operation of the local tv act,we deny northpoint petition for review and its appeal of the fcc licensing decision,as well.to the extent that northpoint alleges any violation of prior agreements or understandings with the fcc as to the end result of the development and testing of its technology,that is a tucker act matter not reviewed in this apa proceeding.
ii.discussion 
dbs.rlbsa harmful interference standard 
under chevron,nrdc,d,we defer to the commission interpretation of statutes which it is charged with implementing,so long as the congress has not unambiguously forbidden it and it is otherwise permissible.this means that,if congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue,we give effect to its unambiguously expressed intent if the statute is silent or ambiguous,we defer to the commission interpretation so long as it is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.
the rlbsa charges the fcc with ensur ing that no facility licensed or authorized under the rlbsa causes harmful interference to the primary users of that spectrum,stat,b,without specifying what harmful interference might mean in this context.we must therefore defer to the commission interpretation of harmful interference so long as it is based on a permissible construction of the statute.chevron,at.this does not require that the agency construction be the only permissible construction,nor the reading the court would have reached if the question initially had arisen in a judicial proceeding.id.at.rather,all we need to conclude is that the construction is not arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute.id.at.
in this case,the fcc applied its existing definition of harmful interference,listed in the terms and definitions section of its general rules and regulations for frequency allocations and radio treaty matters,see,to the context of potential interference with dbs service by mvdds users of the ghz bandwidth.the dbs providers argue that the commission conclusion was impermissible,because it departed from its own standard contained in,and provided no firm upper limit on the level of outages that would be tolerated.reviewing the record,we can not agree with this assessment.in the first order,the commission closely followed the definition of harmful interference,interference which endangers or repeatedly interrupts a radiocommunication service when it said it would strive to set the technical parameters such that dbs operations are not seriously degraded or subject to repeat interruptions due to mvdds operations.first order,rcd.at.the commission did not stray,arbitrarily or otherwise,when it stated in the first order it could do this by ensuring that the maximum increase in outage caused by an mvdds transmitter to any dbs subscriber be a value such that the increase would be generally unnoticed by the dbs subscriber.id.the commission explained in the second order,that dbs is,on the whole,extremely reliable with typical service availabilities on the order of to percent,and that the small number of interruptions to which dbs operations are already subject are well tolerated by dbs subscribers.second order,rcd.at.thus,there is a logical argument that if mvdds increases that small number of the dbs providers do not contest the consumers do not notice a level at which they still do not notice the interruptions,the dictate that dbs service not be seriously degraded will be satisfied.the fcc decision to allow outages in dbs service that generally go unnoticed is therefore based on a permissible construction of the rlbsa.
we reject the dbs providers next argument,that the lack of a numerical upper limit on the number of outages that will be tolerated renders the fcc construction of harmful interference impermissible,in light of the qualitative requirement that interruptions stay at or below a level that are generally unnoticed by the dbs subscriber,first order,rcd.at.as the commission explained,although the harmful interference standard enunciated in the first order and for which it set technical parameters in the second order does not set a strict limit on the percentage by which mvdds may increase outages in dbs service,the overly conservative assumptions used in its modeling,the reality that dbs outage rates vary widely around the country and from season to season,and the fact that outages occur at all times of the,not just when subscribers are watching dbs,it found that the additional service outage that may result over and above the percent starting point falls within the permissible level.second order,rcd.at.in other words,the commission consistently followed its qualitative requirement that outage increases not be perceptible to the dbs consumer the relevant increased interruptions be generally unnoticed by the dbs subscriber continues to be met even in those rare instances where increases in the instance of signal outages may go above.that standard,as we have just explained,passes apa muster.the fcc decision not to impose a strict upper bound on percentage increases in dbs outages,it follows,is also permissible.
in the alternative,the dbs providers charge that even if the fcc definition of harmful interference is permissible,the technical parameters the commission issued failed to ensure a level of interference that would,in fact,be tolerable to the average dbs consumer.the commission responds that it was reasonable to predict that dbs customers,who regardless face wide variations in their own service that are larger than the increased outages that will be caused by mvdds would be insensitive to relatively small increases in variability.govt.br.at.the plausibility of this a relatively small increase in variability would be less noticeable than relatively large existing.further,as the commission pointed out at oral argument,a increase in a unavailability is tiny.thus,neither the fcc definition of harmful interference nor its anticipation that its technical parameters would prevent such interference from occurring in practice,were unreasonable.
the decision to permit mvdds operations under the second order technical parameters appears particularly reasonable in light of the safety valve referred to in that order.see second order,rcd.at.i f due to an anomalous situation,the order explains,a dbs provider can demonstrate a tangible detrimental impact on dbs caused by mvdds operations,the fcc may adjust the relevant technical parameters to eliminate the problem.id.through this safety valve,the fcc can ensure that mvdds causes no harmful interference even if,contrary to the fcc predictions,operation under existing parameters produces noticeable service interruptions in some limited number of areas.
finally,the dbs providers charge that the fcc failed to adequately explain why mvdds providers were not assigned to alternative bandwidths where they would not cause harmful interference.because,for the reasons enunciated above,we conclude that the commission took adequate steps to prevent harmful interference from occurring,such an explanation is not necessary.
other alleged rlbsa violations 
the dbs providers also allege that the regulations at issue violate the rlbsa insofar as they a fail to protect dbs service to new subscriber locations,and b fail to protect dbs service to all existing subscriber locations.
new subscriber locations 
as part of its implementation of the plan to share the ghz bandwidth,the commission issued a rule that new dbs receiver antennas installed more than days after the relevant dbs licensee is notified of a potential mvdds transmitter site,shall have no further rights of complaint.e.instead,the dbs licensee is responsible for mitigating any harmful interference to dbs reception that might result.id.the dbs producers argue that this violates the unambiguous obligation that the rlbsa imposes on the commission to ensure that no facility licensed or authorized to deliver local broadcast television signals causes harmful interference to dbs operations.dbs br.at quoting rlbsa b,stat.
by citing this aspect of the mvdds regulations out of context,the dbs providers obscure its practical nature.that same section of the earlier provides that any mvdds provider shall not begin operation unless it can ensure that the detectable signals from its transmitting antenna at all dbs customers of record locations is below the applicable limit,calibrated to ensure no harmful interference.a.dbs customers of record,in turn,is defined as those who had their dbs antennas installed prior to or within the period after notification to the dbs operator by the mvdds licensee of the proposed mvdds transmitting antenna site.id.the subsequent rule to which the dbs providers dbs providers who install receivers nearby after that period are responsible for locating them in such a way as to avoid the mvdds signal,e is simply a practicable solution for what to do next,after an mvdds transmitter is already in operation.this rule does not,as the dbs providers suggest,deprive new dbs subscribers of the right to receive their satellite service free of harmful interference.instead,it simply shifts the burden for avoiding harmful interference in those instances from the mvdds providers to the dbs that is clearly not barred by the rlbsa.
the rlbsa charges the commission only with ensur ing that no facility licensed or authorized under the rlbsa cause harmful interference to the primary users of that spectrum rlbsa at b.it does not speak to how the commission must ensure that harmful interference not occur,or who the commission must enlist to ensure that harmful interference not occur.the use of the word ensure in the statute is sufficiently ambiguous to allow a construction that shifts the burden for some protective measures onto the dbs providers from the mvdds providers,to which we defer under chevron step two.we therefore find that e does not violate the rlbsa as the dbs providers argue.
existing subscribers 
another subsection of the implementing regulations,g,requires new mvdds providers to remedy complaints by existing dbs subscribers of record only if the complaints are received within a year from when the mvdds providers start operations.the dbs providers complain that this leaves many existing subscribers with no protection from harmful interference.specifically,they argue that subscribers who experience seasona
