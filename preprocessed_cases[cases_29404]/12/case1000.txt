the illinois commerce commission icc appeals the decision of the appellate court in favor of the illinois independent telephone association and six rural telephone companies or local exchange carriers lecs the central issue here is what the illinois general assembly meant when it ordered the icc to establish a universal service support fund usf in section d of the public utilities act ilcs d west.did the legislature intend for the fund to support all rural telephone lines,or only a single line for each residence or business we agree with the appellate court that universal means universal and that the legislature intended the fund to support all lines.we affirm.
background 
in,the federal communications commission fcc established a federal universal service fund usf to help rural telephone companies defray the high costs of providing public telephone service to sparsely populated areas.because the federal usf covered only part of these costs,the general assembly amended section d of the public utilities act in,ordering the icc to investigate and,if need be,establish a state usf.ilcs d west.the source of the state usf would be all local exchange and interexchange telecommunications carriers certificated in illinois on a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory basis.ilcs d west.in short,the fund would be repaid by telephone customers throughout illinois in surcharges tacked onto their telephone bills.the general assembly further instructed the icc to define which telecommunications services constitute universal service,noting that the state definition should be at least as broad as the federal definition promulgated by the fcc.ilcs e west.the fcc has listed nine services designated for support,including voice grade access to the public switched network.a.
in,the icc decided to establish a state usf and concluded that the illinois list of supported services should mirror the fcc list of supported services.contrary to the position advocated by its staff,however,the icc found 
with respect to the element of the voice grade access to the network,it shall be limited to a primary residence line and a single business line.the basis for this conclusion is that discretionary services would not be supported by the section d fund.as ameritech illinois appropriately argues,to do otherwise might create the unintended result of end user customers in one area of the state subsidizing discretionary services of end user customers in another area of the state whose service is supported by the fund.
the lecs petitioned for,and the icc granted,rehearing on four issues two issues concerning alleged mathematical errors in determining the size of the usf and the monthly affordable rate for each rural telephone customer,one issue concerning a transition plan to reach the affordable rate,and one issue concerning the services supported by the usf.in its order on rehearing,the icc corrected its mathematical errors and approved a transition plan.but,again contrary to the position advocated by its staff,the icc refused to alter its decision that the state usf would support only primary or single residential and business lines 
at the time we reached the single line determination,we were cognizant of the fact that basing the size of the usf fund on support for a single line would reduce the fund size.we were also cognizant of the fact that the qualifying companies would,in all likelihood,seek to recoup the reduction in the fund size from their customers.
despite the fact that our decision here may bring rate increases to the customers of the qualifying companies,the policy issue is more far reaching.the policy issue facing the commission is whether the families and agencies,and,in the case of public agencies,the taxing agencies that support them,should bear the brunt of increased rates relating to second lines,or whether the burden should be shifted to all citizens of the state,including low income citizens in our inner cities that can not afford a single line.on balance,reasoned public policy supports imposing the burden on the parties who use the services and the localities where they are used rather than allowing parties to purchase second lines on the backs of the poor.
according to the icc,section d did not indicate that the general assembly intended the icc to walk in lock step with the fcc in determining whether or not to support all access lines in the usf.the icc asserted that the statute simply indicated that the illinois list of supported services should be no smaller than the federal list of supported services.the icc insisted that it had done just that 
the fact that the fcc computes the level of support based upon support for all access lines does not change the fact that our order supports the same services.there is no indication anywhere in section that the number of lines entitled to support may not be limited,as long as individuals and businesses are guaranteed access to the network and that the fund recognize that access is at an affordable rate.
the icc ordered that t he services defined by the fcc as supported services shall be the state supported universal services for purposes of the fund,with the exception that the fund shall be based upon support for a single residential or business line.emphasis added.the lecs appealed.
on may,the appellate court filed an opinion,and the lecs filed a petition for clarification under supreme court rule.see.on september,the appellate court denied that petition,but vacated its earlier opinion and filed a new one.the appellate court affirmed the icc on several issues,but reversed the icc on the primary lines issue.the appellate court stated 
in reaching its decision that it would only include residential primary telephone lines in counting the number of access lines eligible for support,the commission essentially expressed its belief that the federal government had not intended for business or secondary residential lines to be included.we do not find the federal government list of services eligible for support to be so restrictive.
simply stated,universal support means universal support.more specifically,the fcc identified voice grade access to the public switched network as a service eligible for support.the commission determined that the access line list should mirror that of the fcc.we agree.d.
the appellate court noted that the fcc definition of voice grade access refers to a basic telephone line that allows a person to place and accept calls this definition contains no primary lines limitation.d at.
the appellate court continued 
to the extent that the commission was concerned that urban residents should not be required to pay for discretionary services enjoyed by their rural counterparts,we ask,why should access to phone discretionary phone much more in a rural setting than in an urban setting furthermore,the assumption that all secondary lines are discretionary lines dismisses entities like schools and public libraries,which require affordable access on all their lines.the point of providing universal fund support service is to level the playing field.theoretically,lower prices,competitive with what is offered in urban settings,will allow greater access to telephonic services.our state and federal governments have established this greater access as a worthy goal.these extra access lines,whether or not they can be labeled discretionary,should not be inordinately more expensive than identical services in an urban setting.we find no legal justification for limiting the number of access lines eligible for this support.d at.
the appellate court also reversed the icc order reducing the amount of the state usf by the percentage of multiple lines and made its decision retroactive to march,the date of the icc order on rehearing.d at.we granted the icc petition for leave to appeal.a.
in this appeal,the icc raises four issues whether the appellate court erred in deciding that the lecs need not file second rehearing petitions after the icc granted in part and denied in part their first rehearing petitions whether the appellate court erred in reviewing de novo the icc decision to limit the state usf to primary residential and business lines whether the appellate court erred in rejecting the icc primary lines limitation and instead deciding the legislature intended the usf to support all lines and whether the appellate court erred in making its decision retroactive.we address these issues in turn.
the second rehearing petition requirement 
the icc argues that the appellate court undermined case law from this court requiring a putative appellant to file a second rehearing petition in order to preserve an issue on appeal where the icc has granted rehearing and considered additional evidence the lecs respond that,as the appellate court noted,these cases predate the amendments to the public utility act and consequently no longer control.according to the lecs,an icc order is final and appealable after the commission has decided a putative appellant first rehearing petition,whether or not the commission considered additional evidence.
section a of the act addresses rehearing petitions.the icc may rescind,alter,or amend an order,and any party to such an order may file an application for rehearing within days of its service,but n o appeal shall be allowed from any rule,regulation,order or decision of the commission unless and until an application for a rehearing thereof shall first have been filed with and finally disposed of by the commission.ilcs a west.section a further provides,only one rehearing shall be granted by the commission.ilcs a west.the appellate court here correctly observed that neither the act nor its accompanying regulations contain a second rehearing petition requirement.d at.that requirement is a gloss placed upon the act by cases from this court.
in alton illinois commerce comm n,we addressed whether a putative appellant must file a second rehearing petition where the icc has considered new evidence upon rehearing.we noted that the act implies such a requirement by providing that an appellant may not raise any issues that were not included in a rehearing petition.alton,at.because the icc considered new evidence upon rehearing,we held that the putative appellant should have filed a second rehearing petition discussing that evidence as a condition precedent to its right to appeal.alton,at.accord city of edwardsville illinois commerce comm n.
again,in scherer freight lines,illinois commerce comm n,we revisited the second rehearing petition requirement and focused on the purpose of the relevant statutory provisions the requirement of an application for rehearing as a condition to an appeal and the limitation that no person on appeal shall rely on any ground not set forth in such application for rehearing clearly disclose the underlying policy that any person aggrieved by a decision of the commission must first give the commission an opportunity to correct its alleged errors before resorting to the courts.scherer freight,at.although the order upon rehearing was labeled a reaffirming order,and its substance was similar to the commission initial order,it still recited that it was based upon the entire record,including evidence not before the commission when the first order was entered.scherer freight,at.the appellants initial rehearing petition argued that the icc decision was against the manifest weight of the evidence,but because they did not give the icc an opportunity to reevaluate the manifest weight of the new evidence when they neglected to file a second rehearing petition,we held that the trial court properly dismissed their appeals.scherer freight,at.
in continental air transport illinois commerce comm n,we carved out an exception to the second rehearing petition requirement,which was plainly implied by our language in scherer freight.i f an order entered after rehearing does not substantially modify the first one and is not based upon any additional evidence,an appeal therefrom may be taken without a second petition for rehearing.continental air,at.we broadened this exception in du page utility illinois commerce comm n.even if the icc considers new evidence upon rehearing,an appellant need not file a second rehearing petition where the order upon rehearing is substantially the same as the initial order.du page utility,at.
the exception now nearly swallows the rule.unless the new evidence upon rehearing prompts the icc to make major changes to its order,the party seeking an appeal need not seek a second rehearing.here,under this exception,the lecs properly appealed the icc order on rehearing.as the icc acknowledged in that order,on the primary lines issue,no party has presented any matter that was not previously before the commission at the time of the entry of the second interim order.more importantly,its order on rehearing reaches the same conclusion on this issue as its initial,that the illinois usf supports only primary residential and business lines.
having decided that subsequent cases have drained the potency from the alton second rehearing petition requirement,we also note that that requirement sprang from an interpretation of the version of the act.before,a litigant appealed an icc decision to the trial court,ch,par.in,the general assembly exercised its constitutional authority see.const,art.vi,and directed appeals from icc decisions to the appellate court.now,a litigant can appeal either an icc order refusing an application for rehearing or an icc order upon and after a rehearing immediately to the appellate court for the purpose of having the reasonableness or lawfulness of the rule,regulation,order or decision inquired into and determined.ilcs a west.r ules governing other civil cases,supreme court rules,govern such an appeal.ilcs b west see also insofar as appropriate,supreme court rules on appellate procedure are applicable to proceedings for direct appellate court review of administrative agency orders.under supreme court rule a,no request for reconsideration of a ruling on a motion will toll the running of the time within which a notice of appeal must be filed under this rule.a.
when the legislature redirected judicial review of an icc order from the trial court to the appellate court,it ensured that after one rehearing petition was decided,the order was final and appealable.if we were now to revitalize alton and its second rehearing petition requirement,we would create great havoc for icc appeals.a putative appellant would be at the mercy of the icc,watching the clock tick on its appeal while waiting for the commission to rule on its second rehearing petition.here,the icc closed its order on rehearing by noting that subject to the provisions of section of the public utilities act,this order is final as to all matters determined herein.as a final order upon and after a rehearing,it was appealable under section a.see ilcs a west.the appellate court correctly rejected the icc argument.
the primary lines limitation 
the central issue in this appeal is the icc construction of section d,which incorporates section e,of the act.this issue is one of statutory interpretation and involves nothing more than determining what the general assembly meant when it ordered the icc to define the services that constitute universal service in accord with the fcc list of supported services.on this issue,our review proceeds de novo.see illinois commerce comm n,the commission interpretation of a question of law is not binding on a court of review,citing united cities gas illinois commerce comm n,accord citizens utility board illinois commerce comm n,we are not bound by the commission interpretation of law see also ilcs e iv c west providing that a reviewing court must reverse an icc order if it violates state or federal law.though we owe deference to the icc interpretation of the act where there is a reasonable debate about its meaning see illinois consolidated telephone illinois commerce comm n,bloom township high school illinois commerce comm n,d,citing abrahamson illinois department of professional regulation,board of education of plainfield community consolidated school district illinois educational labor relations board,d,the provisions at issue here are quite clear.
