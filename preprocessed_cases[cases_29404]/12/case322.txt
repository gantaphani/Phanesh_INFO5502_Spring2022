alvin lee lewis appeals from the sentence that followed his conviction on twelve counts relating to the manufacture and sale of unauthorized satellite television access devices along with an order of restitution,lewis was sentenced to multiple concurrent terms of imprisonment,some for months and others for months,followed by three years of supervised release.he argues that he should have been sentenced under the fraud sentencing guidelines rather than the money laundering guidelines,thereby reducing his term of imprisonment.we affirm the sentence imposed by the district court.
in its authorized use,digital satellite television viewing is available to individuals who have purchased the requisite components of a system and who pay a subscription fee or individual viewing charges to the program provider.a system includes a receiver,a computer access card,and the familiar antenna.the programs that are sent via satellite are scrambled,and the access card has a computer chip that decrypts the programming that the customer has paid to view.
not every viewer is authorized,however.hackers find ways to replicate the access cards.once replicated,the cards are sold to viewers who can then watch the programs without paying the provider.the industry responds by creating electronic to detect and render inoperable any unauthorized access cards.not to be outdone,hackers create printed circuit boards for the receivers that in turn block the electronic.these items are advertised through internet sites and in magazines.
in late may,lewis and his nephew brandon scott conversed with an individual who,unknown to them,was an investigator for a company that provides encryption technology for satellite transmissions.the investigator,william sutherland,had seen an internet posting which listed boss cards for sale.boss is a trade name for printed circuit boards with computer chips that are programmed to allow unauthorized satellite users to protect their pirated signals by blocking the electronic employed by the industry.sutherland sent an inquiry and in reply was directed to a telephone number.when he called the number,scott answered.in their ensuing conversations,scott told sutherland that he was selling access cards for and boss blocker cards for.sutherland ordered two of each card from scott.later that day lewis called him,saying that he wanted to become a little bit better acquainted before doing business with him.to the point,lewis asked if sutherland was affiliated with directv a satellite television programmer or nds a supplier of encryption technology to programmers including directv and in fact sutherland employer or any law enforcement agency.sutherland said that he was not.seemingly satisfied,lewis told sutherland that he would get the cards the following week.
when sutherland did receive the cards,he forwarded them to the person in charge of unauthorized user investigations for nds americas.sutherland learned that the cards did not function,and called scott to tell him that.he also told scott that he would be interested in placing a large order in the future if these cards operated satisfactorily.scott agreed to make them right,but when sutherland received them a second time,they still did not operate correctly.sutherland told scott that the second batch was also bad,and scott directed him to return them.after inspecting the cards,scott said one of them had been fried and that he would replace it for.sutherland agreed,scott replaced the cards and sent them to sutherland for a third time,and this time they functioned.upon scott instruction,sutherland paid for the items with personal money orders made payable to lewis.
sutherland then began negotiating with scott and lewis for the purchase of access cards and boss by now boss ii cards.during this time sutherland advised the secret service of his activities and,at the agency request,recorded four of his own telephone conversations with both scott and lewis.lewis assured sutherland that he could deliver the product even though he would be away on a trip to russia for a month.he said that his nephew scott could speak for him and could handle the transaction in his absence.lewis,scott,and sutherland ultimately agreed to a price of for of each card,which sutherland would pay for with two cashier checks in the amount of each.sutherland traveled to nashville to meet with scott and discuss the details of the transaction.when they met again near nashville less than two weeks later to consummate the deal,secret service agents were present at the restaurant that was their meeting place.after sutherland and scott exchanged the cards and the payment for them,secret service agents approached scott and asked him to go outside to talk.he accompanied them but began running once he reached the out of doors.the agents were able to stop him and he was handcuffed by local police officers.
the secret service also obtained a search warrant for the house that lewis and scott lived in.upon arresting scott,an agent asked him if he wanted to be present during the execution of the warrant.he said that he did,and the search was conducted upon his arrival at the house.agents seized a number of items during the search,including two computers,one with an attached programmer access cards more than one thousand computer micro chips circuit board components and printed circuit boards several satellite receivers in cash and nearly in money orders,most of them made payable to lewis and others to scott several dish antennae and a notebook with instructions on how to program one of the computer chips.
following the search,the secret service invited an nds americas analyst to participate in analyzing some of the seized items.in so doing,the analyst determined that of the access cards were modified for satellite reception,and that the computers contained software which in conjunction with the written directions from the notebook could create the access cards.
lewis was indicted,and tried.at trial,the government presented seven witnesses who testified that they purchased access cards boss cards from lewis,whom they learned about through either a topical magazine or the internet.another witness testified that he had written a review of the boss card in that magazine at lewis request.after its publication,lewis contacted him again to tout a new product he planned to introduce for another satellite system,but the individual no longer wrote for the magazine and told lewis he could not help him.
scott also testified as a government witness at lewis trial,and detailed his activities in assembling circuit boards,programming access cards,and dealing with customers on his uncle behalf.he was years old at the time of trial.scott testified that he had moved to tennessee to live with lewis because he needed a place to stay and he did like california,where his mother lived.he had hoped to return to school after making some money working for his uncle,although he did not know at the time what his uncle business was.he apparently learned quickly because,not long after he arrived,lewis traveled to russia on two occasions and left scott in charge of business.the first was a trip and the second lasted for two months.during his absences,scott filled orders,put together cards,programmed access cards,and generally kept the business running.
the search of lewis house occurred in august,during one of his trips to russia.scott testified that he telephoned lewis to tell him of the search and seizure,and that lewis reacted without concern and directed him to continue carrying on the business.even though scott understood that the activities were illegal,he did continue to the extent finances would allow.in early,scott began cooperating with the government as it continued its investigation of lewis.at the time,scott was engaged in his own satellite enterprise that did not include lewis,but scott was not truthful in telling the government about his activity.
the money laundering counts against lewis were based on bank deposits to scott account and checks written on that account.scott testified that lewis had told him to purchase access cards from tom cleary if he needed mo
