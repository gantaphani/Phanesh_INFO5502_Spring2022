in this appeal,we are asked to review the district court order dismissing a putative challenge brought under protection of subscriber privacy of the cable communications policy act of the cable act,supp.the dismissal,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b was predicated upon the district court determination that the plaintiff,jeffrey klimas,lacked standing to contest alleged violations of the privacy provisions in b by defendant comcast cable communications,comcast in the operation of its broadband internet service.on appeal,the plaintiff alleges that the district court misconstrued the provisions of b and failed to address the claims brought under the notice provisions of a.
we conclude that the complaint was properly subject to dismissal under rule b,but for reasons other than the one identified by the district court.the plain language of b indicates that its prohibition against the collection of personally identifiable information using a cable system is not applicable to information collected from the operation of a broadband internet service,even when operated by a cable company such as comcast,because b,by its terms,applies only to a cable system.b,b.section a is broader,requiring notice of the collection of personally identifiable information to subscribers of any cable service or other service,a emphasis added,which arguably might cover broadband internet service.however,subsection a b confines other service to certain facilities used in the provision of cable service,and subsection a a excludes from the notice requirements any record of aggregate data which does not identify particular persons.a a,b.there is no allegation that the information about internet activity collected in this case was actually correlated with subscriber lists so as to identify particular persons.
for these reasons,as explained more fully below,we affirm the order of dismissal entered by the district court and the resulting judgment in favor of the defendant.
factual and procedural background 
the dispute in this case involves the collection of information regarding internet protocol ip addresses and their linkage to universal resource locators urls that facilitate use of the internet.any computer from which a person accesses the internet is assigned an ip address,which may be either static remain constant or dynamic change periodically.when a url,or website name,is typed into software,a network of computers is able to connect to a corresponding ip address,permitting the transmission by internet of various types of information between the two addresses.internet service providers isps have the capacity to maintain databases containing a history of the linkages created by such transmissions.
on february,the president of comcast cable communications,released a statement regarding the privacy of the company subscribers,which read,in part since we launched our own internet network six weeks ago ip and url information has been stored temporarily.this information has never been connected to individual subscribers and has been purged automatically to protect subscriber privacy.beginning immediately,we will stop storing this individual customer information in order to completely reassure our customers that the privacy of their information is secure.the statement also indicated that comcast had reviewed information in aggregate form only for purposes of network performance management to ensure an optimal internet network experience for our subscribers.
two months later,the plaintiff filed a class action in federal court seeking damages for violation of the cable act.the complaint,as amended,charged that comcast had violated b by collecting personally identifiable information concerning subscribers.for example,comcast linked the internet protocol of plaintiff jeffrey klimas with the url of websites he visited,and otherwise tracked the internet surfing activities of its broadband internet subscribers.
in response to the defendant motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under federal rule of civil procedure b,the plaintiff filed a second amended complaint,in which he claimed that the defendant had kept a database which stored where each of its individual subscribers went on the internet,and what each was doing that the information the defendant collected included personally identifiable information sent to and from its internet subscribers,including their web surfing habits,where they visited,information they provided at web sites and the like that the comcast database stored the history of links and also,as a consequence,the information of what its subscribers viewed,did and entered at the web sites they visited and that the defendant had a list of every web site its internet subscribers had visited,as well as the power to connect and correlate those online activities with the identity of each subscriber.the complaint also alleged that the defendant had information from which it could identify its subscribers,but not that the defendant had actually correlated the linkages with the subscriber list.the plaintiff also alleged that ip addresses are often dynamic a cable operator might assign a different ip address after a certain number of hours,days,or weeks.in addition,the complaint also alleged other violations of the cable act,including failure to give proper notice of collection and storage of the information,failure to destroy the information when it was no longer necessary,and failure to make the information available for subscriber inspection,all of which is regulated under a.
in a renewed motion to dismiss,the defendant asserted that the plaintiff lacked standing to bring a cable act challenge because the injury alleged was hypothetical and not actual,noting that the complaint described two separate in which comcast had stored its subscribers linkages and another in which the company maintained the personal information names and addresses that corresponded to given ip addresses.the flaw in the plaintiff theory of recovery,according to comcast,was the lack of any claim that comcast had ever correlated these two databases.
at a hearing on the motion to dismiss,the district court was influenced not only by comcast argument,but also by the allegation in the plaintiff complaint that ip addresses are often dynamic,pressing both sides for an explanation of the extent to which subscribers contact information is revealed in their ip addresses and under what circumstances and how frequently ip addresses change in an ensuing opinion and order dismissing the case,the district court reasoned that because the personally identifiable information part of plaintiff claim stems from comcast collecting information about links,the dispositive issue is whether an ip address is personally identifiable information under the cable act,which the plaintiff had conceded was the controlling question during oral argument in the district court.characterizing the basis for dismissal as a lack of standing on the part of the plaintiff,the district court ruled that a dynamic ip address can not constitute personally identifiable information because d ynamic ip addresses constantly change and unless an ip address is correlated to some other information,such as comcast log of ip addresses assigned to its subscribers,it does not identify any single subscriber by itself.in other words,an ip address,by itself,is not specific information about the subscriber.in so ruling,however,the district court failed to acknowledge that not all ip addresses are dynamic,nor did the court rule on the remainder of the plaintiff claims.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
we review de novo the dismissal of a complaint under federal rule of civil procedure b.see williams wci steel,cir.dismissal is appropriate only when it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim that would entitle him to relief,after construing the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and accepting as true the factual allegations.id.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
dismissal for lack of standing 
in the more than years since congress passed the cable act in,the statute has remained largely unamended.the section invoked in this litigation,provides measures to protect the privacy of cable subscribers.specifically,subsection b prohibits cable operators from using cable systems to collect personally identifiable information about subscribers.b.specifically,it provides 
except as provided in paragraph,a cable operator shall not use the cable system to collect personally identifiable information concerning any subscriber without the prior written or electronic consent of the subscriber concerned.
a cable operator may use the cable system to collect such information in order to 
a obtain information necessary to render a cable service or other service provided by the cable operator to the subscriber or 
b detect unauthorized reception of cable communications.
id.the phrase personally identifiable information is not defined in the statute except in the negative.the term does not include any record of aggregate data which does not identify particular persons.a a.
it was perhaps this provision that led the district court to the conclusion that the plaintiff lacked standing to bring this action,despite the language of f that explicitly permits cable subscribers to bring a civil action to enforce the privacy measures.of course,i n order to establish the injury in fact element of standing,the plaintiff must show that he has sustained or is immediately in danger of sustaining some direct injury as the result of the challenged conduct.kardules city of columbus,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.put another way,the injury must be both concrete and particularized,meaning that the injury must affect the plaintiff in a personal and individual way.id.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.furthermore,the injury may not be the product of speculation or conjecture.id.at.the district court reasoned that because the plaintiff did not allege that the defendant had ever reconciled collected linkages with subscribers names,any claim that the information collected was personally identifiable was speculative,and the plaintiff therefore had no standing to bring suit for a violation of the act privacy provisions 
after a study of the relevant provisions of,we conclude to the contrary and hold that in light of subsection f,the plaintiff allegation that the defendant improperly collected linkage information,taken as true,ostensibly alleged an injury under subsection b.the district court determination that the complaint was inadequate because it alleged that the information about subscribers was based on ip addresses,but did not allege correlation of those addresses to individual subscribers names is,in our judgment,better analyzed not as a lack of standing,but rather as the lack of a b claim.
failure to state a claim 
we conclude that a reading of the plain language of b precludes its application to broadband internet service.the plaintiff pleaded in his second amended complaint that the defendant was a cable operator that provided cable service over a cable system,an apparently accurate statement.but,because the plaintiff alleged that the defendant collected personally identifiable information from subscribers internet use,as opposed to their use of the defendant cable service,the statute does not provide a cause of action.even though the isp in this dispute is also a cable service provider,the collection of the data in this case had nothing whatever to do with comcast cable service or with information regarding its cable subscribers.it follows that the defendant did not run afoul of the prohibition in b against a cable operator using a cable system to collect personally identifiable information concerning subscribers.b.put simply,what is at issue in this case is broadband internet access,not cable service.moreover,a series of recent decisions has made clear that,however uncertain federal regulation of broadband service via cable may still be,broadband internet service delivered via cable is not cable service.
in the first of these cases,city of portland,cir,the court of appeals for the ninth circuit considered a challenge to a local franchising authority requirement that a cable operator grant all internet service providers unrestricted access to its cable broadband transmission facilities in order for it to receive a cable franchise the court looked at the section of the cable act governing cable franchises and ruled that it applied to the provision of cable service only,not broadband internet service.working from the definition of cable service provided in,the appellate court held 
the essence of cable service is transmission of programming to subscribers generally internet access is not and general,but interactive and individual beyond the subscriber interaction contemplated by the statute.accessing web pages,navigating the web hypertext links,corresponding via,and participating in live chat groups involve communication and information exchange unmatched by the act of electing to receive a transmission of cable or television programming.and unlike transmission of a cable television signal,communication with a web site involves a series of connections involving information exchange and storage,even when a user views seemingly static content.thus,the communication concepts are distinct in both a practical and a technical sense.surfing cable channels is one thing surfing the internet over a cable broadband connection is quite another.
the court then articulated a definition for internet service provided by cable operators proprietary internet service providers.it first noted that the federal communications commission had defined conventional internet service as an information service.id.at.according to the communications act of,as amended,such a service is the offering of a capability for generating,acquiring,storing,transforming,processing,retrieving,utilizing,or making available information via telecommunications.relying on this classification of conventional isps,the appellate court recognized that such isps offer their service by leasing access to phone lines over which subscribers access the isps point of presence on the internet commonly referred to as connection or dsl.thus,conventional isps provide an information service only by means of another operator telecommunications equipment,but do not actually provide any telecommunications service.however,proprietary cable operator isps control the cable lines between their internet points of presence and their subscribers computers.thus,according to the ninth circuit,they also provide telecommunications service 
u nlike other isps,controls all of the transmission facilities between its subscribers and the internet.to the extent is a conventional isp,its activities are that of an information service.however,to the extent that provides its subscribers internet transmission over its cable broadband facility,it is providing a telecommunications service as defined in the communications act.
city of portland,at.telecommunications service is defined by the communications act as the offering of telecommunications for a fee directly to the public,or to such classes of users as to be effectively available directly to the public,regardless of the facilities used.in turn,telecommunications is defined as the transmission,between or among points specified by the user,of information of the user choosing,without change in the form or content of the information as sent and received.
in reaching both these decisions about cable internet service,the court noted that although the was empowered to decide the issue,it had not spoken and so the court was not required to afford deference to any commission ruling.the court expressly observed that the fcc has declined,both in its regulatory capacity and as amicus curiae,to address the issue before us.thus,we are not presented with a case involving potential deference to an administrative agency statutory construction pursuant to the chevron doctrine.city of portland,at.
three months after the city of portland decision,the issued a notice of inquiry to determine what regulatory treatment,if any,should be
