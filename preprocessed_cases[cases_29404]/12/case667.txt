this copyright infringement action was brought against primetime joint venture primetime,a satellite television carrier,by four major television networks,four associations representing the networks local affiliates,and four corporations owning affiliates.after the plaintiffs proved at trial that primetime had unlawfully distributed copyrighted network programming to satellite dish subscribers who were not authorized to receive such programming by virtue of the statutory,compulsory license under which primetime was operating,the district court entered a permanent injunction against primetime requiring it to terminate the transmission of such programming to unauthorized subscribers.
thereafter,congress passed the satellite home viewer improvement act of improvement act,et,stat,which contained a grandfather clause permitting primetime and other satellite carriers to continue transmitting network broadcasting to satellite dish owners who had received a particular type of transmissions before any termination of such transmissions occurring prior to october.id.a b iii.because of this clause,which was codified as a b iii,the district court entered an order modifying the permanent injunction.primetime brought this appeal because it contends that the modifications to the injunction did not go far enough.
the specific issue this appeal presents is whether the improvement act any termination language includes voluntary as well as involuntary terminations of transmissions.the more general and fundamentally important issue is whether the plain meaning of statutory language trumps contrary legislative history.we answer both questions in the affirmative.as a result,we vacate the district court december,order modifying the injunction against primetime and remand for further modification of the injunction.
background 
the plaintiffs in this case are four television networks cbs broadcasting,fox broadcasting abc,and the national broadcasting company,four trade associations comprised of stations affiliated with the networks,and four corporations which own local broadcast stations affiliated with cbs.we will refer to the plaintiffs collectively,as the networks.primetime is a satellite television carrier which transmits programming to subscribers who own or rent satellite dishes.as a result of the satellite home viewer act shva,primetime received a compulsory,statutory copyright license to transmit network programming to viewers who are unserved by network broadcasters.the shva defined the meaning of unserved households by reference to an objective level grade b of signal intensity.
the networks brought this action against primetime in,asserting that it had infringed the networks copyrights by transmitting network material to individuals who did not fit within the shva definition of unserved.they alleged that primetime had improperly relied on individual subscribers subjective representations concerning their picture quality and signed up large numbers of subscribers who were not eligible to receive network programming from a satellite carrier.in march,the networks moved for a preliminary injunction,and after finding that primetime had ignored the objective standard set out in the statute for determining unserved households,the district court entered a preliminary injunction against it in july.that injunction prohibited primetime from signing up any new illegal customers and ordered it to terminate transmissions to existing illegal customers within days.thereafter,the parties agreed to a number of extensions of the deadline for terminating illegal subscribers,and those extensions were embodied in court orders modifying the preliminary injunction.
in december,following a full trial,the district court issued a final judgment and permanent injunction in favor of the networks.the permanent injunction required that the transmission of network broadcasting to illegal subscribers signed up during the pendency of the motion for an injunction to be terminated by february,and that the transmission to subscribers signed up before the motion was filed to be terminated by april.primetime carried out the february terminations.before the next deadline,however,the parties agreed to postpone the remaining terminations until june and december.
the statutory license provided by the shva was scheduled to expire at the end of.throughout that year congress considered an extension of,and changes to,the statutory license.after both houses of congress passed differing bills amending the shva,a conference committee negotiated what became the improvement act.congress passed the improvement act in november,and the president signed the bill into law on november.
one of the provisions of the improvement act grandfathered in the transmission of network broadcasting by satellite carriers to subscribers even if those subscribers did not fit within the statutory license definition of unserved households.improvement act a b iii,stat,codified at a b iii.this provision,which is the subject of this appeal,states that 
the limitations of clause a b i,which limits the compulsory license to unserved households as defined by the statute,shall not apply to any secondary transmissions by services of network stations that a subscriber to service received before any termination of such secondary transmissions before october.
id.emphasis added.congress also provided that subscribers who were receiving network broadcasting as of october,could continue to receive such broadcasting.
in light of the grandfather clause,primetime moved the district court to modify the permanent injunction in order to permit primetime to transmit network broadcasting to subscribers falling within the scope of the clause.primetime argued that in light of the grandfather clause,it should be permitted to transmit network broadcasting to any dish owner whose service had previously been terminated,regardless of whether the service had been terminated voluntarily service was canceled at the subscriber request or as a result of the subscriber failure to pay or involuntarily service was canceled pursuant to court order or as a result of a network challenge to the eligibility of a subscriber.in support of its position primetime focused on the fact that the grandfather clause refers to any termination.
the networks countered by arguing that the grandfather clause was only intended to permit transmission to subscribers whose service had been terminated involuntarily,either as a result of court orders or as a result of previous challenges to eligibility.they argued that the phrase any termination in the grandfather provision was intended to refer to,and was shorthand for,the transmission cutoffs prompted by the district court injunction.in support of their argument,the networks quoted several statements from members of congress,from the district court,and from others in which the word termination was used in reference to the cutoffs.the networks noted that the statute was passed in the context of a cutoff crisis resulting from the public backlash partly as a result of primetime efforts against the terminations.the networks relied heavily on the conference report description of this section of the improvement act which stated that 
section a of this act creates a new section a b iii of the copyright act to permit continued delivery by means of transmissions of network stations to owners who received signals of the pertinent network on october,or were recently required to have such service terminated pursuant to court orders or settlements under section.
conference report to the improvement act,cong.rec,daily ed.
after considering the parties arguments concerning the scope of the grandfather clause,the district court noted that 
now,i read and reread this statute and i do think i understand it too well insofar as it written.it not a model of clarity.however,i have received some comfort from reading the conference report,which i think is clearer.
the court then stated that t he statute could have said very easily any subscriber who received network programming at any time,and they did say it.the court held that the a b iii grandfather clause was only applicable to those subscribers whose service had been involuntarily terminated as a result of court orders.consequently,the court amended its permanent injunction to state that 
primetime shall not be prohibited by this order from delivering,through services,any network station to 
a a dish at a household that received any abc,cbs,fox,or nbc station from primetime by services as of october,or 
b a dish at a household that received any abc,cbs,fox,or nbc station from primetime by services before october,and who had such service terminated pursuant to court order.
primetime appealed,challenging the district court interpretation of a b iii of the improvement act.
ii.discussion 
the sole issue before us is whether the a b iii grandfather provision of the improvement act extends to all satellite subscribers whose service was terminated before october,or only to those whose service was involuntarily terminated.
a.the plain meaning of the statute 
this court has repeatedly stated that w e begin our construction of a statutory provision where courts should always begin the process of legislative interpretation,and where they often should end it as well,which is with the words of the statutory provision.harris garner,cir en banc.we have also said just as frequently that w hen the import of words congress has used is clear we need not resort to legislative history,and we certainly should not do so to undermine the plain meaning of the statutory language.id.at.in other words,w hen the words of a statute are unambiguous,then,this first canon of statutory construction is also the last judicial inquiry is complete.merritt dillard paper,cir citation omitted.the rule is that we must presume that congress said what it meant and meant what it said.united states steele,cir en banc citing connecticut bank germain,d.
the supreme court has similarly stated that g iven a straightforward statutory command,there is no reason to resort to legislative history.united states gonzales,d accord,circuit city stores,adams,d as the conclusion we reach today is directed by the text of,we need not assess the legislative history of the provision.even where t here are contrary indications in the statute legislative history we do not resort to legislative history to cloud a statutory text that is clear.ratzlaf united states,d.we do not start from the premise that the statutory language is imprecise.instead,we assume that in drafting legislation,congress said what it meant.united states labonte,d.likewise,we assume the supreme court,in saying that,said what it meant.
our first task in deciding this case,then,is to determine whether the plain meaning of the improvement act a b iii grandfather clause,and in particular its phrase any termination,is apparent.in the absence of a statutory definition of a term,we look to the common usage of words for their meaning.consolidated bank,united states dep t of treasury,cir.see also in re griffith,cir en banc in interpreting the language of a statute,we generally give the words used their ordinary meaning.citations and quotations omitted.
in order to determine the common usage or ordinary meaning of a term,courts often turn to dictionary definitions for guidance.see,gonzales,at.at harris,at.employing this approach confirms our common sense impression that the ordinary meaning of the phrase any termination is plain and apparent.the word termination is defined as follows 
the act of terminating or the condition of being terminated.a.the end of something in time the conclusion.b.an end of something in space a limit or an edge.a result an outcome.
american heritage college dictionary ed.the word terminate has the following definition 
to bring to an end or a halt.to occur at or form the end of conclude.to discontinue the employment of.to come to an end.to have as an end or a result.
id.there is no ambiguity in the word termination.the ordinary meaning of that word includes voluntary terminations as plainly as it does involuntary terminations.the networks do not dispute that,and admit in their brief that their interpretation of the statute is contrary to the literal application of the statute according to the dictionary terms.the fact that the networks have to write into the statutory phrase the limiting adjective involuntary in order to express what they think congress intended is further proof that the plain meaning of what congress actually said is against their position.what congress actually did,of course,is choose an expansive word any instead of a restrictive one.
both the supreme court and this court have had occasion to consider the meaning of the word any.in gonzales,the supreme court noted that r ead naturally,the word any has an expansive meaning,that is,one or some indiscriminately of whatever kind.at.at quoting webster third new int dictionary.the court noted that in the absence of any language limiting the breadth of that word,it must be read as referring to all of the subject that it is describing.id.
similarly,this court has held that the adjective any is not ambiguous it has a meaning.merritt,at.see also lyes,at same.as we have said before,because congress did not add any language limiting the breadth of that word,any means all.merritt,at quoting gonzales,at.at.see also lyes city of riviera beach,cir en banc same united states castro,cir concluding that any meant every or all.this long history of established meaning is important,because we readily presume that congress knows the settled legal definition of the words it uses,and uses them in the settled sense.harris,at.it is beyond reasonable dispute that if plain meaning and common usage are the guide,as they should be,the phrase any termination in the improvement act a b iii grandfather clause means all terminations of any kind,not just involuntary terminations such as those resulting from court orders.
the networks dress up another kind of argument in plain meaning clothes by urging us to view the text of the statute against the backdrop of the cutoff crisis,and say that if we do so we will see that the legislators used the word termination as shorthand for involuntary cutoffs it follows,they contend,that the plain meaning of the phrase actually supports their position that any termination does not really mean any termination but only involuntary terminations.but the plain meaning clothes do not fit that argument.it is not a plain meaning argument,but instead an argument that we should depart from the plain meaning of the words congress chose in favor of what we might divine from the surrounding circumstances that it really meant 
the plain in plain meaning requires that we look to the actual language used in a statute,not to the circumstances that gave rise to that language.our decisions back up that requirement by mandating that ambiguity in statutory language be shown before a court delves into legislative history.see,harris,at when the import of the words congress has used is clear,as it is here,we need not resort to legislative history,and we certainly should not do so to undermine the plain meaning of the statutory language.united states veal,cir review of legislative history is unnecessary unless a statute is inescapably ambiguous.citation and quotation omitted.the supreme court decisions establish the same thing.see circuit city.at where the meaning of a provision can be drawn from the text of a statute,there is no need to assess the legislative history of the provision gonzales,at.at same ratzlaf,at.at there are,we recognize,contrary indications in the statute legislative history.but we do not resort to legislative history to cloud a statutory text that is clear.any ambiguity in the statutory language must result from the common usage of that language,not from the parties dueling characterizations of what congress really meant.where the clear and unambiguous language of a statute provides a bridge to congress intent,we need not and will not wade into the brackish waters of legislative history 
even where the statutory language is not entirely transparent,which we believe the provision at issue in this case is,the court has tools at its disposal for elucidating the meaning of a statute without reverting to legislative history.these tools are the canons of construction.the canons of construction are interpretative tools,which are no more than rules of thumb that help courts determine the meaning of legislation.griffith,at citation omitted.the canons assist the court in determining the meaning of a particular statutory provision by focusing on the broader,statutory context.see,dbb,at noting that canons allow courts to avoid look ing at one word or term in isolation,but instead allows us to look to the entire statutory context.
one benefit of applying canons of construction,rather than considering legislative history,is that their application does not require resort to extrinsic material.instead,the canons of construction focus on the text actually approved by congress and made a part of our country laws.as the supreme court recent opinion in circuit city confirms,where the meaning of a statute is discernible in light of canons of construction,we should not resort to legislative history or other extrinsic evidence canons of construction are essentially tools which help us to determine whether the meaning of a statutory provision is sufficiently plain,in light of the text of the statute as a whole,to avoid the need to consider extrinsic evidence of congress intent 
application of canons of construction bolster our conclusion in this case that the phrase any termination is not limited to involuntary terminations resulting from court orders.one canon recognized by the supreme court is that w here congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same act,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.russello united states,d citation and quotations omitted.also,w here congress knows how to say something but chooses not to,its silence is controlling.griffith,at citation and quotations omitted,alteration in original.in addition,a term appearing in several places in a statutory text is generally read the same way each time it appears.ratzlaf,at.at citation omitted.
application of these canons further convinces us of the same conclusion dictated by the plain meaning of the statutory phrase any termination.we find significant congress use of the word terminated elsewhere in a similar provision in the same act.in c of the improvement act,which is a separate grandfather provision,congress provided for the transmission of network broadcasting to certain subscribers who had satellite service terminated after july,and before october,as required by this section.improvement act c,stat,emphasis added.this provision apparently allows both and dbs subscribers to receive network broadcasting from satellite carriers until december,if they do not receive an network signal of grade a intensity,which is a clearer signal than the grade b intensity used in the definition of unserved households.by including the phrase as required by this section in the c grandfather clause,congress modified the word termination in that provision so that it refers only to terminations required by the section of the shva governing the compulsory license.
so,congress chose to modify and limit the word termination in another grandfather clause in the same statute but not in the grandfather clause at issue in this case.as we have explained before,congress clear ability to modify a term to indicate the type thereof in other instances,and the fact that it did not do so in the disputed phrase,indicates that it had no intention to so limit the term.consolidated bank,at.see also gonzales,at.at finding significant that the word any was modified in one portion of the statute,but not in another russello,at.at same.therefore,the canons of construction support our conclusion that the meaning of the improvement act a b iii grandfather clause is clear and unambiguous.because the plain meaning of the phrase any termination is settled and on its face and in light of the canons of networks may only prevail if they show that an exception to the plain meaning rule applies.we turn now to that question.
possible exceptions to the plain meaning rule 
the networks argue that even if we conclude that the plain meaning of the term any termination includes voluntary we should prevail nonetheless.the networks point to language from several of our cases which indicates that we may look beyond the plain language of a statute at extrinsic materials if 
the statute language is ambiguous applying it according to its plain meaning would lead to an absurd result or there is clear evidence of contrary legislative intent.
dbb,at.the networks argue that each of these circumstances is present in this case.
the first of the supposed exceptions mentioned in the quotation from dbb is really just a restatement of the plainness requirement of the plain meaning rule.if the statutory language is ambiguous,its meaning is not plain.stating that ambiguity establishes an exception,instead of disestablishes the predicate for the rule,confuses things.
contrary legislative intent 
as for the third listed exception in the quote from dbb,it is merely dicta in that case,and it is also contrary to the law of this circuit.the statement in dbb that clear evidence of legislative intent can control over the plain meaning of legislative language is merely dicta,because the statutory language in that case was found to be ambiguous,at,so the plain meaning rule did not apply there for that reason.even if that statement had been a holding of dbb,it would not bind us,because there is binding precedent of both this court and the supreme court to the contrary.
our en banc opinion in harris,which the dbb panel was powerless to overrule,does not say that if the meaning of a legislative provision is plain from the language,we will still consider contrary legislative history provided that it is really clear legislative history.such an exception would have serious potential because it would require that legislative history always be considered in order to determine whether there was clear evidence of contrary legislative intent.dbb,at.instead,the en banc court meant it when it said in harris that 
when the import of the words congress has used is clear,as it is here,we need not resort to legislative history,and we certainly should not do so to undermine the plain meaning of the statutory language.
harris,at.the merritt panel,whose decision binds subsequent panels including the one in dbb,also meant what it said when the words of a statute are unambiguous,then,this first canon is also the last judicial inquiry is complete.merritt,at quotation omitted.likewise,we have every reason to believe that the supreme court also meant what it said given a straightforward statutory command,there is no reason to resort to legislative history,gonzales,at.at,and we do not resort to legislative history to cloud a statutory text that is clear,ratzlaf,at.at.
the reasons for refusing to give even clear legislative history more weight than clear statutory language are sound.this court has explained that it is ultimately the provisions of our laws rather than the principal concerns of our legislators by which we are governed.lyes,at quoting oncale sundowner offshore,d.when a statute is passed by congress,it is the text of the statute,and not statements put in some committee report or made on the certainly not someone understanding of the circumstances which gave rise to the has been voted on and approved by the people elected representatives for inclusion in our country laws.the language of our laws is the law.
moreover,as judge harold leventhal once observed,the use of legislative history is akin to entering a crowded cocktail party and looking over the heads of the guests for one friends.conroy aniskoff,d scalia,concurring.this problem of subjectivity and indeterminacy may be avoided or at least minimized by focusing not on legislative history,but instead on the text of a statute,which is the result of innumerable compromises between competing interests reflecting many competing purposes and goals.boca ciega hotel,bouchard transp,cir.the statutory language itself is the principal battlefield where the warring interests struggle against each other,and it is to that battlefield we should look for the results of the battle.
another reason for adhering to the clear language congress chose instead of some other indicia of its intent is the absence of a convincing explanation for the divergence of the two.for example,in this case,if congress really meant in a b iii of the improvement act to grandfather only involuntary terminations resulting from court orders,then why did it say any termination why not simply say any involuntary termination or any termination resulting from court orders it could easily have done so,but did not.those who ask courts to give effect to perceived legislative intent by interpreting statutory language contrary to its plain and unambiguous meaning are in effect asking courts to alter that language,and c ourts have no authority to alter statutory language we can not add to the terms of the provision what congress left out.merritt,at.the language of the statute is entirely clear and if that is not what congress meant then congress has made a mistake and congress will have to correct it.conroy,at.at scalia,concurring.
the quote from dbb that we set out earlier in this opinion does list one recognized exception to the plain meaning of results.we have recognized that courts may reach results inconsistent with the plain meaning of a statute if giving the words of a statute their plain and ordinary meaning produces a result that is not just unwise but is clearly absurd.merritt,at.however,we have also observed that 
though venerable,the principle is rarely applied,because the result produced by the plain meaning canon must be truly absurd before the principle trumps it.otherwise,clearly expressed legislative decisions would be subject to the policy predilections of judges.
id.in other words,it is irrelevant that w e may not have made the same policy decision had the matter been ours to decide if we can not say that it is absurd,ridiculous,or ludicrous for congress to have decided the matter in the way the plain meaning of the statutory language indicates it did.id.
the networks argue that absurd results would follow from the plain meaning interpretation of the improvement act a b iii grandfather clause because it would permit transmission to any dish owner who formerly received network matter how far in the past.they also attempt to show absurdity by way of the example of a dish owner one mile away from the local fox station in atlanta who subscribed to a distant fox station for one month in and then canceled her subscription for lack of interest,or of a subscriber who received transmission because of a computer error or whose service was canceled because of failure to pay bills.
in light of this court exacting standard for finding absurdity,we do not believe that the networks have shown that the plain meaning interpretation of the improvement act grandfather clause would lead to truly absurd results.in particular,it seems to us that equally absurd results are possible under the networks own interpretation of the statute.nothing in their interpretation would prevent a subscriber who lived one mile from a local affiliate from receiving transmission as long as the subscriber was terminated pursuant to a court order.yet,everyone,including the networks,agrees congress certainly intended to bring about results which include that one.nor are we convinced that permitting subscribers to be grandfathered in even though considerable time may have passed since they last received transmission is an absurd result.interests such as fostering competition between satellite and cable carriers,or protecting rural consumers who invested in outmoded objectives which have some support in the improvement act legislative be served by such results 
we should always remember when a party argues the absurd results exception that congress often legislates at the macro level,not on a micro scale.general problems are given general solutions and even where more specific solutions are possible,compromises are often struck.the language used may sweep too broadly in some respects affording protection and relief to some who are not truly deserving or aggrieved,and too narrowly in other respects failing to reach some who are more deserving or aggrieved.but that is the nature of a political process and of all worldly endeavors.imperfection is not absurdity,but is inherent in humankind and all of our works.the networks have not shown that the plain language interpretation of the grandfather clause will cause the type of truly absurd or ludicrous results which would permit us to depart from the plain meaning of the statute.
c.the networks narrow construction argument 
finally,we address the networks argument that the court should not interpret the improvement act a b iii grandfather provision according to the plain meaning of its words because doing so would expand a compulsory copyright license.the networks point to an opinion from our predecessor court which stated that 
we begin by noting that the compulsory license provision is a limited exception to the copyright holder exclusive right to decide who shall make use of his composition.as such,it must be construed narrowly,lest the exception destroy,rather than prove,the rule.thus we should neither expand the scope of the compulsory license provision beyond what congress intended in,nor interpret it in such a way as to frustrate that purpose.
fame publ.custom tape,cir.but the fame opinion nonetheless recognized that congress intent is controlling.id.while the narrow construction rule makes good sense when the provision relating to compulsory licenses is ambiguous,it does not require that the legislative intent embodied in the plain meaning of statutory language be jettisoned in favor of that or any other rule of construction.any such requirement would be inconsistent with this court more recent binding precedent which emphasizes the primacy of statutory language.see,harris,at.whatever guidance the quoted part of the fame opinion might offer in general,it can not require that we interpret a specific statutory provision,which was enacted a quarter of a century later,in a way that is contrary to the clearly expressed plain meaning of the provision.
the networks also point out,in support of their narrow construction argument,that the conference committee report to the improvement act stated that the committee was aware it was acting in derogation of the exclusive property rights granted by the copyright act to copyright holders,and that it therefore need ed to act as narrowly as possible to minimize the effects of the government intrusion on the broader market cong.rec.but as we have already explained,even clear evidence of contrary intent in legislative history materials can not override the plain meaning of unambiguous statutory language.besides,it is not altogether clear that the conference committee report would require a different result,even if it were controlling.it is one thing to construe a provision narrowly and another to construe it contrary to its plain meaning and unambiguous terms.
iii.conclusion 
the phrase any termination in a b iii,means any termination prior to the specified date,and that includes both voluntary and involuntary terminations.accordingly,the district court december,order modifying the permanent injunction in this action is vacated,and this case is remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
i heartily concur in the conclusion of judge carnes opinion,though i come to it by a somewhat different route.i,by no means,intend to diminish either his interpretation of the eleventh circuit precedents,supported by what some of the justices on the supreme court have said from time to time,or his ultimate definition of the terms any and termination as including voluntary as well as involuntary terminations in the context in which they appear.but i would add that the legislative purpose of satellite home viewer improvement act shvia provides an alternative
