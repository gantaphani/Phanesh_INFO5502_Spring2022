directv,and echostar satellite,collectively the satellite companies,appeal from the district court dismissal of their claims against mark treesh,the commissioner of the department of revenue for the state of kentucky.the satellite companies seek a permanent injunction against certain provisions recently added to kentucky revenue statutes that afford cable television operators credits and other relief from state taxes assessed against both cable companies and the satellite companies.the satellite companies contend that these credits unconstitutionally discriminate against interstate commerce in violation of the commerce clause of article i of the constitution.because we find no constitutional violation,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
a.the satellite and cable companies 
the satellite companies provide video programming to subscribers by means of satellites stationed above the earth.the federal government auctioned the right to transmit on certain electromagnetic frequencies,and the satellite companies paid more than million for these rights.the satellite companies allege that they have further invested more than billion in building,insuring,and launching their satellites.subscribers in kentucky receive the signals from these satellites by means of small satellite dishes mounted on or near their houses.according to their complaint,the satellite companies employ no infrastructure in the state to transmit their signal directly to the subscriber and do not use public in providing service.the district court noted,however,that according to the amicus curiae brief of the kentucky cable television association kcta,the satellite companies do have local receiving facilities on the ground in kentucky,which receive the signals of local broadcast stations and include them in their offerings with the channels sent by satellite.in their complaint,the satellite companies state that directv has two sales employees in kentucky and that echostar has six sales employees in kentucky.the district court noted that,according to the kcta,the satellite companies employ a legion of local contractors in kentucky to sell their services and receiving dishes.
cable companies,on the other hand,provide video programming by means of cable networks located in kentucky.cable systems receive the programming that they retransmit to subscribers at local cable headends.the cable headends then transmit the programming to kentucky subscribers by way of cables laid in trenches in or along roads or hung on utility poles in the state and connected to the subscribers television sets and boxes.in their complaint,the satellite companies assert that cable companies must obtain local government permission to use roads and other in order to lay or string cable connecting their local distribution facilities to the subscribers homes.local governments typically provide this permission by franchise agreements and permits granted to the cable companies.the satellite companies assert that in return for permission to use public,the cable companies pay a franchise fee to the applicable local government that is typically five percent of gross revenue within the franchise area.the satellite companies characterize the franchise fee as compensation to the local government for valuable rights granted by the franchise.the satellite companies allege that cable operators have a strong local presence in kentucky due to the employment of numerous kentucky residents and the location of numerous offices and facilities within the state to provide service.finally,the satellite companies allege that when a customer wishes to purchase a subscription to television service,there are basically only two choices cable or satellite.
b.the changes to kentucky tax law 
in march,kentucky amended its tax laws.see.acts,regular session the amendments relevant provisions codified at various sections of chapter of the kentucky revised statutes.
prior to the amendments,neither the cable companies nor the satellite companies were required to pay kentucky state sales tax.in addition,pursuant to a of the federal telecommunications act of,the satellite companies,but not the cable companies,were and are exempt from all local taxes and fees,title vi,a,stat.a reprinted at,historical and statutory notes.nevertheless,the telecommunications act explicitly reserves to states the powers the states themselves had to tax satellite companies.ibid.meanwhile,as stated above,the cable companies paid franchise fees to local governments.
the kentucky legislature passed the amendments in order to provide a fair,efficient,and uniform method for taxing communications services sold in kentucky and to simplify an existing system that includes a myriad of levies,fees,and rates imposed at all levels of government.krs.the amendments became effective on january.
section of the amendments imposes an excise tax on the retail purchase of multichannel video programming service provided to a person whose place of primary use is in the state.krs.the amendments define multichannel video programming service as cable service and satellite broadcast and wireless cable service.id.the excise tax is of the sales price charged for the service.id.section of the amendments imposes a tax on a multichannel video programming service provider gross revenues from service provided to people in kentucky.id,a.together,these provisions effectively impose a tax on total charges for either cable or satellite.
section of the amendments establishes a gross revenues and excise tax fund.krs.all revenues from the taxes described above are to be deposited into this fund.the money in the fund is then to be allocated among the state and its political subdivisions,school districts,and special districts.id.under section of the amendments,every political subdivision,school district,special district,and sheriff department must certify to the revenue cabinet the total local franchise fees it collected from multichannel video programming service providers in fiscal year.id.this certified amount is then used to determine the monthly portion of the gross revenues and excise tax fund that will be distributed to each subdivision,school district,and special district.the amendments provide that each will be assigned a percentage,called the local historical percentage,which is based on the amount of the subdivision certified collections as a proportion of the total certified amount of all collections of all parties participating in the fund.in return for their participation in this fund,the subdivisions must agree to relinquish any right to a franchise fee or tax on multichannel video programming services.id.b.
pursuant to section of the amendments,local governments are prohibited from levying any franchise fee or tax on a multichannel video programming service.krs.if a local government imposes or attempts to impose a franchise fee or tax,the local government may not receive any share of the proceeds of the excise and gross revenues taxes for the period that the imposition occurs.id.further,if a provider of a multichannel video programming service actually pays a franchise fee or tax with respect to the service,the provider is entitled to a credit against the state taxes due in the amount of the franchise fee or tax.id.
c.the satellite companies complaint 
the satellite companies allege that the provisions of the amendments that afford cable system operators credits against the state excise and gross revenues taxes and relief from franchise fees unconstitutionally discriminate against interstate commerce in violation of the commerce clause.the satellite companies ask the court to declare krs,unconstitutional.these are the subsections of the amendments prohibiting local governments from levying franchise fees and taxes,denying local governments fund proceeds if they levy such fees,and crediting providers of multichannel video programming services for any such fees paid.in effect,they argue that if a state imposes uniform taxes on all video programming providers,it also is constitutionally required that the state allow its localities and subdivisions to charge significant franchise fees.
the satellite companies argue that with the new provisions the cable companies receive a tax preference because revenues from the state excise and gross revenues tax are used to pay the franchise fees that cable operators would otherwise have to pay local governments for access to local.this discriminates against interstate commerce because cable companies,which provide service via infrastructure necessarily located within the state,get the tax preference while satellite companies,which provide service via satellites inherently located outside of the state,get no tax preference.in other words,the cable companies pay the new taxes but get relief from a portion of their operating costs,the price paid for the right to provide cable service in the franchise area and rights of access to public.the satellite companies pay the new taxes,but receive no relief from their operating costs.according to the satellite companies,this constitutes discrimination against interstate commerce because the burdened satellite inherently facilities and have very little infrastructure,while the benefitted cable necessarily expansive facilities to deliver their television service.

the satellite companies first argue that the district court erred by relying on factual assumptions that were neither alleged in their complaint nor consistent with the complaint allegations.the satellite companies argue that this improperly converted the motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment.specifically,the satellite companies argue that the district court substituted its own factual assumptions,largely drawn from the kcta amicus brief,for the factual allegations in the satellite companies complaint,and that the district court faulted plaintiffs for not coming forward with evidence to support their allegations.
at some times in its opinion,the district court appears to have made factual assumptions that may be controverted.while the satellite companies alleged that they used no infrastructure whatsoever within the state to deliver programming,the district court found that the mechanisms by which the satellite companies deliver programming lie partially outside of kentucky and partially inside the state.the district court specifically pointed to the receiving dishes for local programming mentioned in the kcta brief as an example of the infrastructure.further,the district court faults the satellite companies for the lack of evidence in the record to support the principal places of business of the satellite and cable companies,and the failure of the satellite companies to presen t any other evidence from which the district court could conclude that cable companies are economic interests.
if the district court decision were actually predicated upon the above factual findings or the failure of plaintiffs to present the specified evidence,it would have been error.u nder the notice pleading standard of the federal rules,courts are reluctant to dismiss colorable claims which have not had the benefit of factual discovery,at.further,it does not appear that the satellite companies were given a reasonable opportunity to present all material made pertinent to the issue as required by.b when a district court converts a motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment.
the district court opinion,however,was not clearly predicated upon its additional factual findings or its finding of lack of evidence.several of the district court reasons for dismissal were not based on these additional findings.therefore,ignoring the above flaws in the district court opinion,the relevant question on appeal is whether the district court properly found that,even accepting all of the facts in the satellite companies complaint as true,the complaint failed to demonstrate that the amendments discriminate against interstate commerce.
the constitution expressly authorizes congress to regulate commerce with foreign nations,and among the several states,const.art.i,cl,and the negative or dormant aspect of the commerce clause implicitly limits a state right to tax interstate commerce.in boston stock exch.state tax comm n,d,the court provided a concise exegesis of the dormant aspect of the commerce clause 
w e begin with the principle that the very purpose of the commerce clause was to create an area of free trade among the several states.mcleod dilworth.it is now established beyond dispute that the commerce clause was not merely an authorization to congress to enact laws for the protection and encouragement of commerce among the states,but by its own force created an area of trade free from interference by the states t he commerce clause even without implementing legislation by congress is a limitation upon the power of the states.freeman hewit.the commerce clause does not,however,eclipse the reserved power of the states to tax for the support of their own governments,gibbons ogden,wheat,or for other purposes rather,the clause is a limit on state power.defining that limit has been the continuing task of this court.on various occasions when called upon to make the delicate adjustment between the national interest in free and open trade and the legitimate interest of the individual states in exercising their taxing powers,the court has counseled that the result turns on the unique characteristics of the statute at issue and the particular circumstances in each case,freeman hewit this approach has left much room for controversy and confusion and little in the way of precise guides to the states in the exercise of their indispensable power of taxation.northwestern states portland cement minnesota,d.
a tax provision satisfies the requirements of the commerce clause if the activity taxed has a substantial nexus with the taxing state the tax is fairly apportioned to reflect the degree of activity that occurs within the state the tax does not discriminate against interstate commerce and the tax is fairly related to benefits provided by the state.see complete auto transit,brady,d.the satellite companies only challenge kentucky amended tax law on ground.
the commerce clause does not prevent the states from structuring their tax systems to encourage the growth and development of intrastate commerce and industry.boston stock exch.state tax comm n,d.the supreme court has never precisely delineated the scope of the doctrine that bars discriminatory taxes.the court has made it clear,however,that a tax statute constitutionality does not depend upon whether one focuses upon the benefitted or the burdened party.bacchus imports,dias,d.
