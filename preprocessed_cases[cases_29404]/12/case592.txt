ron rusakiewicz and paul spera,the plaintiffs and appellants in this case,are or were members of the veterans of foreign wars of the united states vfw.they distributed fliers at the vfw convention in salt lake city accusing john lowe and other officers of the california department of the organization of fraud in connection with the organization membership rolls.lowe sued rusakiewicz and spera for defamation in state court in utah.the defamation suit was later dismissed with prejudice by agreement of the parties.rusakiewicz and spera then filed this suit against lowe and other officers of the california department of the vfw,claiming that the defamation suit amounted to abuse of the legal process and unlawful use of civil proceedings.the district court dismissed their complaint,holding that the court did not have personal jurisdiction over the individual defendants other than lowe and that the complaint did not state a claim for which relief may be granted.rusakiewicz and spera appeal.we reverse the district court holding as regards jurisdiction.we affirm its dismissal of the abuse of process and wrongful use of civil proceedings claims.
factual and procedural background 
in august,rusakiewicz and spera attended a vfw conference in salt lake city,utah.there they distributed fliers making accusations of fraud and misconduct against some individual officers of the california department of veterans of foreign wars vfwca.the fliers claimed that some vfwca officers had hacked into computers at the national vfw and converted the names of some national vfw members into vfwca augmenting the member rolls and the coffers of the vfwca.john lowe,one of those accused,served a complaint on the two men,maintaining that he had been defamed and asking for damages.before filing suit,lowe consulted with other officers of the vfwca in salt lake city about the suit.the other officers,including shirley shaw,david norris,and john wolfe,offered their support to lowe regarding his lawsuit and agreed to use vfwca funds to pay lowe legal expenses.lowe,however,was the sole plaintiff in that suit.
lowe attempted to reach a compromise agreement with rusakiewicz and spera.he proposed that the two men agree to make no comments or communication of any nature relating to alleged criminal action or other violations of the law in connection with the vfw membership matter,in return for his dropping his suit for damages.rusakiewicz and spera rejected the proposed compromise agreement.after some back and forth,and with consent from the defamation defendants,lowe later voluntarily dismissed his complaint with prejudice.
several months after the defamation action was dismissed,rusakiewicz and spera filed a complaint for damages against lowe in the united states district court for the district of utah,alleging that his defamation suit was an abuse of process and an unlawful use of civil proceedings.the plaintiffs joined shaw,norris,wolfe,and the vfwca as defendants for allegedly authoriz ing,approv ing,ratify ing,institut ing the wrongful civil action of lowe.the jurisdictional basis for the lawsuit was diversity of citizenship,under a.rusakiewicz and spera are citizens of connecticut and massachusetts,respectively,lowe and the other vfwca officers are citizens of california,and the vfwca is incorporated in california.the defendants filed a motion to dismiss,asserting lack of personal jurisdiction over shaw,norris,and wolfe whom we will generally call the vfwca defendants,and contending that the complaint had failed to state a claim for abuse of process and unlawful use of civil proceedings under utah common law.they did not contest the court jurisdiction with respect to lowe or the vfwca.
the district court granted the motion to dismiss,finding it lacked jurisdiction over the vfwca defendants.the district judge said to plaintiffs counsel below that if he 
had the facts to support some notion that they shaw,norris,and wolfe were colluding with lowe to file a baseless lawsuit in salt lake,well,then there would be jurisdiction over them.there would be enough information to suggest that they committed a tort in utah,at least enough basis for going forward but i did see that you have anything like that.
with respect to the claims against the remaining defendants,lowe and the vfwca,the court held that there was an insufficient legal basis to support either a claim for abuse of process or a claim for unlawful use of civil proceedings.the court explained that the claim for abuse of process fail ed for lack of an allegation of a wilful act independent of the legal process and that the claim for unlawful use of civil proceedings failed because the prior case was not terminated on the merits in favor of rusakiewicz and spera.
ii.jurisdiction 
we review de novo the district court finding that it lacked jurisdiction over the vfwca defendants shaw,norris,and wolfe.pro axess,orlux distribution,cir.where there has been no evidentiary hearing,as in this case,and the motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction is decided on the basis of affidavits and other written material,the plaintiff need only make a prima facie showing that jurisdiction exists.realty,vaughan real estate,see also soma med.int l standard chartered bank,cir.all factual disputes are resolved in favor of the plaintiffs when determining the sufficiency of this showing.wenz memery crystal,cir.
to establish personal jurisdiction over the vfwca defendants,the plaintiffs had to show,first,that jurisdiction is authorized under utah law and,second,that the exercise of jurisdiction does not offend the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.far west capital,towne,cir.the defendants initially try to make the case that jurisdiction over the vfwca defendants is barred under utah law because the purpose of utah statute is to protect utah citizens and residents,and no party to the present litigation is a utah citizen or resident.this attempt is unavailing.
it is true that utah statute has a purpose clause that states that the provisions of the statute are intended to ensure maximum protection to citizens of utah.utah code ann emphasis added.but the remainder of that clause says that the provisions of the statute should be applied so as to assert jurisdiction over nonresident defendants to the fullest extent permitted by the fourteenth amendment of the constitution.and the utah supreme court has explicitly said that any set of circumstances that satisfied due process will also satisfy the statute.sii megadiamond,am.superabrasives,utah.this collapses the utah standard into the more general due process standard for jurisdiction.as we have put it before,our jurisdictional inquiry in utah diversity cases is reduced to a single question did the defendants have sufficient minimum contacts with the state of utah to establish personal jurisdiction over them fidelity cas.of new york philadelphia resins,cir we conclude that they did.
the plaintiffs point to the minutes of a january vfwca meeting at which the organization deputy advocate stated that the defamation suit was approved in an ad hoc meeting in salt lake city by all of the officers then present.he stated that the department meaning the vfwca paid for the filing of the lawsuit.lowe admitted that he had spoken with the vfwca defendants about filing the lawsuit.these defendants were all present at the vfwca meeting,they were all officers,they all voted to fund the lawsuit,and they more generally authorized and approved of it.
we start the due contacts analysis by seeking to find some act by which the defendant s purposefully avail ed themselves of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum state.burger king rudzewicz,d.merely random,fortuitous or attenuated contacts will not be sufficient to establish jurisdiction.id.internal citations omitted.it appears that the contacts the vfwca defendants made were neither random nor fortuitous nor attenuated.
it is well established that the act of filing a lawsuit in a particular state is sufficient to establish jurisdiction over the plaintiff in the courts of that state in a subsequent action for abuse of process or similar torts.see neuralstem,stemcells,d,collecting cases in which a party essentially consents to jurisdiction in the forum state through the act of filing a previous suit where the second suit arises from the same transaction.jurisdiction is thus clear as to lowe.shaw,norris,and wolfe were not plaintiffs in the defamation lawsuit,but they were part of an ad hoc team that agreed that lowe should file a lawsuit against rusakiewicz and spera in utah,and that he should do it forthwith.not only did they discuss the suit with lowe and give it their approval in advance,but they appropriated vfwca money to fund it.these discussions and votes took place in utah.
other courts have found the act of authorizing and directing a lawsuit to be enough to establish jurisdiction over officers of a corporation.for example,in mobil oil advanced environmental recycling technologies,a delaware district court found that the officers of a corporation who directed the filing of a lawsuit in delaware were subject to personal jurisdiction there.in that case,the court found jurisdiction even though none of the acts that directed or authorized the lawsuit were conducted in delaware.id.at.the court held that by authorizing and directing the filing of mobil declaratory judgment lawsuit in delaware,the corporate officers purposefully availed themselves of the benefits and protections of delaware.id.at.this case is the same,except that the decisions to authorize and support the lawsuit were made in the forum state,which makes the argument for jurisdiction that much stronger 
but mobil oil is still a step removed from the facts of our case.in mobil oil,the defendant corporate officers authorized a lawsuit in which the corporation itself was the plaintiff.here,the officers supported lowe decision to file the defamation lawsuit and authorized the payment of vfwca corporate funds to defray its costs,but the corporation was not a plaintiff.the parties have not cited cases involving this factual scenario,and we have not located any.nonetheless,we think it must be true that those who support and authorize funding of intentional tortious conduct must be subject to personal jurisdiction in the state where the tort took place and where they committed the acts that supported the tort.if a group of corporate officers voted to appropriate corporate money to fund a bank robbery in utah,we think the minimum contacts would be sufficient to permit the state court to assume jurisdiction even though they took no part in the actual.
if a defendant actions have created sufficient minimum contacts,we must still go on to consider whether the exercise of personal jurisdiction over the defendant offends traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.omi holdings,royal ins.of canada,cir internal quotations omitted.but if we find that there have been minimum contacts as we have,the burden is on the defendant to present a compelling case that the presence of some other considerations would render jurisdiction unreasonable.burger king,at.such cases are rare.traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice are said to comprise five factors the burden on the defendant,the forum state interest in resolving the dispute,the plaintiff interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief,the interstate judicial system interest in obtaining the most efficient resolution of controversies,and the shared interest of the several states in furthering fundamental social policies.id.at.
it is scarcely unfair to make those who have initiated a lawsuit in a particular state undergo suit in that state to determine whether the lawsuit was tortious.if shaw,norris,and wolfe,along with lowe,regarded utah as a suitable forum for their suit,it can not be unfair for them to be sued in the same forum on the basis of that original suit.the other factors either support or do not cut strongly against this conclusion.it therefore does not run afoul of traditional notions of justice and fair play to find jurisdiction over the vfwca defendants in utah.
the defendants object that the plaintiffs are trying to assert jurisdiction solely on their actions as vfwca officers in authorizing vfwca funds to reimburse lowe for his legal fees.appellee br.they continue that shaw,norris,and wolfe met in their capacities as officers of the vfwca in order to decide whether to authorize lowe legal fees,id.at emphasis added,and that it is hornbook that officers and employees of a nonprofit are not personally liable for acts done in their capacities as officers.id.at.they cite our decision in ten mile industrial park western plain service,cir for the proposition that,where acts are performed by individuals in their corporate capacities,the corporate structure will ordinarily insulate the individuals from the court jurisdiction.appellee br.
we think that the defendants are reading ten mile incorrectly.ten mile held that the court lacked jurisdiction over an executive committee of a corporation for the contacts made by the corporation.id.at.the rationale was that an officer in a corporation is not personally liable for all the acts of the corporation j urisdiction over the representatives of a corporation may not be predicated on jurisdiction over the corporation itself id.at see also wegerer first commodity of boston,cir.rather,jurisdiction over the representatives must be based on their individual contacts with the forum state.ten mile,at.
the liability of the vfwca defendants under this complaint is not predicated on their status as corporate officers,but on their own personal acts as individuals in supporting and voting to fund the defamation lawsuit.these are contacts in utah by the defendants themselves,in ten that have been imputed to them on account of the actions of the corporation.so there is no derived liability,only primary liability,in this case.as the utah supreme court has explained,an officer of a corporation is not personally liable for torts of the corporation or of its other officers and agents merely by virtue of holding corporate office,but can only incur personal liability by participating in the wrongful activity.armed forces ins.exch.harrison,utah citing william meade fletcher,fletcher cyclopedia of the law of private corporations,at ed see id.no jurisdiction when corporate officer was not personally making or directing others emphasis added.applying these principles,we hold that the district court erred in concluding that it lacked personal jurisdiction over the vfwca defendants.
iii.abuse of process 
in a case arising under diversity jurisdiction,as this case does,the federal court must ascertain and apply the state law.wade emcasco ins,cir.in utah,abuse of process applies to one who uses a legal process against another primarily to accomplish a purpose for which it is not designed.anderson dev.tobias,utah internal citation omitted.or,as the utah supreme court put it in an earlier case,the essence of abuse of process is a perversion of the process to accomplish some improper purpose,such as compelling its victim to do something which he would not otherwise be legally obliged to do.crease pleasant grove city,utah.to establish a claim for abuse of process in utah,the claimant must show an ulterior purpose in bringing the suit,and a wilful act in the use of the process not proper in the regular conduct of the proceedings.hatch davis,utah quotations omitted.the second part of the test is known as the wilful act requirement,and to satisfy it a party must point to conduct independent of the legal process itself that corroborates the alleged improper purpose.id.at.
the district court focused on the wilful act requirement in dismissing the plaintiffs claim.the instant case,the court stated,fails to properly state an abuse of process claim because there is no allegation of,or even a factual basis for asserting an independent act corroborative of an alleged improper purpose.dist.op.at,wl,at.the district court reasoned that lowe lawsuit had been designed to address the claim that he was defamed,id.at,wl,at,and that his settlement offers were in pursuit of that end to induce rusakiewicz and spera to stop saying things about him that lo
