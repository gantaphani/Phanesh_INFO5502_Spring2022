section of the telecommunications act of act requires the federal communications commission,upon biennial review,to repeal or modify any regulation that is no longer necessary in the public interest as the result of meaningful economic competition between providers of such service.cellco partnership verizon wireless verizon wireless and verizon telephone companies verizon petition for review of the commission biennial regulatory reviews for and,respectively,challenging the commission interpretation of.verizon wireless also challenges the commission determination to retain two rules,a and i.because of the nature of the term necessary,whose meaning depends on its statutory context,we defer to the commission reasonable interpretation of as requiring it to apply the same standard used to adopt regulations under b to determinations of whether the regulations remain necessary in the public interest,and as imposing a time limit for commission action only in a.absent direction by congress for a contrary interpretation,this interpretation provides internal statutory consistency,avoids absurd results,and is consistent with congress deregulatory purpose.
we therefore hold,upon rejecting the commission challenges to our jurisdiction and verizon wireless standing,that because neither mandates the completion of the b proceedings within the biennial year itself nor requires the commission to repeal or modify every rule that the commission does not determine to be absolutely essential,and thus does not impose a special evidentiary burden,the commission provided an adequate explanation for retention of the two rules challenged by verizon wireless.accordingly,we deny verizon wireless petition challenging the commission interpretation of and its determination to retain the two rules.in light of our disposition of verizon wireless petition,we dismiss verizon petition for lack of jurisdiction.
the communications act of vested broad discretion in the commission to regulate interstate and international wire and radio communications services.see.among the responsibilities that congress assigned to the commission is the duty to prescribe such rules and regulations as may be necessary in the public interest.id.b.its rulemaking authority thus extends to adopting rules so long as they are not an unreasonable means to achieve permissible goals.fcc citizens comm.for,d.
in,congress amended the communications act to provide for the regulation of mobile communications services.see omnibus budget reconciliation act of,title vi,c,stat.commercial mobile radio services cmrs were to be treated as common carriers subject to title ii of the communications act,which authorizes the commission to ensure that carriers comply with applicable statutes.see.congress,however,authorized the commission to forbear from applying the provisions of title ii to such carriers upon determining,among other things,that forbearance is consistent with the public interest.c a iii.in making that determination,the commission must consider whether the proposed forbearance regulation will promote competitive market conditions,including the extent to which such regulation will enhance competition among providers of commercial mobile services.id.c c.congress further directed the commission to review cmrs competitive market conditions and to analyze these conditions in its annual report.id.
in,by further amendment to the communications act,congress enacted the telecommunications act of to ensure a,national policy framework designed to accelerate rapidly private sector development of advanced telecommunications and information technologies and services to all americans by opening all telecommunications markets to competition,sess.congress broad policy was to be implemented through commission rules,but the act provided that it shall not be construed to modify,impair or supersede the communications act unless expressly so provided,c,stat,note.see also iowa utils,d.the act directed the commission to expedite rulemaking in a variety of areas,for instance,local competition,universal service,and portability,see d,b,but also vested the commission with general forbearance authority,id.as pertinent here,the act,amended title i of the communications act by adding a new,which directed the commission to undertake biennial assessments of its rules to determine whether they should be repealed or modified.section provides 
a biennial review of regulations.in every year beginning with,the commission shall review all regulations issued under this chapter in effect at the time of the review that apply to the operations or activities of any provider of telecommunications service and shall determine whether any such regulation is no longer necessary in the public interest as the result of meaningful economic competition between providers of such service.
b effect of determination.the commission shall repeal or modify any regulation it determines to be no longer necessary in the public interest.
id.emphasis added.
consequently,the commission has undertaken a wholesale review of its regulations.initially,the commission approach was to examine all its rules,not merely those that were specifically implicated in,to determine whether repeal or modification might be appropriate.as a result of the biennial regulatory review,the commission initiated proceedings to remove unnecessary regulatory burdens.see biennial regulatory review report,fcc rcd,january report.
the commission also conducted a comprehensive review of its regulations in the biennial regulatory review.with respect to each rule,staff reports considered the underlying purposes,the advantages and disadvantages,the impact of competitive developments,and whether modification or repeal should be recommended.see public notice,biennial review staff report released,fcc rcd.as a result of the biennial review,the commission adopted the staff recommendations for modification or repeal of rules and released an updated staff report in light of comments on the initial staff report.see january report,fcc rcd at.the commission also reported on the status of the deregulatory initiatives begun in the review,see,id.at,construing not to require completion of such initiatives within the biennial year,id.at.following notice and comment,the commission modified or repealed numerous regulations.
in the international service market,for instance,the commission removed tariff regulation from interexchange services provided by carriers,see policy and rules concerning the international,interexchange marketplace,fcc rcd,adopted streamlined procedures for processing applications for submarine cable landing licenses,see review of commission consideration of applications under the cable landing license act,fcc rcd,reduced the notification period in the foreign carrier affiliation notification rule,and exempted certain classes of foreign carriers from the prior notification requirement,see rules and policies on foreign participation in the telecommunications market,fcc rcd.the commission also determined to retain a,which requires common carriers to report annually on their international telecommunications traffic,and i as of august,h,which requires providers of telecommunications services to give notice of their foreign affiliations in seeking commission authorization to operate.see biennial regulatory review report and order,amendments of parts and of the commission rules,fcc rcd,june order.the commission invited comments on any additional international telecommunications services that should be modified or repealed as part of the biennial regulatory review.see public notice,commission seeks public comment in biennial review of telecommunications regulations within the purview of the international bureau,fcc rcd.
in the biennial regulatory review,the commission formally addressed the meaning and scope of,and the commission staff issued a series of reports reviewing and determining,as to each rule covered by,whether the rule should be repealed or modified.the commission,in a report released march,adopted the staff reports and its own report,which incorporated its interpretation of,stated its intention to issue notices of proposed rulemaking on the basis of the recommendations in the staff reports,and solicited applications for review of those recommendations.see biennial regulatory review,fcc rcd,march report,available at.
the petitions for review represent another attempt by the same parties and the same counsel to elicit from this court a narrow interpretation of the word necessary in the deregulatory context of the act.in cellular telecommunications internet ass fcc,ctia,verizon wireless failed to persuade the court in the related context of the commission forbearance authority,a,to adopt such an interpretation.now verizon wireless and verizon seek in tandem petitions to elicit a narrow construction of necessary for purposes.verizon does not challenge any particular regulation addressed by the biennial regulatory review,but verizon wireless challenges the commission determinations in the review to retain a and i,ultimately maintaining that in view of the commission utter disregard of a statutory mandate,the court should instruct the commission to repeal the regulations.verizon wireless br.at.we address the commission threshold challenges to verizon petition,and turn thereafter to the merits of verizon wireless petition.
the commission challenges both verizon standing to petition for review of an order setting forth the commission interpretation of requirements before it has been applied in a manner causing injury to verizon,see eeoc,shell oil ferc,and the court jurisdiction to consider a or order,see drg funding sec y of hud,franklin massachusetts,d lujan wildlife fed n,d ohio forestry ass n,sierra club,d.we need not decide these questions.verizon wireless has standing to challenge the commission actions regarding a and i.see friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl,d.agency of natural res.united states,d.because we decide the merits of verizon wireless petition,verizon petition,which presents identical challenges to the commission interpretation of,no longer presents a substantial federal question,and the court therefore lacks jurisdiction.see steel citizens for a better env t,d world wide minerals,republic of kazakhstan.
to succeed on appeal,verizon wireless must demonstrate that the june order is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.under this highly deferential standard of review,the court presumes the validity of agency action,see,davis latschar,and must affirm unless the commission failed to consider relevant factors or made a clear error in judgment,see,citizens to preserve overton park,volpe,d.one of the relevant factors is the act mandate in for biennial reviews to identify commission regulations no longer necessary in the public interest as the result of meaningful economic competition between providers of such service,followed by their repeal or modification.sinclair broad.group,fcc,ctia,at.the standards of chevron natural resources defense council,d,apply to the court review of the commission interpretation of the communications act.see ctia,at.thus,where congress has spoken directly to the issue,our inquiry is at an end.chevron,at.where congress intent is unclear because the statute is silent or the language congress has used is ambiguous,the question is whether the agency interpretation is a permissible construction of the statute,id.at,and if it is,the court will defer to the implementing agency reasonable interpretation.see,at.
the two regulations whose retention verizon wireless challenges involve reporting requirements.the first,requires all common carriers providing international service to file annual and quarterly reports with the commission regarding such service,including a financial breakdown and a compilation of total minutes of calls involving international destinations.in the biennial review,in response to comments by verizon wireless,the commission determined that quarterly reports by cmrs carriers affiliated with certain foreign carriers were no longer necessary in the public interest.june order,fcc rec at.because such carriers have a de minimis amount of the switched resale international traffic,the commission reasoned,they are unlikely to be able to distort traffic on affiliated routes.id.at.however,the commission retained the annual reporting requirement,despite comments from both verizon wireless and cingular wireless llc cingular supporting its elimination because some of the same data was provided in other regulatory filings.noting that both the commission and industry use the information provided in the reports to monitor compliance with the commission rules and policies,the commission concluded that the proposed alternative would not provide information on minutes of use,which the commission found to be important.id.at.the commission concluded therefore,we find that these less burdensome annual reporting requirements continue to be in the public interest.id.at.
the second regulation,requires notification to the commission of foreign affiliations.under the communications act,a,the commission is required to determine whether public convenience and necessity would be served by a carrier acquisition,construction,or operation of telecommunications facilities,including international ones.to make that determination,the commission requires all international carriers,except those owned by another carrier with its own international authorization,see i,to comply with the application process in.during the biennial review,cingular commented that the exemption in i,which exempts only subsidiaries,should be extended to international carriers that hold a controlling interest,but not a complete ownership stake,in another carrier.the commission declined to broaden the exemption,reiterating its finding when it adopted the exemption a controlling interest that does not amount to ownership may raise additional issues,such as additional foreign affiliations or minority ownership or beneficial interest by persons or entities who are barred from holding a commission authorization.june order,fcc rcd at quoting biennial regulatory review,review of international common carrier regulations,fcc rcd.it noted that subsidiaries not wholly owned by a carrier might require more information for national security,law enforcement,trade or foreign policy evaluation.id.the commission is required to notify the secretaries of defense and state when a carrier requests a authorization.see b.
verizon wireless contends that a strict reading of the term necessary is required by the plain language,the statutory structure,and the purpose of.the commission,according to verizon wireless,failed to meet its burden under to demonstrate by specific record evidence that the retention of these two regulations in their present form is necessary,for the commission may not rely on its initial justification for adoption of a rule,but instead must provide evidence to demonstrate that its regulation remains essential in light of present market conditions.as support for its interpretation of,verizon wireless relies on the dictionary definition of necessary as essential or indispensable,see merriam webster collegiate dictionary ed,and this court opinions in fox television stations,fcc,fox i,and sinclair,at.in its view,such a strict reading is the only reading consonant with the statutory purpose,which modified the previous regulatory model for telecommunications services to favor reliance upon competition and market forces.verizon wireless reply br.at.it maintains that the commission interpretation fails to recognize that is meant to cabin the commission authority and reduce regulation and not simply to restate the general administrative law obligation of the commission to carefully monitor the effects of its regulations and make adjustments where circumstances so require.aclu fcc,see bechtel fcc.although the court rejected virtually all of the same arguments in support of a narrow reading of necessary as meaning absolutely essential in the context of the commission forbearance authority under,see ctia,at,we reexamine them as applied to.
when congress enacted,it did not specify what it meant by the key phrase at issue,necessary in the public interest.in the biennial regulatory review,the commission did not address the meaning of this key phrase,but instead implicitly relied on the traditional meaning of the phrase as it had been interpreted in other sections of the communications act.see,june order,fcc rec at.the commission formal discussion of its interpretation of appears in the biennial regulatory review.responding to comments on the appropriate interpretation of,submitted in response to the commission public notice for suggestions for the review,the commission adopted an interpretation rejecting assertions that the plain meaning of requires the commission to repeal any rule that it does not find to be absolutely essential.see march report,fcc rcd at.the court takes judicial notice of the march report.see shuttlesworth birmingham,d fire ins.of hartford thompson.leboeuf,lamb,greene macrae,abraham.an examination of the commission reasoning in construing its obligations under demonstrates that its interpretation is eminently reasonable.
the commission has interpreted in light of the fact that the phrase necessary in the public interest in a and b was the same phrase that congress used in delegating rulemaking authority to the commission.this is consistent with the general proposition that identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning.gustafson alloyd,d.under b,the commission can adopt rules upon finding that they advance a legitimate regulatory objective it need not find that they are indispensable.see march report,fcc rcd at citizens,at.in light of what the commission correctly observed to be the ambiguous nature of the term necessary,with its meaning dependent on its statutory context,the commission concluded that congress intended the phrase in to have the same meaning as in b.see march report,fcc rcd at.it rejected the view that congress use of a different verb may be in b and is in preceding clause no longer in the public interest required two different standards,reasoning that because both provisions required the commission to make predictive judgments about the necessity of a rule,congress would not have used the same phrase it had used in b if it had intended to require a more stringent standard.id.at.
the commission found further support for its interpretation in the phrase no longer,which precedes the phrase necessary in the public interest,as indicating that congress intended the same standard to apply in as applies in b.id.at.the legislative history also offered support for the commission interpretation.id.at citing conf,at.the commission interpretation,moreover,avoided absurd results where the commission would adopt a regulation under b as necessary only to be required to revoke it in the following year as under a more stringent necessary standard in.see march report,fcc rcd at.therefore,the commission concluded that congress intended the commission to carry out the deregulatory purpose of the act through the reevaluation of its rules in light of current competitive market conditions to be sure that the conclusion that it reached in adopting the rule that it was needed to further the public interest remains valid.id.at.
the term necessary is a word whose meaning,as verizon wireless acknowledges,may be influenced by its context.the supreme court and this court have had occasion to construe the word necessary in the strict,dictionary definition sense that verizon wireless maintains applies to.in,the court rejected the commission flexible construction of necessary in,which requires the commission to consider whether access to a proprietary network element is necessary before requiring its unbundling the court held that the term requires the commission to apply some limiting standard,rationally related to the goals of the act.at.similarly,in gte service fcc,the court rejected an expansive commission interpretation of necessary in the context of requiring local exchange carriers to provide for collocation of equipment necessary for access to unbundled network elements at a carrier premises,which is another part of closely related to that at issue in.both cases,however,addressed only the word necessary,rather than the phrase necessary in the public interest,and,as the supreme court observed in,the act is not a model of clarity.it is in many important respects a model of ambiguity or indeed even,at.similarly,this court noted in ctia that necessary is not language of plain meaning.ctia,at.consequently,verizon wireless position that necessary in must be interpreted to have a strict dictionary definition ignores both that congress chose to leave the phrase unqualified except in ways that are supportive of the commission view that the same standard is to apply in as applies in b,at t,at,and that courts have long recognized that the term necessary does not always mean indispensable or essential.see,citizens,at armour wantock.mcculloch maryland,wheat.indep.ins.agents of,hawke,ctia,at.adoption of verizon wireless position,then,would give an unwarranted rigidity to the application of the word necessary,which has always been recognized as a word to be harmonized with its context.armour,at.
to the extent verizon wireless contends that the commission ignores the deregulatory purpose animating the act,verizon wireless ignores both what the commission has said in interpreting and what the commission has done in implementing since initiating the biennial reviews in.in the and biennial regulatory reviews,the commission acknowledged the deregulatory goal of the act and its obligation to determine whether its rules were necessary in light of current market conditions.see public notice,biennial review staff report released,fcc rcd march report,fcc rcd at.while rejecting verizon comment that imposed a special burden to support any finding that a rule remained necessary and that absent such evidence the rule must immediately be repealed,the commission agreed that where conditions are met,creates a presumption in favor of repealing or modifying covered rules.see march report,fcc rcd at.in addition,the staff reports adopted by the commission in the and biennial reviews incorporate the competitive market approach in examining whether a regulation is no longer necessary.indeed,the commission actions in response to the biennial reviews indicate that is working as congress intended.see,id.at conf,at see also january report,fcc rcd at.
nothing in our opinions in fox i and sinclair is to the contrary.these cases arose in the regulatory context of h and g,governing broadcast ownership requirements.pretermitting whether the different regulatory context suffices to distinguish the statutory challenge in the instant petitions,neither fox i nor sinclair adopted a controlling definition of necessary,much less the position that embodies a presumption in favor of deregulation.although sinclair states that only those regulations necessary in the public interest may be retained,at,it cited the recently decided opinion in fox i,at,for that proposition and did not itself define necessary.in fox i,the court,in addressing remedies available for the court to require,interpreted necessary to mean that a regulation should be retained only insofar as it is necessary in,not merely consonant with,the public interest.at.but shortly after sinclair was decided,the court in fox television stations,fcc,fox ii,retracted fox i definition of necessary,due to lack of briefing on the subject and the fact that the definition was unnecessary to the court opinion.id.at.consequently,sinclair,at,and fox ii left undecided the question of what necessary means in.
the court statement in fox i regarding the meaning of necessary as creating a presumption in favor of modification or elimination of existing regulations was,as noted,made in the context of discussing the available remedies for the court.at.nothing in that opinion suggested that under biennial review mandate the commission could no longer rely on its predictive judgment or inferences in determining to retain a regulation.id.at.the court observation in fox i about the presumption created by the act onl
