this is a second trip to our court for eric noel in his more than a feud with sandra hall over a horse,a mobile home,and tapes of recorded telephone calls.it all started with the horse.in this unhappy chapter of the continuing saga,noel appeals from summary judgment entered by the district court of oregon dismissing his case against herb weisser,hall attorney during the early part of the dispute.noel challenges the district court dismissal of his federal and state law claims against weisser,as well as the denial of leave to file a fifth amended complaint that alleges rico violations.here,we affirm the district court entry of summary judgment on the federal wiretap claims.in a separate memorandum disposition,we affirm the district court on all other claims,including the denial of the motion to file a fifth amended complaint 
before all the lawsuits and enmity began,sandra hall lived and worked at the vancouver riding academy,a business that eric noel owned and operated.in and,noel and hall entered into two inauspicious agreements.first,in may,they agreed to jointly purchase a horse named red hot prospect for,train it and ready it for resale,and share equally in any profits earned.second,around august,hall sold noel her mobile home which was parked on the premises of the academy.the sale price of was to be paid in full when red was sold.
by august,hall and noel relationship had turned sour,and it continued to deteriorate as the two fought over the management of the horse and the ownership of the home.then in may,hall and her husband,brian hall,went to the mobile home,where noel now lived,and found a number of cassette tapes on a table and in a stereo that belonged to hall.she played one of them and realized that the tapes contained recordings of her telephone conversations while she lived at the academy.id.she took the tapes and called her friend,gabrielle lennartz,whose conversation had also been recorded,to seek her advice.it is not clear from the record how or by what means noel made these recordings,although both parties appear to assume that he intercepted hall calls and recorded her conversations on the tapes.
immediately after hearing from hall,lennartz contacted herb weisser,an attorney.weisser told lennartz that the women may have federal and state wiretap claims against noel,but that either he or she would have to listen to the tapes in their entirety and summarize them before he could evaluate the legal claim.weisser advised lennartz to turn over the original tapes to the police as evidence of a crime but to make a copy for him for purposes of pursuing a civil claim against noel.he also suggested that she contact the other parties whose conversations had been recorded to inform them that the tapes had been made.lennartz took his advice and listened to the tapes as she copied them,prepared a summary of the contents,delivered the tapes and the summaries to weisser and to the clark county sheriff department,and called the recorded parties to inform them of the existence of the tapes.noel also alleges that lennartz disclosed the contents of the conversation to his clients and prospective employer in order to discredit him.
a number of lawsuits ensued thereafter.of some relevance here,in the lawsuit over red the horse filed by noel in the skamania county superior court,hall,represented by weisser,filed counterclaims alleging the violation of wiretapping laws.hall later voluntarily dismissed the counterclaims,hired william brendgard as her lawyer,and filed a separate suit against noel in state court,alleging violations of federal wiretap law under and state wiretapping law under section of the revised code of washington.she won a judgment of plus costs and attorney fees in august.
the dispute finally reached the federal courts on may,when noel filed suit in the district court of oregon against hall,her husband brian,weisser,lennartz,and michelle merchant in the third amended complaint,the one being pursued in this lawsuit,he alleged the violation of federal wiretap laws,the violation of oregon wiretap laws,loss of use of the mobile home,damage to the mobile home,damage to personal property,intentional interference with contractual relations,breach of fiduciary duty,blackmail,extortion,and injurious falsehood.in fact,there were few torts he failed to allege other than horse thievery.the case was appealed previously when the district court dismissed all claims against the halls based on the doctrines of and claim preclusion.on september,intrigued by the technical jurisdictional issues,we wrote a lengthy and learned disquisition on the doctrine and reversed on that ground as well as on the ground of claim preclusion as to which our disquisition was equally learned although not as lengthy.we remanded the case to the district court affirming the dismissal of the claims against hall but reversing the dismissal of all other claims.noel hall,cir.thus the saga of red the horse survived once more and once more the federal courts became enmeshed in the petty feud between noel and the others.
on remand,noel sought leave to file a fifth amended complaint.seeing light at the end of the tunnel,or at least a glimmer of light,the magistrate judge denied the motion,and the district judge overruled noel objections to the magistrate judge order.the magistrate judge then recommended granting weisser motion for summary judgment,and the district judge adopted the recommendation and granted the motion.the district court entered a rule b judgment in favor of weisser on september.noel again timely appealed 
ii.jurisdiction 
we have jurisdiction over noel appeal of the federal wiretap claim pursuant to if we determine that the district court properly entered final judgment as to all claims against weisser.
when the district court dismisses claims against one of a number of parties,it has discretion to direct the entry of a final judgment as to that party only if the court expressly determines that there is no just reason to delay.b.our function on appeal is to scrutinize the district court evaluation of such factors as the interrelationship of the claims so as to prevent piecemeal appeals in cases which should be reviewed only as single units,d.if we are satisfied that such juridical concerns have been met,however,we accord substantial deference to the district court assessment of equitable factors such as prejudice and delay.see also texaco,ponsoldt,cir.
in this case,the district court expressly determined that there was no just reason for delay and directed that final judgment be entered as to all claims against weisser this determination was proper.the summary judgment disposed of the case between noel and weisser,freeing weisser from further unduly burdensome litigation.see alcan aluminum carlsberg fin,cir.although similar claims remain pending against other defendants,the factual bases of many of the claims differ as to each defendant.moreover,we have held that claims certified for appeal do not need to be separate and independent from the remaining claims,so long as resolving the claims would streamline the ensuing litigation.texaco,at.it would do so here.as a result,red the horse may finally be on the path to ending his journey through the federal courts.in short,we conclude that we have jurisdiction over this appeal.
iii.federal wiretap claims 
the civil damages provision of the federal wiretap act,title iii of the omnibus crime control and safe streets act of,as amended by the electronic communications privacy act of,et.wiretap act,provides a private right of action to any person whose wire communication is intercepted,disclosed,or intentionally used in violation of this chapter.a washington state court found noel liable under this provision for intercepting hall telephone conversations and recording them on audiotapes.noel contended before the district court that weisser violated the same provision by directing lennartz to listen to and copy the tapes,thus intercept ing his wire communication,and intentionally us ing and disclos ing the tapes contents in the course of filing a lawsuit against him and in making settlement offers we review de novo the
