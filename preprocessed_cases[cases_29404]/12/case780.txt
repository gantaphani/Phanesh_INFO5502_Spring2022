currently,a wireless telephone customer who wishes to switch from one wireless service provider to another must also change telephone numbers.in,the federal communications commission commission or fcc promulgated regulations requiring wireless carriers to provide number portability the ability of consumers to keep their phone numbers when they switch wireless carriers and set a compliance date of june.see telephone number portability,first report and order and further notice of proposed rule,wl first report and order.in,the commission granted a request from petitioner cellular telecommunications internet association ctia,pursuant to a,for temporary forbearance from enforcement of the commission wireless number portability rules,and extended the compliance deadline to november.see ctia petition for forbearance from commercial mobile radio services number portability obligations,memorandum opinion and order,wl temporary forbearance order.petitioner verizon wireless then sought permanent forbearance from the commission wireless number portability rules.on july,the commission denied verizon wireless forbearance petition,but extended the enforcement deadline to november.see verizon wireless petition for partial forbearance from the commercial mobile radio services number portability obligation,memorandum opinion and order,wl order.
in the instant case,petitioners ctia and verizon wireless seek review of the commission order denying permanent forbearance from enforcement of the commission rules requiring wireless carriers to provide number portability.petitioners challenge the commission statutory authority to impose wireless number portability.petitioners also contend that the commission misinterpreted and misapplied a of the telecommunications act of,a,which requires the commission to forbear from enforcement of its regulations if three standards are met,including the condition that enforcement is not necessary for the protection of consumers.
we dismiss the petition for review in part and deny the petition in part.we first find that petitioners challenge to the fcc authority to impose wireless number portability is.a petition for judicial review to challenge a final order of the commission must be filed within days after its entry.see see also a.the fcc promulgated the number portability rules in july and the petition for review in this case was not filed until august.the petition for review is clearly untimely.the statutory time limit is jurisdictional.therefore,we are constrained to dismiss the untimely petition for review for want of jurisdiction.
on petitioners challenge to the commission decision not to forbear from enforcement of the wireless number portability rules,we conclude that the commission interpretation and application of the second prong of the enforcement test under a enforcement is not necessary for the protection of consumers was permissible and reasonable.the statutory term necessary does not have a plain meaning under step one of chevron natural resources defense council,d.and,in the context of the forbearance statute,necessary certainly can not plainly mean absolutely required or indispensable,as petitioners would have it,for that would leave the second prong of the forbearance test with no obvious applications.the commission construed the term necessary to mean that there must be a strong connection between what the agency does by way of regulation and what the agency permissibly seeks to achieve with that regulation.under this reasonable interpretation of the forbearance statute,the commission found that number portability rules are required to achieve the desired statutory goal of consumer protection.the commission therefore did not err in declining to forbear from enforcement of the wireless number portability rules.we therefore deny the petition for review of the commission forbearance decision.
background 
congress passed the telecommunications act of,stat,codified at et the act or the act,to promote competition and reduce regulation in order to secure lower prices and higher quality services for american telecommunications consumers and encourage the rapid deployment of new telecommunications technologies.act,preamble.in pursuit of that goal,a directs that the commission 
shall forbear from applying any regulation or any provision of this chapter to a telecommunications carrier or telecommunications service,or class of telecommunications carriers or telecommunications services,in any or some of its or their geographic markets,if the commission determines that 
enforcement of such regulation or provision is not necessary to ensure that the charges,practices,classifications,or regulations by,for,or in connection with that telecommunications carrier or telecommunications service are just and reasonable and are not unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory 
enforcement of such regulation or provision is not necessary for the protection of consumers and 
forbearance from applying such provision or regulation is consistent with the public interest.
the act defines number portability as the ability of users of telecommunications services to retain,at the same location,existing telecommunications numbers without impairment of quality,reliability,or convenience when switching from one telecommunications carrier to another.id.section b of the act requires all local exchange carriers to provide,to the extent technically feasible,number portability in accordance with requirements prescribed by the commission.id.b.the act defines local exchange carrier lec as 
any person that is engaged in the provision of telephone exchange service or exchange access.such term does not include a person insofar as such person is engaged in the provision of a commercial mobile service under section c of this title,except to the extent that the commission finds that such service should be included in the definition of such term.
id.the commission has not made a determination that commercial mobile radio service cmrs or wireless service should be included in the definition of local exchange carrier.the act thus does not expressly require wireless carriers to provide number portability.
on july,the commission promulgated rules requiring wireless carriers to provide number portability.see first report and order.although wireless carriers are not lecs,the commission,in its first report and order,concluded that it had independent authority,under,to require wireless carriers to provide number portability.id.at.the commission set a compliance date of june,for wireless carriers.id.on petition for reconsideration,the commission reaffirmed its principal findings.see telephone number portability,first memorandum opinion and order on reconsideration,wl first reconsideration order.
on may,petitioner verizon wireless predecessor in interest,bell atlantic nynex mobile,filed a petition for review of the commission wireless number portability rules in this court,challenging the commission authority to impose wireless number portability.the petition was supported by a number of intervenors,including petitioner ctia.the case was transferred to the tenth circuit and briefed.
meanwhile,on december,ctia filed a forbearance petition with the commission under a of the act,a,seeking temporary forbearance from enforcement of the number portability requirements for wireless carriers until completion of a period prescribed by the commission.on february,the commission granted the petition and extended the wireless number portability enforcement deadline to november.see temporary forbearance order,at.the commission found that the test for forbearance under a had been met.it found that wireless number portability was not necessary at that time to ensure just and reasonable charges and practices,because competition in the wireless market had increased significantly.nor was wireless number portability necessary at that time to protect consumers,because the demand for number portability among consumers was low.finally,the commission found temporary forbearance consistent with the public interest because the industry needed additional time to develop number portability technology and improvements likely to enhance service and competition.see id.at.but the commission rejected permanent forbearance,because,in the longer term,wireless number portability was expected to become increasingly important to consumers as wireless phones became potential substitutes for their wireline phones.see id.at.
on march,in light of the commission extension of the enforcement deadline to november,bell atlantic and the commission agreed to dismiss without prejudice the case that was pending before the tenth circuit.the stipulated dismissal provided that the commission shall not object to bell atlantic mobile presentation of the same issues and arguments presented in this appeal in any other present or future proceeding involving review of an fcc action or order concerning cmrs number portability.joint motion for dismissal,bell atlantic nynex mobile,fcc,cir.filed,reprinted in joint appendix ja.
on july,with the november enforcement deadline approaching,verizon wireless filed a petition with the commission,seeking permanent forbearance from the wireless number portability rules under a.verizon wireless claimed that the wireless market was already sufficiently competitive that the industry should not be required to implement wireless number portability while attempting to comply with other regulatory requirements and that the costs of implementing wireless number portability would exceed the benefits.see verizon wireless petition pursuant to for partial forbearance from the cmrs number portability obligation,ja.on july,the commission issued the order that is the subject of the instant petition for judicial review.the commission denied verizon wireless petition for permanent forbearance,but extended the implementation deadline by another year,to november.see order,at.
the commission found that permanent forbearance was not justified under the second and third prongs of the a forbearance test.on the second prong enforcement is not necessary for the protection of consumers,the commission reasoned that the market was developing as anticipated in the temporary forbearance order,such that more consumers viewed their wireless phones as potential substitutes for their wireline phones,and that wireless service was competing directly with wireline service.id.at.as these trends continue,and as wireless service subscribers increase the frequency with which they give out their mobile telephone number,we anticipate that an increasing number of consumers will be reluctant to change wireless service providers unless they can keep the same number,and will find themselves forced to stay with carriers with whom they may be dissatisfied because the cost of giving up their wireless phone number in order to move to another carrier is too high.id.at.the commission thus concluded that a permanent forbearance from the number portability requirements for cmrs carriers is not consistent with the protection of consumers.id.at.
on the third prong forbearance is consistent with the public interest,the commission worried about market failure,reasoning that 
it is unlikely for the entire industry to agree to move to wireless number portability voluntarily.in addition,there may be economic disincentives for any individual carrier to be the first to voluntarily adopt full number portability,which would provide its subscribers the flexibility to switch to a different carrier while retaining their current phone numbers.this is because,absent the implementation of full number portability by other wireless carriers,that carrier could not gain any new wireless customers from the wireless carriers.as a result,to ensure that consumers have the ability to switch carriers while retaining their phone numbers,we must require wireless carriers to implement number portability.
id.at.the commission again emphasized the trend of consumers use of wireless phones as their main phones,and the importance of wireless number portability to eliminating a disincentive to switch among wireless carriers based on competitive factors such as price,service,and coverage.id.thus,the commission deemed permanent forbearance inconsistent with the public interest.
although the commission denied permanent forbearance,it found that further extension of the implementation deadline to november,was warranted,to provide adequate time to resolve technical and issues.see id.at.
this petition for review of the commission order followed.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
in reviewing the commission construction of the test for forbearance under a,we are governed by the principles enunciated in chevron natural resources defense council,d.in chevron,the court held that,i f the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.at.at.if congress has not directly addressed the precise question at issue,and the agency has acted pursuant to an express or implicit delegation of authority,the agency interpretation of the statute is entitled to deference so long as it is reasonable and not otherwise arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute.id.at.at.see also motion picture ass of,fcc.
the commission order is also subject to review under the traditional arbitrary and capricious standard.as the supreme court explained in motor vehicle manufacturers ass state farm mutual automobile insurance,d,
t he scope of review under the arbitrary and capricious standard is narrow and a court is not to substitute its judgment for that of the agency.nevertheless,the agency must examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.burlington truck lines,united states,d.in reviewing that explanation,we must consider whether the decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment.bowman transportation,freight system,d citizens to preserve overton park volpe,d.
timeliness of challenge to fcc statutory authority to impose number portability 
in conjunction with their petition for review of the fcc decision not to forbear from enforcing the wireless number portability requirement,petitioners also seek to challenge the commission statutory authority to impose wireless number portability.see petitioners br.we hold that the question of the commission statutory authority to impose wireless number portability is not properly before this court.
first,petitioners challenge to the commission statutory authority is nothing more than a challenge to the underlying regulations,promulgated in,requiring wireless carriers to provide number portability.see first report and order,first reconsideration order.the commission specifically addressed the issue of its authority to require wireless number portability in the first report and order,at,and in the first reconsideration order,at.petitioners challenged the commission authority to require wireless number portability in their petition for review of the first report and order and the first reconsideration order,thereby satisfying the statutory requirement that a petition for judicial review of a final order of the commission must be filed within days after its entry.see see also a.however,petitioners later voluntarily dismissed their petition for review,see joint motion for dismissal,ja,and did not refile their petition within the statutory time limit.petitioners challenge to the commission authority to promulgate the underlying regulations in the instant case is therefore untimely.
it does not matter whether the commission agreed,in settling the case before the tenth circuit,not to object to the presentation of the same issues and arguments in any future proceeding involving review of an order concerning wireless number portability.see id.at.the statutory deadline is jurisdictional.natural res.def.council nuclear regulatory comm n,see freeman eng g,fcc,an untimely appeal must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction citation and internal quotation marks omitted emphasis in original.and this court is not bound by any agreement between the parties that purports to abrogate this jurisdictional requirement.
we recognize that statutory time limits are not always inviolate.for example,there are at least two notable circumstances in which the court will entertain challenges beyond a statutory time limit to the authority of an agency to promulgate a regulation following enforcement of the disputed regulation and following an agency rejection of a petition to amend or rescind the disputed regulation.see nlrb union flra.neither of those situations is present here.the commission has not yet enforced the wireless number portability requirement against petitioners.when the november,enforcement date arrives,if the commission in fact enforces the regulation against petitioners,then petitioners may be able to challenge the underlying regulation as applied to them.but because the statutory limitations period has expired,petitioners can not challenge the regulation before it is enforced against them.
in short,the challenge to the fcc authority to impose wireless number portability is untimely.we therefore dismiss this claim.
forbearance 
the statutory test for forbearance under a has three prongs that must all be satisfied before the commission is obligated to forbear from enforcing a regulation or a statutory provision enforcement is not necessary to ensure that the charges,practices,classifications,or regulations are just and reasonable and are not unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory enforcement is not necessary for the protection of consumers and forbearance is consistent with the public interest.see a.the three prongs of a are conjunctive.the commission could properly deny a petition for forbearance if it finds that any one of the three prongs is unsatisfied.because we conclude that the commission did not err in finding that the second prong was not met,it is unnecessary for us to address the fcc decision with respect to the other two prongs.
petitioners challenge to the commission application of a second prong centers on the meaning of statutory term necessary.petitioners contend that,in applying the second prong not necessary for the protection of consumers,the commission erred in failing to construe necessary to mean absolutely required,indispensable,or essential.petitioners position is that the commission must forbear from enforcement of its wireless number portability rules if enforcement is not absolutely required to protect consumers.see petitioners br.petitioners argue that enforcement of the wireless number portability rules is not absolutely required to protect consumers,because,in petitioners view,the rate of wireless consumers switching carriers is high even absent number portability.see id.at.
petitioners contend that this reasoning is compelled by the plain meaning of the adjective necessary,which,they point out,often is defined as absolutely required,indispensable,or essential.see petitioners br.citing merriam webster collegiate dictionary ed.but dueling over dictionary definitions is pointless,for it fails to produce any plain meaning of the disputed word.see raymond randolph,dictionaries,plain meaning,and context in statutory interpretation,harv.pub.pol y.if we focus on legal contexts,black law dictionary ed defines necessary and proper to mean b eing appropriate and well adapted to fulfilling an objective.for example,in the context of the necessary and proper clause of the constitution,const.art.i,cl,the supreme court long ago rejected the view that the necessary and proper clause demands that an act of congress be absolutely necessary to the exercise of an enumerated power.see mcculloch maryland,wheat.rather,it suffices that a statute is conducive to and is plainly adapted to its end,at.jinks richland county,d emphasis in original.hence the word necessary does not always mean absolutely required or indispensable.
indeed,there are many situations in which the use of the word necessary,in context,means something that is done,regardless of whether it is indispensable,to achieve a particular end.see randolph,supra,at.for example,necessary improvement is defined as an improvement to property that is made to prevent its deterioration.webster third new international dictionary of the english language unabridged.the point is simple it is crucial to understand the context in which the word is used in order to comprehend its meaning.see mcculloch,wheat.at stating that the word necessary admits of all degrees of comparison and is often connected with other words,which increase or diminish the impression the mind receives of the urgency it imports.
in iowa utilities board,d,the supreme court applied a narrow construction of necessary in reviewing a challenge to the commission interpretation of the term in d.this court followed suit in gte service fcc,in reviewing the commission interpretation of necessary in c,holding that,
a s is clear from the court judgment in iowa utilities board,a statutory reference to necessary must be construed in a fashion that is consistent with the ordinary and fair meaning of the word,so as to limit necessary to that which is required to achieve a desired goal.
it is significant that gte service applied a definition of necessary that which is required to achieve a desired goal that does not foreclose a particular means to an end merely because other means are hypothetically available to achieve the desired end.this is entirely understandable,because a definition of necessary that embraces only a narrow construction in all contexts makes no sense.for example,if a house foundation is weakening due to excess water on the property,and the goal of a home improvement project is to eliminate the water problem,viable solutions might include rebuilding the foundation to make it strong enough to withstand any water,digging around the house to divert water away from the house,or adding sump pumps to the house interior to expel water excesses.a solution is required to achieve the desired goal,thus necessary.none of the solutions is indispensable in the sense that it is absolutely required,because either of the other two might do as well to achieve the desired goal.but the selection of any one of the solutions is necessary to achieve the desired goal.thus,the solution that is selected is necessary to achieve the desired goal.
c ourts have frequently interpreted the word necessary to mean less than absolutely essential,and have explicitly found that a measure may be necessary even though acceptable alternatives have not been exhausted.natural res.def.council thomas,citing ftc rockefeller,cir finding that a subpoena could be necessary to an ftc investigation even though the agency had not pursued reasonably available alternatives.context is relevant to the interpretation of the term necessary.the meaning varies with context,thomas,at,and a dictionary definition by no means tells us what necessary means in every statutory context.
we do not read iowa utilities board or gte service to suggest that necessary has precisely the same meaning in every statutory context,or that context is irrelevant to the meaning of necessary.it is also noteworthy that neither iowa utilities board nor gte service involved the application of the forbearance provision of the act.rather,those cases involved disputes between lecs and new carriers seeking market access.the act fundamentally restructures local telephone markets,ending the monopolies that states historically granted to lecs and subjecting incumbent lecs to a host of duties intended to facilitate market entry,including the obligation under c to share their networks with competitors.a requesting carrier can obtain such shared access by purchasing local telephone services at wholesale rates for resale to end users,by leasing elements of the incumbent network on an unbundled basis,and by interconnecting its own facilities with the incumbent network.
in iowa utilities board,the supreme court held that the fcc did not adequately consider the necessary and impair standard under d when it gave requesting carriers blanket access to incumbent carriers network elements.the fcc rule implementing d implicitly regarded
