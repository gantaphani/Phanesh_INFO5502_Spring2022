background 
the claim systems and methods that relate in particular to cable networks that offer voice over internet protocol voip telephone services.plaintiff appellant arris develops and manufactures cable telephony and data products for cable system operators for use in voip systems.this declaratory judgment action stems from bt allegations that cable one,arris customer,has infringed the by using equipment purchased from arris to implement voip services on cable one network.
voip is a communications protocol under which voice data is transmitted over a network such as the internet,rather than over the traditional public switched telephone network pstn.to originate a voip telephone call,the analog voice signal must first be digitized and encoded into packets.in cable one network,this essential function is performed by devices sold by arris known as embedded multimedia terminal adapters e mtas.an e mta is a device that combines a cable modem cm and a multimedia terminal adapter mta to allow for the connectivity of both devices and traditional analog telephones.the mta converts the telephone analog voice signal into digital ip packets,delivers a dial tone,and manages other essential call functions.
in addition to e mtas,cable one voip network uses other arris products known as cable modem termination systems cmtss.a cmts is an electronic device,typically used at a cable company or,which communicates with multiple subscribers cable modems and routes traffic to and from the internet.the use of cmtss in cable one network is essential to the functionality of its voip services.cable one network and arris cmts and e mta products all operate in accordance with the industry standards of data over cable service interface specification docsis,which defines interface standards for cable modems and supporting equipment and packetcable,which is an extension of docsis used for voip.
on july,bt sent a letter to cable one that accused cable one voip network of infringing various claims of the and sought to begin licensing negotiations the specified claims included both system and method claims.in response to bt letter,cable one requested on august,that it be provided a specific comparison of the claims of the to our cable systems or operations.on august,bt sent cable one a page presentation showing the applicability of selected claim elements in the four bt patents to cable one services.the presentation specifically and repeatedly identified arris cmtss and e mtas used in cable one network as embodying numerous elements and performing numerous method steps of the asserted claims.bt and cable one subsequently met on october,at cable one offices in phoenix,arizona,where bt reviewed the page presentation and further explained its infringement contentions.
following the october meeting,cable one sent a letter to arris in november notifying arris of bt infringement accusations.cable one additionally demanded in the letter that arris defend,indemnify and hold harmless cable one from these assertions of infringement.
on january,bt proposed a meeting with cable one and its vendors to determine if we have a basis for further licensing discussions.in late february,cable one requested that arris be included in the next meeting.the meeting was held on march,at arris office in suwanee,georgia.during the meeting,bt presented the same page presentation of bt infringement contentions that it had presented to cable one at the phoenix meeting.
the parties including arris met again at arris suwanee office on august,where they discussed potential licensing for cable one.at the meeting,arris presented a response to bt infringement contentions.arris contended that certain relevant claim limitations were not met by arris cmts or e mta products used in cable one network.see.
following the august meeting,bt requested that arris send formal rebuttal information regarding its infringement contentions,and it further requested a telephone conference with the parties technical people.on september,arris sent bt further materials containing its arguments,seeking to absolve cable one of infringement by demonstrating how components within cable one network did not meet one or more of the limitations in the.two conference calls took place thereafter on september,and november,during which arris presented its arguments and bt responded to them.
on november,bt requested that both arris and cable one agree to receive a specific licensing proposal under the terms of a nondisclosure agreement bt had entered into with cable one.arris and cable one agreed,and on december,bt sent copies of its licensing proposal to both parties.the proposed licensing agreement explicitly stated that the license would be granted to cable one only.no license agreement was consummated.
on march,arris filed this declaratory judgment action in the united states district court for the northern district of georgia,seeking a declaration that arris does not infringe the an injunction preventing bt from instituting infringement actions against arris or its customers and a declaration that the are invalid.the district court found that there was no article iii case or controversy between arris and bt,because throughout the parties meetings and conversations,bt only discussed cable one infringement and did not discuss any infringement by arris.arris,slip op.at see also id.at.in the district court view,the defendant actions were directed solely toward cable one,arris customer,rather than arris itself,which the court found did not constitute a real and immediate injury for article iii jurisdiction.id.at.the court accordingly dismissed arris declaratory judgment action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.id.

this case again presents a question of standing to bring a declaratory judgment action for a determination of and invalidity.in medimmune,genentech,the supreme court rejected our prior,more stringent standard for declaratory judgment standing insofar as it required a reasonable apprehension of imminent suit,d see also abb cooper,llc,wl,at,recognizing medimmune rejection of the reasonable apprehension test teva,at same sandisk stmicroelectronics,same.under the court new standard,an article iii case or controversy exists when the facts alleged,under all the circumstances,show that there is a substantial controversy,between parties having adverse legal interests,of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment.medimmune,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the dispute must be definite and concrete,touching the legal relations of parties having adverse legal interests,such that the dispute is real and substantial and admi ts of specific relief through a decree of a conclusive character,as distinguished from an opinion advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts.id.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
arris contends that it has standing and that there is an article iii case or controversy simply because it has suffered economic injury as a result of infringement threats made by bt against arris customer cable one.this,says arris,creates a risk that cable one will cease purchasing arris cmts and e mta products for its voip operations.while economic injury may confer standing in cases challenging government action we have not held that economic injury alone is sufficient to confer standing in patent cases seeking a declaratory judgment.indeed,in patent cases before the supreme court decision in medimmune,the regional circuits and our court held that economic injury is not alone sufficient to confer standing medimmune did not abandon this rule.to the contrary,medimmune adopted an adverse legal interest requirement.see medimmune,at requiring the dispute to touch the legal relations of parties having adverse legal interests and summarizing the question of declaratory judgment jurisdiction as whether the facts alleged,under all the circumstances,show that there is a substantial controversy,between parties having adverse legal interests,of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment emphases added.an adverse legal interest requires a dispute as to a legal right for example,an underlying legal cause of action that the declaratory defendant could have brought or threatened to bring in the absence of a controversy as to a legal right,a mere adverse economic interest is insufficient to create declaratory judgment jurisdiction.although economic injury alone is insufficient to create standing,we nonetheless conclude that arris has standing based on other standards.
we have recognized that,where a patent holder accuses customers of direct infringement based on the sale or use of a supplier equipment,the supplier has standing to commence a declaratory judgment action if a the supplier is obligated to indemnify its customers from infringement liability,or b there is a controversy between the patentee and the supplier as to the supplier liability for induced or contributory infringement based on the alleged acts of direct infringement by its customers though there was no express indemnification agreement here,arris contends it risks being held liable to cable one for indemnification under georgia uniform commercial code ucc.see see also ws packaging,global commerce,llc,d,holding that,under wisconsin ucc.stat,a customer without an indemnity contract may nonetheless seek indemnification from a seller if sued for infringement based on its use of the seller product.we need not reach the indemnification issue,for we conclude that,applying the standard articulated by the supreme court in medimmune,there is an actual controversy between arris and bt concerning arris liability for,at least,contributory infringement.
here,bt has accused cable one of infringing system and method claims of the.when the holder of a patent with system claims accuses a customer of direct infringement based on the customer making,using,or selling of an allegedly infringing system in which a supplier product functions as a material component,there may be an implicit assertion that the supplier has indirectly infringed the patent likewise,when the holder of a patent with method claims accuses the supplier customers of direct infringement based on their use of the supplier product in the performance of the claimed method,an implicit assertion of indirect infringement by a supplier may arise 
pursuant to c of the patent act,an act of contributory infringement may include either the sale of a component of a patented machine,manufacture,combination or composition including a component used in a claimed system,or the sale of a material or apparatus for use in practicing a patented process.c.this covers both contributory infringement of system and method claims to hold a component supplier liable for contributory infringement,a patent holder must show,inter alia,that a the supplier product was used to commit acts of direct infringement b the product use constituted a material part of the invention c the supplier knew its product was especially made or especially adapted for use in an infringement of the patent and d the product is not a staple article or commodity of commerce suitable for substantial noninfringing use.wordtech,integrated networks solutions.
there is no question here that bt accused arris customer cable one of direct infringement of various system and method claims,including claims of the patent claims of the patent claim of the patent and claims,and of the patent.according to bt,the parties discussions were limited solely to infringement by cable one network and the licensing of cable one bt contends t here was no discussion of any potential infringement of the patents in suit,either directly or indirectly,inducing or contributing to infringement,by arris.appellee br.the page presentation of bt infringement contentions,however,paints a different picture.while the presentation did not expressly accuse arris of contributory infringement,bt explicitly and repeatedly singled out arris products used in cable one network to support its infringement contentions.bt clearly identified arris cmts and e mta products as embodying numerous elements and performing numerous method steps of the asserted claims.before presenting any claim tables,bt laid the foundation for its allegations,stating 
subsequent to july,cable one used arris cadant cmts and touchtone telephony modems e mta for its voip deployment.we assume that all voip customers are provided with services via arris cmts.the voip solution is certified against packetcable and docsis standards.
the page presentation then proceeded to discuss arris cmts and e mta products on at least pages,including in multiple claim tables purporting to match components of cable one network to elements of the system claims and method steps of the method claims of the on at least pages,arris was specifically referenced by name,arris products were identified by brand name and model number,arris cadent cmts,or arris product literature was copied from its website for illustrative effect the presentation made it clear that cable one use of arris cmtss and e mtas was central to bt infringement contentions.for many of the asserted claims,bt contended that virtually all of the claimed system elements or method steps were practiced by arris cmtss or e mtas when used in cable one network.
for example,with respect to the patent,bt presentation purported to present two claims tables independent claim reading on the operation of e mtas and dependent claim reading on the operation of cmtss.claim claims a packet network comprising one or more packet network elements,each packet network element comprisin a number of claimed limitations.patent ll emphases added.bt analysis of claim stated that the one or more packet network elements is the e mta.providing a picture of arris e mta and a link to arris website emphasis in original.bt claim table then purported to match every limitation of claim packet network element to the functionality of arris e mta within cable one network.see.similarly,claim recites a network as claimed in claim further comprising one or more host elements,each said host element comprising a number of limitations.patent emphases added.bt presentation asserted that t he cmts is a host element in accordance with claim,emphasis added,and its claim table matched every limitation of claim host element to the functionality of the arris cadant cmts used in cable one network.see.this section of bt presentation concluded a s shown in the first claim table,cable one configuration and use of the cm component within e mtas infringes claim.in addition,cable one configuration and use of cmtss with e mtas infringes claim.
bt presentation gave similar treatment to many of the asserted claims of the other.claim of the patent recites a method for controlling acceptance of a call for a node in a communications network,patent ll,and bt presentation argued that arris cadant cmts equipment implemented according to docsis and packetcable or later version standards provides a method of controlling acceptance of a call as recited in the patent.bt claim table matched the functionality of arris cmtss within cable one network to the performance of every method step of claim.similarly,claim of the patent recites a method of controlling a bidirectional broadband and telephone network from an end of the network,patent ll,and bt claim tables again linked the functionality of arris e mtas or cmtss within cable one network to the performance of every method step.
at a minimum,bt identified arris cmtss or e mtas or the cm or mta of the e mta as satisfying at least one essential element or method step for every asserted claim analyzed in its presentation.bt extensive focus on arris cmts and e mta products in its infringement contentions implies that arris products are being used as a material part of the allegedly infringed invention one of the required elements of contributory infringement under c.moreover,bt alleges that arris cmtss and e mtas were designed specifically for use under the docsis and packetcable standards for voip suggesting that they are especially made or especially adapted for a use that infringes the and are not staple article s or commodit ies of commerce suitable for substantial noninfringing use.c.
in addition to the content of bt infringement accusations against cable one,we find it relevant that arris was directly and substantially involved in bt infringement and licensing negotiations.while direct communication between a patentee and a declaratory plaintiff is not necessary to confer standing,see arrowhead,at i f the circumstances warrant,an actual controversy may be found in the absence of any communication from the defendant to the plaintiff,the nature and extent of any communications between the declaratory plaintiff and the patentee are certainly relevant factors to consider when evaluating whether there is an article iii case or controversy between the parties.here,the communication to arris of bt infringement contentions was direct and repetitive.arris was included in the latter two of the three meetings between bt and cable one both of which were held at arris office in suwanee,georgia.at the second meeting,bt presented the same page presentation of infringement contentions that it had previously presented solely to cable one at the first meeting in phoenix.this activity shows that arris was within bt primary intended audience at the second meeting.at the third meeting,arris presented its responses to bt infringement contentions,and bt thereafter requested that arris send it formal rebuttal information.after arris sent the materials,two conference calls took place between arris and bt during which arris presented its arguments and bt responded.this protracted process between arris and bt supports the conclusion that there was an article iii case or controversy regarding whether arris was contributorily infringing the 
bt makes several arguments as to why there is no article iii case or controversy between it and arris.none of them is convincing.first,bt argues the district court properly held that no case or controversy existed between it and arris because bt did not explicitly accuse arris itself of direct or indirect infringement.but such an express accusation is unnecessary.as we have repeatedly held,a specific threat of infringement litigation by the patentee is not required to establish jurisdiction,and a declaratory judgment action can not be defeated simply by the stratagem of a correspondence that avoids magic words such as litigation or infringement.abb,wl,at quoting hewlett packard acceleron llc,holding that actual controversy as to infringement existed where patent owner sent plaintiff two letters seeking to discuss the patent.here,even in the absence of an express accusation against arris,we think the circumstances indicate there is a dispute between arris and bt concerning arris liability for contributory infringement that is sufficient to constitute an article iii case or controversy.
second,bt argues that its allegations against cable one should not be construed as including any implicit assertions of indirect infringement by arris because bt included an express disclaimer of such in its infringement contentions.bt page presentation repeatedly included the following statement 
these assertions are based around the combination of supplier equipment deployed in a way that is unique to cable companies.nothing in this assertion is meant to accuse any particular supplier of equipment of patent infringement.
emphasis added.we are not persuaded by bt disclaimer.far from suggesting that bt did not have a claim against arris,the disclaimer use of the word particular appears to suggest that some supplier or suppliers are accused.it is clear that the accused supplier is arris.bt infringement contentions focused primarily on arris equipment,and bt expressly excluded the equipment of arris main competitor cisco from its allegations.arris and cisco are direct competitors who sell similar cmts and e mta products but bt drew a distinction between arris and cisco and cisco subsidiary scientific atlanta by notifying cable one that bt wishes to make it clear that this assertion of infringement does not relate to cisco or cisco products because cisco has secured a license in all of these patents being asserted against cable one.emphases added.bt further noted that the products of cisco subsidiary scientific atlanta are covered by the cisco license from bt.id.emphases added.by expressly noting that its assertion of infringement does not apply to cisco licensed products and that scientific atlanta products are covered by the license,bt implied that the assertion of infringement was applicable to arris unlicensed products and that arris was liable for infringement.bt disclaimer that nothing in its assertion is meant to accuse any particular supplier of infringement is at best a transparent attempt to defeat arris standing to bring this declaratory judgment action.the actual controversy with arris that bt has created by its accusations can not be so easily avoided.
third,bt surprisingly appears to contend that arris burden as the declaratory judgment plaintiff includes the burden of presenting evidence that arris actions indirectly infringe the.ironically,bt overlooks the fact that the very purpose for an accused infringer to bring a declaratory judgment action is to seek a judicial determination that a coercive claim by the patent holder would not succeed on the merits.while a declaratory plaintiff indeed has the burden of demonstrating that an actual case or controversy exists,king,at,that burden does not extend to showing that the defendant holds meritorious positions on the issues in controversy.as we have stated,i t would be incongruous to require that one seeking a declaration of noninfringement prove its process or product is the same as or identical to the patented process or product.arrowhead,at.to require declaratory judgment plaintiffs to allege or show that their products or processes are infringements would limit the judgments they seek to declarations of invalidity or unenforceability.id.at.the declaratory judgment act is not so limited.
finally,bt suggests that it has agreed not to sue arris for infringement.in a line of cases beginning with super sack manufacturing chase packaging,we have held that a patentee grant of a covenant not to sue a supplier for infringement can eliminate the supplier standing to bring a declaratory judgment action at oral argument in our court,bt represented that it do es not assert that arris products directly infringe or that arris contributorily infringe s the by selling its products to cable one.oral arg.at,available at oral argument.however,bt has not provided any covenant that would protect arris from liability for indirect infringement.when questioned as to why,given its professed position on arris infringement liability,bt did not simply grant arris a covena
