northpoint technology,and its subsidiary,compass systems,collectively,northpoint,petitions for of the decision of the federal communications commission fcc or commission in auction of direct broadcast satellite licenses,order,wl,fcc rcd dbs auction order,reprinted in joint appendix at.specifically,northpoint challenges the commission conclusion that,notwithstanding the congress enactment of section of the reorganization for the betterment of international telecommunications act orbit act,pub,stat.codified at,the commission remains authorized to auction licenses to operate direct broadcast satellite dbs channels.we agree with northpoint that the commission interpretation of section of the orbit act can not stand on the current administrative record and,accordingly,we set aside part of the dbs auction order and remand for the commission further consideration.
in march,northpoint subsidiary,compass systems,compass,submitted to the commission an application for licenses to provide dbs service from unassigned channels at two of the eight orbital and west to the united states by the international telecommunications union itu at the regional administrative radio conference for the planning in region of the service in the frequency band ghz and associated feeder links in the frequency band ghz the itu region band plan or plan.the international and wireless telecommunications bureaus bureaus dismissed compass application as premature one year later.see letter to antoinette cook bush,wl,fcc rcd int l wireless telecomms.burs.the bureaus explained that,because the commission competitive bidding rules governed the awarding of the dbs service licenses compass sought,compass application would be accepted only during an established filing window.see id.while the bureaus observed that there was no filing window currently open with respect to licenses for the dbs channels compass seeks,they nevertheless pointed out that today the commission has issued a public notice announcing the auction of dbs service licenses scheduled for august.see id.at.
the public notice to which the bureaus referred proposed the auction of four dbs service licenses,including the two sought by compass.see public notice,auction of direct broadcast satellite service licenses scheduled for august,wl,fcc rcd,reprinted in at.in addition to announcing the upcoming auction,the commission invited public comment on its authority vel non to hold the auction.see id.at.the commission had initially concluded that section of the orbit act,which provides in part that the commission shall not have the authority to assign by competitive bidding orbital locations or spectrum used for the provision of international or global satellite communications services,did not divest it of authority to auction dbs service licenses because,it said,they are not authorizations to use spectrum for the provision of international or global satellite communications services.fcc rcd at quoting.the commission received four comments in response to its invitation,including northpoint.see dbs auction order,fcc rcd at.only northpoint challenged the commission authority to auction licenses to operate dbs service channels.see id.at.
in the end northpoint comments did not persuade the commission.finding northpoint two statutory arguments without merit,the commission reaffirmed its original conclusion.id.at.it first disagreed with northpoint exceedingly broad reading of the orbit act auction prohibition,explaining that it would be unreasonable to conclude that congress intended that the incidental provision of transborder service would convert an otherwise auctionable license into an unauctionable one.id.at.the commission relied in part on the orbit act legislative history.see id.at.it explained that,while the house commerce committee report accompanying a bill containing an identical exemption indicated that an auctions exemption could help global or international satellite communications service providers avoid financial burdens they might otherwise face if a auction regime precipitated a succession of auctions in numerous countries in which the operators might seek to provide service,the auctioning of dbs service licenses does not raise these concerns because these licenses are for channels designed under the plan to serve the united states.id.
the commission next rejected northpoint conjectures about the possibility of dbs licensees providing a international service.id.at.according to the commission,the dbs licenses that are slated for auction can not now are they anticipated to to provide any significant degree of international service.id.it explained that the coverage maps northpoint relied on identified areas of the world that are visible from certain orbit locations,not the actual coverage areas of those orbital positions as defined in the itu region band plan.id.it also observed that dbs service is not an international service simply because s atellite beams illuminate beyond the borders of a particular country.id.on the contrary,in order to have full coverage of a national territory,coverage of regions beyond those borders is to be expected.id.the commission further noted that a licensee wishing to provide service outside the united states must obtain a modification of the plan a process,it advised,that has no guarantee of success.id.
the commission also rejected northpoint contention that it had previously considered dbs service to be an international service in amendment to the commission regulatory policies governing domestic fixed satellites separate international satellite systems,report order,wl,fcc rcd disco i,explaining that in disco i it concluded only that it should not impose regulatory barriers on a licensee interested in providing dbs service outside the united states.see fcc rcd at,emphasis added.since disco i,the commission observed,it had received only four proposals to provide dbs service beyond the borders of the united states and currently all providers of dbs service are providing service only to the united states and not to any foreign counties.see id.at.
the commission next explained that,contrary to northpoint claim,the commission did not routinely secure a modification of the itu region band plan for a dbs operator in order for such an operator to provide international service.id.at.according to the commission,most of the cases in which it had sought modification have had nothing to do with the provision of service outside the united states and that it had sought modification on behalf of a licensee proposing to provide international service from a orbit location in only two instances.see also id.
the commission further noted that its authorization of the echostar satellite did not mean that it considered dbs service to be international service.see id.at.it explained that its observation in echostar satellite corporation,application for minor modification of direct broadcast satellite authorization,launch operating authority for echostar,order authorization,wl,fcc rcd,chief,satellite radiocomm,int l bur.echostar,that it permits dbs licensees to provide dbs service in other countries,id.at,simply responded to an argument that it should require echostar to direct all of its proposed spot beams to locations within the united states.fcc rcd at.the commission stated that echostar was designed to provide service to the united states,including alaska and hawaii,on its assigned channels and that it was allowed to direct one spot beam toward mexico because that beam could not be directed within the united states without causing harmful into other spot beams in its own fleet.id.at.and echostar may use this beam,the commission explained,if echostar decides to provide service to mexico and obtains any necessary authority from mexico to do so.id.at.
the commission also rejected northpoint contention that the orbit act prohibits the auction of dbs service licenses because dbs service relies on spectrum that is used for the provision of,id.at,quoting,fixed satellite service ngso fss or fss which,according to northpoint,is indubitably an international satellite communications service.id.the commission explained that it construed the relevant language of section of the orbit act to focus on whether the particular spectrum being assigned is used for international or global satellite communications services and that dbs service licenses are limited almost exclusively to domestic use.id.at.the commission therefore concluded that,b ecause ngso fss and dbs licenses are assigned entirely separately,there is no reason to read the orbit act to constrain the dbs license assignments merely because ngso fss shares the same spectrum band.id.
on july,the commission auctioned three dbs service licenses two of which were the and west longitude orbital locations northpoint had applied for.two bidders won the three licenses for a total of million.northpoint did not participate in the auction instead,on february,it petitioned for review of the fcc dbs auction order.
unwilling to take no for an answer,northpoint again challenges the fcc construction of section of the orbit act with the two statutory arguments the commission concluded were without merit.see dbs auction order,fcc rcd at.northpoint first argues that licenses for dbs service channels fall within the orbit act auction ban because dbs service is,in light of the commission prior treatment of it,an international or global satellite communications service.having treated dbs as an international service for years,northpoint asserts,the fcc can not now pretend that the service is purely domestic simply to gratify its own desire to assign dbs orbital locations and spectrum via auction.petitioners br.at.in so doing,northpoint says,the commission deviate d from previous policy without even acknowledging that it has deviated.petitioners br.at emphasis in brief.
northpoint additionally asserts that even if dbs service is not itself an international or global satellite communications service under section of the orbit act,the spectrum dbs service uses can not be auctioned because it is used for the provision of international or global satellite communications service within the meaning of section.as northpoint sees it,if a particular portion of the spectrum is used by anyone for international service,then no portion of the spectrum may be awarded by competitive bidding even if a particular licensee or group of licensees will use that spectrum only for domestic service.petitioners br.at emphasis in brief.that is,in northpoint view,section denial of auction authority is based on the spectrum in which the applicant seeks to operate,rather than on the character of the applicant.petitioners br.at.therefore,because dbs service and ngso fss service share a slice of ghz downlink ngso fss uses the spectrum for international or global satellite communications service,section of the orbit act prohibits the commission from auctioning dbs service licenses.see petitioners br.at.
we review the commission interpretation of section of the orbit act under the methodology announced by the united states supreme court in chevron natural res.def.council,d,under which we defer to the commission interpretation of the communications act so long as the congress has not unambiguously forbidden it and the interpretation is otherwise permissible.see id.at.see also barnhart walton,d.that is,under the chevron,we stop the music at step one if the congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue because the agency must give effect to its unambiguously expressed intent.chevron,at.if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter.id.at.but if the statute is silent or ambiguous,we dance on and,at step two,defer to the commission interpretation if it is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at.a reasonable explanation of how an agency interpretation serves the statute objectives is the stuff of which a permissible construction is made,id.at.see,continental air lines dep t of,an explanation that is arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute,however,is not.chevron,at.see,motion picture ass of,fcc,instrument fcc,w e have recognized that an arbitrary and capricious claim and a chevron step two argument overlap ass of regulatory util.comm rs icc,t he inquiry at the second step of chevron overlaps analytically with a court task under the administrative procedure act.in this case the commission trips at step two.
to the extent that northpoint couches its arguments in chevron step one,that section of the orbit act unambiguously prohibits the auctioning of licenses to operate dbs service misses the mark.see walton,at.step one asks whether the statute unambiguously forbids the agency interpretation.section ambiguity is plain and profound,as northpoint counsel conceded at oral argument.see tr.of oral argument at statute absolutely ambiguous.the section provides that the commission shall not have the authority to assign by competitive bidding orbital locations or spectrum used for the provision of international or global satellite communications services.emphasis added.orbital locations or spectrum not yet assigned by the commission,however,are plainly not used for any type of service,including international or global satellite communications services.id.accordingly,because the statute,if read literally,would limit the commission auction authority based on conditions,it is ambiguous and requires interpretation.see chevron,at.
under chevron step two,the commission interpretation of section at first blush appears plausible.the commission interpreted the language of the statutory prohibition to focus on whether the particular spectrum being assigned is used for international or global satellite communications services.dbs auction order,fcc rcd at.this makes sense as section prohibits only the auctioning of spectrum that is used for international or global satellite communications service,see it does not expressly prevent the auctioning of spectrum that is used for domestic satellite communications services simply because that spectrum is also used for for international or global satellite communications services.this construction is consistent with the statute apparent purpose of deterring foreign governments from auctioning spectrum used to provide international or global satellite communications services.as the commission points out,the scant legislative history of section consists of a house report on an earlier bill with an auction prohibition identical to section that noted concurrent or successive spectrum auctions in the numerous countries in which global satellite service providers seek downlink or service provision licenses could place significant financial burdens on providers of such services,at,a concern that is manifested in section second sentence.see the president shall oppose in the itu and in other bilateral and multilateral fora any assignment by competitive bidding of orbital locations or spectrum used for the provision of such services.a strictly domestic satellite communications service,however,has nothing to do with multiple spectrum auctions in foreign jurisdictions.and given that satellite beams do not stop at national borders,there is also logic to the commission rejection of northpoint contention that dbs service is an international or global satellite communications service on account of transborder.northpoint contention would tend to blur a distinction implicit in the statute section reference to international service implies that there is also,or domestic,is,that not all satellite communications service is necessarily international.see id.the commission argument that it would be unreasonable to conclude that congress intended that the incidental provision of transborder service would convert an otherwise auctionable license into an unauctionable one is thus not unreasonable.fcc rcd at.while its construction may be permissible under section,however,we can not defer to it on this record for at least three reasons which we now explain.
first,the commission reliance on the itu region band plan as a basis for treating dbs service as a solely domestic satellite communications service is dubious in light of the policy it announced in disco here,the commission declares that the dbs
