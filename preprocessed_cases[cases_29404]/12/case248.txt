robin hagan hagan appeals from the district court grant of judgment as a matter of law in favor of the,echostar satellite,and echosphere,collectively,echostar,following the district court declaring a mistrial after the jury was unable to come to a verdict at the conclusion of a trial on the merits.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm.
this case arises from echostar termination of hagan employment on january.the relevant facts are not in dispute.in,hagan began his employment with echostar,a satellite television company,as a technician responsible for installing satellite dishes for customers in houston,texas.although hagan acknowledges that he occasionally violated company policies in minor ways,by tardiness,echostar continued to employ and promote him.after working as a technician for nearly four years,in march of hagan was promoted to the position of field service manager,and as part of the new position,he was placed in charge of a small group of technicians.hagan directly reported to trina robinson,an installation manager robinson reported to patrick morrow morrow,the general manager and morrow reported to elizabeth miller,a regional manager located in colorado.
in december of,hagan attended a managers meeting at which morrow explained to the attendees an upcoming change to the technicians work schedule.under the schedule as it existed to that time,each week was divided into two shifts of workdays sunday through wednesday and wednesday through saturday.because the two shifts overlapped on wednesdays,two technicians were assigned to a single vehicle on those days,rather than each technician having his own vehicle as on every other day.under the old schedule,technicians workdays often exceeded ten hours,so they earned a considerable amount of overtime pay,often up to one full day of extra pay per pay period.
under the new schedule,technicians would work a total of seven workdays each with a mandatory lunch break over each pay period.this was accomplished with two rotating shifts a sunday through wednesday shift and a thursday through saturday shift.at the managers meeting,morrow explained that echostar objective in implementing the new schedule was to remove the inefficiencies created by the wednesday overlap and to improve customer service.when some managers,including hagan,raised questions and concerns regarding the potential decrease in overtime pay for the technicians and the way the technicians might react,morrow assured the managers that eight hours of overtime pay were built into the new schedule as part of the shift in each period.although the managers were instructed to keep the schedule change a secret until it was officially announced,they were told by echostar that when the time came,they were to explain echostar stated reasons to the technicians and to assure them that the change was not designed to reduce their overtime pay.the managers were also supposed to emphasize the positive,such as the extra day off during each pay period.
on january,morrow officially announced the new schedule during an meeting attended by both managers and technicians.morrow fielded a limited number of questions from the technicians and instructed them to speak to their designated field service manager if they had further questions.later that day,a few of hagan technicians asked him whether their overtime pay would be decreased under the new schedule,and hagan told them that it would.at least one of the technicians asked if the change was legal,though hagan could not remember the exact content or wording of the question.hagan admits that the calculation of his technicians overtime hours was part of his job as field service manager that he knew that his technicians were not legally entitled to overtime hours that he had told his technicians they could not depend on overtime pay that he did not think echostar had done anything illegal and that he had not personally questioned the legality of the schedule change.nevertheless,he asked the human resources manager,eric love love,to speak with the technicians who had asked the legal question.rather than stay around to listen to love conversation with those technicians,hagan moved on to field another technician questions.although he did not hear love answer,he believed that it was satisfactory based on the technicians reaction.that was the only relevant question regarding the legality of the schedule change.
on january,at a meeting with his technicians,hagan was again asked by his technicians whether the schedule change would reduce their overtime hours.he again told them that it would,but he did emphasize that echostar was making the change to eliminate the inefficiencies caused by the old schedule overlapping wednesday schedule.on january,morrow and hagan had an unscheduled meeting at which morrow primarily discussed hagan poor work performance.morrow also criticized the way hagan had presented the schedule change to his technicians.
on january,morrow called hagan into his office and,in love presence,informed him that he was being terminated,effective immediately,for lack of performance.love added that hagan should have addressed his technicians questions personally rather than getting love to do so,even if hagan had to wait until he could speak to love.hagan was also told that he should have better presented the schedule change to his technicians.
although the only reason for termination stated on january,was lack of work performance,echostar later listed insubordination as an additional reason.hagan points to a series of documents and,not discussed by the district court,concerning morale problems caused by hagan conduct and apparently related to the insubordination charge.an by morrow on the day of hagan termination stated,hagan stated to the technicians that the reason for the new shifts was to eliminate overtime,so they are in an uproar.there is also an undated file memo by morrow,probably authored on the date of hagan termination or soon afterward,that speaks of the possibility of hagan technicians seeking outside representation as a result of the way hagan presented the schedule change impact on their overtime pay.
on february,hagan filed suit against echostar in the united states district court for the southern district of texas,stating as his only claim a violation of the fair labor standards act flsa,et.specifically,hagan claimed that he was engaged in protected activity under a and that echostar terminating him constituted unlawful retaliation.a jury trial was held on february through.at the close of hagan case,echostar moved for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to,but the district court reserved ruling.at the close of all the evidence,but before the case was submitted to the jury,echostar renewed its rule motion.the district court again reserved ruling and submitted the case to the jury.
during deliberations,the jury submitted several questions to the district court concerning the jury instructions,particularly the scope of protected activity under section a,but the jury was ultimately unable to come to a verdict,describing the proceeding as hopelessly deadlocked in its final note to the court.the district court then declared a mistrial and informed the parties that it would rule on echostar pending rule motion.on february,in an unpublished memorandum and order,the district court granted judgment as a matter of law in favor of echostar.hagan echostar satellite,no,wl.hagan now appeals from that judgment.
the primary inquiry in this appeal is whether the district court appropriately granted judgment as a matter of law in favor of echostar pursuant to.we have previously explained the standard of review for the grant or denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law as follows 
we review a district court ruling on a rule a motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo.resolution trust cramer,cir.under this standard,we view all of the evidence in the light and with all reasonable inferences most favorable to the party opposed to the motion.id.citation omitted.a district court may not grant a rule a motion unless a party has been fully heard on an issue and there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for that party on that issue.fitzgerald weasler engineering,cir.this court reviews a jury verdict for sufficiency of the evidence by determining whether 
reasonable and jurors in the exercise of impartial judgment might reach different conclusions a mere scintilla is insufficient to present a question for the jury however,it is the function of the jury as the traditional finder of facts,and not the court,to weigh conflicting evidence and inferences,and determine the credibility of witnesses.

according to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure,it is that a motion for directed verdict or judgment as a matter of law made at the close of the plaintiff must be renewed at the close of all the evidence in the case.id.citing mccann texas city refining,cir.
victoria county,cir.
we first address hagan argument that a conflict in substantial evidence precludes the grant of judgment as a matter of law.that contention lacks merit.most significantly,hagan points to no potentially relevant facts that were not already considered by the district court,except for a file memo mentioning outside representation and other management correspondence concerning hagan presentation of the schedule change to his technicians.as we discuss in part vii of this opinion,those documents do not affect the outcome of this case.thus,the district court did not omit any relevant material facts from its opinion.
next,hagan argues that we should infer a conflict in substantial evidence from the fact that the jury was deadlocked in this case,but there are two reasons that argument must fail.first,the proper grant of a judgment as a matter of law makes the submission of the case to the jury irrelevant second,even if we were to look to the jury deliberations for guidance in this case,the clarification questions asked by the jury suggest a dispute over the law rather than the facts.the jury first note asked whether an employee need s to be aware of mention the flsa when bringing the issue to management for it to be considered a protected activity,while the second note simply stated,we can not agree on what constitutes protected activity and so can not determine if the actions of the plaintiff were a complaint covered by the statute.in short,there is nothing in the record to suggest a genuine conflict in substantial evidence,and therefore nothing to preclude judgment as a matter of law.
we now arrive at the heart of the controversy.hagan only claim is that echostar retaliated against him in violation of the provisions of the flsa for personally objecting to the field technicians schedule change because of a potential decrease in overtime pay and for passing along his technicians question regarding the legality of the change to the human resources department.because hagan entire suit rests on the flsa,he may achieve protected status only if he was engaged in protected activity as set out by,which provides,in relevant part 
a after the expiration of one hundred and twenty days from june,it shall be unlawful for any person 
to discharge or in any other manner discriminate against any employee because such employee has filed any complaint or instituted or caused to be instituted any proceeding under or related to this chapter,or has testified or is about to testify in any such proceeding,or has served or is about to serve on an industry committee 
because it is undisputed that,at the time of hagan discharge,he had not instituted or caused to be instituted any proceeding,had not been linked to testimony in such a proceeding,and had not been involved on an industry committee,hagan entire claim turns on whether or not his behavior constitutes filing a complaint under section a.if hagan did file a complaint,then he was engaged in protected activity under the flsa,and we should reverse the district court grant of judgment as a matter of law in favor of echostar.if hagan did not file a complaint,then he was not engaged in protected activity,his termination did not violate the flsa,and we should affirm.
hagan asserts that the district court improperly applied the framework set out in mcdonnell douglas green,d in its memorandum and order granting judgment as a matter of law although mcdonnell douglas was a title vii case,the framework established therein has been adapted and applied to cases under the age discrimination in employment act adea and the flsa as set out by the district court below,the framework is applied as follows in the context of a flsa claim 
first,a plaintiff must make a prima facie showing of participation in protected activity under the flsa an adverse employment action and a causal link between the activity and the adverse action.if a plaintiff meets this burden,the defendant must then articulate a legitimate,reason for its decision.the burden then shifts to the plaintiff to demonstrate that the proffered reason is a pretext for discrimination.
hagan echostar satellite,no,wl,at,citations omitted.
hagan argues that the district court erred in applying that framework in its analysis rather than addressing the ultimate question of whether discrimination occurred.indeed,there is precedent holding that after a full trial on the merits,a district court must look at whether the plaintiff had presented sufficient evidence to allow a jury to arrive at a verdict,whether the plaintiff has met his ultimate burden of proving discrimination or retaliation depending on the statute at issue,rather than simply focusing on the plaintiff prima facie case this circuit has phrased the question for the jury as the ultimate question of whether a defendant took the adverse employment action against a plaintiff because of protected status.
however,both the prima facie case and the ultimate question in this matter depend on the issue of whether hagan had filed a complaint under section a.that issue was correctly the focus of the district court memorandum and order.succinctly,if hagan can not prove that he was engaged in protected activity under section a,then he can not make out a viable claim under the flsa.in effect,hagan failure to make out a prima facie case automatically decides the ultimate question.the district court error in speaking about the prima facie case rather than the ultimate question if indeed that was an is harmless.
this circuit has never addressed the exact contours of protected activity under section a in the context of filing a complaint,so the district court looked to other courts that have addressed the issue for guidance.in this effort,the district court found that even an informal,internal complaint could constitute protected activity under the flsa.hagan,wl,at.next,the district court found that hagan could not recover under the flsa unless he stepped out of his role as an echostar field service manager,either to complain to his employer in behalf of the technicians,or in his own behalf,about a supposed violation or irregularity under or related to the flsa.id.third and finally,the district court found that the flsa protects employees engaged in otherwise protected activity if that employee possesses a good faith belief that the employer had violated the law.id.at.
the district court ultimately determined that hagan actions did not rise to the level of an informal complaint,because there was no evidence that hagan at any point crossed the line from acting in his appointed capacity as a field service manager in behalf of the company to acting in an adversarial role against echostar.id.moreover,the district court noted that hagan lacked a good faith belief that echostar had violated the law in implementing the schedule change.thus,the district court held,hagan had failed to present any evidence that he had engaged in protected activity under section a,and echostar was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
we address each of the three rules relied upon by the district court the informal complaint rule the stepping outside the role rule and the good faith rule.
the district court correctly noted the majority interpretation of section a is that even an informal,internal complaint may constitute protected activity 
this court has followed the majority position that an employee informal complaint to his employer may constitute protected activity under section a.see dearmon.migrant council,d,kazen,truex hearst commc ns,d,rosenthal,see also,lambert ackerley,cir en banc valerio putnam,cir eeoc romeo comty,cir eeoc white son,cir brock richardson,cir love of,cir brennan maxey yamaha,cir.but see lambert genesee,cir requiring the filing of a formal complaint with a government agency.at the same time,however,not all abstract grumblings or vague expressions of discontent are actionable as complaints.lambert,at valerio,at.
hagan,wl,at.
the informal complaint interpretation is not the only one.for example,in lambert genesee hospital,cited by the district court as contrary authority,the second circuit stated that t he plain language of section a limits the cause of action to retaliation for filing formal complaints,instituting a proceeding,or testifying,but does not encompass complaints made to a supervisor.lambert,at citing romeo,at surheinrich,dissenting.we do not read section a so narrowly as the lambert court.section a speaks of an employee fil ing any complaint,and we can not agree that the plain language is limited to filing a formal complaint.
we adopt the majority rule,which allows an informal,internal complaint to constitute protected activity under section a,because it better captures the goals of that section.we also accept that there are necessary qualifications to the majority rule.for instance,as the district court also noted,not all abstract grumblings or vague expressions of discontent are actionable as complaints.hagan,wl,at.thus,although section a allows informal complaints to constitute protected activity,the only immediate effect here is that hagan claim is not automatically precluded because he did not file a formal complaint.we must still determine whether he actually filed an informal complaint.
the circumstances that may constitute an informal complaint under the flsa have included an employee outburst following her refusal to take part in what she thought was an unlawful scheme the fact that an employee complained to the school district of unlawful sex discrimination and had told them she believed they were breaking some sort of law by paying her lower wages than previously paid to male temporary custodians the complaints of female employees to a of the employer and to a foreman about the unequal pay despite the absence of a formal eeoc complaint at the time of retaliatory and sending a memo requesting a pay raise to the president of the employer with an attached copy of the equal pay act 
it is clear these cases require the informal complaint to concern some violation of law.here,hagan personally voiced internal objections and concerns to management about the possibility of field technicians receiving less overtime pay.however,he did not frame any of his objections in terms of the potential illegality of the change.hagan admits that he did not think the change was illegal,and it is undisputed that the change was in fact legal.thus,hagan personal objections to the schedule change do not constitute protected activity under the flsa.the only remaining issue is whether hagan passing along the field technicians questions about the legality of the schedule change to human resources manager staying to listen to love an informal complaint.the resolution of that question depends on whether the district court formulation of the stepping outside the role requirement is correct.
relying primarily on mckenzie renberg,cir,the district court found that an employee does not file a complaint under section a unless that employee somehow steps outside of his normal job role.in mckenzie,the tenth circuit explained the stepping outside the role requirement as follows 
despite our expansive interpretation of a,we have never held that an employee is insulated from retaliation for participating in activities which are neither adverse to the company nor supportive of adverse rights under the statute which are asserted against the company i t is the assertion of statutory rights,the advocacy of rights by taking some action adverse to the via formal complaint,providing testimony in an flsa proceeding,complaining to superiors about inadequate pay,or is the hallmark of protected activity under a.
here,mckenzie never crossed the line from being an employee merely performing her job as personnel director to an employee lodging a personal complaint about the wage and hour practices of her employer and asserting a right adverse to the company.mckenzie did not initiate a flsa claim against the company on her own behalf or on behalf of anyone else.rather,in her capacity as personnel manager,she informed the company that it was at risk of claims that might be instituted by others as a result of its alleged flsa violations.in order to engage in protected activity under a,the employee must step outside his or her role of representing the company and either file or threaten to file an action adverse to the employer,actively assist other employees in asserting flsa rights,or otherwise engage in activities that reasonably could be perceived as directed towards the assertion of rights protected by the flsa.here,mckenzie did none of these things.indeed,mckenzie testified that her job responsibilities included participating in wage and hour issues.there is no evidence in the record to suggest that mckenzie was asserting any rights under the flsa or that she took any action adverse to the company rather,the record reflects that mckenzie actions in connection with the overtime pay issue were completely consistent with her duties as personnel director for the company to evaluate wage and hour issues and to assist the company in complying with its obligations under the flsa.mckenzie therefore lacks an essential ingredient of a retaliation claim that is,she did not take a position adverse to her employer or assert any rights under the flsa.accordingly,mckenzie did not engage in activity protected under a 
id.at footnote omitted.
we find the logic of mckenzie to provide a correct and balanced approach in requiring an employee to step outside his or her role of representing the company by either filing or threatening to file an action adverse to the employer,by actively assisting other employees in asserting flsa rights,or by otherwise engaging in activities that reasonably could be perceived as directed towards the assertion of rights protected by the flsa,at.this rule is eminently sensible for management employees like hagan,because a part of any management position often is acting as an intermediary between the manager subordinates and the manager own superiors.the role necessarily involves being mindful of the needs and concerns of both sides and appropriately expressing them.voicing each side concerns is not only not adverse to the company interests,it is exactly what the company expects of a manager.
if we did not require an employee to step outside the role or otherwise make clear to the employer that the employee was taking a position adverse to the employer,nearly every activity in the normal course of a manager job would potentially be protected activity under section a.an otherwise typical employment relationship could quickly degrade into a litigation minefield,with whole groups of employees,human resources employees,and legal employees,to name a difficult to discharge without fear of a lawsuit.for those reasons,we agree that an employee must do something outside of his or her job role in order to signal to the employer that he or she is engaging protected activity under section a.
of course,whether an employee has stepped outside the role depends on what that role is and whether special circumstances are present.for instance,in york city of wichita falls,cir,also cited by the district court and discussed by both parties at oral argument,a fire department battalion chief showed the fire chief a memo discussing garcia san antonio metro.transit authority,d and asked if the fire fighters were due any overtime pay under g
