on january,verizon submitted an application to the federal communications commission under of the telecommunications act of,seeking authority to offer service to customers in massachusetts.the commission approved the application on april,just within the statutory time limit.in re application of verizon,et for authorization to provide,interlata services in massachusetts,fcc rcd,wl order.worldcom,and a number of similarly situated firms acting through a trade association appellants or worldcom challenge the approval.the parties main dispute revolves around the commission conclusion that verizon rates for unbundled network elements unes complied with the telric standard long run incremental cost.appellants challenge in essence attacks as unreasonable the commission use in combination of two devices that it had employed separately,one in its approval for oklahoma,which we upheld in sprint comm.fcc,and the other in its approval for new york,which we upheld in fcc.we are not persuaded.as for the two remaining issues,one requires a remand because the relevant record is not materially distinguishable from that in sprint we lack jurisdiction over the other.
because our opinions in and sprint set out the statutory background in some detail,our treatment here will be brief.the decree settling the antitrust litigation,the modification of final judgment mfj,see united states american telephone and telegraph,aff sub nom.maryland united states,d,split the sale of services from the sale of local telephone services,so that the bell operating companies spun off from by the mfj could provide local service but were barred from offering service in their local markets.but of the act allows those,together with their successors,commonly known as incumbent local exchange carriers or ilecs to secure fcc approval to sell service to customers in the region for which they are the dominant providers.to receive approval an ilec must show among many other things compliance with a list of fourteen conditions,termed the competitive checklist,designed to ensure that an ilec will be permitted to sell service in its local region only when it has opened up the local service market to competition.c b.
one of the fourteen items on the checklist requires an ilec to offer access to network elements needed by competitors to provide telecommunications service.see id.at c incorporated into the competitive checklist by c b ii.these elements,the unbundled network elements or unes referred to earlier,must be offered to competitive local exchange carriers clecs at rates that are establish ed by state regulatory agencies pursuant to a pricing methodology prescribed by the fcc.see iowa utilities,d.the methodology chosen by the commission is called telric,which requires that rates be based on the cost of operating a hypothetical network built with the most efficient technology available.id.at.at.see also verizon communications,fcc,d upholding the telric standard.
application of the telric standard has proved complex,involving detailed over years of litigation in state agencies.this complexity has two important consequences for this case.first,because the fcc has only days to approve or reject a application,it can not independently determine the telric compliance of an ilec une rates.rather,the fcc defers to the determinations of the state agencies who possess a considerable degree of expertise and who typically perform a significant amount of background work during the rate determinations,at.thus,the fcc need only ensure that the state proceedings comply with basic telric principles and are not infected with clear factual errors so substantial that the end result falls outside of the range that the reasonable application of telric principles would produce.id.at.second,the commission may base its finding of telric compliance on a comparison of the disputed rates with those of a neighboring state which it had already approved under,provided that the applicant can demonstrate that local costs were at or above those in the benchmark state.see joint application by sbc communications,et for provision of interlata services in kansas and oklahoma,fcc rcd at determining that the oklahoma loop charges were based on a comparison with previously approved texas loop charges,aff,sprint,at.
the massachusetts controversy began when verizon filed an initial application in september.possibly because of various criticisms,including fcc concern over its une pricing,it withdrew the application in december.but before doing so it filed a tariff lowering its une rates to levels substantially equivalent to the rates offered by bell atlantic verizon name before its merger with gte in new york,which had already secured commission approval under.see,at.
these new york rates had themselves been the subject of challenge.clecs had offered before the new york public service commission nypsc and the fcc during the proceeding that bell atlantic had understated the size of the discounts it received on certain switch purchases,with the result that its une rates might in fact not comply with telric.the nypsc its proceedings to inquire into the claims,but the commission nonetheless approved the application.in at t we rejected the clecs attack on the approval,finding that such newly discovered evidence was not in itself enough to upset an otherwise valid approval.at.in a move loosely paralleling that of the nypsc,the massachusetts department of telecommunications and energy dte in january embarked on its scheduled,quinquennial review of verizon une rates.thus,as in new york,at the times the relevant applications were pending before the fcc,the disputed une rates were under challenge and review in the state agency with immediate authority.
worldcom leading claim is even if the new york rates were acceptable at the time,their age and their errors made them inadequate as benchmarks,so that the massachusetts approval was arbitrary and capricious.in addition,they say that it was arbitrary and capricious for the fcc to dismiss their argument that the massachusetts une rates created a price squeeze,were so high that a clec could not use unes for profitable sale of local service.finally,worldcom argues that the application was fatally defective because,at the time it was filed,verizon was not offering its advanced services at resale discounts,in contravention of item on the competitive checklist,see c b xiv.
reasonableness of the new york benchmark 
worldcom does not claim that there is anything inherently flawed in the commission use of benchmarking which we upheld in sprint,even where the previously approved rates had been seriously called into question,as was true of the rates approved in the new york process which we upheld in.rather,it contends that the commission deference under is owed to a process,not to a result deference by the commission is therefore inappropriate where the rates under review were adopted by a state agency that of massachusetts that did not conduct its own factfinding.second,worldcom argues that if the fcc chooses to use a benchmark to evaluate the une rates before it in the proceeding,it must ensure that the chosen benchmark is reasonable,based on all available evidence.
worldcom first point completely overlooks the facts of sprint.there the ilec had simply given a certain class of oklahoma charges an arbitrary haircut,at,which had the effect of bringing them into line with rates approved by the commission for texas,id.at.we see no principled distinction between oklahoma process,accepting arbitrarily trimmed rates that matched ones approved in texas and blessed by the commission under and massachusetts similar adoption of ones matching those approved in new york and similarly blessed by the commission.
moreover,many of the elements of the process that merited deference under are present here,both in massachusetts process itself and the commission clear recognition of the link between the ongoing new york proceedings and the massachusetts rates.worldcom points to the critical role of the active review and modification of bell atlantic proposed une prices.in re application by bell atlantic new york to provi
