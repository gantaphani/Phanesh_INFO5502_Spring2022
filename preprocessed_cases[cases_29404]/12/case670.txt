telephone service providers serving primarily small and rural the federal communications commission fcc or the commission decision to impose an interim cap on rapidly escalating subsidy payments.the universal support subsidy,intended to ensure adequate,reasonably priced service for residents of rural,sparsely populated,or areas,increased by more than a billion dollars between and.see joint bd.on universal,cc docket,universal service monitoring report tbl universal service monitoring report.petitioners accuse the fcc of fumbling the procedural requirements of the administrative procedure act apa in promulgating the interim order violating the federal communications act and acting arbitrarily and capriciously.
telecommunications act of 
since the passage of the communications act of the act,congress has made universal service a fundamental goal of federal telecommunications regulation.indeed,of the act states the very purpose of the fcc is to make available,so far as possible,to all the people of the united states a rapid,efficient,and wire and radio communication service with adequate facilities at reasonable charges.as amended.
in,congress amended the act to introduce competition into local telephone service,telecommunications act of,stat,which had traditionally been provided through regulated monopolies,see.at the same time,congress also added a new universal service provision,to the act.see id.the telecommunications act of established a joint board on universal service the joint board or board to recommend changes to the fcc federal universal service regulations.section b directs the joint board and the commission to base policies for the preservation and advancement of universal service on six enumerated principles,plus such other principles as the joint board and the commission may establish.id.b.among these principles are access provided in all regions of the nation including consumers and those in rural,insular,and high cost areas,reasonably comparable services and rates to those offered in urban areas,an equitable and nondiscriminatory contribution to the preservation and advancement of universal service,by a ll providers of telecommunications services,and specific,predictable,and sufficient federal and state mechanisms to preserve and advance universal service.id.b.in addition,pursuant to its authority under b to adopt other universal service principles in the public interest,the commission adopted a seventh competitive neutrality principle,which requires that universal service support mechanisms and rules neither unfairly advantage nor disadvantage one provider over another,and neither unfairly favor nor disfavor one technology over another.in the matter of joint bd.on universal,wl.another universal service provision,e,requires that federal universal service support be explicit and sufficient to achieve statutory purposes and restricts universal support to designated eligible telecommunications carrier s etcs.e.
the commission fulfills its mandate to provide universal service through the universal service fund the usf.in addition to the support program,which is designed to support rural providers serving areas,the usf also supports programs for customers,schools and libraries,and health care providers.see.support disbursements,however,overwhelmingly represent the largest category of usf expenditures,accounting for percent of usf disbursements in.see universal service monitoring report tbl.prior to the fcc order challenged in this case,the program and the program were the only two components of the usf not subject to a cap on total support.
support for the fund comes from assessments paid by interstate telecommunications service providers.the assessments are calculated by applying a quarterly contribution factor to the contributors interstate revenues,and contributors almost always pass their contribution assessments through to their customers.see alenco commc ns,fcc,cir.although incumbent local exchange carriers ilecs receive support based on their actual costs of providing service,under the commission identical support rule,competitive etcs cetcs,mainly wireless providers,receive support for each line based not on their own costs,but rather on the same support ilecs in the relevant service area receive.a.
b.the order 
in,growth in the amount of usf support distributed under the program,particularly to cetcs,prompted the commission to ask the joint board to review the commission support rules,specifically with respect to cetc service areas.the board responded with several recommendations,including a recommendation to consider revisiting the identical support rule as a means for calculating support for cetcs.see in the matter of joint,wl recommended decision.the board also recommended support be limited to a single connection that provides access to the public telephone network,rather than subsidizing multiple connections for the same household or business.id.the board concluded supporting a single connection is more consistent with the goals of section of the act than the present system,and is necessary to preserve the sustainability of the universal service fund and would be competitively neutral.id.the board recognized,however,that restricting support to a single connection may present significant administrative challenges.id.thus,rather than suggesting the commission modify its methodology for calculating support at that time,the board recommended the commission consider support modifications for cetcs as part of a comprehensive review of support mechanisms.see id.in any event,before the commission could act on the board recommendations,congress enacted legislation specifically prohibiting the commission from implementing the single connection rule.consolidated appropriations act,stat.
after investigating and seeking comment on several support reform proposals,the joint board took action in may by recommending the commission adopt an interim,emergency cap on support to cetcs.in the matter of universal serv.support,wl recommended decision.noting cetc support had skyrocketed from million in the correct figure appears to be million to almost billion in annual growth rate of over board concluded that without immediate action to restrain growth in competitive etc funding,the federal universal service fund is in dire jeopardy of becoming unsustainable.id.the board acknowledged the interim cap would not be a permanent solution to problems with the support distribution mechanisms,id,committed to making recommendations on comprehensive universal service reform by november,and sought comment on comprehensive reform in a public notice,id.
the commission issued a notice of proposed rulemaking seeking comments on the proposed interim cap,see in the matter of universal serv.support.proposed may,to be codified at pt,and after receiving and reviewing sets of comments,largely adopted the joint board proposal,see in the matter of universal serv.support.july,to be codified at pts,the order.under the interim cap,annual support for cetcs is capped at the level of support cetcs were eligible to receive in march,subject to two limited exceptions.first,to the extent a cetc files cost data demonstrating its own costs meet the support threshold in the same manner as the incumbent lec in the relevant service area,the cetc is not subject to the interim cap.id.second,the cap does not apply to cetcs serving tribal lands or alaska native regions.id.the commission emphasized the cap would remain in place only until it adopted comprehensive,universal service on which the commission planned to move forward in an expeditious manner.id.
petitioners challenge the fcc order imposing the interim cap on support to cetcs.they claim,among other things,the commission violated the requirements of the apa,violated of the federal communications act,and acted arbitrarily and capriciously in violation of apa a.we are not persuaded by any of these arguments.accordingly,having jurisdiction to review the order pursuant to and a,we deny the petitions for review.
rulemaking challenge 
we begin with petitioners argument that the commission violated the requirements of the apa.although the petitioners arguments are somewhat confusing,we find them all to be without merit.
petitioners first claim seems to be that the commission jumped the gun.it imposed the same interim emergency cap on two individual carriers seeking license transfers that it later imposed on all wireless carriers in the order.see alltel atlantis holdings lcc,at t dobson commc ns.neither adjudicatory order imposed any obligations or restrictions on parties,including petitioners,other than those directly involved in the mergers.because petitioners can not allege any actual injury fairly traceable to either adjudicatory order,they lack standing to raise,and we lack jurisdiction to consider,their challenges to the order on this ground.see lujan defenders of wildlife,d.
petitioners make an alternative but equally unconvincing argument that the commission violated the apa.petitioners claim the commission imposition of the same interim cap recommended by the joint board and adopted by the commission in the alltel and at t adjudications proves the proceedings served no purpose,since they simply rubber stamped a rule change the commission had already adopted and enforced without the benefit of notice and comment.br.for pet rs.although petitioners once again confuse their argument with inapposite claims that the commission somehow circumvent ed the apa by adopting the cap as a condition to the two mergers while the rule was still pending,see reply br.for pet rs,it appears their central argument is that the imposition of the cap in the two adjudications demonstrates the commission was about the rule.furthermore,because the commission based its decision on exactly the same facts cited by the board and relied on by the commission in adopting the cap in the two adjudications,petitioners argue the commission improperly prejudged the issue in violation of the apa.see id.at.
under the apa,a g eneral notice of proposed rule making shall be published in the federal register and shall include either the terms or substance of the proposed rule or a description of the subjects and issues involved.b.after publishing the required notice,the agency must give interested persons an opportunity to participate in the rule making through submission of written data,views,or arguments.id.c.the opportunity for comment must be a meaningful opportunity,see gerber norton,and we have held that in order to satisfy this requirement,an agency must also remain sufficiently,see,fed.express mineta,mclouth steel prods.thomas.
here,the commission complied with each of the apa rulemaking requirements.the commission issued a notice of proposed rulemaking,see in the matter of universal serv.support,compiled a record that included sets of comments from interested parties,considered those comments,and did not issue the order until the required rulemaking process was complete.nothing else is required.
numerous commenters expressed support for the rule,and the commission properly took those views into account when it decided to impose the interim cap.other commenters opposed the cap or recommended changes to its operation.the commission likewise took those views into account,responding throughout the order to specific critiques of the cap.see,order.indeed,the commission even added an exception to the rule based on the comments.see,comments of the iowa telecomm.ass on pub.notice of may,at may,suggesting the commission base support on cetcs own costs.
statutory language 
petitioners also raise a number of challenges to the fcc interpretation and application of of the act.pursuant to the principles outlined in,the joint board and the commission are responsible for developing specific,predictable and sufficient mechanisms to preserve and advance universal service.b.since the principles outlined use vague,general language,courts have analyzed language in b under chevron step two.see texas office of pub.util.counsel fcc,cir topuc.thus,the question is whether the agency interpretation is a permissible construction of an ambiguous statute.chevron,natural res.def.council,d.we will uphold the agency interpretation as long as it is reasonable,see id.at,even if there may be other reasonable,or even more reasonable,views.fcc,see also mci telecomms.fcc.
petitioners first contend the commission violated of the act by interpreting the statutory principle that there should be specific,predictable and sufficient usf support,b emphasis added,as also requiring that the fund remain sustainable,see order noting the interim cap was necessary until comprehensive reforms are adopted to ensure that the universal service fund will be sustainable for future years.they argue sustainability is a principle adopted neither by congress in b nor by the commission in this or any previous order.we disagree.while it is true the commission may not depart from the principles in b altogether to achieve some other goal,qwest fcc,cir qwest i,we think preservation and sufficiency are just different ways of describing sustainability,see b stating t here should be specific,predictable and sufficient federal and state mechanisms to preserve and advance universal service.see collegiate thesaurus.thus,although sustainability is not mentioned in b,the commission reasonably interpreted congress directive that it preserve universal service as also requiring that it sustain universal service,which,in turn,requires ensuring the sustainability of the fund.
petitioners second argument is that the commission further violated the act by reading b as requiring that support should be sufficient,but not excessive.order emphasis added.they claim such an interpretation elevates the commission own goal of preserving the solvency of the usf over congress directive in b that the fund provide support that is sufficient to meet the needs of preserving and advancing universal service.petitioners apparently think b compels the commission to welcome wretched least so long as compensating fee exactions can be squeezed out of consumers.but the commission analysis goes beyond a narrow view of solvency,concluding the statutory principle of sufficiency proscribes support in excess of that necessary to achieve the act universal service goals.order.thus,the commission apparently reasons that sufficiency encompasses not just affordability for those benefited,but fairness for those burdened.the agency seeks to strike an appropriate balance between the interests of widely dispersed consumers with small stakes and a concentrated interest group seeking to increase its already large stake.
moreover,although this court has specifically addressed neither the meaning of sufficiency as the term is used in the act nor how the commission should balance the risks of excessive subsidization with the principles set forth in b,the commission must consider not only the possibility of pricing some customers out of the market altogether,but the need to limit the burden on customers who continue to maintain telephone service.the fifth circuit reasoning in alenco communications fcc,is instructive.in alenco,the fifth circuit upheld the commission decision to impose a prophylactic cap on usf growth,much like the cap at issue in this case.id.at.the court acknowledged t he agency broad discretion to provide sufficient universal service funding includes the decision to impose cost controls to avoid excessive expenditures that will detract from universal service.id.at see also qwest i,at noting the commission discretion to balance the principles in b against one another when they conflict.alenco,therefore,underscores the error of petitioners fundamental position that the commission may not take measures to guard against excessive usf contributions when deciding how best to administer the program.expounding on the proper interpretation of sufficient as used in b,the fifth circuit noted excessive funding may itself violate the sufficiency requirements of the act by detract ing from universal service by causing rates unnecessarily to rise,thereby pricing some consumers out of the market.alenco,at see also qwest commc ns int l fcc,cir noting excessive subsidization arguably may affect the affordability of telecommunications services,thus violating the principle in b.the court thus recognized the principle of providing sufficient funding mechanisms to advance universal service,b,may need to be balanced against the principle of affordability for consumers,id.b.
the commission enjoys broad discretion when conducting exactly this type of balancing.see fresno mobile radio,fcc,when an agency must balance a number of potentially conflicting statutory objectives judicial review is limited to determining whether the agency decision reasonably advances at least one of those objectives and its decisionmaking process was regular.see also topuc,at,noting the commission considerable amount of discretion to balance the competing concerns set forth in b and the substantial amount of deference the commission should be accorded when interpreting the term sufficient.moreover,it is hard to imagine how the commission could achieve the overall goal of preservation and advancement of universal service,b if the usf is sufficient for purposes of b,yet so large it actually makes telecommunications services less affordable,in contravention of b.that the commission,in the face of evidence showing providers were receiving subsidies in excess of what is needed to allow them to remain in the market,chose to consider its interest in avoiding excessive funding from consumers was thus entirely reasonable 
in any event,petitioners have failed to demonstrate their support would actually be insufficient under the interim cap.the pertinent question is whether the interim cap will undercut adequate telephone services for customers,since t he purpose of universal service is to benefit the customer,not the carrier.alenco,at.petitioners,however,seem to ignore this fact in their cry for more subsidies,which they have failed to prove are necessary to provide basic service to customers who have none.petitioners include no cost data showing they would,in fact,have to leave customers without service as a result of the cap and therefore give us no valid reason to believe the principle of sufficiency,even viewed in isolation,will be violated by the cap.
furthermore,the commission created an exception to the cap.to the extent a cetc believes its capped support is insufficient,the order permits the cetc to obtain an exemption upon fil ing cost data demonstrating that its costs meet the support threshold in the same manner as the incumbent lec.order.there is no reason to petitioners have offered no data support under the cap will be insufficient.thus,the limits imposed by the interim cap seem unlikely to deprive any cetcs customers of service,while they are almost sure to reduce the cetcs profits.conveniently,both petitioners and their amicus fail to mention the exemption provision even a single time in their briefing.however,at oral argument,counsel for petitioners,when pressed on the significance of the exception,characterized it as merely a side door that effectively achieves nothing since there is no accounting mechanism in place for wireless carriers to calculate their costs.although we need not consider this belated complaint,we think it not unreasonable for the commission to ask that providers be prepared to calculate their own costs.
we are equally unpersuaded by petitioners final statutory argument that the commission decision to impose the cap only on cetcs violates the commission principle of competitive neutrality and that the commission also violated the act by elevating its principle of sustainability over the principle of competitive neutrality.cetcs enjoy a significant advantage over ilecs under the current support system.under the identical support rule,as the ilec loses lines while its fixed costs remain approximately the same,the cetc receives higher support per line for each line it takes from the ilec.moreover,since the current regime appears to count each line and handset the same based on the ilec costs,cetcs receive subsidies well in excess of their costs.thus,as the commission noted in its order,wireless cetcs have an incentive to expand the number of subscribers located in the parts of areas,rather than to expand the geographic scope of their network.id.
as a result of these inequities and inefficiencies that exist under the current regime,the source of the rapid growth of the usf fund is also unbalanced.support to ilecs has been flat since,see id,and has even declined since,id.moreover,most ilec support mechanisms are already capped or subject to growth limits.id.support to cetcs,on the other hand,grew from million to billion in the six years from to.id.the evidence thus reveals it is cetc support,not ilec support that is exerting pressure on the usf and therefore poses the most direct threat to the fund sustainability.
the competitive neutrality principle requires that universal service support mechanisms and rules neither unfairly advantage nor disadvantage one provider over another,and neither unfairly favor nor disfavor one technology over another.in the matter of joint bd.on universal.the rule thus only prohibits the commission from treating competitors differently in unfair ways.based on the commission findings that cetcs and not ilecs were responsible for the surge in costs,a solution targeting only cetcs was hardly unfair.moreover,although the rule does not require the commission to provide the exact same levels of support to all etcs,see,tcg new york,city of white plains,cir noting competitive neutrality does not require precise parity of treatment,to the extent a cetc believes it should be entitled to greater support than the amount disbursed under the cap,the order permits the cetc to obtain an exception upon fil ing cost data demonstrating that its costs meet the support threshold in the same manner as the incumbent lec.order.if a cetc is not able to make this showing,the argument that reducing its support below that of the ilec violates the principle of competitive neutrality has little force.
arbitrary and capricious 
we turn last to petitioners claim that the commission decision to impose the interim cap was arbitrary and capricious.unlike chevron step two review,which focuses on whether the agency interpretation was reasonable,arbitrary and capricious review focuses on the reasonableness of the agency decisionmaking processes.the standard is very deferential.unless arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law,or not supported by substantial evidence,we will uphold an agency final order.see also arent shalala.our role in this regard is a limited one,and we will not substitute our judgment for that of the agency.see sprint nextel fcc.the commission need only articulate a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.motor vehicle mfrs.ass state farm mut.ins,d.
the arbitrary and capricious standard is particularly deferential in matters implicating predictive judgments and interim regulations.see,earthlink,fcc,mci telecomms.fcc,fcc citizens comm.for,d.where,as here,the fcc must make predictive judgments about the effects of increasing subsidies,certainty is impossible.the commission therefore relied on its expertise to evaluate the existing evidence and decide whether the risk of harm to the universal support system was large or important enough to merit immediate regulatory action.the commission concluded it was and predicted a crisis would ensue if it procrastinated.see order noting t o avert this crisis,it is necessary to place some temporary restraints on the portion of support,competitive etc support.in circumstances involving agency predictions of uncertain future events,complete factual support in the record for the commission judgment or prediction is not possible or required since a forecast of the direction in which future public interest lies necessarily involves deductions based on the expert knowledge of the agency.melcher fcc,quoting fpc transcon.gas pipe line,d.thus,when an agency decision is primarily predictive,our role is limited we require only that the agency acknowledge factual uncertainties and identify the considerations it found persuasive.see id.at.
