opinion of the court 
tkr cable company tkr brought this action against sellers of cable television descramblers,seeking statutory damages and injunctive relief for alleged violations of and.on for summary judgment,the district court determined,among other things,that the defendants had conducted sales of cable descramblers in violation of and,and through these sales,the defendants had assisted in the interception of radio communications and therefore were subject to the more severe statutory penalties of,rather than the relatively lenient penalties of.after an evidentiary hearing on damages,the court imposed the minimum damages pursuant to of per device,for a total of.the court also awarded counsel fees and granted injunctive relief.
the issue on appeal is whether,which prohibits the unauthorized interception of radio communications,applies to the sale of cable decoding equipment.the defendant sellers,cable city corporation and its officers jay grabert and chris schad collectively cable city,argue that is the sole statutory remedy for cable piracy of signals sent over terrestrial cable lines,and that applies only against offenders who directly intercept satellite or radio broadcasts as they pass through open air.
we hold that a cable television descrambler does not facilitate the interception of communications by radio and therefore the statutory damages available under do not apply here.accordingly,we will vacate the penalties imposed and remand the case for further proceedings.
tkr,based in piscataway,new jersey,provides cable television services under the authority of various municipal franchises it has purchased.these franchises authorize tkr to construct,operate,and maintain cable television systems in parts of middlesex,monmouth,and somerset counties.tkr offers its subscribers programming in packages,which include basic and standard services,as well as the option to elect premium programming services,such as cinemax,home box office hbo,and showtime,each at an additional monthly charge.tkr also offers programming,providing subscribers the opportunity to purchase individual movies,sporting events,or other entertainment at a per event fee.tkr transmits the signals for all of its cable television services from its reception facilities in piscataway to the homes of subscribers through a network of cable wiring and equipment.to prevent subscribers from receiving services they have not purchased,tkr encodes the signals,providing paying subscribers with a decoder that deciphers transmissions for the appropriate channels.scrambling constitutes the primary means by which tkr,as well as most cable service providers,prevent theft of their transmissions.
in spite of tkr precautions,the cable theft business persists.cable pirates have permeated the marketplace with unauthorized decoders that render viewable previously scrambled transmissions.in most cases,tkr can not detect or prevent the theft of its programming services without permission from a subscriber to inspect his or her home.
cable city conducted a cable piracy operation out of an office in matawan,new jersey.specifically,cable city sold cable television decoders to the public,offering descrambling services to the region for a profit.cable city represented to customers that its descramblers were bullet protected or bullet proof,meaning that they could circumvent tkr electronic security measures designed to disable pirate decoders.cable city advertised and marketed its illicit wares to tkr subscribers via val pak direct mailings,promoting their descramblers as devices designed for use on tkr cable television system.
tkr initially noticed cable city activities in or around april when some of its employees received these val pak mailings.the advertisements stated that cable city sold cable television decoders,remarking in smaller print,anyone implying theft of cable services will be denied a sale.the mailings further stated in yet smaller print,it is not the intent of cable city to defraud any pay television operator and we will not assist any company or individual in doing the same.in response to these developments,tkr retained a private investigator who visited cable city office and later purchased a descrambler based upon the representation of a cable city sales agent that the device would get all of the premium and channels.during testing at tkr facility,the descrambler received and permitted viewing of all of tkr scrambled programming services,including premium and programming.
on june,tkr sought and obtained an ex parte temporary restraining order from the district court,enjoining cable city from further sales of cable television descramblers.the order further froze the defendants business and personal assets and granted expedited discovery.the order additionally authorized the seizure of cable television descramblers,business records,and the proceeds of descrambler sales.
after a hearing on june,the court issued an order entering a preliminary injunction enjoining the continued sale or marketing of decoders enjoining the alteration,removal,or destruction of any business records concerning transactions involving decoders enjoining the transfer,withdrawal,or encumbrance of any assets without a showing that such action would be necessary for personal expenses or legitimate business expenses reaffirming the prior grant of expedited discovery and imposing upon the defendants a duty to notify tkr of their subsequent obtainment of any of the above items,cable decoders,business records,illicit proceeds and to retain such items pending a further order of the court.see tkr cable cable city,geb,wl,at july.
following discovery,the parties filed for summary judgment.on january,the district court granted tkr motion for summary judgment as to all but one defendant,holding cable city liable under both and.the district court also entered a permanent injunction prohibiting cable city from selling or otherwise distributing any equipment intended for unauthorized reception of any communication service offered over tkr cable system.tkr cable cable city,geb,slip op.at,see also supp supp.the court denied cable city for summary judgment.id.the district court determined that a applies to cable city conduct,stating that the prohibition contained in section a against the unauthorized interception of radio communications has also been interpreted to include cable television transmissions.id.at quoting tkr cable cable city,wl,at.following a subsequent hearing on damages,the district court issued a memorandum opinion,finding that cable city had made decoder sales.see tkr cable cable city,geb,slip op.at june.in accordance with,the court assessed statutory damages of per violation,amounting to a total damage award of,plus attorneys fees and costs of.see also tkr cable cable city,geb,slip op.at.cable city filed this appeal.

cable city principal argument is that the district court erred in subjecting it to the exacting liability provisions of,rather than assessing liability under the milder provisions of section subjects cable city to a minimum liability of in damages for each of its sixteen decoder box sales,amounting to damages of no less than.section,by contrast,provides a statutory damages range of to and increases the range by an additional for violations committed willfully and for purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain.cable city maintains that congress provided liability in for cable pirates who directly intercept airborne transmissions but not for offenders like cable city who sell decoder boxes that intercept cable transmissions.tkr contends that applies because cable city actions constitute interception or unauthorized reception of radio communications.we agree with cable city.
we begin by recounting the historical background underlying.although originally addressed wire communications,such as those with which cable city interfered,congress subsequently revised the section in,confining its scope nearly exclusively to radio transmissions.this statutory alteration proves critical to our analysis.
section has its genesis in the beginning of the twentieth century with the enactment,in,of the act to regulate radio communication.act of,ch,stat.this act,originally intended to protect the confidentiality of wireless communications,defined radio communications as any system of electrical communication by telegraphy or telephony without the aid of any wire connecting the points from and at which the signals are sent or received.id,stat.at emphasis added.congress replaced the act with the radio act of.radio act of,ch,stat.this measure included a definition of radio communication as being any communication of any nature transferred by electrical energy from one point to another without the aid of any wire connecting the points from and at which the electrical energy is sent or received id,stat.at emphasis added.these definitions clearly show congress desire,from the beginning of the twentieth century,to distinguish between radio communications and communications transmitted over wire.
seven years later,congress repealed the radio act of when it passed the communications act of the communications act or the act,now codified in relevant part at a.communications act of,ch,stat.this act established the federal communications commission and granted it jurisdiction over the regulation of radio and wire transmissions.id.the communications act originally provided for the maintenance of privacy through four clauses that prohibited the unauthorized divulgence or publishing of wire or radio communications by the operators responsible for receiving such communication the unauthorized interception and divulgence of wire or radio communications the unauthorized receipt and use of wire or radio communications for the benefit of the unauthorized receiver or someone else not entitled to the communication and the divulgence,publication,or use of unlawfully intercepted information by anyone knowing that the information was wrongfully obtained.see id.at codified as amended at a.the act further provided definitions of wire and radio communication that are still in use today and are codified at.specifically,defines radio and wire communication as follows 
the term radio communication or communication by radio means the transmission by radio of writing,signs,signals,pictures,and sounds of all kinds,including all instrumentalities,facilities,apparatus,and services among other things,the receipt,forwarding,and delivery of communications incidental to such transmission 
the term wire communication or communication by wire means the transmission of writing,signs,signals,pictures,and sounds of all kinds by aid of wire,cable,or other like connection between the points of origin and reception of such transmission,including all instrumentalities,facilities,apparatus,and services among other things,the receipt,forwarding,and delivery of communications incidental to such transmission.
accordingly,in both the principal provisions of the communications act,now codified at,and the definitional provisions now codified at and,congress clearly defined wire and radio communications as concepts involving distinct types of transmissions.
years after passage of the communications act,congress restructured the regulatory framework governing the interception of radio and wire communications when it passed the omnibus crime control and safe streets act of.see,stat.the crime control act or the act.seeking to combat a contemporary surge in crime,particularly in organized activity,congress greatly expanded the authority of law enforcement officials to monitor the communications of suspected offenders.to ensure autonomy and coherence in the novel framework of the act,congress amended from the communications act to remove references to wire communications from all but the first clause of a,which banned the divulgence of wire and radio transmissions by communications personnel.see act,stat.at.the legislative history of the act states that,while the act removed prohibitions on interference with,and monitoring of,wire communication from the purview of section of the communications act,congress introduced comprehensive provisions regulating the interception of wire and oral communications,now codified at et.see,reprinted in.congress also explained why it removed the reference to wire communication in 
this section amends section of the communications act of stat.this section is not intended merely to be a reenactment of section.the new provision is intended as a substitute.the regulation of the interception of wire or oral communications in the future is to be governed by proposed new chapter of title,united states code.
id.emphasis added thus,through the crime control act,congress removed from of the communications act the principal share of its authority over wire communications,leaving primarily with radio communications.in short,although,as originally drafted in,would have reached the cable decoder box piracy perpetrated by cable city,the act removed the critical language granting authority over such conduct 
tkr contends nonetheless that,in spite of the crime control act,continues to cover cable transmissions.tkr asserts that,although the act removed key references to wire communications from,the remaining references to radio communication in the act suffice to encompass the acts of cable city in the instant case.in particular,tkr argues that the definition of r adio communication in supports a determination that all wire communications,be they of wire,radio,or satellite origin,fall under.tkr notes that the provision defining r adio communication in includes within its scope the transmission by radio of communication of all kinds,including all instrumentalities,facilities,apparatus and services among other things,the receipt,forwarding,and delivery of communications incidental to such transmission.tkr thereby suggests that all wire retransmissions after the receipt of a radio transmission necessarily fall within the definition of because they entail the conveyance of a radio signal via instrumentalities or facilities incidental to such communication.id.
we reject tkr interpretation of because,as the seventh circuit noted in united states norris,if the argument is taken to its full conclusion,it unacceptably blurs the line between radio and wire communications.united states norris,cir.we believe that such an expansive construction of radio communication would place an unacceptably broad range of transmissions within the purview of,effectively ignoring the significance of congress excision of wire communication from.as the norris court noted,this reading of radio communication would place cordless telephone conversations within the ambit of because they commence with a brief radio communication,followed by an extensive wire transmission.moreover,tkr reading of demands undue contortion of the phrase instrumentalities or facilities incidental to such transmission.suggesting that an entire cable infrastructure constitutes a mere instrumentality incidental to the transmission of a satellite broadcast ignores the scale of effort entailed in delivering this transmission to a given residence.the wires that connect a home satellite dish to the living room television arguably constitute facilities incidental to the transmission.however,the entire cable transmission infrastructure of a city or suburban area,a structure that provides a foundation for a significant business,such as that of tkr,or any other major cable service provider,can not be considered a mere instrumentality to transmission.the plain language of,read in the context of the crime control act,therefore precludes an interpretation of radio communication in that would include terrestrial cable transmissions such as those in the instant case.
in sum,by transferring authority over wire communications to the province of the crime control act,congress removed coverage of wire communications from,and thereby excluded activities such as cable city from that provision scope.moreover,contrary to tkr argument,because tkr cable transmissions are not incidental to the transmission of radio communications,the definition of radio communications that accompanies does not apply here.we believe,therefore,that does not reach cable city conduct.
even if there were any doubt as to the facial applicability of,the history of both and and congress express intent demonstrates that only,and not,applies to cable city conduct.two principal reasons,both particularly informed by a historical perspective,demonstrate why only,rather than,reaches cable city conduct in,congress enacted to combat the novel phenomenon of cable piracy,a crime that acquired significance only with the recent expansion of the cable industry in the and an interpretation of that reaches cable city conduct would effectively render superfluous because it would deprive of any substantial activity that it could uniquely address.
we begin by setting within the context of cable industry history.in the years following the passage of the omnibus crime control act,the cable television industry witnessed a period of widespread and unprecedented expansion.although cable television,which found its beginnings as a means of providing the residents of rural areas with better reception of television broadcast signals,spread from its inception quickly beyond its roots in oregon,it had still,by the mid,reached no more than to percent of american homes,at,reprinted in,at.the year,however,brought significant change,particularly through the introduction of satellite technology,which congress,in its legislative history to,later documented 
the cable industry has changed dramatically since its beginnings 
in,home box office hbo,a time,subsidiary,revolutionized the cable industry by launching the satellite delivery of its programming service.this development made it possible to economically deliver to local cable systems by satellite a vast array of national programming services.these new services provided movies,sports,news,and specialized programming directed to a number of individual segments of the national audience such as children,minorities and senior citizens.with the availability of these new services,the cable television industry experienced a new round of growth and expansion,moving into still larger cities with systems that promised over channels to every home.
id.addressing this sudden growth of the cable industry and its accompanying consequences,congress in promulgated the cable communications policy act,a new regulatory framework for the field of cable television.see cable communications policy act of,stat.codified in relevant part at cable act or act.
as part of the act,congress passed what is now a,which provides,among other things 
no person shall intercept or receive or assist in intercepting or receiving any communications service offered over a cable system,unless specifically authorized to do so by a cable operator or as may otherwise be specifically authorized by law.
for purposes of this section,the term assist in intercepting or receiving shall include the manufacture or distribution of equipment intended by the manufacturer or distributor as the case may be for unauthorized reception of any communications service offered over a cable system in violation of subparagraph.
a.through these provisions of the cable act,congress acknowledged the novel expansion of the cable television industry,and created strict new penalties to deter cable pirates who would otherwise exploit this phenomenon.
as we noted above,congress enacted specifically to combat the novel phenomenon of cable piracy,a crime that emerged in abundance only with the cable industry developments of the.the legislative history to the cable act supports this interpretation.congress therein expressly identified the threat to the rapidly changing cable industry that the newly enacted would address 
the committee is extremely concerned with a problem which is increasingly plaguing the cable theft of cable service.this problem has taken on many forms from the manufacture and sale of equipment intended to permit reception of cable services without paying for it,to apartment building dwellers tapping into cable system wire in a building hallway that is used for providing service to a neighbor apartment unit,to the sale by building superintendents of cable converters left behind by previous tenants to new tenants.such practices not only often permit one to obtain cable service without paying the installation and costs,but also,for instance,involve individuals gaining access to premium movie and sports channels without paying for the receipt of those services.
theft of service is depriving the cable industry of millions of dollars of revenue each year which it should otherwise be receiving.the committee believes that theft of cable service poses a major threat to the economic viability of cable operators and cable programmers,and creates unfair burdens on cable subscribers who are forced to subsidize the benefits that other individuals are getting by receiving cable service without paying for it.
at,reprinted in at.it is clear,from the language of the statement above,that congress sought primarily to address the phenomena associated with the recent accelerated growth of the cable industry,fueled by the satellite delivery of programming service.id.at.without this development which made it possible to economically deliver to local cable systems by satellite a vast array of national programming services,there would have been neither a greatly expanded cable industry,the greatly expanded cable piracy that accompanied it,nor the necessity to pass legislation regulating either the former or the latter.id.these concerns all strongly suggest that,in enacting as part of the cable communications policy act,congress wished to address cable piracy in the most thriving and vital sector of the industry.that is,congress intended to regulate the sector wherein cable networks economically deliver to local cable systems by satellite a vast array of national programming services the sector that had driven the unprecedented growth of the prior decade.id.
tkr argues,however,that already addressed this growing field of cable piracy.we reject tkr interpretation,not only because the legislative history accompanying demonstrates that congress drafted the provision to deter the newly emergent and previously unaddressed cable piracy,but also because tkr reading of would effectively render superfluous.
to avoid suggesting that is redundant,tkr contends that congress actually drafted to provide liability for interception of communications directed from a point of origin to a particular destination solely by wire transmissions,a form of transmission that undisputedly has not addressed since the passage of the act.both history and the plain language of the statutes,however,expose the flaws in this conception of the regulatory framework.by suggesting that congress drafted because it was primarily concerned with purely cable transmissions,tkr proposes that congress conceived to address only local cable programming,a relatively minor segment of the industry.this argument ignores congress acknowledgment,recounted above,that the satellite technology and market forces reshaping the cable industry motivated its passage of the cable act.see,at,reprinted in at explaining that new legislation was necessary since t he communications act of was enacted well before the advent of cable television.
the legislative history to shows that congress specifically
