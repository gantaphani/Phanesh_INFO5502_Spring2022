in these consolidated appeals,rural telephone companies rtcs collectively appeal the district court orders affirming final orders of the oklahoma corporation commission occ.the occ orders established interconnection obligations under the federal telecommunications act of between the rtcs and commercial mobile radio service cmrs providers.our jurisdiction arises under,and we affirm.
background 
the rtcs are traditional landline telecommunications carriers doing business in oklahoma.cmrs providers are wireless telecommunications carriers.this dispute arose from negotiations for interconnection agreements between the rtcs and cmrs providers.
the telecommunications act of telecommunications act or act,opened the previously monopolized telecommunications industry to competition.under the act,local exchange carriers lecs like the rtcs,have a duty to interconnect with competitors and negotiate agreements in good faith.a,c.in the instant cases,the rtcs and cmrs providers resolved many outstanding issues during voluntary negotiations entered into pursuant to a of the act.however,negotiations broke down over compensation for the transport and termination of telecommunications traffic.the cmrs providers subsequently filed petitions with the occ seeking arbitration of the contested issues pursuant to b of the act.
the parties raised numerous issues before the arbitrator.relevant here,the rtcs and cmrs providers disputed the compensation regime that would apply to the transport and termination of telecommunications between the parties networks.under the terms of the interconnection agreements,the cmrs providers were not required to establish physical connections with the rtc networks,although the agreements do not preclude such connections.rather,telecommunications traffic could be routed through an interexchange carrier ixc,southwestern bell telephone company swbt.when an rtc customer places a call to a cmrs customer,the call must first pass from the rtc network through a point of interconnection with the swbt network.swbt then routes the call to a second point of interconnection between its network and the cmrs network.the call is then delivered to the cmrs customer in contrast,were the rtc and cmrs networks directly connected,the call would pass only through a single point of interconnection.
the cmrs providers maintained that,regardless of the presence of the ixc,the telecommunications exchange referenced above is subject to the reciprocal compensation obligations found in b of the act.the federal communications commission fcc,charged with effectuating the provisions of the act,has determined that reciprocal compensation should only apply to telecommunications traffic originating and terminating in the same local area.first report and order,fcc,cc docket,first report and order.under a typical reciprocal compensation agreement between two carriers,the carrier on whose network the call originates bears the cost of transporting the telecommunications traffic to the point of interconnection with the carrier on whose network the call terminates.id.having been compensated by its customer,the originating network in turn compensates the terminating carrier for completing the call.id.in contrast,the rtcs maintained that traffic passing through an ixc is subject to the access charge,or calling,regime.under the access charge regime,the originating caller pays the ixc,which in turn compensates the originating and terminating networks.id.thus,the rtcs contend that they have no obligation to compensate cmrs providers for transporting and terminating such traffic.
in the context of the instant cases,the difference between the compensation schemes is more than semantic.under these reciprocal compensation agreements,the originating network bears the cost of transporting telecommunications traffic across swbt network to the point of interconnection with the terminating network.the originating network is then required to compensate the terminating network for terminating the call.under the act,reciprocal compensation is based solely on the costs of transport and termination incurred by the terminating provider.d a.in contrast,under the access charge regime,both the originating and terminating carriers would be compensated by the ixc.under this scenario,neither carrier bears the cost of transporting traffic on the ixc network.
excepting traffic to or from a cmrs provider,state commissions are responsible for determining what areas are local for purposes of applying the reciprocal compensation obligation found in b.first report and order.however,the fcc has determined that traffic to or from a cmrs network that originates and terminates within the same major trading area is subject to transport and termination rates under section b,rather than interstate and intrastate access charges.id.a major trading area mta is the largest wireless license territory,and might encompass all or part of numerous local calling areas.id.relying on this fcc determination,the arbitrator determined that reciprocal compensation would apply to agreements between the rtcs and cmrs providers in the instant cases.the occ subsequently approved provisions in the arbitrated agreements reflecting this determination.
in addition,and solely with respect to wwc license western wireless,the arbitrator determined that western wireless should have the option under the agreements to establish local numbers without establishing direct connections with the rtcs.this determination resulted in a provision under the interconnection agreement requiring an rtc to deliver calls to western wireless at a swbt switch.
on completion of the arbitration,the conformed agreements were submitted to and approved by the occ.the rtcs initially appealed the occ orders approving the interconnection agreements to the oklahoma supreme court,but their suit was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.the rtcs then brought suit in federal district court.in its first order and judgment,the district court affirmed various aspects of the occ orders,including the determination that compensation for the transport and termination of telecommunications would be reciprocal.atlas.com of,d,atlas i.in its second order and judgment,the district court affirmed that part of the occ final order approving the provision in the interconnection agreement that requires an rtc to deliver calls to western wireless at a swbt switch.atlas.com of,d,atlas ii.
issues on appeal 
in,and,the rtcs challenge that portion of atlas i affirming the occ determination that reciprocal compensation obligations apply to all calls originated by an rtc and terminated by a wireless provider within the same major trading area,without regard to whether those calls are delivered via an intermediate carrier.d at.the rtcs contend that the holding is contrary to both the telecommunications act and fcc regulations.in,the rtcs reiterate the foregoing and further challenge the district court determination that the act does not require competing carriers to interconnect physically with the lec network as contrary to the express language of the statute and fcc regulations.atlas ii,d at.
discussion 
standard of review 
the issues raised by the rtcs in the instant cases are purely legal.as such,we will conduct a de novo review to determine whether the interconnection agreements,as approved by the occ,comply with the requirements of the act and federal regulations implementing its statutory provisions.southwestern bell.brooks fiber communications of,cir.however,we note that the rtcs have not challenged the validity of the various fcc regulations at issue in this case.thus,we have not been asked to undertake,nor will we engage in,a reasonableness inquiry concerning those determinations.see chevron,natural res.def.council,d.
ii.the statutory scheme 
section of the act establishes a system of obligations imposed on separate,statutorily defined telecommunications entities.pac.bell cook telecom,cir competitive telecomms.ass fcc,cir.section a obligates each telecommunications carrier to interconnect directly or indirectly with the facilities and equipment of other telecommunications carriers.a.under section b,the more limited class of local exchange carriers is obligated to,among other things,establish reciprocal compensation arrangements for the transport and termination of telecommunications.id.b.finally,c imposes additional obligations on incumbent local exchange carriers ilecs for instance,ilecs have the duty to negotiate in good faith interconnection agreements that comply with the obligations in b c.id.c.ilecs also bear the statutory duty to provide,for the facilities and equipment of any requesting telecommunications carrier,interconnection with the ilec network.id.c.such interconnection must be provided at any technically feasible point within the ilec network,id.c b,and on rates,terms,and conditions that are just,reasonable,and nondiscriminatory.id.c d.
recognizing that implementation of the provisions of the act would not be instantaneous,congress included language to ensure that certain exchange access and interconnection requirements would continue to be enforced after passage of the statute.
on and after february,each local exchange carrier,to the extent that it provides wireline services,shall provide exchange access,information access,and exchange services for such access to interexchange carriers and information service providers in accordance with the same equal access and nondiscriminatory interconnection restrictions and obligations including receipt of compensation that apply to such carrier on the date immediately preceding february,until such restrictions and obligations are explicitly superseded by regulations prescribed by the commission after february.
id.g.as the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit has explained,g is a transitional provision designed to keep in place certain restrictions and obligations,including the existing access charge regime,until such provisions are superceded by fcc regulations.worldcom,fcc.
finally,in defining the parameters for reciprocal compensation under b,congress mandated that the terms and conditions for such compensation must provide for the mutual and reciprocal recovery by each carrier of costs associated with the transport and termination on each carrier network facilities of calls that originate on the network facilities of the other carrier.d a i.however,congress clearly indicated that it did not seek to preclude arrangements that waive mutual recovery such as arrangements.id.d b i.
iii.fcc implementation 
in its first report and order,the fcc made several determinations that bear directly on these consolidated cases.while declining to treat cmrs providers as lecs,and thus subject to the obligations imposed under b c,the fcc expressly determined that lecs are obligated under b to enter into reciprocal compensation arrangements with cmrs providers.first report and order.furthermore,the commission determined that i ncumbent lecs are required to provide interconnection to cmrs providers who request it for the transmission and routing of telephone exchange service or exchange access,under the plain language of section c.id.
in determining the scope of the b obligation,the fcc concluded that reciprocal compensation obligations should apply only to traffic that originates and terminates within a local area.id.with respect to communication,the fcc determined that state commissions retained the authority to define local area for the purpose of applying the b obligation.id.however,the commission defined the local area for communication as coterminous with the mta,the largest wireless territory.id.the fcc explained that traffic to or from a cmrs network that originates and terminates within the same mta is subject to transport and termination rates under section b,rather than interstate and intrastate access charges.id.emphasis added.
these fcc determinations have since been codified as regulations binding on the industry and state commissions.relevant here,details an ilec obligation under c of the act to provide for interconnection with requesting carriers and identifies technically feasible points of interconnection on the ilec network.with respect to reciprocal compensation requirements,the regulations further provide that e ach lec shall establish reciprocal compensation arrangements for transport and termination of telecommunications traffic with any requesting telecommunications carrier.a.for purposes of applying the requirement in section,telecommunications traffic is defined in relevant part as that exchanged between a lec and a cmrs provider that,at the beginning of the call,originates and terminates within the same major trading area.id.b.finally,transport in the context of reciprocal compensation obligations is defined as the transmission and any necessary tandem switching of telecommunications traffic subject to section b of the act from the interconnection point between the two carriers to the terminating carrier end office switch that directly serves the called party,or equivalent facility provided by a carrier other than an ilec.id.c.
iv.appellants common between the agreements and the act and federal regulations 
we construe the rtcs briefs in these consolidated cases as raising a single common issue alleging inconsistency between the interconnection agreements and the plain language of the act,the first report and order,and the relevant regulations this issue roughly corresponds to that treated by the district court in part of its order and judgment in atlas d at.we treat the issue unique to,the western wireless issue,separately below.
we begin,as we must,with the plain language of b and its regulatory counterpart a in no uncertain terms,both provisions impose a duty on lecs to establish reciprocal compensation arrangements with requesting carriers.we next turn to b,a regulatory provision that both gives effect to and narrows the lecs obligation.regulation b defines telecommunications traffic subject to reciprocal compensation as,in relevant part,that exchanged between a lec and a cmrs provider that,at the beginning of the call,originates and terminates within the same mta.b.
we hold that the mandate expressed in these provisions is clear,unambiguous,and on its face admits of no exceptions.the rtcs in the instant case have a mandatory duty to establish reciprocal compensation agreements with the cmrs providers,see qwest fcc,cir noting that the term shall connotes a mandatory,as opposed to permissive,requirement,for calls originating and terminating within the same mta.where the regulations at issue are unambiguous,our review is controlled by their plain meaning.in re sealed case.nothing in the text of these provisions provides support for the rtc contention that reciprocal compensation requirements do not apply when traffic is transported on an ixc network.
our reading of the plain language of the relevant statutory and regulatory provisions is further supported by the fcc definition of telecommunications traffic in the context of exchange in the same regulations.see b.regulation b specifically excludes from reciprocal compensation requirements landline traffic exchanged between a lec and a carrier that is interstate or intrastate exchange access in nature.id.b emphasis added.significantly,the commission did not carry forward that same exception into regulation b,the operative definition in this case.we agree with the district court conclusion that the fcc was undoubtedly aware of issues arising when access calls are exchanged,yet chose not to extend a similar exception to traffic.atlas i,d at.when in exercising its authority an agency includes a specific term or exception in one provision of a regulation,but excludes it in another,we will not presume that such term or exception applies to provisions from which it is omitted.russello united states,d noting that when congress so acts,courts will presume that the exclusion was intentional.
we are not persuaded by the rtcs arguments that our interpretation creates tension or is inconsistent with other fcc regulations and provisions of the act.the rtcs first contend that c mandates that the exchange of local traffic occur at specific,technically feasible points within an rtc netwo
