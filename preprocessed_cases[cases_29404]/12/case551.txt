the city of berkeley appeals the district court summary judgment ruling that its interim telecommunication carriers ordinance is preempted by the federal telecommunications act of act.the district court ruled that the interim telecommunication carriers ordinance is preempted by the act because the ordinance imposed an onerous burden on telecommunications providers seeking entry into the telecommunications market in berkeley.the court held also that the ordinance is not saved by the act safe harbor clause because the regulations that create this prohibiting effect do not merely regulate the city of berkeley public but regulate the telecommunications companies themselves.we come to the same conclusions as the district court and,therefore,affirm the district court judgment.
background 
in,congress passed the federal telecommunications act.the full title of the act is an act to promote competition and reduce regulation in order to secure lower prices and higher quality services for american telecommunications consumers and encourage the rapid deployment of new telecommunication technologies.as indicated by the title,the purpose of the act was to reduce regulation of telecommunications providers by creating a procompetitive,national policy framework.the act was later codified in.section furthers this purpose by precluding states and municipalities from passing laws that prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the ability of any entity from providing telecommunications services.a.this preemption is not absolute.section also includes a safe harbor clause that allows state and local government to manage the public or to require fair and reasonable compensation from telecommunications providers so long as the management and compensation is done on a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory basis.c.
in december,qwest communications corporation qwest won a competitive bidding process to provide faster and expanded telecommunications capacity to lawrence berkeley national laboratory lbnl located in the city of berkeley,california city.in order to upgrade lbnl telecommunications capacity,qwest needed to install a local loop between lbnl and qwest central system.this involved laying a conduit through the city public.from march through december,qwest and the city negotiated and developed an acceptable construction plan to lay the conduit in the public.on july,qwest presented an application for the permits necessary to begin work on lbnl conduits.however,on july,the berkeley city council adopted resolution,declaring a moratorium on telecommunications infrastructure work with exceptions for emergency and hardship cases.as a result,the city stopped issuing excavation permits for telecommunications infrastructure work and qwest was unable to obtain the necessary permits to begin construction.
on december,the city enacted ordinance ordinance to regulate telecommunications companies and their use of the public.on february,qwest filed suit against the city arguing in part that ordinance was preempted under federal and state law.qwest also sought temporary injunctive relief.in may,the district court enjoined the city from enforcing ordinance.following the court ruling,the city passed resolution,adopting ordinance ordinance to replace ordinance.in response,qwest amended its complaint to challenge ordinance in addition to ordinance.on april,the district court ruled that ordinances and were preempted by.the city appealed the district court decision with regard to only ordinance.
standard of review 
the district court grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo.see buono norton,cir.thus,our review is governed by the same standard used by the trial court under federal rule of civil procedure c.see olsen idaho bd.of,cir.
discussion 
under the supremacy clause of the united states constitution,congress may preempt state law through federal legislation.const.art.vi,chicago transp.kalo brick tile,d.congress can preempt state law through legislation in several ways.jones rath packing,d.one way is to expressly state an intention to preempt,as congress has done with a n o state or local statute or regulation,or other state or local legal requirement,may prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the ability of any entity to provide any interstate or intrastate telecommunications service.see,metrophones,crossing,cir.we have interpreted this preemptive language to be clear and virtually absolute in restricting municipalities to a very limited and proscribed role in the regulation of telecommunications.city of auburn qwest,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the narrowly circumscribed role is set forth in c.this safe harbor clause permits state and local government control over the use of the,so long as the control is management of the itself and not control of the telecommunications companies with facilities in the.id.at.
preemption a 
before considering whether ordinance falls within the safe harbor,we must determine whether the ordinance regulations fall within the preemptive language of a.the city argues qwest failed to produce any facts showing how any section or combination of sections of ordinance does what a or having the effect of prohibiting telecommunications services.specifically,the city contends that qwest must show the actual impact of ordinance on qwest ability to provide telecommunications services.however,we explicitly rejected this argument in qwest city of portland 
the district court noted that qwest has not pointed to a single telecommunications service that it,or any other entity,is effectively prohibited from providing because of the cities fees or any of the other challenged requirements.we do not agree that qwest was required to make an actual showing of a single telecommunications service that it is effectively prohibited from providing.we have previously ruled that regulations that may have the effect of prohibiting the provision of telecommunications services are preempted.
cir citations and quotation marks omitted.
consequently,rather than considering the actual impact of ordinance,we must determine whether the specific regulations of ordinance may have the effect of prohibiting the provision of telecommunications services in the city.id.as explained below,the regulations of ordinance have that prohibiting effect.
section of ordinance requires telecommunications companies using the public to pay what the city refers to as a based compensation fee.in auburn,we stated that fees not based on the costs of maintaining the public,as required under the telecom act contributed to a regulatory scheme that had the impermissible effect of precluding telecommunications companies from providing services.at.
in portland,at,we questioned whether this language stood for the proposition that all based fees would be automatically preempted.that questioning is reasonable based on the text and organization of that require an individualized determination of whether the regulation prohibits or may have the effect of prohibiting the provision of telecommunications services before determining whether the regulation is saved by the safe harbor clause of.thus,we decline to read auburn to mean that all based fees are automatically preempted,but rather that courts must consider the substance of the particular regulation at issue.
the city makes no attempt to assert that its based fee is not the type of regulation that prohibits or may have the effect of prohibiting the provision of telecommunications services.instead,the city asserts that section escapes preemption because it allows telecommunications companies protected by a to be excluded from paying this fee by complying with the common carrier exemption procedure.ordinance d.
however,the common carrier exemption procedure is not a simple process.the city own witness described the exemption as a very exhaustive process that requires the applicant company to provide extensive information about the company and the specific project.although not identical to the franchise application process in auburn,the exemption process in this case is similarly onerous and,therefore,has the same discouraging effect.
