verizon petitions for review of an order of the federal communications commission denying the company request that the commission forbear from requiring it to unbundle and to lease certain elements of its network pursuant to of the communications act of.the commission had previously determined that incumbent local exchange carriers ilecs,including verizon,need not unbundle and lease those same elements under of the act.because the commission failed adequately to explain its decision not to forbear,we grant verizon petition for review.
background 
under of the communications act of,as amended by the telecommunications act of,the commission shall forbear from applying any regulation or any provision of the act to a telecommunications carrier or telecommunications service if it determines 
enforcement of such regulation or provision is not necessary to ensure that the charges,practices,classifications,or regulations by,for,or in connection with that telecommunications carrier or telecommunications service are just and reasonable and are not unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory 
enforcement of such regulation or provision is not necessary for the protection of consumers and 
forbearance from applying such provision or regulation is consistent with the public interest.
a.the commission must make its determination whether to grant or to deny a petition for forbearance within one year of receiving it,else the petition is deemed granted.id.c.the commission may,however,upon finding an extension is necessary in order to meet the requirements set out above,extend the period by days,as it did here.
as a bell operating company boc,verizon must satisfy the requirements of of the act before it may provide interlata,long distance services.see.those requirements include a competitive checklist setting out conditions a boc must satisfy when providing access and interconnection to competitive local exchange carriers clecs.c b.the four checklist items at issue in this case require the bocs to provide clecs with local loop transmission,transport,and switching,as well as nondiscriminatory access to certain network elements.see c b iv vi x.section of the act sets out interconnection requirements with which all telecommunications carriers,not only the bocs,must comply.section d instructs the commission to consider,at a minimum,whether the failure of an ilec to provide access to such network elements would impair the ability of a clec to provide the services it seeks to offer.see d.
on july,verizon petitioned the commission to forbear from applying items four through six and item ten of the section competitive checklist once the corresponding elements no longer need to be unbundled under section d.verizon took the position in its petition for forbearance that w here an element no longer meets the section d standard for unbundling,forbearance with respect to the parallel checklist item is required by section.
in august the commission eliminate d the unbundling requirement of with respect to most broadband network elements,in order to mak e it easier for companies to invest in new equipment and deploy the services that consumers desire.see report and order and order on remand and further notice of proposed rulemaking,review of the section unbundling obligations of incumbent local exchange carriers,cc docket et,fcc,fcc rcd,triennial review order.we upheld that part of the triennial review order in united states telecom ass fcc.
on october,one business day before expiration of the extension of the time for the commission to act upon verizon july petition,verizon submitted an ex parte letter to the commission,as authorized by.the letter stated 
a lthough verizon petition originally requested forbearance with respect to all elements that do not have to be unbundled under section,the broadband issue is sufficiently urgent that we hereby withdraw our request for forbearance with respect to any narrowband elements that do not have to be unbundled under section.specifically,the portion of the forbearance petition that remains pending relates to the broadband elements that the commission has found in the triennial review order do not have to be unbundled under section,including,the features,functions and capability of hybrid loops,and packet switching.
emphasis in original.along with its letter,verizon submitted a memorandum detailing the reasons it maintained the commission was required to forbear from requiring it to unbundle broadband elements pursuant to.
on october,the last day of the extension period,the commission denied verizon petition for forbearance,stating in relevant part 
we find that verizon october ex parte letter abandoned the core legal rationale underlying its petition and substituted a wholly different argument for forbearance.we therefore deny verizon initial petition because the principal argument for the relief initially requested was rendered moot by the triennial review order and because verizon substituted a new theory of relief.in light of this substitution,we choose to treat verizon october ex parte letter as a new forbearance petition.
as a new forbearance petition,verizon ex parte letter triggered a new period for consideration,and the commission established a new schedule for comments accordingly.verizon now petitions the court for review of the october order.
ii.analysis 
verizon first complains the commission violated c of the communications act by failing to rule on the merits of its petition for forbearance within the statutory period.as mentioned above,a petition for forbearance is deemed granted under c if the commission does not deny it within one year or,as here,one year plus days after it receives the petition.see c.verizon also argues that by treating its ex parte letter of october,as a new forbearance petition,the commission unlawfully extended the review period beyond the statutory deadline.
as the commission first correctly points out,its decision of october,although not on the merits,was timely nothing in the act requires that the commission make a decision on the merits of an application that is defective procedurally particularly if the defect arises only one day before the deadline for a decision.the significant question,therefore,is not whether the commission violated the statutory deadline,but whether,as verizon also argues,the commission explanation for denying verizon petition was inadequate and its decision therefore arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.see a see also cellular telcoms.internet ass fcc,in addition to requirements of,commission order is also subject to review under the administrative procedure act arbitrary and capricious standard.
the commission denied verizon petition on two independent grounds in its ex parte letter of october verizon substituted a new theory of relief and the principal argument for the relief initially requested was rendered moot by the triennial review order.with respect to the ex parte letter,verizon argues it neither abandoned the core legal rationale underlying its petition,nor substituted a wholly different argument for forbearance,as the commission put the matter in the order.on the contrary,verizon argues that in the letter it reiterated the basic rationales for forbearance emphasis in original the broadband issues raised in the ex parte letter addressed the same policy concerns that verizon had aired,and the fcc had accepted,in the triennial review proceeding.the commission responds by pointing out that verizon had made no mention of broadband in its july petition whereas in the ex parte letter it relied upon the specific finding relating to broadband elements in the triennial review order issued in august.
the commission assertion that verizon ex parte letter abandoned the core legal rationale underlying its petition makes no apparent sense when one realizes that broadband elements are merely a subset of the network elements for which verizon requested forbearance in its july petition.in that petition verizon had asked the commission,without qualification or limitation,
to forbear from applying items four through six and ten o
