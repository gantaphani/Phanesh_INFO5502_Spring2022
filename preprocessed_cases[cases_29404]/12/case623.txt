this case arises out of congress efforts,through the telecommunications act of the act,to increase competition in the market for local telephone service.in at t iowa utilities,d,the supreme court briefly outlined the history of local telephone service,the impact of the act on such service,and the methods by which the act allows new companies to gain entry to a local market 
until the,local phone service was thought to be a natural monopoly.states typically granted an exclusive franchise in each local service area to a local exchange carrier lec,which owned,among other things,the local loops wires connecting telephones to switches,the switches equipment directing calls to their destinations,and the transport trunks wires carrying calls between switches that constitute a local exchange network.technological advances,however,have made competition among multiple providers of local service seem possible,and congress recently ended the longstanding regime of monopolies.
the telecommunications act of act or the act,stat,fundamentally restructures local telephone markets.states may no longer enforce laws that impede competition,and incumbent lecs are subject to a host of duties intended to facilitate market entry.foremost among these duties is the lec obligation under c ed.supp.ii to share its network with competitors.under this provision,a requesting carrier can obtain access to an incumbent network in three ways it can purchase local telephone services at wholesale rates for resale to end users it can lease elements of the incumbent network on an unbundled basis and it can interconnect its own facilities with the incumbent network.when an entrant seeks access through any of these routes,the incumbent can negotiate an agreement without regard to the duties it would otherwise have under b or c.see a.but if private negotiation fails,either party can petition the state commission that regulates local phone service to arbitrate open issues,which arbitration is subject to and the fcc regulations promulgated thereunder.
id.at.footnotes omitted.
the act imposes three general conditions a state commission must satisfy in arbitrating open issues regarding an interconnection agreement.first,it must ensure that its resolution and conditions meet the requirements of section,including the regulations prescribed by the fcc pursuant to section.c.second,it must establish any rates for interconnection,services,or network elements according to subsection d of section,id.c,which provides that interconnection and network element charges shall be based on the cost of providing the interconnection or network element,and nondiscriminatory,and may include a reasonable profit.third,it must provide a schedule for implementation of the terms and conditions by the parties to the agreement.id.c.as long as these three requirements are satisfied,a state commission is free,subject to the provisions of to establish or enforc e other requirements of state law in its review of an interconnection agreement,including requiring compliance with intrastate telecommunications service quality standards or requirements.e.
once an interconnection agreement is arbitrated,it must be submitted to the state commission for final approval.see e.a state commission may reject an arbitrated agreement only if the agreement or a provision thereof fails to meet the requirements of section of the act or the fcc regulations promulgated under the act.see e b.
finally,the act provides for federal court review of interconnection agreements.specifically,e authorizes any party aggrieved by a state commission decision regarding an interconnection agreement to bring an action in an appropriate federal district court.for example,if a party to an arbitrated interconnection agreement is dissatisfied with a particular provision imposed by a state commission,it can seek review of that provision by filing suit in federal court.federal court review is limited to the determination of whether the agreement meets the requirements of section and section.id.
history of interconnection agreements and ensuing litigation 
plaintiff qwest is an incumbent local exchange carrier ilec based in the state of colorado.mci and sprint,along with several other companies,sought entry to qwest market for local phone service.under the act,these companies are generally referred to as competing local exchange carriers clecs.mci and sprint each attempted,unsuccessfully,to negotiate interconnection agreements with qwest.accordingly,mci and sprint each filed a petition with the cpuc asking for arbitration of unresolved issues with qwest.in particular,both mci and sprint sought inclusion in their respective interconnection agreements of most favored nation or pick and choose clauses affording them the right to pick any clause from any other interconnection agreement either agreed to or arbitrated by any other carrier who interconnected with qwest,and purchase services from qwest out of any effective tariffs filed by qwest with the cpuc regardless of the price s otherwise established for such services in the parties interconnection agreement.dist.order at.
cpuc decision regarding mci petition 
mci petition,which was filed first,was addressed by the cpuc in a written order issued on december.the cpuc agreed with mci regarding the provision and ordered that the interconnection agreement between mci and qwest include a provision allowing mci to incorporate and use any interconnection,service,or network element from another agreement,upon acceptance of all of the terms and conditions in the agreement related to such interconnection service or element,and to purchase services out of an effective tariff,regardless of prices set forth in an existing agreement.mci app.at.the cpuc concluded the first portion of the provision was required by section i of the act i and fcc rule,which implemented section i.the cpuc concluded the second portion of the provision,the tariff portion was consistent with the act and qwest common carrier obligations.id.more specifically,the cpuc agreed with mci that it would be unable to fairly compete in serving if it wa s required to purchase services from qwest at unfavorable rates or on less favorable terms and conditions as compared to other providers.id.
after the cpuc issued its decision,the eighth circuit vacated fcc rule,the regulation implementing section i of the act.see iowa utilities bd.fcc,cir,aff in part,rev in part sub nom.at t iowa utilities,d.accordingly,pursuant to qwest petition for reconsideration,the cpuc modified the provision by striking all references to mci right to incorporate terms from other interconnection agreements.the cpuc subsequently approved the arbitrated interconnection agreement between mci and qwest,which included the following provision 
the provisions of section i of the act shall apply to this agreement,including state and federal interpretive regulations in effect from time to time.in the event any governmental authority or agency permits qwest,via tariff,to provide any service covered by this agreement in accordance with any terms or conditions that individually differ from one or more corresponding terms or conditions of this agreement,mci may elect to amend this agreement to reflect any such differing terms or conditions contained in such tariff,with effect from the date mci makes such election and for the remainder of the term of this agreement.the other services covered by this agreement and not covered by such decision or order shall remain unaffected and shall remain in full force and effect.notwithstanding the foregoing,mci may purchase services out of an effective tariff,regardless of prices set forth in an existing agreement.

cpuc decision regarding sprint petition 
sprint petition was addressed initially by an arbitrator.the arbitrator agreed with sprint and ordered,in pertinent part,that the interconnection agreement between sprint and qwest permit sprint to purchase services out of an effective tariff,regardless of prices set forth in the existing agreement.sprint app.at.the arbitrator concluded that this provision was consistent with the act and qwest common carrier obligations,and with other commission orders.id.more specifically,the arbitrator agree d with sprint that a clec would be unable to fairly compete in serving end users if it wa s required to purchase services from qwest at unfavorable rates or on less favorable terms and conditions as compared to other providers.id.the arbitrator decision was consistent with the cpuc decision on mci petition,which was issued approximately one week prior to the arbitrator decision.
qwest filed exceptions to the arbitrator decision,triggering review by the cpuc itself.in particular,qwest challenged the portion of the arbitrator decision requiring inclusion of the most favored nation clause.on january,the cpuc issued an order rejecting qwest exception to the most favored nation clause.id.at.in doing so,the commission concluded that the arbitrator recommended decision correctly ruled upon th e issue for the reasons stated therein.id.at.the cpuc subsequently approved the interconnection agreement between sprint and qwest,effective july.id.at.
consistent with the cpuc decision,the interconnection agreement between sprint and qwest included the following provision 
qwest shall make available any interconnection,service,or network element provided under an agreement approved under section i of the act to which it is a party to sprint upon the same terms and conditions as those provided in the agreement.individual interconnection,service,or network elements from another agreement,are available upon acceptance of all the terms and conditions in the agreement related to such interconnection,service or element.upon proof provided by qwest that sprint causes qwest to incur greater costs in the provision of the service than the current carrier agreement,sprint will accept the increased costs for the service.qwest shall also permit sprint to purchase services out of an effective tariff,regardless of prices set forth in an existing agreement.qwest shall make all agreements available for public viewing within days of approval by the commission.sprint will notify qwest of its intent to adopt the provisions of another agreement at least days prior to effectuating the change.
dist.order at citing sprint interconnection agreement,section.
district court proceedings 
qwest,acting pursuant to e,filed separate actions challenging the cpuc decisions on mci and sprint petitions.with respect to the sprint interconnection agreement,qwest initially opposed the clause in its entirety.however,following the supreme court decision in iowa utilities,qwest narrowed its challenge to only the portion of the provision affording sprint the right to purchase services out of qwest colorado tariffs qwest actions were consolidated by the district court for decision.
the district court ultimately agreed with qwest and concluded that neither the act nor the fcc rules promulgated pursuant to the act permit ted a requesting carrier to opt into tariff provisions.dist.order at.the district court further concluded that allowing mci and sprint to use a tariff to supplement or supplant any term,condition,or price that is covered by the agreement would eviscerate the provisions of and of the act which require that the parties negotiate the terms of an interconnection agreement and arbitrate those terms that they are not able to agree to.id.more specifically,the district court concluded there would be little incentive for carriers such as mci and sprint to negotiate if they could simply opt into a more favorable tariff than the state commission imposes.id.at.the court also expressed concern that permitting carriers such as mci and sprint to pick and choose from tariffs could undermine federal court review of interconnection obligations under the act.id.lastly,the court noted that if mci and sprint or other carriers wanted to have a tariff term incorporated into the ir interconnection agreements,they we re free to seek an amendment of the ir interconnection agreement s.id.at.the district court therefore vacated the pick and choose provisions of the agreements to the extent they permitted mci and sprint to purchase services at tariff rates id.
we review de novo whether the arbitrated interconnection agreements are in compliance with the act and the implementing fcc regulations.southwestern bell.brooks fiber comm.of,cir.all other issues,including state law determinations made by the cpuc,are reviewed under an arbitrary and capricious standard.id.
sprint appeal case 
the primary question we must address is whether the tariff provision violates i the fcc implementing regulation.section,as its title indicates,generally outlines the p rocedures for negotiation,arbitration,and approval of interconnection agreements.section i,entitled availability to other telecommunications carriers,provides 
a local exchange carrier shall make available any interconnection,service,or network element provided under an agreement approved under this section to which it is a party to any other requesting telecommunications carrier upon the same terms and conditions as those provided in the agreement.
i.in turn,fcc rule provides 
a an incumbent lec shall make available without unreasonable delay to any requesting telecommunications carrier any individual interconnection,service,or network element arrangement contained in any agreement to which it is a party that is approved by a state commission pursuant to section of the act,upon the same rates,terms,and conditions as those provided in the agreement.an incumbent lec may not limit the availability of any individual interconnection,service,or network element only to those requesting carriers serving a comparable class of subscribers or providing the same service,local,access,or interexchange as the original party to the agreement.
b the obligations of paragraph a of this section shall not apply where the incumbent lec proves to the states commission that 
the costs of providing a particular interconnection,service,or element to the requesting telecommunications carrier are greater than the costs of providing it to the telecommunications carrier that originally negotiated the agreement,or 
the provision of a particular interconnection,service,or element to the requesting carrier is not technically feasible.
c individual interconnection,service,or network element arrangements shall remain available for use by telecommunications carriers pursuant to this section for a reasonable period of time after the approved agreement is available for public inspection under section f of the act.
the district court concluded that i and the implementing regulation govern only a requesting carrier ability to opt into interconnection agreements entered into under the act.dist.order at.proceeding further,the district court interpreted i and the implementing regulation as precluding a state commission from allowing a clec to opt into the prices and terms set forth in an ilec published tariffs.in other words,the district court interpreted section i as governing the entire universe of provisions,and concluded that,because a tariff is not an agreement approved under section,nor part of the section negotiation and arbitration process,it violates i if a clec is allowed to opt into one or more of an ilec tariffs.id.at.
we reject the district court interpretation of i.nothing in the language of i suggests that it was intended to govern the entire universe of provisions.s
