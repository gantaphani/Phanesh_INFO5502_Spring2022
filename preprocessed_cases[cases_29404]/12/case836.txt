before us are petitions for review of two rulemaking orders of the federal communications commission.the orders changed the financial terms applicable to companies that purchased licenses to provide personal communications services pcs at an auction in which bidding was limited to small businesses and entrepreneurs.see amendment of the commission rules regarding installment payment financing for pcs licensees,second report and order and further notice of proposed rule making,wl restructuring order and amendment of the commission rules regarding installment payment financing for pcs licensees,order on reconsideration of the second report and order,wl reconsideration order.petitioners airwaves,hereinafter airwaves and sprint spectrum characterize the rules as a benefit given retroactively to incumbent licensees,to the detriment of losing bidders in the spectrum auction and of competitors in the pcs industry,and therefore as unauthorized,unreasonable,and arbitrary and capricious.intervenor nextwave,a successful bidder in the original auction,supports the new rules it also maintains that neither petitioner has standing to challenge them.
we hold that airwaves,as a disappointed bidder in the original auction,does have standing to petition for review of the new rules we therefore do not reach the question whether sprint spectrum also has standing.we hold further that,although the changes to the commission financing rules are indeed retroactive,the commission had adequate reasons for adopting them,and that it reasonably balanced competing goals and acted within its statutory authority.
background 
broadband pcs are a type of mobile telephone technology.see omnipoint fcc.in order to provide pcs a company must get from the commission a license to use a portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.in the commission decided to distribute such licenses through a system of competitive bidding,pursuant to j.see implementation of section j of the communications bidding,second report and order,wl.the commission designated a portion of the spectrum for the provision of pcs and divided that portion into six blocks,which it labeled a through f.in keeping with its statutory mandate to ensure that small businesses are given the opportunity to participate in spectrum auctions,j d,the commission limited the bidding for spectrum to entrepreneurs and small companies.see restructuring order at omnipoint,at upholding the limitation.the commission offered small businesses bidding for licenses an installment payment plan under which they could pay down and the balance over a period of ten years,with interest only paid for the first six years and interest and principal for the remaining four.restructuring order at.entrepreneurs who did not qualify as small businesses were offered less favorable payment terms.see id.at.
between may and july some different bidders bought at auction for each basic trading area bta in the use mhz of spectrum for the provision of pcs.their bids totaled billion,a figure some observers attributed to irrational exuberance on average,licensees agreed to pay nearly three times per potential customer what the winning bidders in the a and auctions had paid.see restructuring order at peter spiegel,hollow victory,forbes,at.
within nine months of the auction,it became clear that a number of high bidders might not be able to make their scheduled payments.see wireless telecommunications bureau seeks comment on broadband pcs c and f block installment payment issues,public notice,wl.in march,the commission suspended the payment obligations of all licensees pending a review of its installment payment terms.see installment payments for pcs licenses,order,wl.
in october,the commission issued the first of the two orders challenged in this case.that order ended the suspension of payments announced the previous march and offered a menu of new financing options to all licensees.see restructuring order at.upon reconsideration the commission retained the menu approach but altered several of the offerings in important particulars.see reconsideration order at.the revised scheme also permitted a licensee to select a different option for licenses it held in each major trading area mta referring to the geographic regions into which the commission has divided the long as it applied the same option to all its licenses within each mta.see reconsideration order at.upon the promulgation of the order on reconsideration,each licensee was required,in order to avoid default,to choose a menu option for each of its mtas.see id.at.
the menu offered each licensee four choices.first,the licensee could continue to make payments under the original terms of the auction.see restructuring order at.
second,the licensee could surrender all its licenses for a particular mta and receive a prepayment credit in an amount equal to of the down payments and of any installment payments it had made on those licenses,as well as forgiveness of its debt on the returned licenses.the prepayment credit would be put toward payment for such other pcs licenses as the licensee continued to hold.the licensee could either provide additional funds in order to prepay all the licenses it retained in a given mta or,were it to rely solely upon its prepayment credits,could prepay as many licenses as possible in a given mta and surrender any remaining licenses to be auctioned anew.see restructuring order at reconsideration order at.
third,the licensee could elect to disaggregate each of its licenses within a given mta,returning mhz of spectrum to the commission and retaining mhz under license.the licensee outstanding debt to the commission with respect to returned spectrum would be forgiven.the licensee would also receive a credit equal to of its down payments on the returned spectrum,which it could apply to the payments due on the retained spectrum.a licensee combining disaggregation and prepayment would receive a credit equal to of its down payment for returned spectrum,which it could use to prepay the commission either for the retained mhz of the disaggregated licenses or for other pcs licenses it retained.see restructuring order at reconsideration order.
finally,the licensee could simply surrender its licenses for a particular mta and be forgiven its outstanding debt with respect to those licenses.a licensee electing this amnesty option could either retain the right to rebid when its licenses were sold at auction again or forego the opportunity to rebid and receive a credit of of its original down payment it could apply that credit to payments due in connection with the prepayment or disaggregation of licenses that it retained in other mtas.see reconsideration order at.
the commission states that in crafting this menu of options it considered and balanced several policy goals maintaining the integrity of spectrum auctions ensuring fairness to actual and prospective licensees resolving all issues promptly and complying with its statutory mandates to p romot e economic opportunity and competition in the marketplace,and to ensure that new and innovative technologies are readily accessible to the american people by avoiding excessive concentrations of licenses and by disseminating licenses among a wide variety of applicants,including small businesses.see restructuring order at quoting j.
ii.analysis 
airwaves and sprint pcs contend that the commission changed its original auction rules arbitrarily and capriciously and without statutory authority.after analyzing the petitioners standing,we consider the commission claim that the new rules were foreshadowed in the original auction rules and therefore do not represent a significant change in policy.we then turn to the questions of arbitrariness and of statutory authority.
do petitioners have standing 
the irreducible constitutional minimum for standing in an article iii court is that the petitioner was injured in fact,that its injury was caused by the challenged conduct,and that its injury would likely be redressed by a favorable decision of the court.lujan defenders of wildlife,d.nextwave,intervening in defense of the commission,argues that airwaves lacks standing because it can demonstrate neither that it was injured in fact nor that its alleged injury is redressable.
a bidder in a government auction has a right to a legally valid procurement process a party allegedly deprived of this right asserts a cognizable injury.directv,fcc.a disappointed bidder need not demonstrate that it would be successful if the contract were let anew but only that it was able and ready to bid and that the rule prevent ed it from doing so on an equal basis.id.at quoting northeastern.chapter of contractors of america city of jacksonville,d.of course,in order to show that its injury is redressable,a disappointed bidder must demonstrate that it is ready,willing,and able to participate in a new auction should it prevail but it need not demonstrate that it will participate in such an auction regardless of the circumstances then prevailing.see orange park florida,fcc.
airwaves meets these requirements.it submitted bids in the original auction but dropped out before securing any licenses.it claims that it would have bid more had it known that financial terms more favorable than those announced at the time of the auction would later be offered to winning bidders.airwaves further affirms,in the sworn declaration of its chief executive,that it intends to bid in a future reauction of pcs spectrum and that it is able to raise the capital necessary to do so.that is sufficient.
nextwave also argues that airwaves can not base its standing upon its participation in the original auction because airwaves acknowledges that the original auction was fair airwaves challenges only the way in which the commission treated licensees after the auction was completed.in this argument,however,nextwave misapprehends airwaves claim,which is that revisions to the financing options available to the high bidders constitute impermissibly retroactive changes to the initial auction rules.there is no basis for suggesting,as nextwave seems to do,that ex post changes can never affect the validity of a government auction.
finally,nextwave argues that airwaves fails to demonstrate that its claim is redressable by this court because it does not allege that when it petitioned for review of the new rules it was ready,willing,and able to bid in a new auction.nextwave asserts that as of that date airwaves had returned all its investment capital to its investors and was not in good standing in the state of delaware because of a tax dispute,for both of which reasons it would have been unable to bid in any new auction that the commission might have conducted.nextwave premise is correct standing is determined as of the date an action is filed,see smith sperling,d but nextwave offers no persuasive reason to think either that airwaves lacked access to capital on that date or that it would not have resolved its tax dispute in delaware had that been necessary in order to bid in a new auction.in fact,the tax matter was resolved soon after the filing.absent any evidence to the contrary,airwaves assertion that it was ready,willing,and able to participate in a rerun of the auction satisfies the redressability requirement.
having determined that airwaves has standing,we do not need to reach the question whether sprint spectrum has standing as well,for sprint presents no arguments beyond those made by airwaves.see railway labor executives ass united states,i f one party has standing in an action,a court need not reach the issue of the standing of other parties when it makes no difference to the merits of the case.
is the rule retroactive 
airwaves argues that the changes in the commission auction rules give a windfall to licensees.the commission and nextwave respond that the original auction rules anticipate the possibility that the commission might revise its financing provisions,making the adoption of the new rules foreseeable.small refiner lead task force epa,holding that final administrative rules that depart from an agency initial proposals do not require new notice and comment if the final rules are a logical outgrowth of the proposals,such that the parties should have anticipated that they might be imposed.
the commission points out that the original auction rules provided that as a general rule a defaulting bidder licenses would be deemed forfeit and reauctioned,at,which reasonably can be taken to suggest that forfeiture and reauction were not to be the inevitable consequence of default.more important,the original rules specifically allowed a licensee that has defaulted or that anticipates default under an installment payment program to obtain a three to six month grace period during which to seek from the commission a restructured payment plan.id.at.in addition,the original rules provided that default would occasion a substantial penalty,implementation of section j of the communications bidding,fifth report and order,wl,and under the revised rule every licensee that fails to honor its original payment obligations forfeits at least of its down payment on all spectrum that it returns to the commission.
in some respects,however,the new rules clearly do contradict the commission previously stated policies.the initial auction rules provided that the commission would consider requests for financial restructuring on a basis.at.this certainly implied that the commission would not proceed by way of a further rulemaking and a new rule of general application,see bowen georgetown,d.the distinction is significant,for the initial auction rules made only those licensees that ha d defaulted or that anticipate d default eligible for a grace period and financial restructuring.at.the menu,in contrast,is available to all licensees regardless of their financial condition.see restructuring order at.
the new regulations therefore do not merely fill in the details of a policy foreseeable at the time of the original auction instead,they constitute a secondarily retroactive change to the rules governing that auction.see bowen,at.scalia,concurring defining secondary retroactivity as describing rule s with exclusively future effect that affect past transactions emphasis omitted.a secondarily retroactively rule is valid only to the extent that it is in substance and in being made retroactive.see id.at.it is to reasonableness that we turn next.
are the regulations reasonable 
airwaves argues that the rule is invalid for two related reasons.first,it contends that the commission failed to relate its offering of refinancing options to its own stated goals.second,it argues that regardless whether the commission embraced fairness as a goal,the rule is simply so unfair that it must be deemed arbitrary and capricious.
under the arbitrary and capricious standard,this court does not substitute its judgment for that of the administrative agency.see motor vehicle mfrs.ass of the united states state farm mut.auto.ins,d.a regulatory decision in which the commission must balance competing goals is therefore valid if the agency can show that its resolution reasonably advances at least one of those objectives and that its decisionmaking process was regular.fresno mobile radio,fcc.because airwaves does not challenge the regularity of the commission decisionmaking process,the issue now before us is whether the commission reasonably justified its regulations with reference to at least one of its avowed goals.see restructuring order at.
the menu withstands review under this standard the commission justified each of the menu options and its selection principle with reference to one or more of its stated goals.in particular,the commission justified each of its menu options as enabling c block licensees to remain participants in the wireless market,which it found would hasten the delivery of new services to the public and promote efficient use of the spectrum.reconsideration order at see restructuring order at,disaggregation id.at amnesty reconsideration order at prepayment.in addition,the commission justified the prepayment option as a way of minimizing conflicts between the agency roles as creditor and as regulator.see reconsideration order at.the commission explained disaggregation,as it did the provision for election,in par
