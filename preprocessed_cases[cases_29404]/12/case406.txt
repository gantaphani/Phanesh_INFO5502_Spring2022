this case presents the question of whether telephone calls to cell phones within the same locale are treated as local calls or calls by the fcc.the district court reviewing a decision of the missouri public service commission,held that the plain language of the fcc regulation required such calls to be treated as local calls,even when such calls were routed through a provider.the result of that conclusion is that the local telephone company and the provider must share reciprocal compensation for such calls,alma communications missouri pub.serv,wl.may.alma communications company and several other local telephone companies from rural missouri whom we will refer to collectively as alma for simplicity sake,contend that such calls should be treated as calls if they are routed through a carrier.we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background.
we borrow heavily from the background supplied by the district court,which took the alphabet soup served up by the parties and rendered it into serviceable english.the legal landscape of this case is the bifurcated system for allocating costs between telephone service providers this controversy,as others we have entertained,arises because providers do not fit neatly into the bifurcated system.see rural iowa indep.ass iowa util,cir iowa network,qwest,cir iowa network services i.
alma is a local exchange carrier or lec,in other words,a local telephone company providing traditional phone services.local exchange carriers usually serve a small local service area covering a few local exchanges exchanges being designated by the first three numbers of a phone number.more specifically,alma is a rural incumbent local exchange carrier.incumbent means that it was the telephone company in possession of its area at the time that the telecommunications act of opened up local service to competition.
before the telecommunications act of,all customers in a local exchange carrier geographical area would be serviced by one local exchange carrier,which connected the caller and recipient of a local call.the act opened local service areas up to competition,so that different carriers might serve caller and recipient even in the same exchange area.iowa network services i,at.calls placed and received within a local service area are local calls,as opposed to toll or calls.id.at.local exchange carriers serving the same area may have a direct connection with each other,which means that there is an actual physical point of interconnection between the carriers networks wwc license,llc boyle,cir distinguishing direct from indirect connections.when two local exchange carriers are involved in a local call,both incur costs for the call,since the caller carrier has to originate the call,but the receiver carrier has to transport the call from the point of that carrier connection with the originating carrier network and to terminate the call the carrier for the party originating the call is compensated by its customer,the caller.atlas.oklahoma.comm n,cir.
in the act,congress required the carriers to enter into reciprocal compensation arrangements,whereby the carrier for the caller would compensate the recipient carrier for its costs in transporting and terminating local calls.see b enumerating duties of local exchange carriers,including t he duty to establish reciprocal compensation arrangements for the transport and termination of telecommunications.
when a customer calls a number outside of the local service area,there may be no direct connection between the local exchange carriers involved.in that case,the call does not go directly from one local exchange carrier to the other,but is routed through an intermediary carrier known as an interexchange carrier or ixc.the customer chooses a carrier and pays it for service.however,the carrier can not complete the calls by itself.a local exchange carrier has to originate the call and another one has to terminate it.the provider pays the local exchange carriers access compensation for their services in connecting the call.
the distinction between local calls funded by reciprocal compensation and funded by access compensation becomes less clear when one of the parties to the call is using a cell phone instead of a land line.service is provided by a commercial mobile radio service,instead of a local exchange carrier rather than the local service area that defines the boundaries for local calls on land lines,a major trading area,which is a larger area,defines which calls are local.iowa network servs.i,at citing b rural iowa indep.ass n,at.
when the local exchange carrier and the provider networks are connected directly,then the costs are handled by a reciprocal compensation agreement between the local exchange company and the wireless company,just as if the call were a traditional local call.on the other hand,if the customer calls a customer situated outside the major trading area,the call will be routed through a carrier and the costs will be covered by access compensation.
however,when the provider chooses not to connect directly with the local exchange carrier network,even a call from the same major trading for that matter,even a call from the same local service area,has to go through an intermediary.the provider is thus indirectly interconnected with the local exchange carrier network.the intermediary carrier does not have to be a carrier,however,since large local exchange carriers,such as southwestern bell telephone,can act as transiting carriers.in fact,companies usually do not choose to connect directly with rural local exchange carriers,because the volume of business does not make it economically advantageous for the company to do so.the question in this case is whether the compensation model for such calls should be governed by the fact that both parties to the call are situated within the same major trading area or whether it should be governed by the fact that the call was routed through a carrier.
this litigation.
is a company which does not have a direct connection to alma networks,having chosen instead to directly interconnect with southwestern bell telephone,a large incumbent local exchange carrier,in kansas city.southwestern bell is directly connected with alma.when a call is placed from cell phones to one of alma customers,connects the call either through southwestern bell,which acts as a transiting carrier,or through a carrier in either case,pays the intermediary carrier.when the to traffic is carried through a transiting carrier,pays alma reciprocal compensation.when the to traffic goes through an interexchange carrier,pays the interexchange carrier both for the interexchange carrier services and for the fee the terminating local exchange carrier charges to deliver the call.
the dispute in this case concerns calls going in the other direction,from a land line to a cell phone.for what alma calls historical and regulatory reasons,alma does not send any of its calls to through a transiting carrier,but instead sends all traffic bound for through a carrier.even calls to a phone that originate and terminate within alma local service area are routed through a carrier,with the result that alma customers have to dial to reach even a customer next door.
alma insists that it has no choice but to send calls through a carrier and that those calls are therefore inherently in nature.alma introduced evidence before the arbitrator that it would be legally and technically problematic and a major change from how such calls are currently handled in missouri for alma to deliver such calls without going through an interexchange carrier.introduced evidence before the arbitrator that it would be possible for the local exchange carriers to route calls to without sending it to a provider alma witnesses testified that the companies ought to eliminate the problem by negotiating an interconnection agreement with us and getting local numbers.answers that it would be economically wasteful for each carrier to connect directly to each rural exchange moreover,there was testimony that even if were to establish a direct connection with the respective local exchange carriers,the local exchange carriers would on
