this case involves phone calls made with two kinds of prepaid calling cards.the first kind uses internet protocol ip technology to transport part or all of a telephone call cards.the second offers a interface through which users can either make a call or access several types of information cards.in the order under review the federal communications commission determined that both types of cards offer telecommunications services and that providers of those cards are therefore subject to access charges,universal service fund contributions,and other obligations under the communications act.in the matter of regulation of prepaid calling card services,fcc rcd order.
these consolidated petitions for review do not challenge the substantive merits of that decision.rather,they attack the commission decisions as to the retroactivity of its substantive interpretation of the statute.ibasis contests the decision to make the order retroactive as to cards,and qwest contests the decision to make it as to cards.
we find no manifest injustice in applying the order retroactively to cards and thus deny ibasis petition for review.but we can discern nothing in the record that justifies the commission decision to foreclose retroactive application of the order statutory interpretation to cards in the calculation of a provider liability for access charges.accordingly,we grant qwest petition for review and vacate the order insofar as it purports to bar such an application.
under the communications act of,as amended by the telecommunications act of,providers of telecommunications services are regulated as common carriers,but providers of information services are not,cable telecomm.ass brand x internet,d see also brand x,at.describing the historical basis for that distinction.in,at t petitioned the commission for a declaratory ruling that its enhanced prepaid calling by the addition of an advertising message from the card jurisdictionally interstate and provided information services.see am.fcc,at t.while that petition was still pending,at t alerted the commission that it had developed cards and was considering the transport of calls via prepaid calling cards using ip technology.letter from judy sello,senior attorney,at t,to marlene dortch,secretary,fcc.at t amended its petition to add a request for a declaratory ruling that these new variations on its prepaid calling cards would be treated as interstate information services.id.
on february,the commission released an order and notice of proposed rulemaking in response to at t petition.at t.petition for declaratory ruling regarding enhanced prepaid calling card services,fcc rcd prepaid card order or nprm.as to the enhanced prepaid cards described in at t original petition,the commission determined that those cards offered telecommunications information that the calls made with them are intrastate when they originate and end in the same state,regardless of a call actual route.id.at,see also at t,at.the commission declined,however,to extend its declaratory ruling to and cards it stated that r ather than try to address each possible type of calling card offering through a declaratory ruling,the commission was initiating a rulemaking to consider the classification and jurisdiction of new forms of prepaid calling cards.id.at.opening a new docket for that proceeding,the commission requested comment on the proper classification of and cards.id.at.
the commission released the order at issue here on june.in a part of that order that it labeled a declaratory ruling,the commission announced that and cards are telecommunications services and that their providers are subject to regulation as telecommunications carriers,fcc rcd at,and thus subject to the obligation to pay access charges to local exchange carriers,id.at.it also indicated that jurisdiction over calls would be governed by the traditional analysis,meaning that calls made with prepaid cards that originate and end in the same state are intrastate,regardless of a call actual route.id.at,see also prepaid card order,fcc rcd at.both aspects of the substantive requirements that and card providers pay access charges and that they pay the generally higher intrastate access charges for those calls when thus against ibasis interests as a provider of cards and in favor of qwest interests as a local exchange carrier of calls made by both types of cards.
turning to the issue of remedy,the commission said that a declaratory ruling was,notwithstanding the proceedings launch as a rulemaking,a form of adjudication and recognized that g enerally,adjudicatory decisions are applied retroactively.id.at.the commission decided that it would apply that general rule to cards but would decline to give retroactive effect to our ruling on cards to avoid a manifest injustice.id.at.ibasis and qwest both take issue with the retroactivity rulings,which in each case are adverse to their respective interests.they filed petitions for review at t and verizon intervened in opposition to qwest.we consolidated the petitions.
ibasis argues that the order announces a rule rather than an adjudicatory order,and thus that it can not apply retroactively,citing bowen georgetown university hospital,d.in the alternative,ibasis argues that even if the order was an adjudication,its retroactive application to cards used before the commission announced its decision works a manifest injustice.we reject both contentions.
the section of the order that classifies and cards as telecommunications services is labeled a declaratory ruling.the commission is authorized to issue a declaratory ruling to terminate a controversy or remove uncertainty,e see also,and there is no question that a declaratory ruling can be a form of adjudication,see,at t,at.ibasis argues the commission characterization of its order did not qualify as an adjudication because the commission initial pronouncement purporting to start a rulemaking,the process it employed,and the result it reached all bespeak a rulemaking.ibasis argument,then,is that if it walks like a rule and talks like a rule,it must be a rule.
ibasis is clearly correct that the process started out as a rulemaking and in part preserved that form.but the commission indisputably split the proceeding into a dual one,half rulemaking and half adjudication,or at least purported to do so.ibasis appears to assume that such a split is inherently improper.but it points to no case and to nothing in the administrative procedure act or communications act that bars such a bifurcation.obviously if a party adversely affected by the adjudication argued that the switch deprived it of any right to which it would be entitled in an adjudication,we would have to assess that deprivation under conventional principles governing adjudications.but ibasis opening brief,except for the circular argument that the switch triggered a traditional characteristic of adjudication the possibility of retroactive application,pointed to no such deprivation.
in its reply brief ibasis finally identified a possible deprivation the nprm failure to provide interested parties with notice that there was a risk of retroactive effect.properly raised,this would be an extremely serious claim against the commission curious way of doing business.but we ordinarily do not consider claims raised for the first time in a reply brief,carter george washington,and we note here that even ibasis reply brief fails to point to any fact or argument that it might have adduced materially beyond what the commission actually discussed.for reasons unknown to us,other participants in the proceedings filed materials on whether commission action should have retrospective effect.see joint appendix sprint,verizon,at t,verizon,verizon,at t.
ibasis also argues that such a broadly applicable order as in fact came the classification of all and only take the form of a rule,and thus must be prospective only.there is no such general principle.most norms that emerge from a rulemaking are equally capable of emerging legitimately from an adjudication,nlrb bell aerospace,d,and accordingly agencies have very broad discretion whether to proceed by way of adjudication or rulemakin
