morris communications,morris,a mobile,paging and communications service provider,appeals the federal communications commission fcc or commission order denying its requests to waive the automatic cancellation of its nine specialized mobile radio smr licenses.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the commission order.
on april,the fcc notified morris that it had successfully bid for nine mhz smr licenses covering certain areas in the southeast united states.fcc announces winning bidders in the auction of,licenses to provide mhz smr in major trading areas.morris chose to pay its winning bids in quarterly installments,which made the licenses conditioned upon the full and timely performance of morris payment obligations under the installment plan.d.indeed,morris licenses expressly stated that authorization is conditioned upon the full and timely payment of all moneys due pursuant to sections and of the commission rules and the terms of the commission installment plan failure to comply with this condition will result in the automatic cancellation of this authorization.morris commc ns,license at.
for five years morris made the quarterly payments either on time or within the two consecutive automatic grace periods authorized by g on july,however,morris failed to make the installment payment on each of its nine licenses.it also failed to make payment plus late fees by the end of the two grace periods,that is,january.earlier in january,the fcc began outsourcing its loan servicing to a private vendor,colson services corporation colson.colson had notified morris by letter in early january that it was taking over the fcc loan servicing and that morris was to send all payments to colson.it enclosed a form that required morris to designate an employee responsible for bill handling.morris returned the form,designating its controller as the responsible employee.colson sent the january,installment payment notices to morris but without addressing them to the controller and the notices did not reach morris controller until february,days after the payments were due.morris remitted the full amount owed to the fcc on february.
on april,the fcc notified morris that an event of default ha d occurred,that the license s automatically cancelled by operation of the rules and that the commission wa s commencing debt collection procedures.letter from mark reger,cfo,fcc,to morris communications,at.the letter further noted that all of morris obligations ha d been accelerated.id.at.on may,morris requested a waiver from the automatic cancellation rule.in its request,morris explained the circumstances leading up to its late february,installment payments and asked the commission to review its request as expeditiously as possible.letter from frederick joyce and marianne roach casserly,attorneys,alston bird llp,to mark reger,cfo,fcc,at may,waiver request.on may,morris again wrote to the commission,request ing that the commission stay the effectiveness of the decisions set forth in the commission letters dated april.letter from frederick joyce and marianne roach casserly,attorneys,alston bird llp,to mark reger,cfo,fcc,at may,request for stay.
the fcc responded on may,acknowledging receipt of the waiver request and informing morris that w ithin days of this letter we will mail you either a resolution to your item or a letter telling you when you can expect a resolution.letter from mark reger,cfo,fcc to frederick joyce and marianne roach casserly,attorneys,alston bird llp,at may.thirty days came and went,however,and morris heard nothing from the commission.more time elapsed and,even after morris repeated telephone calls and written inquiries,the commission did not respond.morris continued to make timely payments on its nine licenses until october.at that point,morris stopped making payments on seven of the nine licenses.
not having received any reply from the fcc by december,morris then began construction on the two smr stations on whose licenses it had continued making payments and notified the fcc of the stations construction letter from frederick joyce and ronald quirk,attorneys,alston bird llp,to william kunze,chief,commercial wireless division,wireless telecommunications bureau,fcc.morris also the fcc corresponding notifications of buildout.see d buildout notification required within days of end of construction period.
on january,morris filed another waiver request with the fcc.in it,morris asked the fcc for a extension of time,up to and including december,to fully construct a digital mhz smr system in all its authorized major trading areas,a waiver of section e of the commission rules,which states that requests for extension of time to construct must be filed before the expiration of the construction of coverage period,and a forbearance of its installment payment obligations on each of its nine licenses.morris commc ns,petition for rule waiver at.in support of its request,morris noted the unique and unusual regulatory uncertainty surrounding its licenses and the fact that demand for mhz smr services in the vast majority of these predominantly rural markets simply has not occurred.id.at.
on april,after almost three years of nothing but silence from the commission,the auctions and spectrum access division division finally denied both of morris waiver requests noting that morris ha d failed to demonstrate that the underlying purpose of the commission payment rule would not be served,or would be frustrated,by its application in this particular case.ronald quirk.the division also noted that morris acknowledges that it is facing financial difficulties and that it can not continue to make its installment payments for these licenses.id.at.morris thereafter stopped making installment payments on its remaining two licenses.
on may,morris appealed the division decision to the full commission.in its application for review,morris argued,inter alia,that the division ignored fcc precedent in denying morris waiver requests,was equitably estopped from revoking morris licenses,did not provide a reasoned explanation for its action and denied morris procedural due process.while review was pending,morris offered to negotiate a settlement agreement with the fcc whereby it could retain its nine licenses,fulfill its payment obligations for each license within one year and continue to make its installment payments for each of the licenses until paid in full.the commission eventually rejected the offer.
in morris asked the commission for special temporary authority sta to operate its two constructed smr stations for a period of days or until the fcc issued a decision,whichever occurred first.the commission granted the sta for both stations on december.on june,morris requested an extension of the sta for an additional period,which request the fcc appears to have granted.
on february,almost three years after morris petitioned for review,the commission issued its decision denying morris application for review.morris commc ns.the commission determined that morris ha d failed to show that,by denying its waiver requests,the division treated it differently than similarly situated entities and the division denial was therefore not an abuse of discretion.id.at.the fcc stated that the commission has explained unequivocally that,because parties remain obligated for the full amount of their debt following their default on installment payments,the commission acceptance of a payment after such a default does not,by itself,constitute a constructive waiver of the automatic cancellation rule or revive an automatically canceled license.id.at.moreover,the commission noted that t he division correctly found morris assertion that it was uncertain as to the exact amount owed,and that it received its payment notice late,insufficient by itself to justify a waiver of the installment payment rules because fcc precedent makes clear that it is the licensee responsibility to know the amounts and due dates of its installment payments.id.at.regarding morris claim of equitable estoppel,the commission concluded that it ha d done nothing,by either act or omission,that would have led morris to believe that the licenses had not
