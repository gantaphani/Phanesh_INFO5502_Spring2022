verizon petitions for review of a federal communications commission fcc order denying verizon petitions for forbearance from its unbundling obligations under of the communications act.verizon contends that the fcc erroneously denied verizon petition for forbearance from local exchange unbundling regulations by unlawfully departing from the legal standards and analyses in its prior forbearance orders.specifically,verizon asserts that the fcc order should be vacated because it relied on a newly minted market share test to determine whether the retail market in six metropolitan statistical areas msas was sufficiently competitive to warrant forbearance from unbundling requirements.we agree that this test departs from fcc precedent by relying solely on actual,and not potential,marketplace competition.the fcc unexplained departure from its precedent was in error.accordingly,we grant verizon petition on this limited ground and remand for further consideration.
background 
congress enacted the telecommunications act of,stat.the act,in the hopes of uprooting the monopolies that had,up until that point,controlled the local telephone markets,and fostering greater competition within each local service area.verizon commnc ns fcc,d.to accomplish these goals,the act gives the fcc broad power to require an incumbent local exchange carrier ilec to provide its competitors clecs with access to elements of the ilec network on an unbundled basis.see c.in determining which unbundled network elements unes the ilec must make available to clecs in a particular market,the fcc must consider at a minimum whether the clec ability to compete would be impaired without access to those unes.see d 
the fcc has been through numerous attempts at defining what constitutes impairment under the act.see covad commc ns fcc.in,shortly after the act passed into law,the fcc concluded that a clec was entitled to a particular une if the quality of the service the entrant can offer,absent access to the requested element,declines the cost of providing the service rises.in the matter of implementation of the local competition provisions in the telecommunications act of,first report and order.in at t iowa utilities board,d,the supreme court found this interpretation of impairment unreasonable.the court construed the statute to apply a limiting standard in assessing which cost differentials would impair a clec ability to compete.id.at.
on remand,the fcc determined that a clec ability to compete is impaired if,taking into consideration the availability of alternative elements outside the incumbent network,including by a requesting carrier or acquiring an alternative from a supplier,lack of access to that element materially diminishes a requesting carrier ability to provide the services it seeks to offer.in the matter of implementation of the local competition provisions of the telecommunications act of,third report and order and fourth further notice of proposed rulemaking une remand order.on review of the une remand order,we held that the commission broad concept of impairment was in error because it failed to properly balance the costs and benefits of unbundling.telecom ass fcc usta i.in usta i,we also instructed the fcc to make more nuanced impairment determinations.id.at.
on remand from usta i,the commission found that a requesting carrier ability to compete would 
be impaired when lack of access to an incumbent lec network element poses a barrier or barriers to entry,including operational and economic barriers,that are likely to make entry into a market uneconomic.that is,we ask whether all potential revenues from entering a market exceed the costs of entry,taking into consideration any countervailing advantages that a new entrant may have.in the matter of review of the section unbundling obligations of incumbent local exchange carriers,report and order and order on remand and further notice of proposed rulemaking triennial review order.on remand,the fcc made an absolute national impairment finding,subject to specific findings of by state public utility commissions.id.at.
on review of the triennial review order,we concluded that the fcc touchstone of impairment uneconomic excessively vague.telecom ass fcc usta ii.we also held that the fcc could not lawfully implement a more nuanced impairment standard by adopting a blanket finding of impairment and then delegating power to state regulatory commissions to make exceptions to the fcc nationwide rule.id.at.instead,we held that the fcc must establish unbundling criteria that take into account relevant market characteristics which capture significant variation,id.at,sensibly define the relevant markets,id.at,connect those markets to the fcc impairment findings,id.at,and consider whether the element in question is significantly deployed on a competitive basis,id.at quotation omitted.
after usta ii,the fcc modified its standards for determining impairment in the triennial review remand order and applied those revised standards to create a revised list of network elements that must be provided as unes.see in the matter of unbundled access to network elements trro.as the fcc set forth in the trro,an ilec must unbundle its network elements only where the fcc find s that carriers genuinely are impaired without access to particular network elements and where unbundling does not frustrate sustainable,competition.id.at.in the trro,the fcc declined to order unbundling of network elements on a nationwide basis in the mobile wireless and long distance services markets because those markets were sufficiently competitive.id.at.the fcc found that it was not appropriate to render similar judgments regarding the local telephone exchange and exchange access service markets.id.at.nevertheless,the fcc did note that ilecs remain free to seek forbearance under of the act from the application of unbundling rules in specific geographic markets where they believe the aims of c have been fully implemented and the other requirements for forbearance have been met.id.at.under a of the act,the fcc may grant a forbearance petition only if it determines that enforcement of the requirement is not needed to ensure that rates are just,reasonable,and that the regulation is not necessary to protect consumers and that a grant of forbearance is consistent with the public interest.a.
since the trro,the fcc has reviewed and issued orders on two such petitions for forbearance of unbundling rules.see in the matter of petition of qwest corporation for forbearance pursuant to c in the omaha metropolitan statistical area omaha order,in the matter of petition of acs of anchorage.pursuant to section of the communications act of,as amended,for forbearance from sections c and d in the anchorage study area anchorage order.in the omaha order,qwest sought,as verizon does here,forbearance from unbundling requirements and dominant carrier regulations.omaha order,at.the fcc granted qwest petition for forbearance in nine of the wire centers in the omaha msa.in doing so,the fcc expressly stated that it would not apply the c impairment standard in determining whether to grant forbearance under,as those standards were distinct.see id.at.the fcc instead stated it would look solely to the criteria of in determining whether to grant forbearance.id.at.
the fcc first assessed the level of retail competition and the role of the wholesale market.this factor,the fcc stated,was the m ost important factor in its forbearance analysis.id.at.the fcc determined that,across the entire omaha msa,cox communications the clec had developed sufficient competition and proved itself capable of competing very successfully using its own network.id.at.the fcc also found the omaha wholesale market to be sufficiently competitive.id.at.having considered the level of competition in the omaha msa,the fcc then determined the extent of cox competitive facilities coverage.the fcc found forbearance was warranted in the nine wire centers where cox cable plant covers at least redacted percent of the end user locations that are accessible from that wire center.id.at.still,the fcc denied qwest petition for forbearance in the remaining fifteen omaha wire centers where competition was not as extensive as it was in the nine wire centers where forbearance was granted.id.at.
in january,acs of anchorage filed a similar petition to qwest petition in the omaha msa,seeking forbearance from its unbundling obligations in eleven wire centers in the anchorage,alaska msa.as it had done in the omaha order,the fcc stated that its sole task was to determine whether to forbear under the standard of section.anchorage order,at.the fcc further stated that this order would not determine whether acs competitors had prove n impairment without access to unes under.id.at quotation omitted.accordingly,the fcc stated in no uncertain terms that we do comprehensive proclamations in this proceeding regarding status in the anchorage study area.id.at.the fcc then proceeded to analyze whether forbearance was warranted,and applied the same test that it had applied in the omaha order.see id.at.applying the first step of the test,the fcc concluded that r etail competition in the anchorage study area is robust.id.at.the fcc then assessed whether acs chief competitor facilities covered a sufficient portion of each wire center.the fcc determined consistently that forbearance was warranted only in the five wire centers in which acs competitors had at least redacted percent coverage of the end user locations.id.at.
on september,verizon filed the present petitions for forbearance from section c loop and transport unbundling requirements in six metropolitan statistical areas msas boston,new york,philadelphia,pittsburgh,providence,and virginia beach.in an order issued december,the fcc denied verizon petitions.in the matter of petitions of the verizon telephone companies for forbearance pursuant to c in the boston,new york,philadelphia,pittsburgh,providence and virginia beach metropolitan statistical areas,memorandum opinion and order order.the fcc found that each element of a was not satisfied because there was insufficient evidence of competition.id.at id.at there is insufficient evidence of competition for us to determine that consumers will be protected if we forbear id.concluding that forbearing from une obligations is not in the public interest under a because there was insufficient evidence of competition to determine that consumers would be protected under a.in reaching this decision,the fcc relied heavily on the fact that record evidence showed that verizon still had greater than a redacted percent share of the retail market in each of the six msas.the fcc also found that the record evidence showed that most of verizon competitors relied in substantial part on verizon own facilities,including those unbundled network elements that verizon did not want to unbundle.an examination of the wholesale market did not alter the fcc analysis.the fcc noted that the evidence showed that verizon competitors had deployed facilities that meet the redacted percent coverage threshold in certain wire centers in each of the six msas.nevertheless,the fcc held that it had not granted forbearance simply on the basis of facilities coverage in the omaha order and anchorage order,and would not do so here.the fcc stated that the m ost important factor in its forbearance analysis was evidence of successful competition.id.at.
ii.analysis 
verizon first argues that the test applied by the fcc was improper because it is based primarily on an analysis of market share.this,verizon argues,contravenes of the act because,under that section,ilecs must offer access to network elements at low une rates only when the fcc finds that the failure to provide access to such network elements would impair the ability of the telecommunications carrier seeking access to provide service.d b.building on the phrase impair the ability in,verizon argues that unbundling is appropriate only if clecs lack the ability to compete using their own facilities.where a clec has the ability to is,where competition is possible,usta ii,at fcc can not mandate unbundling under.therefore,verizon reasons,when it has shown that the clecs in the six msas are at least capable of competing,the fcc may not mandate unbundling.
before turning to the merits,it is worth emphasizing what is not at issue in this appeal.we do not consider whether forecloses the fcc from mandating unbundling when competition is possible.that issue is best addressed by a petition for a new rulemaking requesting that the fcc reassess its unbundling requirements under.verizon did not file such a petition in this case.rather,verizon merely sought forbearance under from these unbundling requirements in six msas across the country.the ruling under review in this case is the fcc denial of verizon petitions for forbearance.see order.the dispute before this court therefore concerns whether the statutory text of the fcc interpretation.we hold that it does not.
verizon argument fails because it unnecessarily conflates the fcc impairment standard with the forbearance standard under.as we have noted previously,the plain language of imposes no particular mode of market analysis or level of geographic rigor.earthlink,at citing a.section does not ask the fcc to reconsider its decision in the trro that unbundling is still required in the local services market because clecs abilities to compete are impaired.rather,as applied to the dispute in this case,the language of the section contemplates that the fcc will evaluate whether enforcement of unbundling requirements in the local services market is not needed to ensure that rates are just,reasonable and enforcement is not necessary to protect consumers and a grant of forbearance is consistent with the public interest.a.in both the omaha order and anchorage order,the fcc consistently noted that its analyses under and were wholly distinct,and that the fcc was only assessing whether forbearance was warranted under.see,anchorage order,at rejecting ilec argument that the fcc should determine impairment under instead of whether forbearance was warranted under id.at noting that the standards used in impairment analysis are distinct from forbearance analysis and that does not bind the commission forbearance review.omaha order,at rejecting commenters proposals that the fcc interpret and apply the section c impairment standard in its forbearance analysis id.at noting that neither section nor the commission precedent directs the fcc to whether a rule carries out the goals of a prior rulemaking.similarly,in the order,the fcc conducted a complete forbearance analysis under without reassessing its impairment determination under.see order,at.we therefore are persuaded that the fcc decision to refuse to interpret and apply its impairment standard in its analysis of verizon petition for forbearance under was reasonable.
we must also ensure that the fcc interpretation is not arbitrary and capricious under the administrative procedure act.see a.to survive review under this standard,the fcc must examine and consider the relevant data and factors,and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.motor vehicle mfrs.ass n,state farm mut.auto.ins,d quotation omitted see also earthlink,at.if the fcc changes course,it must supply a reasoned analysis establishing that prior policies and standards are being deliberately changed.motor vehicle mfrs.ass n,at.quotation omitted see also.valley improvement ferc,a n agency acts arbitrarily and capriciously when it abruptly departs from a position it previously held without satisfactorily explaining its reason for doing so.
on review of verizon petitions for forbearance,the fcc determined that it was not required to grant forbearance because verizon had not shown that the six msas were sufficiently competitive to warrant such relief.in reaching this decision,the fcc stated that it was most concerned with determining whether verizon had shown that clecs had been successful in their competitive efforts.see order,at.the fcc did not appear concerned with whether clecs had shown the capability for potential competition.see id.at.instead,the fcc applied a market approach that it u
