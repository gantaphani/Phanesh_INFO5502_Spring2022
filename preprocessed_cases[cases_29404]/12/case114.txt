omnipoint is a wireless cell phone provider licensed by the federal communications commission fcc.in an effort to close a coverage gap,omnipoint decided to build a telecommunications tower in white plains,new york.imitation branches would be affixed to the cylindrical tower in order to dress it up as an evergreen tree.
on october,omnipoint signed an agreement with fenway golf club fenway,located on the border of white plains and the village of scarsdale,to lease a site for the tower.the agreement afforded omnipoint an option period of two years to obtain government approval for the proposed tower,failing which fenway had a unilateral right to terminate.
in june,omnipoint fenway a special permit from the board.at the public hearings,there was little question that there is a gap in omnipoint coverage the controversy was over the proposed solution.omnipoint reassured the board that the proposed tower would have minimal visual impact on the community because a tower disguised as a tree would blend in,camouflaged by the local mature and deciduous tree line.omnipoint commc ns,d at.an omnipoint expert did a study,parking a crane at the proposed site,and touring the public roads of the neighborhood to ascertain whether and where the crane was visible.the study concluded that,except for a single property,the crane would be invisible or unnoticeable outside the golf course.illustrative photographs were taken from the public streets.as the board pointedly noted,however,residents were not invited to participate in the study,or notified of it.
public hearings continued monthly from july through march.throughout,neighbors argued that the tower would be an eyesore.nearby temple kol ami contended that the tower would cause parents to withdraw their students from its nursery school,and would impair the view from its chapel.the neighbors expert testified that a tower can not effectively be disguised as an evergreen in a neighborhood where the tallest evergreen is just feet high.according to other testimony credited by the board,the tower would be at least feet taller than the tallest deciduous trees in the landscape.other experts testified on the neighbors behalf regarding the anticipated diminution in property values.
the board announced its intention to deny omnipoint application at the january meeting,and formally denied the application in a resolution adopted at the meeting in march.see infra.within weeks,omnipoint sued,alleging that the board violated the tca and new york civil practice laws and rules article,and seeking damages pursuant to.
day before the october,expiration of the option executed a formal agreement with residents,whereby fenway agreed not to allow the construction of cell towers in exchange for the residents acquiescence in fenway contested proposal for a maintenance facility.the next day,fenway terminated the omnipoint agreement.less than two months later,on december,fenway maintenance facility application was approved by the board.
in december,the district court decided the parties summary judgment motions.omnipoint commc ns,d.on omnipoint motion for summary judgment on count i,the district court ruled that the board decision was unsupported by substantial evidence,id.at,a ruling we now reverse.the district court other rulings on the other claims are not at issue on appeal 
magistrate judge yanthis conducted a damages trial on the substantial evidence claim,and in february directed entry of judgment in the amount of,consisting of damages for costs incurred during the zoning process,damages for lost revenue,damages for the expense of locating an alternative site,and in attorneys fees.
we review the district court summary judgment decision de novo,see young county of fulton,cir,and the board decision for substantial evidence,see c b iii any decision by a state or local government or instrumentality thereof to deny a request to place,construct,or modify personal wireless service facilities shall be in writing and supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record.the latter is a deferential standard,and courts may neither engage in their own nor supplant the board reasonable determinations substantial evidence,in the usual context,has been construed to mean less than a preponderance,but more than a scintilla of evidence.cellular.town of oyster bay,cir internal citation omitted.substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.id.citation omitted.
the board resolution focused on three considerations adverse visual impact diminution of property values and lack of public necessity.
as omnipoint concedes,aesthetics is a permissible ground for denial of a permit under the tca.see town of oyster bay,at in new york,aesthetics can be a valid ground for local zoning decisions.
given the tower would rise to three times the height of the tallest evergreen tree and would be half again as tall as any other tree in the area,the board could reasonably conclude especially given express testimony to that effect that the tower would be widely visible.in addition,the board received substantial evidence of the tower adverse aesthetic impact.we have no difficulty concluding that the board rejection was based on reasonable and substantial evidence.
omnipoint argues,however,that the board erroneously focused on the statements by agitated neighbors and their expert,rather than on the testimony of omnipoint expert and her visual impact study.we disagree.
first,the board was free to discount omnipoint study because it was conducted in a defective manner.the study concluded that the tower would be visible from only one property outside the golf course.however,because the study was conducted without notice to the board or community,the observation points upon which its conclusion was based were limited to locations accessible to the public no observatio
