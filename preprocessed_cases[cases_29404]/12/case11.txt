in the first amendment context,a law may be invalidated as overbroad if a substantial number of its applications are unconstitutional,judged in relation to the statute plainly legitimate sweep.washington state grange washington state republican party.stevens claims that common depictions of ordinary and lawful activities constitute the vast majority of materials subject to.the government does not defend such applications,but contends that the statute is narrowly limited to specific types of extreme material.section constitutionality thus turns on how broadly it is construed.
section creates a criminal prohibition of alarming breadth.the statute definition of a depiction of animal cruelty does not even require that the depicted conduct be cruel.while the words maimed,mutilated,and tortured convey cruelty,wounded and killed do not.those words have little ambiguity and should be read according to their ordinary meaning.section does require that the depicted conduct be illegal,but many federal and state laws concerning the proper treatment of animals are not designed to guard against animal cruelty.for example,endangered species protections restrict even the humane wounding or killing of animals.the statute draws no distinction based on the reason the conduct is made illegal.
moreover,applies to any depiction of conduct that is illegal in the state in which the depiction is created,sold,or possessed,regardless of whether the wounding or killing took place there,c.depictions of entirely lawful conduct may run afoul of the ban if those depictions later find their way into states where the same conduct is unlawful.this greatly expands scope,because views about animal cruelty and regulations having no connection to cruelty vary widely from place to place.hunting is unlawful in the district of columbia,for example,but there is an enormous national market for depictions,greatly exceeding the demand for crush videos or animal fighting depictions.because the statute allows each jurisdiction to export its laws to the rest of the country,a applies to any magazine or video depicting lawful hunting that is sold in the nation capital.those seeking to comply with the law face a bewildering maze of regulations from at least separate jurisdictions.
limiting reach to crush videos and depictions of animal fighting or other extreme cruelty,as the government suggests,requires an unrealistically broad reading of the statute exceptions clause.the statute only exempts material with serious value,and serious must be taken seriously.the excepted speech must also fall within one of b enumerated categories.much speech does not.for example,most hunting depictions are not obviously instructional in nature.the exceptions clause simply has no adequate reading that results in the statute banning only the depictions the government would like to ban.
although the language of b is drawn from the court decision in miller california,the exceptions clause does not answer every first amendment objection.under miller,serious value shields depictions of sex from regulation as obscenity.but miller did not determine that serious value could be used as a general precondition to protecting other types of speech in the first place.even wholly neutral futilities come under the protection of free speech.cohen california.the first amendment presumptively extends to many forms of speech that do not qualify for b exception,but nonetheless fall within c broad reach.
despite the government assurance that it will apply to reach only extreme cruelty,this court will not uphold an unconstitutional statute merely because the government promises to use it responsibly.nor can the court construe this statutory language to avoid constitutional doubt.a limiting construction can be imposed only if the statute is readily susceptible to such a construction,reno american civil liberties union.to read as the government desires requires rewriting,not just reinterpretation.
this construction of decides the constitutional question.the government makes no effort to defend as applied beyond crush videos and depictions of animal fighting.it argues that those particular depictions are intrinsically related to criminal conduct or are analogous to obscenity if not themselves obscene,and that the ban on such speech would satisfy the proper level of scrutiny.but the government nowhere extends these arguments to other depictions,such as hunting magazines and videos,that are presumptively protected by the first amendment but that remain subject to.nor does the government seriously contest that these presumptively impermissible applications of far outnumber any permissible ones.the court therefore does not decide whether a statute limited to crush videos or other depictions of extreme animal cruelty would be constitutional.section is not so limited but is instead substantially overbroad,and therefore invalid under the first amendment.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit 
chief justice roberts delivered the opinion of the court.
congress enacted to criminalize the commercial creation,sale,or possession of certain depictions of animal cruelty.the statute does not address underlying acts harmful to animals,but only portrayals of such conduct.the question presented is whether the prohibition in the statute is consistent with the freedom of speech guaranteed by the first amendment.
section establishes a criminal penalty of up to five years in prison for anyone who knowingly creates,sells,or possesses a depiction of animal cruelty,if done for commercial gain in interstate or foreign commerce.a a depiction of animal cruelty is defined as one in which a living animal is intentionally maimed,mutilated,tortured,wounded,or killed,if that conduct violates federal or state law where the creation,sale,or possession takes place.c.in what is referred to as the exceptions clause,the law exempts from prohibition any depiction that has serious religious,political,scientific,educational,journalistic,historical,or artistic value.b.
the legislative background of focused primarily on the interstate market for crush videos.according to the house committee report on the bill,such videos feature the intentional torture and killing of helpless animals,including cats,dogs,monkeys,mice,and hamsters,hereinafter.crush videos often depict women slowly crushing animals to death with their bare feet or while wearing high heeled shoes,sometimes while talking to the animals in a kind of dominatrix patter over t he cries and squeals of the animals,obviously in great pain.ibid.apparently these depictions appeal to persons with a very specific sexual fetish who find them sexually arousing or otherwise exciting.at.the acts depicted in crush videos are typically prohibited by the animal cruelty laws enacted by all states and the district of columbia.see brief for united states,listing statutes.but crush videos rarely disclose the participants identities,inhibiting prosecution of the underlying conduct.see,at accord,brief for state of florida et as amici curiae.
this case,however,involves an application of to depictions of animal fighting.dogfighting,for example,is unlawful in all states and the district of columbia,see brief for united states,listing statutes,and has been restricted by federal law since.animal welfare act amendments of,stat.respondent robert stevens ran a business,dogs of velvet and steel,and an associated web site,through which he sold videos of pit bulls engaging in dogfights and attacking other animals.among these videos were japan pit fights and a pit bull documentary,which include contemporary footage of dogfights in japan where such conduct is allegedly legal as well as footage of american dogfights from the and a third video,catch dogs and country living,depicts the use of pit bulls to hunt wild boar,as well as a gruesome scene of a pit bull attacking a domestic farm pig,en banc.on the basis of these videos,stevens was indicted on three counts of violating.

the en banc third circuit,over a dissent,declared facially unconstitutional and vacated stevens conviction.the court of appeals first held that regulates speech that is protected by the first amendment.the court declined to recognize a new category of unprotected speech for depictions of animal cruelty,at,and,and rejected the government analogy between animal cruelty depictions and child pornography,at.
the court of appeals then held that could not survive strict scrutiny as a regulation of protected speech,at.it found that the statute lacked a compelling government interest and was neither narrowly tailored to preventing animal cruelty nor the least restrictive means of doing so,at.it therefore held facially invalid.
in an extended footnote,the third circuit noted that might also be unconstitutionally overbroad,because it potentially covers a great deal of constitutionally protected speech and sweeps too widely to be limited only by prosecutorial discretion,at.but the court of appeals declined to rest its analysis on this ground.
we granted certiorari.
the government primary submission is that necessarily complies with the constitution because the banned depictions of animal cruelty,as a class,are categorically unprotected by the first amendment.we disagree.
the first amendment provides that congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech.a s a general matter,the first amendment means that government has no power to restrict expression because of its message,its ideas,its subject matter,or its content.ashcroft american civil liberties union,internal quotation marks omitted.section explicitly regulates expression based on content the statute restricts visual and auditory depiction s,such as photographs,videos,or sound recordings,depending on whether they depict conduct in which a living animal is intentionally harmed.as such,is presumptively invalid,and the government bears the burden to rebut that presumption.united states playboy entertainment group,quoting paul,citation omitted.
from to the present,however,the first amendment has permitted restrictions upon the content of speech in a few limited areas,and has never include d a freedom to disregard these traditional limitations.at.these historic and traditional categories long familiar to the bar,simon schuster,members of state crime victims,kennedy,concurring in judgment including obscenity,roth united states,defamation,beauharnais illinois,fraud,virginia bd.of pharmacy virginia citizens consumer council,incitement,brandenburg ohio,per curiam,and speech integral to criminal conduct,giboney empire storage ice,are and narrowly limited classes of speech,the prevention and punishment of which have never been thought to raise any constitutional problem.chaplinsky new hampshire.
the government argues that depictions of animal cruelty should be added to the list.it contends that depictions of illegal acts of animal cruelty that are made,sold,or possessed for commercial gain necessarily lack expressive value,and may accordingly be regulated as unprotected speech.brief for united states emphasis added.the claim is not just that congress may regulate depictions of animal cruelty subject to the first amendment,but that these depictions are outside the reach of that amendment altogether that they fall into a first amendment free zone.board of airport comm rs of los angeles jews for jesus.
as the government notes,the prohibition of animal cruelty itself has a long history in american law,starting with the early settlement of the colonies.reply brief,see,the body of liberties.bay colony,reprinted in american historical documents,harvard classics,eliot ed.no man shall exercise any tirranny or crueltie towards any bruite creature which are usuallie kept for man use but we are unaware of any similar tradition excluding depictions of animal cruelty from the freedom of speech codified in the first amendment,and the government points us to none.
the government contends that historical evidence about the reach of the first amendment is not a necessary prerequisite for regulation today,reply brief,and that categories of speech may be exempted from the first amendment protection without any tradition of subjecting that speech to regulation.instead,the government points to congress legislative judgment that depictions of animals being intentionally tortured and killed are of such minimal redeeming value as to render them unworthy of first amendment protection,brief for united states quoting,at cowen,dissenting,and asks the court to uphold the ban on the same basis.the government thus proposes that a claim of categorical exclusion should be considered under a simple balancing test whether a given category of speech enjoys first amendment protection depends upon a categorical balancing of the value of the speech against its societal costs.brief for united states see also,at.
as a test for first amendment coverage,that sentence is startling and dangerous.the first amendment guarantee of free speech does not extend only to categories of speech that survive an ad hoc balancing of relative social costs and benefits.the first amendment itself reflects a judgment by the american people that the benefits of its restrictions on the government outweigh the costs.our constitution forecloses any attempt to revise that judgment simply on the basis that some speech is not worth it.the constitution is not a document prescribing limits,and declaring that those limits may be passed at pleasure.marbury madison,cranch.
to be fair to the government,its view did not emerge from a vacuum.as the government correctly notes,this court has often described historically unprotected categories of speech as being of such slight social value as a step to truth that any benefit that may be derived from them is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and morality.supra,at quoting chaplinsky,supra,at.in new york ferber,we noted that within these categories of unprotected speech,the evil to be restricted so overwhelmingly outweighs the expressive interests,if any,at stake,that no process of adjudication is required,because the balance of competing interests is clearly struck,at.the government derives its proposed test from these descriptions in our precedents.see brief for united states.
but such descriptions are just that descriptive.they do not set forth a test that may be applied as a general matter to permit the government to imprison any speaker so long as his speech is deemed valueless or unnecessary,or so long as an ad hoc calculus of costs and benefits tilts in a statute favor.
when we have identified categories of speech as fully outside the protection of the first amendment,it has not been on the basis of a simple analysis.in ferber,for example,we classified child pornography as such a category,at.we noted that the state of new york had a compelling interest in protecting children from abuse,and that the value of using children in these works as opposed to simulated conduct or adult actors was de minimis,at.but our decision did not rest on this balance of competing interests alone,at.we made clear that ferber presented a special case the market for child pornography was intrinsically related to the underlying abuse,and was therefore an integral part of the production of such materials,an activity illegal throughout the nation.at.as we noted,i t rarely has been suggested that the constitutional freedom for speech and press extends its immunity to speech or writing used as an integral part of conduct in violation of a valid criminal statute.at quoting giboney,supra,at.ferber thus grounded its analysis in a previously recognized,category of unprotected speech,and our subsequent decisions have shared this understanding.see osborne ohio,describing ferber as finding persuasive the argument that the advertising and sale of child pornography was an integral part of its unlawful production internal quotation marks omitted ashcroft free speech coalition,noting that distribution and sale were intrinsically related to the sexual abuse of children,giving the speech at issue a proximate link to the crime from which it came internal quotation marks omitted.
our decisions in ferber and other cases can not be taken as establishing a freewheeling authority to declare new categories of speech outside the scope of the first amendment.maybe there are some categories of speech that have been historically unprotected,but have not yet been specifically identified or discussed as such in our case law.but if so,there is no evidence that depictions of animal cruelty is among them.we need not foreclose the future recognition of such additional categories to reject the government highly manipulable balancing test as a means of identifying them.
because we decline to carve out from the first amendment any novel exception for,we review stevens first amendment challenge under our existing doctrine.
stevens challenged on its face,arguing that any conviction secured under the statute would be unconstitutional.the court below decided the case on that basis,at,and we granted the solicitor general petition for certiorari to determine whether is facially invalid under the free speech clause of the first amendment,pet.for cert.
to succeed in a typical facial attack,stevens would have to establish that no set of circumstances exists under which would be valid,united states salerno,or that the statute lacks any plainly legitimate sweep,washington glucksberg,stevens,concurring in judgments internal quotation marks omitted.which standard applies in a typical case is a matter of dispute that we need not and do not address,and neither salerno nor glucksberg is a speech case.here the government asserts that stevens can not prevail because is plainly legitimate as applied to crush videos and animal fighting depictions.deciding this case through a traditional facial analysis would require us to resolve whether these applications of are in fact consistent with the constitution.
in the first amendment context,however,this court recognizes a second type of facial challenge,whereby a law may be invalidated as overbroad if a substantial number of its applications are unconstitutional,judged in relation to the statute plainly legitimate sweep.washington state grange washington state republican party,internal quotation marks omitted.stevens argues that applies to common depictions of ordinary and lawful activities,and that these depictions constitute the vast majority of materials subject to the statute.brief for respondent.the government makes no effort to defend such a broad ban as constitutional.instead,the government entire defense of rests on interpreting the statute as narrowly limited to specific types of extreme material.brief for united states.as the parties have presented the issue,therefore,the constitutionality of hinges on how broadly it is construed.it is to that question that we now turn 
as we explained two terms ago,t he first step in overbreadth analysis is to construe the challenged statute it is impossible to determine whether a statute reaches too far without first knowing what the statute covers.united states williams.because is a federal statute,there is no need to defer to a state court authority to interpret its own law.
we read to create a criminal prohibition of alarming breadth.to begin with,the text of the statute ban on a depiction of animal cruelty nowhere requires that the depicted conduct be cruel.that text applies to any depiction in which a living animal is intentionally maimed,mutilated,tortured,wounded,or killed.c.m aimed,mutilated,and tortured convey cruelty,but wounded or killed do not suggest any such limitation.
the government contends that the terms in the definition should be read to require the additional element of accompanying acts of cruelty.reply brief see also tr.of oral arg.the dissent hinges on the same assumption.see post,at.the government bases this argument on the definiendum,depiction of animal cruelty,leocal ashcroft,and on the commonsense canon of noscitur a sociis.reply brief quoting williams,at.as that canon recognizes,an ambiguous term may be given more precise content by the neighboring words with which it is associated.ibid.likewise,an unclear definitional phrase may take meaning from the term to be defined,see leocal,supra,at interpreting a substantial risk of the us e of physical force as part of the definition of crime of violence 
but the phrase wounded or killed at issue here contains little ambiguity.the government opening brief properly applies the ordinary meaning of these words,stating for example that to kill is to deprive of life.brief for united states quoting webster third new international dictionary.we agree that wounded and killed should be read according to their ordinary meaning.engine mfrs.south coast air quality management.nothing about that meaning requires cruelty.
while not requiring cruelty,does require that the depicted conduct be illegal.but this requirement does not limit along the lines the government suggests.there are myriad federal and state laws concerning the proper treatment of animals,but many of them are not designed to guard against animal cruelty.protections of endangered species,for example,restrict even the humane wound ing or kill ing of living animal s.c.livestock regulations are often designed to protect the health of human beings,and hunting and fishing rules seasons,licensure,bag limits,weight requirements can be designed to raise revenue,preserve animal populations,or prevent accidents.the text of c draws no distinction based on the reason the intentional killing of an animal is made illegal,and includes,for example,the humane slaughter of a stolen cow 
what is more,the application of to depictions of illegal conduct extends to conduct that is illegal in only a single jurisdiction.under subsection c,the depicted conduct need only be illegal in the state in which the creation,sale,or possession takes place,regardless of whether the wounding or killing took place in that state.a depiction of entirely lawful conduct runs afoul of the ban if that depiction later finds its way into another state where the same conduct is unlawful.this provision greatly expands the scope of,because although there may be a broad societal consensus against cruelty to animals,brief for united states,there is substantial disagreement on what types of conduct are properly regarded as cruel.both views about cruelty to animals and regulations having no connection to cruelty vary widely from place to place.
in the district of columbia,for example,all hunting is unlawful.munic,tit.other jurisdictions permit or encourage hunting,and there is an enormous national market for depictions in which a living animal is intentionally killed.hunting periodicals have circulations in the hundreds of thousands or millions,see mediaweek,and hunting television programs,videos,and web sites are equally popular,see brief for professional outdoor media association et as amici curiae.the demand for hunting depictions exceeds the estimated demand for crush videos or animal fighting depictions by several orders of magnitude.compare ibid.and brief for national rifle association of america,as amicus curiae hereinafter nra brief estimating that hunting magazines alone account for million in annual retail sales with brief for united states,suggesting million in crush video sales per year,and noting that stevens earned from his videos.nonetheless,because the statute allows each jurisdiction to export its laws to the rest of the country,a extends to any magazine or video depicting lawful hunting,so long as that depiction is sold within the nation capital.
those seeking to comply with the law thus face a bewildering maze of regulations from at least separate jurisdictions.some states permit hunting with crossbows.code ann.code ann.a lexis cum.supp,while others forbid it.admin.reg,or restrict it only to the disabled,envir.conserv.law ann.west.missouri allows the canned hunting of ungulates held in captivity.code regs,tit,but montana restricts such hunting to certain bird species.admin.rule.the grouse may be hunted in idaho,but not in washington.compare idaho admin.code with.admin.code.
the disagreements among the states and the commonwealth s,territor ies,or possession s of the united states,c extend well beyond hunting.state agricultural regulations permit different methods of livestock slaughter in different places or as applied to different animals.compare.stat.excluding poultry from humane slaughter requirements with cal.food agric.code ann.b west including some poultry.california has recently banned cutting or docking the tails of dairy cattle,which other states permit.cal.legis.serv.ch.west.even cockfighting,long considered immoral in much of america,see barnes glen theatre,scalia,concurring in judgment,is legal in puerto rico,see laws ann.supp.posadas de puerto rico associates tourism of,and was legal in louisiana until,see.stat.ann.west effective.an image of any of these practices,if sold or possessed for commercial gain within a state that happens to forbid the practice,falls within the prohibition of a.
the only thing standing between defendants who sell such depictions and five years in federal prison other than the mercy of a prosecutor is the statute exceptions clause.subsection b exempts from prohibition any depiction that has serious religious,political,scientific,educational,journalistic,historical,or artistic value.the government argues that this clause substantially narrows the statute reach news reports about animal cruelty have journalistic value pictures of bullfights in spain have historical value and instructional hunting videos have educational value.reply brief.thus,the government argues,reaches only crush videos,depictions of animal fighting other than spanish bullfighting,see brief for united states,and perhaps other depictions of extreme acts of animal cruelty.at.
the government attempt to narrow the statutory ban,however,requires an unrealistically broad reading of the exceptions clause.as the government reads the clause,any material with redeeming societal value,at,at least some minimal value,reply brief quoting,at,or anything more than scant social value,reply brief,is excluded under b.but the text says serious value,and serious should be taken seriously.we decline the government invitation advanced for the first time in this court to regard as serious anything that is not scant.or,as the dissent puts it,trifling.post,at.as the government recognized below,serious ordinarily means a good bit more.the district court jury instructions required value that is significant and of great import,app,and the government defended these instructions as properly relying on a commonly accepted meaning of the word serious,brief for united states in.
quite apart from the requirement of serious value in b,the excepted speech must also fall within one of the enumerated categories.much speech does not.most hunting videos,for example,are not obviously instructional in nature,except in the sense that all life is a lesson.according to safari club international and the congressional sportsmen foundation,many popular videos have primarily entertainment value and are designed to entertai n the viewer,marke t hunting equipment,or increas e the hunting community.brief for safari club international et as amici curiae.the national rifle association agrees that much of the content of hunting media is merely recreational in nature.nra brief.the government offers no principled explanation why these depictions of hunting or depictions of spanish bullfights would be inherently valuable while those of japanese dogfights are not.the dissent contends that hunting depictions must have serious value because hunting has serious value,in a way that dogfights presumably do not.post,at.but b addresses the value of the depictions,not of the underlying activity.there is simply no adequate reading of the exceptions clause that results in the statute banning only the depictions the government would like to ban.
the government explains that the language of b was largely drawn from our opinion in miller california,which excepted from its definition of obscenity any material with serious literary,artistic,political,or scientific value,at.see reply brief,and.according to the government,this incorporation of the miller standard into is therefore surely enough to answer any first amendment objection.reply brief.
in miller we held that serious value shields depictions of sex from regulation as obscenity,at.limiting miller exception to serious value ensured that a quotation from voltaire in the flyleaf of a book would not constitutionally redeem an otherwise obscene publication.at,quoting kois wisconsin,per curiam.we did not,however,determine that serious value could be used as a general precondition to protecting other types of speech in the first place.most of what we say to one another lacks religious,political,scientific,educational,journalistic,historical,or artistic value let alone serious value,but it is still sheltered from government regulation.even w holly neutral futilities come under the protection of free speech as fully as do keats poems or donne sermons.cohen california,quoting winters new york,frankfurter,dissenting alteration in original.
thus,the protection of the first amendment presumptively extends to many forms of speech that do not qualify for the exception of b,but nonetheless fall within the broad reach of c.
not to worry,the government says the executive branch construes to reach only extreme cruelty,brief for united states,and it neither has brought nor will bring a prosecution for anything less,reply brief.the government hits this theme hard,invoking its prosecutorial discretion several times.see,at,and.but the first amendment protects against the government it does not leave us at the mercy of noblesse oblige.we would not uphold an unconstitutional statute merely because the government promised to use it responsibly.whitman american trucking.
this prosecution is itself evidence of the danger in putting faith in government representations of prosecutorial restraint.when this legislation was enacted,the executive branch announced that it would interpret as covering only depictions of wanton cruelty to animals designed to appeal to a prurient interest in sex.see statement by president william clinton upon signing,weekly comp.doc.no one suggests that the videos in this case fit that description.the government assurance that it will apply far more restrictively than its language provides is pertinent only as an implicit acknowledgment of the potential constitutional problems with a more natural reading.
nor can we rely upon the canon of construction that ambiguous statutory language should be construed to avoid serious constitutional doubts.fcc fox television stations,slip,at.t his court may impose a limiting construction on a statute only if it is readily susceptible to such a construction.reno american civil liberties union.we will not rewrite a law to conform it to constitutional requirements,at quoting virginia american booksellers,omission in original,for doing so would constitute a serious invasion of the legislative domain,united states treasury employees,and sharply diminish congress incentive to draft a narrowly tailored law in the first place,osborne,at.to read as the government desires requires rewriting,not just reinterpretation.
our construction of decides the constitutional question the government makes no effort to defend the constitutionality of as applied beyond crush videos and depictions of animal fighting.it argues that those particular depictions are intrinsically related to criminal conduct or are analogous to obscenity if not themselves obscene,and that the ban on such speech is narrowly tailored to reinforce restrictions on the underlying conduct,prevent additional crime arising from the depictions,or safeguard public mores.but the government nowhere attempts to extend these arguments to depictions of any other activities depictions that are presumptively protected by the first amendment but that remain subject to the criminal sanctions of.
nor does the government seriously contest that the presumptively impermissible applications of properly construed far outnumber any permissible ones.however growing and lucrative the markets for crush videos and dogfighting depictions might be,see brief for united states,internal quotation marks omitted,they are dwarfed by the market for other depictions,such as hunting magazines and videos,that we have determined to be within the scope of.see supra,at.we therefore need not and do not decide whether a statute limited to crush videos or other depictions of extreme animal cruelty would be constitutional.we hold only that is not so limited but is instead substantially overbroad,and therefore invalid under the first amendment.
the judgment of the united states court of appeals for the third circuit is affirmed.
it is so ordered.
united states,petitioner robert stevens 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit 
justice alito,dissenting.
the court strikes down in its entirety a valuable statute,that was enacted not to suppress speech,but to prevent horrific acts of animal cruelty in particular,the creation and commercial exploitation of crush videos,a form of depraved entertainment that has no social value.the court approach,which has the practical effect of legalizing the sale of such videos and is thus likely to spur a resumption of their production,is unwarranted.respondent was convicted under for selling videos depicting dogfights.on appeal,he argued,among other things,that is unconstitutional as applied to the facts of this case,and he highlighted features of those videos that might distinguish them from other dogfight videos brought to our attention the court of appeals incorrectly,in my view declined to decide whether is unconstitutional as applied to respondent videos and instead reached out to hold that the statute is facially invalid.today decision does not endorse the court of appeals reasoning,but it nevertheless strikes down using what has been aptly termed the strong medicine of the overbreadth doctrine,united states williams,internal quotation marks omitted,a potion that generally should be administered only as a last resort.los angeles police united reporting publishing,internal quotation marks omitted.
instead of applying the doctrine of overbreadth,i would vacate the decision below and instruct the court of appeals on remand to decide whether the videos that respondent sold are constitutionally protected.if the question of overbreadth is to be decided,however,i do not think the present record supports the court conclusion that bans a substantial quantity of protected speech.
a party seeking to challenge the constitutionality of a statute generally must show that the statute violates the party own rights.new york ferber.the first amendment overbreadth doctrine carves out a narrow exception to that general rule.see,at broadrick oklahoma.because an overly broad law may deter constitutionally protected speech,the overbreadth doctrine allows a party to whom the law may constitutionally be applied to challenge the statute on the ground that it violates the first amendment rights of others.see,board of trustees of state of fox,ordinarily,the principal advantage of the overbreadth doctrine for a litigant is that it enables him to benefit from the statute unlawful application to someone else see also ohralik ohio state bar,describing the doctrine as one under which a person may challenge a statute that infringes protected speech even if the statute constitutionally might be applied to him 
the strong medicine of overbreadth invalidation need not and generally should not be administered when the statute under attack is unconstitutional as applied to the challenger before the court.as we said in fox,supra,at,i t is not the usual judicial practice,nor do we consider it generally desirable,to proceed to an overbreadth issue unnecessarily that is,before it is determined that the statute would be valid as applied.accord,new york state club,city of new york,see also broadrick,supra,at united reporting publishing,supra,at stevens,dissenting.
i see no reason to depart here from the generally preferred procedure of considering the question of overbreadth only as a last resort because the court has addressed the overbreadth question,however,i will explain why i do not think that the record supports the conclusion that,when properly interpreted,is overly broad.
the overbreadth doctrine strike s a balance between competing social costs.williams,at.specifically,the doctrine seeks to balance the harmful effects of invalidating a law that in some of its applications is perfectly constitutional against the possibility that the threat of enforcement of an overbroad law will dete r people from engaging in constitutionally protected speech.ibid.in order to maintain an appropriate balance,we have vigorously enforced the requirement that a statute overbreadth be substantial,not only in an absolute sense,but also relative to the statute plainly legitimate sweep.ibid.
in determining whether a statute overbreadth is substantial,we consider a statute application to conduct,not fanciful hypotheticals.see,at see also ferber,supra,at houston hill.accordingly,we have repeatedly emphasized that an overbreadth claimant bears the burden of demonstrating,from the text of the law and from actual fact,that substantial overbreadth exists.virginia hicks,quoting new york state club,supra,at emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted alteration in original.similarly,there must be a realistic danger that the statute itself will significantly compromise recognized first amendment protections of parties not before the court for it to be facially challenged on overbreadth grounds.members of city council of los angeles taxpayers for vincent,emphasis added.
in holding that violates the overbreadth rule,the court declines to decide whether,as the government maintains,is constitutional as applied to two broad categories of depictions that exist in the real world crush videos and depictions of deadly animal fights.see ante,at.instead,the court tacitly assumes for the sake of argument that is valid as applied to these depictions,but the court concludes that reaches too much protected speech to survive.the court relies primarily on depictions of hunters killing or wounding game and depictions of animals being slaughtered for food.i address the court examples below.
i turn first to depictions of hunting.as the court notes,photographs and videos of hunters shooting game are common.see ante,at.but hunting is legal in all states,and applies only to a depiction of conduct that is illegal in the jurisdiction in which the depiction is created,sold,or possessed.a,c.therefore,in all states,the creation,sale,or possession for sale of the vast majority of hunting depictions indisputably falls outside reach.
straining to find overbreadth,the court suggests that prohibits the sale or possession in the district of columbia of any depiction of hunting because the district undoubtedly because of its urban character does not permit hunting within its boundaries.ante,at.the court also suggests that,because some states prohibit a particular type of hunting,hunting with a crossbow or canned hunting or the hunting of a particular animal,the grouse makes it illegal for persons in such states to sell or possess for sale a depiction of hunting that was perfectly legal in the state in which the hunting took place.see ante,at.
the court interpretation is seriously flawed.when a federal court is dealing with a federal statute challenged as overbroad,it should,of course,construe the statute to avoid constitutional problems,if the statute is subject to such a limiting construction.ferber,at.see also williams,supra,at stevens,concurring t o the extent the statutory text alone is unclear,our duty to avoid constitutional objections makes it especially appropriate to look beyond the text in order to ascertain the intent of its drafters 
applying this canon,i would hold that does not apply to depictions of hunting.first,because targets depictions of animal cruelty,i would interpret that term to apply only to depictions involving acts of animal cruelty as defined by applicable state or federal law,not to depictions of acts that happen to be illegal for reasons having nothing to do with the prevention of animal cruelty.see ante,at interpreting t he text of c to ban a depiction of the humane slaughter of a stolen cow virtually all state laws prohibiting animal cruelty either expressly define the term animal to exclude wildlife or else specifically exempt lawful hunting activities so the statutory prohibition set forth in a may reasonably be interpreted not to reach most if not all hunting depictions.
second,even if the hunting of wild animals were otherwise covered by a,i would hold that hunting depictions fall within the exception in b for depictions that have serious not trifling scientific,educational,or historical value.while there are certainly those who find hunting objectionable,the predominant view in this country has long been that hunting serves many important values,and it is clear that congress shares that view.since,when congress called upon the president to designate a national hunting and fishing day,see res,sess,stat,presidents have regularly issued proclamations extolling the values served by hunting.see presidential proclamation,fed.reg.obama hunting and fishing are ageless pursuits that promote the conservation and restoration of numerous species and their natural habitats presidential proclamation,fed.reg.bush hunters and anglers add to our heritage and keep our wildlife populations healthy and strong,and are among our foremost conservationists presidential proclamation,fed.reg.bush hunting and fishing are an important part of our nation heritage,and america hunters and anglers represent the great spirit of our country presidential proclamation,fed.reg.carter hunting promotes conservation and an appreciation of healthy recreation,peaceful solitude and closeness to nature presidential proclamation,fed.reg.ford hunting furthers appreciation and respect for nature and preservation of the environment.thus,it is widely thought that hunting has scientific value in that it promotes conservation,historical value in that it provides a link to past times when hunting played a critical role in daily life,and educational value in that it furthers the understanding and appreciation of nature and our country past and instills valuable character traits.and if hunting itself is widely thought to serve these values,then it takes but a small additional step to conclude that depictions of hunting make a contribution to the exchange of ideas.accordingly,i would hold that hunting depictions fall comfortably within the exception set out in b.
i do not have the slightest doubt that congress,in enacting,had no intention of restricting the creation,sale,or possession of depictions of hunting.proponents of the law made this point clearly.see,hereinafter d epictions of ordinary hunting and fishing activities do not fall within the scope of the statute cong.rec,mccollum t he sale of depictions of legal activities,such as hunting and fishing,would not be illegal under this bill at smith l et us be clear as to what this legislation will not do.it will in no way prohibit hunting,fishing,or wildlife videos indeed,even opponents acknowledged that was not intended to reach ordinary hunting depictions.see ibid.scott,at paul.
for these reasons,i am convinced that has no application to depictions of hunting.but even if did impermissibly reach the sale or possession of depictions of hunting in a few unusual situations for example,the sale in oregon of a depiction of hunting with a crossbow in virginia or the sale in washington state of the hunting of a grouse in idaho,see ante,at,those isolated applications would hardly show that bans a substantial amount of protected speech.
although the court overbreadth analysis rests primarily on the proposition that substantially restricts the sale and possession of hunting depictions,the court cites a few additional examples,including depictions of methods of slaughter and the docking of the tails of dairy cows.see ante,at.
such examples do not show that the statute is substantially overbroad,for two reasons.first,as explained above,can reasonably be construed to apply only to depictions involving acts of animal cruelty as defined by applicable state or federal law,and laws do not ban the sorts of acts depicted in the court hypotheticals.see,idaho code lexis no part of this chapter prohibiting cruelty to animals shall be construed as interfering with or allowing interference with t he humane slaughter of any animal normally and commonly raised as food or for production of fiber or n ormal or accepted practices of animal husbandry stat.ann.b the provisions of this section shall not apply to with respect to farm animals,normal or accepted practices of animal husbandry,including the normal and accepted practices for the slaughter of such animals crim.law code ann.lexis sections prohibiting animal cruelty do not apply to customary and normal veterinary and agricultural husbandry practices,including dehorning,castration,tail docking,and limit feeding 
second,nothing in the record suggests that any one has ever created,sold,or possessed for sale a depiction of the slaughter of food animals or of the docking of the tails of dairy cows that would not easily qualify under the exception set out in b.depictions created to show proper methods of slaughter or would presumably have serious educational value,and depictions created to focus attention on methods thought to be inhumane or otherwise objectionable would presumably have either serious educational or journalistic value or both.in short,the court examples of depictions involving the docking of tails and humane slaughter do not show that suffers from any overbreadth,much less substantial overbreadth.
the court notes,finally,that cockfighting,which is illegal in all states,is still legal in puerto rico,ante,at,and i take the court point to be that it would be impermissible to ban the creation,sale,or possession in puerto rico of a depiction of a cockfight that was legally staged in puerto rico but assuming for the sake of argument that this is correct,this veritable sliver of unconstitutionality would not be enough to justify striking down in toto.
in sum,we have a duty to interpret so as to avoid serious constitutional concerns,and may reasonably be construed not to reach almost all,if not all,of the depictions that the court finds constitutionally protected.thus,does not appear to have a large number of unconstitutional applications.invalidation for overbreadth is appropriate only if the challenged statute suffers from substantial overbreadth judged not just in absolute terms,but in relation to the statute plainly legitimate sweep.williams,at.as i explain in the following part,has a substantial core of constitutionally permissible applications.
as the court of appeals recognized,the primary conduct that congress sought to address through its passage of was the creation,sale,or possession of crush videos.en banc.a sample crush video,which has been lodged with the clerk,records the following event 
a kitten,secured to the ground,watches and shrieks in pain as a woman thrusts her shoe into its body,slams her heel into the kitten eye socket and mouth loudly fracturing its skull,and stomps repeatedly on the animal head.the kitten hemorrhages blood,screams blindly in pain,and is ultimately left dead in a moist pile of hair and bone.brief for humane society of united states as amicus curiae hereinafter humane society brief.
it is undisputed that the conduct depicted in crush videos may constitutionally be prohibited.all states and the district of columbia have enacted statutes prohibiting animal cruelty.see,at,and citing statutes,at.but before the enactment of,the underlying conduct depicted in crush videos was nearly impossible to prosecute.these videos,which often appeal to persons with a very specific sexual fetish,at,were made in secret,generally without a live audience,and the faces of the women inflicting the torture in the material often were not shown,nor could the location of the place where the cruelty was being inflicted or the date of the activity be ascertained from the depiction.at.thus,law enforcement authorities often were not able to identify the parties responsible for the torture.see punishing depictions of animal cruelty and the federal prisoner health care act of hearing before the subcommittee on crime of the house committee on the judiciary,hereinafter hearing on depictions of animal cruelty.in the rare instances in which it was possible to identify and find the perpetrators,they often were able to successfully assert as a defense that the state could not prove its jurisdiction over the place where the act occurred or that the actions depicted took place within the time specified in the state statute of limitations.at see also cong.rec.gallegly i t is the prosecutors from around this country,federal prosecutors as well as state prosecutors,that have made an appeal to us for this hearing on depictions of animal cruelty if the production of the video is not discovered during the actual filming,then prosecution for the offense is virtually impossible without a cooperative eyewitness to the filming or an undercover police operation at discussing example of case in which state prosecutor had the defendant telling us he produced these videos,but where prosecution was not possible because the state could not prove where or when the tape was made.
in light of the practical problems thwarting the prosecution of the creators of crush videos under state animal cruelty laws,congress concluded that the only effective way of stopping the underlying criminal conduct was to prohibit the commercial exploitation of the videos of that conduct.and congress strategy appears to have been vindicated.we are told that b y,sponsors of declared the crush video industry dead.even overseas websites shut down in the wake of.now,after the third circuit decision facially invalidating the statute,crush videos are already back online.humane society brief citations omitted.
the first amendment protects freedom of speech,but it most certainly does not protect violent criminal conduct,even if engaged in for expressive purposes.crush videos present a highly unusual free speech issue because they are so closely linked with violent criminal conduct.the videos record the commission of violent criminal acts,and it appears that these crimes are committed for the sole purpose of creating the videos.in addition,as noted above,congress was presented with compelling evidence that the only way of preventing these crimes was to target the sale of the videos.under these circumstances,i can not believe that the first amendment commands congress to step aside and allow the underlying crimes to continue.
the most relevant of our prior decisions is ferber,which concerned child pornography.the court there held that child pornography is not protected speech,and i believe that ferber reasoning dictates a similar conclusion here.
in ferber,an important factor i would say the most important factor was that child pornography involves the commission of a crime that inflicts severe personal injury to the children who are made to engage in sexual conduct for commercial purposes.at internal quotation marks omitted.the ferber court repeatedly described the production of child pornography as child abuse,molestation,or exploitation.see,at in recent years,the exploitive use of children in the production of pornography has become a serious national problem at,sexual molestation by adults is often involved in the production of child sexual performances as later noted in ashcroft free speech coalition,in ferber t he production of the work,not its content,was the target of the statute.see also,at ferber involved speech that itself is the record of sexual abuse 
second,ferber emphasized the fact that these underlying crimes could not be effectively combated without targeting the distribution of child pornography.as the court put it,the distribution network for child pornography must be closed if the production of material which requires the sexual exploitation of children is to be effectively controlled.at.the court added 
t here is no serious contention that the legislature was unjustified in believing that it is difficult,if not impossible,to halt the exploitation of children by pursuing only those who produce the photographs and movies.the most expeditious if not the only practical method of law enforcement may be to dry up the market for this material by imposing severe criminal penalties on persons selling,advertising,or otherwise promoting the product.at.
see also,at the advertising and selling of child pornography provide an economic motive for and are thus an integral part of the production of such materials 
third,the ferber court noted that the value of child pornography is exceedingly modest,if not de minimis,and that any such value was overwhelmingly outweigh ed by the evil to be restricted.at.
all three of these characteristics are shared by,as applied to crush videos.first,the conduct depicted in crush videos is criminal in every state and the district of columbia.thus,any crush video made in this country records the actual commission of a criminal act that inflicts severe physical injury and excruciating pain and ultimately results in death.those who record the underlying criminal acts are likely to be criminally culpable,either as aiders and abettors or conspirators.and in the tight and secretive market for these videos,some who sell the videos or possess them with the intent to make a profit may be similarly culpable.for example,in some cases,crush videos were commissioned by purchasers who specified the details of the acts that they wanted to see performed.see,at hearing on depictions of animal cruelty.to the extent that reaches such persons,it surely does not violate the first amendment.
second,the criminal acts shown in crush videos can not be prevented without targeting the conduct prohibited by the creation,sale,and possession for sale of depictions of animal torture with the intention of realizing a commercial profit.the evidence presented to congress posed a stark choice either ban the commercial exploitation of crush videos or tolerate a continuation of the criminal acts that they record.faced with this evidence,congress reasonably chose to target the lucrative crush video market.
finally,the harm caused by the underlying crimes vastly outweighs any minimal value that the depictions might conceivably be thought to possess.section reaches only the actual recording of acts of animal torture the statute does not apply to verbal descriptions or to simulations.and,unlike the child pornography statute in ferber or its federal counterpart,b provides an exception for depictions having any serious religious,political,scientific,educational,journalistic,historical,or artistic value.
it must be acknowledged that differs from a child pornography law in an important respect preventing the abuse of children is certainly much more important than preventing the torture of the animals used in crush videos.it was largely for this reason that the court of appeals concluded that ferber did not support the constitutionality of,at preventing cruelty to animals,although an exceedingly worthy goal,simply does not implicate interests of the same magnitude as protecting children from physical and psychological harm but while protecting children is unquestionably more important than protecting animals,the government also has a compelling interest in preventing the torture depicted in crush videos.
the animals used in crush videos are living creatures that experience excruciating pain.our society has long banned such cruelty,which is illegal throughout the country.in ferber,the court noted that virtually all of the states and the united states have passed legislation proscribing the production of or otherwise combating child pornography,and the court declined to that legislative judgment.at.here,likewise,the court of appeals erred in the legislative judgment about the importance of preventing cruelty to animals.
section ban on trafficking in crush videos also helps to enforce the criminal laws and to ensure that criminals do not profit from their crimes.see cong.rec,gallegly the state has an interest in enforcing its existing laws.right now,the laws are not only being violated,but people are making huge profits from promoting the violations at may,gallegly explaining that he introduced the house version of the bill because criminals should not profit from their illegal acts we have already judged that taking the profit out of crime is a compelling interest.see simon schuster,members of state crime victims.
in short,ferber is the case that sheds the most light on the constitutionality of congress effort to halt the production of crush videos.applying the principles set forth in ferber,i would hold that crush videos are not protected by the first amendment.
application of the ferber framework also supports the constitutionality of as applied to depictions of brutal animal fights.for convenience,i will focus on videos of dogfights,which appear to be the most common type of animal fight videos.
first,such depictions,like crush videos,record the actual commission of a crime involving deadly violence.dogfights are illegal in every state and the district of columbia,brief for united states,and citing statutes,and under federal law constitute a felony punishable by imprisonment for up to five years,et ed.and supp.ii,supp.ii.
second,congress had an ample basis for concluding that the crimes depicted in these videos can not be effectively controlled without targeting the videos.like crush videos and child pornography,dogfight videos are very often produced as part of a clandestine industry,and the need to market the resulting products requires a visible apparatus of distribution.ferber,at.in such circumstances,congress had reasonable grounds for concluding that it would be difficult,if not impossible,to halt the underlying exploitation of dogs by pursuing only those who stage the fights,at see,at cowen,dissenting citing evidence establishing the existence of a lucrative market for depictions of animal cruelty,including videos of dogfights,which in turn provides a powerful incentive to individuals to create such videos 
the commercial trade in videos of dogfights is an integral part of the production of such materials,ferber,supra,at.as the humane society explains,v ideotapes memorializing dogfights are integral to the success of this criminal industry for a variety of reasons.humane society brief.for one thing,some dogfighting videos are made solely for the purpose of selling the video and not for a live audience.at.in addition,those who stage dogfights profit not just from the sale of the videos themselves,but from the gambling revenue they take in from the fights the videos encourage such gambling activity because they allow those reluctant to attend actual fights for fear of prosecution to still bet on the outcome.accord,brief for center on the administration of criminal law as amicus curiae selling videos of dogfights effectively abets the underlying crimes by providing a market for dogfighting while allowing actual dogfights to remain underground ibid.these videos are part of a lucrative market where videos are produced by a,clandestine staff in order to permit the actual location of dogfights and the perpetrators of these underlying criminal activities to go undetected citations omitted.moreover,v ideo documentation is vital to the criminal enterprise because it provides proof of a dog fighting prowess proof demanded by potential buyers and critical to the underground market.humane society brief.such recordings may also serve as training videos for other fight organizers.ibid.in short,because videos depicting live dogfights are essential to the success of the criminal dogfighting subculture,the commercial sale of such videos helps to fuel the market for,and thus to perpetuate the perpetration of,the criminal conduct depicted in them.
third,depictions of dogfights that fall within reach have by definition no appreciable social value.as noted,b exempts depictions having any appreciable social value,and thus the mere inclusion of a depiction of a live fight in a larger work that aims at communicating an idea or a message with a modicum of social value would not run afoul of the statute.
finally,the harm caused by the underlying criminal acts greatly outweighs any trifling value that the depictions might be thought to possess.as the humane society explains 
the abused dogs used in fights endure physical torture and emotional manipulation throughout their lives to predispose them to violence common tactics include feeding the animals hot peppers and gunpowder,prodding them with sticks,and electrocution.dogs are conditioned never to give up a fight,even if they will be gravely hurt or killed.as a result,dogfights inflict horrific injuries on the participating animals,including lacerations,ripped ears,puncture wounds and broken bones.losing dogs are routinely refused treatment,beaten further as punishment for the loss,and executed by drowning,hanging,or incineration.at footnotes omitted.
for these dogs,unlike the animals killed in crush videos,the suffering lasts for years rather than minutes.as with crush videos,moreover,the statutory ban on commerce in dogfighting videos is also supported by compelling governmental interests in effectively enforcing the nation criminal laws and preventing criminals from profiting from their illegal activities.see ferber,supra,at simon schuster,at.
in sum,may validly be applied to at least two broad categories of expression covered by the statute crush videos and dogfighting videos.thus,the statute has a substantial core of constitutionally permissible applications.moreover,for the reasons set forth above,the record does not show that,properly interpreted,bans a substantial amount of protected speech in absolute terms.a fortiori,respondent has not met his burden of demonstrating that any impermissible applications of the statute are substantial in relation to its plainly legitimate sweep.williams,at.accordingly,i would reject respondent claim that is facially unconstitutional under the overbreadth doctrine.
for these reasons,i respectfully dissent.
