electronic eavesdropping has historically proceeded on a basis of cooperation between law enforcement authorities and telephone service providers.in congress regularized the relationship somewhat by providing that a court order for electronic surveillance should,at the request of the officer applying for authority,direct the provider to furnish the applicant with the necessary information,facilities and technical assistance.act of july,tit.ii,b,stat,codified at.because of rapid technological development since then,congress in added further structure with the communications assistance for law enforcement act calea or the act,et.each of the statute sections has a number lower than that of its codified equivalent in title for simplicity sake we use only the latter.the act has requirements relating to both the capability of telephone service providers to intercept communications and their capacity to do so.in united states telecom ass fcc,we addressed capability here we deal only with capacity.
in very simplified form,calea sets up the following regime as to capacity,involving three key phases the attorney general issues notices of what capacity is needed.the attorney general in fact has delegated his duties to the fbi,and we henceforth refer to it exclusively.each carrier responds with a statement of the modifications any of its systems or services will need to provide the required capacity.a carrier is deemed in compliance with the fbi capacity notices,without having made the specified modifications,until the fbi agrees to reimburse the carrier for those modifications.we spell out the scheme in more detail below.
in the fbi issued a set of rules implementing the act capacity requirements.see implementation of section of calea,fed.reg.march,final notice.united states telecom association usta,a trade association of about telephone companies,sought relief in district court against various provisions of the rules.first,it argued that the fbi had erroneously defined the class of modifications for which carriers might be eligible for reimbursement.second,it said that the fbi concept of the required notices misread the statute in a variety of ways,each increasing the carriers burdens and their risks of being found noncomplaint.in an unpublished opinion the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the fbi on all issues.
reviewing the grant of summary judgment de novo,see,shields eli lilly,we affirm the district court with respect to the reimbursement scheme,finding that the fbi correctly defined the modifications required to be reimbursed.on the other hand,finding error on the part of the fbi on each of the disputes about its notices,we reverse on those issues,with instructions to the district court to remand the case,in one instance vacating the challenged feature of the rules,in the others not.
calea requires the fbi to issue a notice of both the actual number of interceptions and devices that it expects will be conducted and used simultaneously by october,a a,and the maximum capacity required to accommodate the surveillance that enforcement agencies may conduct and simultaneously use after that date,a b.subject to a qualification relating to reimbursement of necessary modifications,service providers are required within three years after notice to have the capacity specified in a a and the ability expeditiously to expand to the maximum capacity specified in a b.see b,e.the fbi notice under a a is to state 
the actual number of communication interceptions,pen registers,and trap and trace devices,representing a portion of the maximum capacity set forth under subparagraph b,that the fbi estimates that law enforcement authorities may conduct and use simultaneously.
a a emphasis added.pen registers are devices that record the telephone numbers dialed by the surveillance subject trap and trace devices record the telephone numbers of the subject incoming calls.
each of the carriers is required to respond to the notice of capacity requirements with a statement of systems or services that do not have the necessary capacity.d.the fbi reviews these statements and may agree to reimburse the carrier for costs associated directly with modifications to attain the capacity requirements.e.until the fbi agrees to reimburse the necessary modifications specified by a carrier,the carrier is considered in compliance.id.
we address first the cost allocation issue,then the character of the notices to be issued by the fbi.
cost allocation.we start with the key statutory provisions.section d sets out the duty of the carrier to submit a statement responding to the fbi notice,and e states the relationship between a carrier compliance and the fbi decision on what to reimburse 
d carrier statement 
within days after the publication by the fbi of a notice of capacity requirements pursuant to subsection a or c of this section,a telecommunications carrier shall submit to the fbi a statement identifying any of its systems or services that do not have the capacity to accommodate simultaneously the number of interceptions,pen registers,and trap and trace devices set forth in the notice under such subsection.
e reimbursement required for compliance 
the fbi shall review the statements submitted under subsection d of this section and may,subject to the availability of appropriations,agree to reimburse a telecommunications carrier for costs directly associated with modifications to attain such capacity requirement that are determined to be reasonable in accordance with section e of this title.until the fbi agrees to reimburse such carrier for such modification,such carrier shall be considered to be in compliance with the capacity notices under subsection a or c of this section.
the final notice provided for eligibility for reimbursement as follows 
capacity costs associated with any equipment,facilities or services deployed after the carrier statement period of days following the effective date of this final notice of capacity will not be eligible for reimbursement.
final notice,fed.reg.at.but the language is concededly different from the thought the fbi intended to convey.in fact,government counsel assured us at oral argument with the full assent of usta counsel,that this sentence should really be read as if it also contained the material added in boldface 
capacity costs associated with any equipment,facilities or services deployed after the carrier statement period of days following the effective date of this final notice of capacity will not be eligible for reimbursement,except costs for modifications the fbi has agreed to compensate under e.
thus,expenses incurred to add than for modifications that the carrier specified in its statement and that the fbi in its discretion agreed to not reimbursable.
usta objects that under the fbi reading of e,a carrier will have to pay for all capacity it adds in the future except for the reimbursed modifications,even though the government will be able to help itself to part of the added capacity.as was developed at oral argument,this skews a carrier incentives rather than invest in capacity additions sized to accommodate not only its customers prospective demand but also the government future wishes,it will elect smaller expansions,anticipating that after the next fbi notice and carrier statement its equipment will require modification and thus government reimbursement.usta further argues that we should not defer to the fbi reading of the act under chevron natural resources defense council,d,because the government has a sharp pecuniary interest in the outcome under usta reading of the statute,the government would have to pay for its share of all new capacity that it uses.
of course the issue of chevron deference arises only if the statute does plainly settle the issue.chevron,at.at holding that if congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue,the court must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.here we find that the act does so,and therefore need not resolve usta theory.
the only costs for which the act provides any compensation are for modifications under e.these modifications are necessarily
