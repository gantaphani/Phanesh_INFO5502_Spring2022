teltech spoofcard service enables customers,when placing phone calls,to spoof or disguise their caller id by selecting the number they would like to appear on recipients caller id screens.that service also permits customers to alter their voices for example,by making a woman voice sound like a man voice in the course of a call.and,finally,that service provides for a means to ensure that calls are recorded and stored.
the events that gave rise to the current suit relate to a particularly ugly but,the record sadly indicates,by no means altogether unusual use of the spoofcard service.in january,walsh lived in an apartment complex in quincy,massachusetts.john luciano lived in that same complex.luciano worked as a chef at a local restaurant.he was acquainted with a man by the name of michael dilorenzo,who was married to a woman by the name of johnienne dilorenzo.
johnienne had once worked at luciano restaurant,and luciano had helped her to get the job.but luciano testified that he fired johnienne because she kept screwing it up and showing up late.johnienne testified that,in fact,she quit the job due to unwanted sexual advances from luciano.
what matters for present purposes is that one night,after johnienne had been fired by luciano,she was at a party when she overheard her friends discussing spoofcard.johnienne friends told her about the spoofcard website and demonstrated how spoofcard worked by calling each other phones and using the spoofcard features.johnienne later told her husband,michael,about spoofcard.
on january,one of the dilorenzos it is not clear who purchased spoofcard minutes from the spoofcard website.on january,johnienne made six phone calls to walsh using spoofcard to mimic a man voice and to make it appear as if the calls were placed using luciano telephone number.
in those calls,johnienne posing as luciano made a series of sexually harassing comments to walsh.through the use of the spoofcard service,the january phone calls between johnienne and walsh were recorded without walsh consent,potentially in violation of.laws ch,chapter,which,among other things,proscribes the recording of phone conversations without the consent of each party to the call.
walsh,believing that luciano had made the calls,reported luciano to the quincy police department later that same day.luciano was arrested on the evening of january,on charges of criminal threatening and criminal harassment.luciano spent several days in jail.
on february,walsh received several voicemails from a blocked number.the voicemail messages threatened retaliation if walsh did not drop the charges against luciano.walsh believed these calls,too,came from luciano,and the confusion about the source of the calls ultimately led authorities to bring felony witness intimidation charges against luciano.as a result of these events,walsh moved out of her apartment and quit a job working at the boston garden.
according to walsh complaint,the dilorenzos,on december,admitted to quincy police that they called walsh on january,and that they made it appear as if the call were coming from luciano phone number.the assistant district attorney,according to walsh,thereafter dropped the charges against luciano and pursued charges against the dilorenzos for criminal harassment,criminal threatening,witness intimidation,and misleading a police officer.
on december,walsh filed a complaint against teltech in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts.walsh alleged that teltech engaged in a number of unfair and deceptive acts and practices in violation of.laws ch,chapter.in particular,walsh alleged that teltech violated chapter by violating chapter,and by offer ing the spoofcard service while encourag ing the use of the spoofcard for illegal purposes as evidenced by the promotional material on spoofcard website for relief,walsh requested compensatory damages in the amount of million,treble damages,punitive damages,disgorgements of profits from the sale of the spoofcard service,and attorneys fees and costs under chapter,as well as an injunction against the future sale and promotion of spoofcard.
on january,teltech filed a motion for summary judgment.walsh filed a memorandum opposing teltech motion on february.on march,walsh filed a motion for leave to file a.
on july,the district court granted teltech motion for summary judgment.the district court held that no reasonable jury could find that teltech actions caused walsh injuries.the district court found that the offering of the service alone could not give rise to liability under chapter,because spoofing has legitimate purposes.and the district court found that the promotional material on teltech website could not give rise to liability under chapter because there was no evidence that the dilorenzos viewed that material,much less that the dilorenzos were influenced by it.finally,the district court denied walsh motion for leave to file a,in part because walsh gave the court no reason to deviate from its rule disfavoring the filing of.
on appeal,walsh makes two main arguments as to how the district court erred.first,walsh contends that the district court failed to address walsh contention that teltech violation of chapter,constituted a violation of chapter.second,walsh contends that the district court erroneously disposed of her remaining chapter claims on causation grounds.we take up each of these contentions in order 
because we are reviewing an award of summary judgment,we may affirm only if we,like the district court,conclude that the record shows there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.mccue bradstreet,cir quoting mcgrath tavares,cir.we review de novo,drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party while ignoring conclusory allegations,improbable inferences,and unsupported speculation.id.quoting shafmaster united states,cir.
