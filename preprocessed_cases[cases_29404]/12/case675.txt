comcast corporation and several intervenors involved in the cable television industry petition for review of a rule in which the federal communications commission capped at of all subscribers the market share any single cable television operator may serve.we agree with comcast that the subscriber limit is arbitrary and capricious.we therefore grant the petition and vacate the rule.
background 
the cable television consumer protection and competition act of directed the fcc,i n order to enhance effective competition,f,to 
prescrib e rules and regulations to ensure that no cable operator or group of cable operators can unfairly impede,either because of the size of any individual operator or because of joint actions by a group of operators of sufficient size,the flow of video programming from the video programmer to the consumer.
id.f a.the commission is to make such rules and regulations reflect the dynamic nature of the communications marketplace.id.f e.
several cable operators immediately challenged certain provisions of the act,in particular arguing the subscriber limit provision was facially unconstitutional as a restriction of speech.see daniels cablevision,united states,rev in part sub nom.time warner entm t united states time warner i.we conclude d that the subscriber limits provision is not.time warner i,at.applying intermediate,rather than strict scrutiny,we upheld the relevant provision of the act because the plaintiff ha d not demonstrated that the subscriber limits provision is on its face either unnecessary or unnecessarily overburdensome to speech protected by the first amendment to the constitution of the united states,id.at.
in the commission first exercised its rulemaking authority and set the subscriber limit at.much has changed in the subscription television industry since the number of networks has increased and satellite television companies,which were bit players in the early,now serve of all subscribers.meanwhile,the fcc has twice changed the formula it uses to determine the maximum number of subscribers a cable operator may serve,but the subscriber limit has always remained at.
in we considered a petition for review of a then newly revised version of the subscriber limit.time warner entm t fcc time warner ii.then,as now,the commission established the subscriber limit through an open field analysis,in which the agency determines whether a programming network would have access to alternative video programming distributors of sufficient size to allow it to successfully enter the market,if it were denied carriage by one or more of the largest cable operators.fourth report and order and further notice of proposed rulemaking.fourth report.in time warner ii we described the formula then used by the fcc 
t he fcc determines that the average cable network needs to reach million subscribers to be economically viable.this is of the roughly million subscribers,and the fcc rounds it up to of such subscribers.the fcc then divines that the average cable programmer will succeed in reaching only about of the subscribers linked to cable companies that agree to carry its programming,because of channel capacity,programming tastes of particular cable operators,or other factors.the average programmer therefore requires an open field of of the market to be viable.
finally,to support the limit that it says is necessary to assure this minimum,the commission reasons as follows with a limit,a programmer has an open field of of the market even if the two largest cable companies deny carriage,acting individually or collusively.
at internal citations and quotation marks omitted.as is apparent from this description,in order to use the open field approach,the commission must assign values to three variables the minimum viable scale,which is the number of viewers a network must reach to be economically viable the relevant market,which is the total number of subscribers and the penetration rate,which is the percentage of viewers the average cable network reaches once a cable operator decides to carry it.
in establishing the subscriber limit we reviewed in time warner ii,the commission had sought to ensure a minimum open field of and reasoned that a cap,rather than the seemingly obvious cap,was necessary because the commission was concerned about the viability of a video programming network if the two largest cable operators denied it carriage.id.at.we granted the petition because the record contained no evidence of cable operators colluding to deny a video programmer carriage and the legitimate,independent editorial choices of two or more cable operators,id.at,could not be said to unfairly impede,either because of the size of any individual operator or because of joint actions by a group of operators of sufficient size,the flow of video programming from the video programmer to the consumer,f a.we directed the agency on remand to consider how the increasing market share of direct broadcast satellite dbs companies,such as directv and dish network,diminished cable operators ability to determine the economic fate of programming networks.time warner ii,at.
on remand,the commission adopted the current version of the subscriber limit.the rule here under review was designed to ensure that no single cable operator can,by simply refusing to carry a programming network,cause it to fail.fourth report,at.based upon the record before the court in time warner ii,the subscriber limit under this standard could not have been lower than.at.based upon the present record,however,the commission concluded no cable operator could safely be allowed to than of all subscribers.plus ça change,plus la même chose 
in the minimum viable scale,the commission relied upon a study finding regarding the number of viewers a cable network needed to reach in order to have a chance of survival after five years,using data on the survival of cable networks between and.fourth report,at.based upon the study,the fcc found the minimum viable scale was million subscribers,about four million more than the agency had found were necessary in.
to determine the total number of subscribers,the fcc counted all cable subscribers and dbs customers,totaling approximately million up from million in.id.at.in the penetration rate,the commission observed,many,if not most,new cable networks are placed on a digital tier.a consequence of being placed on a digital tier versus one of the basic levels of service is a much lower penetration rate.id.at.using an study of the tiering and subscribership data for a sample of cable operators and a linear regression model,the commission determined the penetration rate of the average network was,or slightly more than half the penetration rate it found in.id.at.
from these data,the commission calculated that a video programming network,to be viable,required an open field of up from in.therefore,no cable operator could serve more than of all subscribers.
although the commission recognized that competition in the downstream market especially from dbs companies may affect the ability of a large cable operator to prevent successful entry by a programming network,and that the open field analysis does not directly measure this,it decided not to adjust the subscriber limit to account for such competition because doing so would be quite difficult.id.at.the fcc then gave four reasons it did not regard competition from dbs companies as significant customers are reluctant to switch from cable service to dbs because switching is costly and cable operators offer services,such as telephone and internet access,that are not available with dbs and video programming is a product,the quality of which can not be known with certainty until it is consumed.additionally,c ompetitive pressures from dbs will not provide any assistance to networks that,not having a contract with the largest cable operator,are unable to launch due to a lack of financing.id.at.
comcast now petitions for review of the commission latest version of the subscriber limit.the national cable telecommunications association,bright house networks,the cable television communications association of illinois,cablevision systems corporation,the indiana,michigan,minnesota,and missouri cable telecommunications associations,and time warner have intervened in support of comcast petition.the cctv center for media democracy,united church of christ,and the center for creative community collectively cctv intervenors have intervened in support of the fcc.
ii.analysis 
comcast suggests the cctv intervenors lack standing and argues the subscriber limit is unconstitutional,outside the scope of the fcc statutory authority,and arbitrary,capricious,and unsupported by substantial evidence.the commission suggests comcast lacks standing and,of course,defends the limit on all fronts.
the irreducible constitutional minimum of standing contains three elements injury in fact,causation,and redressability.lujan defenders of wildlife,d.the commission argues we must dismiss the petition because comcast has failed to show it has suffered a concrete injury in fact that is actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.similarly,comcast claims the cctv intervenors can not point to an actual or imminent injury they would suffer if the subscriber limit were lifted.
comcast argues it is injured because the subscriber limit unduly restrict s its opportunity to grow internally and make economically efficient acquisitions.pet.br.in support of the latter point,the company invokes the declaration of a senior vice president,who states that h ad the horizontal ownership cap not been imposed by the fcc,comcast would have seriously pursued further negotiations and due diligence with respect to a specific but unidentified transaction.pick decl.at.this declaration is sufficient to support comcast standing pursuant to fox television stations,fcc fox i,modified on reh g,finding standing where cable operator alleged rule prevented it from acquiring television stations but failed to identif y any specific transaction it would have consummated but for the rule.
the cctv intervenors argue they will be harmed if a cable operator is allowed to serve more than of all subscribers because such an operator could use its market position to restrict consumers access to some cable networks.we need not decide whether this alleged harm is too conjectural or hypothetical to support standing,however,because if one party has standing in an action,a court need not reach the issue of the standing of other parties when it makes no difference to the merits of the case.ry.labor executives ass united states.the cctv intervenors have raised precisely the same issues and made essentially the same arguments as has the commission.whether the cctv intervenors participate in the case therefore can not affect the merits.
b.the subscriber limit 
we may set aside the commission decision only if it was arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.mission broad.fcc,quoting a.we will not do so if the agency examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for its action.fresno mobile radio,fcc,internal quotation marks omitted.
whether a cable operator serving more than of subscribers can exercise bottleneck monopoly power,turner broad.fcc turner i,d,depends,as we observed in time warner ii,not only on its share of the market,but also on the elasticities of supply and demand,which in turn are determined by the availability of competition.at.a cable operator faces competition primarily from companies,such as those providing dbs service and,increasingly,telephone companies providing fiber optic service.as comcast points out,dbs companies alone now serve approximately of all subscribers.recognizing the growing importance particularly of dbs,in time warner ii we said in no uncertain terms that in revisiting the horizontal rules the commission will have to take account of the impact of dbs on cable operators market power.id.
of the three aspects of the commission open field viable scale,total number of subscribers,and penetration the total subscribers measure fully takes account of the competition from dbs companies and companies offering fiber optic services.as comcast points out,the measure of minimum viable scale relies upon data from and,as a result,fails to consider the impact of dbs companies growing market share from to over the six years immediately preceding issuance of the rule,as well as the growth of fiber optic companies.the penetration rate calculation,by the commission own admission,leaves out data regarding dbs omission the fcc attempts to justify with the assertion that such data would not have materially changed the penetration rate.
comcast argues the commission has offered no plausible reason for its failure to heed our explicit direction in time warner ii to consider the competitive impact of dbs companies.instead the commission made the four observations we enumerated above.as for the first,transaction costs undoubtedly do deter some cable customers from switching to satellite services,but comcast points to record evidence that almost of all dbs customers formerly subscribed to cable in the face of that evidence,the commission observation that cost may deter some customers from switching to dbs is feeble indeed.with regard to the some cable consumers may be reluctant to switch to a satellite television service because,unlike cable companies,dbs companies do not offer internet and telephone commission does not point to any evidence tending to show these inframarginal customers are numerous enough to confer upon cable operators their supposed bottleneck power over programming.moreover,as comcast points out,both directv and dish network have partnered with telephone companies to offer bundled dbs and telephone services.
the commission third consumers will not switch providers to access new programming because they can not know the quality of the programming before consuming little discussion.as comcast points out,there is no record support for this conjecture.in any event,it is common knowledge that new video programming is advertised on other television stations and in other media,and can be previewed over the internet,thus providing consumers with information about the quality of competing services.the fcc fourth without its subscriber cap an upstart network will have trouble securing financing unless it has a contract with a cable company serving more than of the no more convincing than the other three when one recalls dbs companies already serve more than of the market.
finally,we note the commission observation that assessing competition from dbs companies is true even if not justify the agency failure to consider competition from dbs companies in important aspects of its model.that a problem is difficult may indicate a need to make some simplifying assumptions,see chem.mfrs.ass epa,but it does not justify ignoring altogether a variable so clearly relevant and likely to affect the calculation of a subscriber to mention one the court had directed the agency to consider.
comcast,on the other hand,points beyond dbs companies growing market share to their exclusive arrangements with certain highly sought after programmers as evidence that competition has led and will likely continue to lead subscribers to switch services.indeed,commissioner mcdowell pointed out in dissent that,as of the date of the fourth report,directv and dish network each served more customers than any cable company save comcast itself.fourth report,at.comcast also points to evidence that the number of cable networks has increased by almost since and has grown at an ever faster rate since,and that a much lower percentage of cable networks are vertically integrated with cable operators than was the case when the congress passed the act.there can be no doubt that consumers are now able to receive far more channels than they could in,let alone.
in sum,the commission has failed to demonstrate that allowing a cable operator to serve more than of all cable subscribers would threaten to reduce either competition or diversity in programming.first,the record is replete with evidence of ever increasing competition among video providers satellite and fiber optic video providers have entered the market and grown in market share since the congress passed the act,and particularly in recent years.cable operators,therefore,no longer have the bottleneck power over programming that concerned the congress in.second,over the same period there has been a dramatic increase both in the number of cable networks and in the programming available to subscribers.
in view of the overwhelming evidence concerning the dynamic nature of the communications marketplace,f e,and the entry of new competitors at both the programming and the distribution levels,it was arbitrary and capricious for the commission to conclude that a cable operator serving more than of the market poses a threat either to competition or to diversity in programming.considering the marketplace as it is today and the many significant changes that have occurred since,the fcc has not identified a sufficient basis for imposing upon cable operators the special obligations,turner i,at,represented by the subscriber limit.we conclude the commission has failed to examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action,fresno mobile,at,and hold the subscriber cap is arbitrary and capricious.
comcast asks us to vacate the subscriber limit.an inadequately supported rule need not necessarily be vacated,nuclear regulatory comm n.rather,t he decision whether to vacate depends on the seriousness of the rule deficiencies and thus the extent of doubt whether the agency chose correctly and the disruptive consequences of an interim change that may itself be changed.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.in the past we have not hesitated to vacate a rule when the agency has not responded to empirical data or to an argument inconsistent with its conclusion.pub.telecomm.ass fcc,see also.pub.telecomm.ass fcc,explaining court in.pub.i intended to vacate rule.
the commission dereliction in this case is particularly egregious.in the previous round of this litigation we expressly instructed the agency on remand to consider fully the competition that cable operators face from dbs companies.time warner ii,at.the omission of this consideration was a major failing of the fcc prior attempt to justify the cap.the commission nonetheless failed to heed our direction and we are again faced with the same objections to the rationale for the cap.it is apparent that the commission either can not or will not fully incorporate the competitive impact of dbs and fiber optic companies into its open field model.we have no trouble concluding,therefore,that vacatur is indicated by the first factor in,the seriousness of the rule deficiencies,at.see fox i,at vacating regulation as a hopeless cause.
vacatur is also indicated by the second factor,whether vacatur is likely to be unduly disruptive of the agency regulatory program.at.although vacatur will eliminate the subscriber limit,cable operators will remain subject to,and competition will be safeguarded by,the generally applicable antitrust laws.natural res.def.council epa,holding vacatur was not unduly disruptive because parties were subject to other environmental regulations see also chamber of commerce sec,considering whether vacatur would disrupt regulated industry and customers pursuant to second criterion.
of course,the second factor is weighty only insofar as the agency may be able to rehabilitate its rationale for the regulation.at.the commission having twice tried and twice failed to justify the cap,we do not think that prospect looms large.were the rule left in place while the fcc tries a third time to rationalize the cap,however,it would continue to burden speech protected by the first amendment.cable programmers and cable operators engage in and transmit speech,and they are entitled to the protection of the speech and press provisions of the first amendment.turner i,at.because it is the purpose of the first amendment to preserve an uninhibited marketplace of ideas the right of the public to receive suitable access to social,political,esthetic,moral,and other ideas and experiences through the medium of broadcasting may not constitutionally be abridged either by congress or by the fcc.fcc league of women voters,d internal alterations omitted.
the subscriber cap has limited the ability of cable operators to communicate with the public for some years despite our determination eight years ago that a prior version of the rule was unconstitutional.see time warner ii,at the fcc has not met its burden under the first amendment.in light of the changed marketplace,the government justification for the cap is even weaker now than in when we held the cap unconstitutional.as the supreme court has observed,the broadcast industry is dynamic in terms of technological change solutions adequate a decade ago are not necessarily so now,and those acceptable today may well be outmoded years hence.columbia broad.democratic,d.to leave the rule in place while the commission tries yet again to justify it would be to ignore this crucial fact about the nature of the video industry.
iii.conclusion 
we hold the subscriber limit is arbitrary and capricious because the commission failed adequately to take account of the substantial competition cable operators face from video programming distributors.the petition for review is therefore granted and the subscriber limit is,accordingly,

it is true that occasionally our court has remanded invalid rules without vacating them.but none of those decisions made even the slightest attempt to square the disposition with a.remanding without vacating often seems to occur without analysis and,perhaps,inadvertently.we traditionally sign off opinions with so ordered or affirmed or dismissed or even occasionally reversed,always in italics,flush right.sometimes,i suspect,not much attention is paid to the large difference between remanded and vacated and remanded.
the opinion in,nuclear regulatory commission at least identified some factors that might make vacating a rule more or less attractive.but the relatively few cases attempting to apply are difficult to reconcile.see kristina daugirdas,note,evaluating remand without vacatur a new judicial remedy for defective agency rulemakings.and like other decisions,failed to parse the language of a.

for one,it preserves the adversarial process.the briefs of the parties rarely discuss what remedy the court should impose if the agency loses.this is understandable.it may be impossible for petitioners,agencies,or intervenors to anticipate exactly how the court decision will come out.there may be challenges to many rules or many aspects of one rule.the court may uphold some and reject others.different consequences can result from different combinations.besides,agencies do not relish anticipating a loss.no litigant
