ohio bell telephone company sbc appeals the district court order affirming the arbitration decision of the public utilities commission of ohio puco.although puco arbitrated over open issues between sbc and appellee mci telecommunications mci,sbc appeals only one issue whether the district court erred in its interpretation of fcc rule a and in affirming puco decision to award mci the tandem reciprocal compensation rate for calls that originate on sbc network and terminate on mci.we affirm the judgment of the district court.
facts and procedural history 
telecommunications act of and implementing regulations 
in,pursuant to the telecommunications act of the act or act,mci began negotiating an interconnection agreement with sbc for telephone service in northeastern ohio.such agreements were made possible by the act,which congress enacted to promote competition in all telecommunications markets,including the local service market.michigan bell.climax,cir.congress sought to eliminate monopolies and adopt a national policy for telecommunication competition in local markets.see at t iowa utils,d the telecommunications act of act or act,stat,fundamentally restructures local telephone markets.states may no longer enforce laws that impede competition,and incumbent local exchange carriers are subject to a host of duties intended to facilitate market entry.foremost among these duties is the local exchange carrier lec obligation under c,supp.ii to share its network with competitors.
before the act,local telephone service was mostly provided by monopolies,now commonly referred to as incumbent local exchange carriers incumbent providers.in this case,sbc is the incumbent provider for telephone service in northeast ohio.
in order to promote competition in the telecommunications market,the act requires incumbent providers to allow new market entrants,such as mci in this case,to utilize the incumbent provider network and buy the incumbent provider telecommunication services for a fair price.see a c.these arrangements were necessary to minimize the barriers to market entry erected during the period in which the incumbent provider functioned as a monopoly.pursuant to the act,the incumbent provider is required to negotiate an agreement,referred to as an interconnection agreement,with a new market entrant,or a competing local exchange carrier competing provider.if the parties can not agree upon certain terms in the agreement,either party can petition the state utility commission to arbitrate the open issues.see id.at b.the state commissions arbitrate the dispute,ensuring that its resolution of the open issues meets the requirements of the act and the federal communication commission fcc implementing regulations.id.at c.
after the state utilities commission arbitrates the open issues,the parties submit the completed interconnection agreement to the state commission,which either approves the final agreement or rejects it.the state commission may reject the agreement if it does not comply with the act or the fcc regulations,discriminates against other telecommunications providers,or is inconsistent with the public interest.id.at e.if either or both parties disagree with the interconnection agreement,as arbitrated by the state commission,they may seek review in federal district court.id.at e.
in the new competitive telecommunications marketplace,a customer who places a call through his provider may be routed from his provider network to another provider network in order to complete the call.this typically occurs when a person places a local call to someone who receives local telephone service from a different provider than that of the caller,an sbc customer calls an mci customer.in this situation,the calling party provider would require the assistance of the called party provider in switching the call over to the separate network.although the calling party pays only its provider for the call,the called party provider incurs costs in transporting and terminating the call.in the absence of an agreement with the calling party provider,the called party provider would go uncompensated for its service.
through interconnection agreements,the providers agree to a compensation structure that allows parties from different providers to seamlessly complete calls to one another.the act requires providers to enter into reciprocal compensation arrangements to compensate each other when calls are completed.id.at b.the reciprocal compensation rates are to be based upon a reasonable approximation of the additional costs incurred by the provider that transports and terminates the call that originates on another network.id.at d a ii.congress,however,elected to avoid inquiries into the actual costs incurred by providers.id.at d b ii the provision regarding reciprocal compensation shall not be construed to authorize the commission or any state commission to engage in any rate regulation proceeding to establish with particularity the additional costs of transporting or terminating calls,or to require carriers to maintain records with respect to the additional costs of such calls.instead,congress left the task of implementing the act,including the reciprocal rate provision,to the fcc.id.at d.
in,the fcc published its governing regulations regarding reciprocal compensation.the fcc concluded that reciprocal compensation rates should be symmetrical between interconnected telecommunications carriers and based on the incumbent provider cost studies.see a.thus,the state commission should apply the same rate no matter which provider,the incumbent or competitor,transports and terminates a call originating from the other network.
this regulation is based on the fcc conclusion that the incumbent provider costs for transporting and terminating a call should be a reasonable approximation,or presumptive proxy of the costs for other providers.in the matter of implementation of the local competition provisions in the telecommunications act of,both the incumbent lec and the interconnecting carriers usually will be providing service in the same geographic area,so the economic costs should be similar in most cases.we also conclude that using the incumbent lec costs for transport and termination of traffic as a proxy for the costs incurred by interconnecting carriers satisfies the requirement of section d that costs be determined on the basis of a reasonable approximation of the additional costs of terminating such calls.using the incumbent lec cost studies as proxies for reciprocal compensation is consistent with section d b ii,which prohibits establishing with particularity the additional costs of transporting or terminating calls.the incumbent economic cost study is relied upon to determine the appropriate costs because smaller new entrants are typically not in a position to conduct a economic cost study.id.
recognizing the intricacies of local telecommunications networks,beyond the general policy of symmetrical rates,the fcc established a more detailed scheme for determining reciprocal compensation rates.the approach takes into account the telecommunications equipment used to transfer and complete a particular tandem or switches.historically,incumbent providers used these two switches to route calls.a tandem switch acts as a hub connecting other switches and is generally able to handle calls over a broad geographic area.switches typically serve smaller geographic areas and fewer customers.acknowledging that the cost associated with transferring calls differs depending on the type of switch used,the fcc held that states may establish transport and termination rates in the arbitration process that vary according to whether the traffic is routed through a tandem switch or directly to the switch.in the matter of implementation of the local competition provisions in the telecommunications act of,at.the fcc also recognized that new entrants may utilize new technology other than the two switches commonly used by incumbent providers.in such event,states shall also consider whether these new technologies,fiber ring or wireless networks perform functions similar to those performed by an incumbent lec tandem switch and thus,whether some or all calls terminating on the new entrant network should be priced the same as the sum of transport and termination via the incumbent lec tandem switch.id.
most important to the issue currently before the court,the fcc established a rule for determining whether the new provider switch generally serves the same role as a tandem switch serves in the incumbent network,whether the entrant can charge the tandem rate when employing new technology.rule a provides where the switch of a carrier other than an incumbent lec serves a geographic area comparable to the area served by the incumbent lec tandem switch,the appropriate rate for the carrier other than an incumbent lec is the incumbent lec tandem interconnection rate.
the interconnection agreement between sbc and mci 
in this case,mci was beginning to offer local telephone service in ohio and sought an interconnection agreement from the incumbent provider,sbc.in,under state regulations,mci applied to puco for permission to offer local service in three ohio counties cuyahoga,franklin,and montgomery.puco examined mci business and technical capabilities and,on december,certified mci to provide local service in the three counties.
one of the sticking points during negotiation of the interconnection agreement was the appropriate reciprocal compensation rate that sbc would pay mci when mci incurred costs by transporting and terminating a call on its network that originated from sbc network.rather than using a series of tandem switches and switches,mci utilized new technology,especially fiber optic rings,to reach all of its customers in a local service area by using only one siemen class telecommunications switch located in cleveland,ohio.the parties could not agree upon the appropriate reciprocal compensation rate to compensate mci for transporting and terminating calls that originate on sbc network,and thus submitted this issue,along with nearly others,to puco for arbitration pursuant to.
puco considered the parties positions and accepted both written and live testimony during the arbitration proceeding,and,on january,issued its arbitration award.in the award,puco decided all outstanding issues and directed the parties to submit a modified interconnection agreement.
puco decided that mci could charge sbc the tandem reciprocal compensation rate rather than the lower end office reciprocal compensation rate.puco considered the prefiled testimony of maria marzulla,a senior manager of mci local network engineering group,who described mci technology and network capabilities.she testified that mci switches all serve areas at least equal in size if not greater than the serving area of the incumbent provider tandem switch,and cited to examples of mci network in baltimore and new york.although during live testimony,marzulla was unable to give an estimate of actual customers being served by mci switch at the time of the hearing,she reemphasized that the mci switch is capable of serving a geographic area comparable to the area served by sbc tandem switch.sbc did not offer testimony or evidence regarding the geographical reach of mci switch,but instead argued that mci was required to show that it was already servicing customers in a geographic area comparable to sbc.
puco rejected sbc argument 
the fundamental question then becomes does mci switch located in cleveland serve an area comparable to that served by ameritech tandem switch.we turn our attention to mci conditional certificate approved in case,wherein the commission granted mci authority to provide local telecommunications service in cuyahoga,franklin,and montgomery counties.we will presume,given the nature of mci operations,that mci shall serve the area for which we found it worthy of a certificate.in our view,that is a comparable service area.
in the matter of petition of mci telecommunications for arbitration pursuant to section b of the telecommunications act of to establish an interconnection agreement with ameritech ohio,puco arbitration.puco based its decision on the best information it had and asked the parties to provide regular reports to the commission telecommunications staff so that it may receive ongoing information.id.
appeal of the arbitration decision 
pursuant to e,sbc sought review of the arbitration determination in the united states district court,challenging various aspects of puco decision,including the reciprocal compensation rate finding.sbc claimed that,to the extent mci was permitted to charge the tandem reciprocal compensation rate,the agreement entered into after the arbitration violated d because mci had not shown that its switch actually served customers in a comparable geographic area as sbc.
on march,the district court affirmed puco decision awarding mci the tandem reciprocal compensation rate.the court concluded that puco applied the correct legal test because it considered the appropriate regulation,a.it then went on to conclude,under the arbitrary and capricious standard,that puco did not err in finding that mci had the capacity to serve a region in northeastern ohio for which it had applied and obtained a certificate of operation.order at.the court deferred to puco previous determination that mci was able to serve the area in question and the issuance of an operating license to mci.id.accordingly,sbc claim was dismissed.
ii.jurisdiction 
this case arises under the telecommunications act of,which permits a party to appeal the final arbitration decision of the state utilities commission to a federal district court.e.generally,this court has jurisdiction over an appeal from the district court order pursuant to.
appellee puco,however,argues that jurisdiction is lacking because the case is either moot or because the majority of sbc challenge to the reciprocal compensation rate is not yet ripe for decision.
first,we disagree with the contention that this case has been rendered moot by the parties interconnection agreement or the superseding interconnection agreement in.the fact that the parties accepted puco arbitration decisions and incorporated them into their interconnection agreement,and thus agreed to operate under such terms during the pendency of this appeal,does not preclude sbc from seeking reimbursement based on the lower rate.mci,a party to the agreement,agrees.if we were to hold otherwise and find that the interconnection agreement rendered the appeal from the arbitration decision moot,telecommunication companies would be forced to forgo entering into interconnection agreements in order to preserve their appeal.the new entrant to the market would not be able to efficiently serve its customers without an interconnection agreement until the appellate process ran its course,further entrenching the incumbent provider and creating the risk that the new entrant technology could become outdated in the meantime.parties are free to continue business relations with an understanding that one party might pursue appeal,and thus seek reimbursement,through the process permitted by federal law.see e.mci maintained its relationship with sbc with this understanding.see indiana bell.mccarty,cir considering the merits of an appeal from the arbitration decision despite the fact that the parties entered into,and operated under,an interconnection agreement that incorporated the arbitrator disputed decisions.
similarly,the parties most recent interconnection agreement,entered into in,does not affect the justiciability of sbc appeal.the contract expressly permits either party to seek a judicial order revising the agreement and authorizes retroactive relief,reimbursement for rates paid.the parties reserved all rights and remedies with respect to collection of rates and charges under the interconnection agreement.accordingly,by its express terms,the interconnection agreement does not render the instant appeal moot.
puco next argues that a refund,or retroactive relief,is not available to sbc under the filed rate doctrine.the classic example of application of the filed rate doctrine,often referred to as the filed tariff doctrine,can be found in the supreme court decision in louisville nashville maxwell.in tha
