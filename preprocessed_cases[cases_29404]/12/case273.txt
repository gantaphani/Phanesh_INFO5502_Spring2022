united states cellular corporation,a provider of wireless telephone services,sued the city of wichita falls for denying cellular permission to build a communications tower.cellular contended that the city decision was not supported by substantial evidence in a written record and therefore violated a provision of the telecommunications act of,c b iii west.the district court granted summary judgment for the city.because we agree with the district court that the city determination was supported by substantial evidence,we affirm.
the telecommunications act of balances two competing concerns.atc realty,llc town of kingston,cir.on one hand,congress found that siting and zoning decisions by units of government have created an inconsistent and,at times,conflicting patchwork of requirements for companies seeking to build wireless communications facilities,at,reprinted in.on the other hand,congress recognize d that there are legitimate state and local concerns involved in regulating the siting of such facilities.id.at,reprinted in at.congress reconciled these conflicting interests by explicitly preserving the zoning authority of local governments,see c a west,but imposing substantive and procedural limits on the exercise of that authority,see id.c b.in particular,the act requires that a locality decision to deny a building permit be supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record.id.c b iii.
the substantial evidence requirement is the focus of this suit.in,cellular identified a gap in its coverage in southwest wichita falls.to remedy the gap,cellular leased a parcel of land and planned to build an tower with a lightning rod.according to cellular,the tower was extremely unlikely to fall similar towers had withstood hurricane and winds.
pursuant to city ordinance,cellular applied for a conditional use permit from the wichita falls planning and zoning commission pzc.see wichita falls,zoning ordinance.the pzc investigated cellular application,compared it to the city recently passed zoning ordinance for communications towers and issued a report.the report found that the proposed tower did not meet several of the guidelines set forth in the ordinance.first,the ordinance provides that a communications tower should be setback from and adjacent properties equivalent to the height of the tower.wichita falls,zoning ordinance a.the proposed tower would have been set back only feet from the northern property line,only feet from the southern property line,and only feet from the eastern property line.however,pzc staff determined that the setbacks would still have been consistent with the intent of the ordinance because the tower would have met minimum wind load requirements and would have been compatible with adjacent land uses and zoning districts.second,the zoning ordinance provides that towers shall not be located closer than feet from an adjacent residential use or residential zoning boundary.wichita falls,zoning ordinance a.the proposed tower would have been set back only feet from the nearest residence and only feet from the nearest residential zone.once again,however,the pzc determined that the setbacks would be sufficient because t he height of the proposed tower would not have pose d a hazard to any adjacent residential structure and because b eing separated from neighboring residential districts by commercial uses would have insure d protection of these areas both from a safety and aesthetic standpoint.the pzc ultimately voted to approve the application conditionally but made full approval subject to cellular obtaining a variance from the airport board of adjustment,which had to determine that a tower would not interfere with the operations of nearby kickapoo airpark 
the airport board of adjustment denied cellular request for a variance.to comply with the ruling of the airport board,cellular reduced the size of the proposed tower from feet to feet.although cellular had maintained that it required a tower,it did not challenge the airport board decision.
meanwhile,a local resident appealed the pzc decision to the wichita falls city council.see wichita falls,zoning ordinance providing for appeal.in july,the council heard presentations from cellular and from wichita falls residents opposed to the tower.much of the council discussion focused on how the proposed tower,even at its reduced height of feet,failed to meet the setback standards established in the new zoning ordinance.the council ultimately voted to revoke the permit approved by the pzc.in an ordinance passed a few weeks after the meeting,the council listed its reasons for revoking the permit violation s of setback rules and concerns about the safety and operations of nearby kickapoo airpark.wichita falls,ordinance,
cellular promptly filed suit in federal district court pursuant to c b v,which authorizes suit by any person adversely affected by any final action inconsistent with the procedural or substantive protections of the telecommunications act.the complaint alleged that the city council decision was not in writing as required by c b iii that the city council decision was not supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record as required by c b iii and that the city council had unreasonably discriminate d against cellular in violation of c b i i.the suit sought an injunction ordering the city to approve cellular permit application.cellular moved for summary judgment,but the district court,finding no genuine issue of material fact,instead granted summary judgment in favor of the city cellular now appeals only one facet of the district court ruling that the revocation was supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record.
we review de novo a district court ruling on a motion for summary judgment and use the same legal standard that the district court used.wyatt hunt plywood,cir.although other circuits have heard challenges brought under c the construction and application of this provision is an issue of first impression in this circuit 
the telecommunications act does not define the term substantial evidence.preferred sites,llc troup county,cir.however,substantial evidence is a legal term of art,so presumably congress intended the term to carry the same meaning it carries in administrative law.see mcdermott int l,wilander,d.the act legislative history confirms this presumption the conference report states that t he phrase substantial evidence contained in a written record is the traditional standard used for judicial review of agency actions.conf,at,reprinted in.
accordingly,substantial evidence is such reasonable evidence that a reasonable mind would accept to support a conclusion,nlrb,cir quoting universal camera nlrb.a finding of substantial evidence requires more than a mere scintilla and less than a preponderance.masterson barnhart,cir quoting newton apfel,cir.the reviewing court must take into account contradictory evidence in the record am.textile mfrs,donovan,d.however,the reviewing court may not the evidence or substitute its judgment for the judgment of the local government.boyd apfel,cir.substantial evidence review is therefore highly deferential.voicestream minneapolis,croix county,cir quoting second generation,town of pelham,cir.the plaintiff carries the burden of proving that no substantial evidence supports the local government decision.voicestream,am.tower lp city of huntsville,cir bell mobile,todd,cir.
in the context of the telecommunications act,the substantial evidence standard limits the types of reasons that a zoning authority may use to justify its decision.first,generalized concerns about aesthetics or property values do not constitute substantial evidence.primeco personal communications.partnership city of mequon,cir preferred sites,at omnipoint zoning hearing,cir.
