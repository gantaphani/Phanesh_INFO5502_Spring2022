global crossing telecommunications,petitions for review of an order of the federal communications commission fcc,requiring global crossing to pay verizon telephone companies compensation for payphone calls originating from verizon payphones and routed over global crossing network finding the fcc decision consistent with the statutory scheme and neither arbitrary nor capricious,we deny the petition for review.
in of the telecommunications act of congress directed the fcc to 
prescribe regulations that 
a establish a per call compensation plan to ensure that all payphone service providers are fairly compensated for each and every completed intrastate and interstate call using their payphone and 
b discontinue all intrastate and interstate payphone subsidies from basic exchange and exchange access revenues,in favor of a compensation plan as specified in subparagraph a.
b a,b pursuant to congress direction,the fcc issued orders in that implemented the provisions of,including paragraphs a and b.see report and order,implementation of the pay telephone reclassification and compensation provisions of the telecommunications act of,fcc rcd,wl order on reconsideration,fcc rcd,wl,aff in part and remanded in part sub nom.illinois pub.telecomm.ass,collectively,payphone orders.
with respect to paragraph a,the fcc required interexchange carriers ixcs that carry calls originating from payphones to compensate the payphone service provider psp see a e very carrier to whom a completed call from a payphone is routed shall compensate the payphone service provider for the call at a rate agreed upon by the parties by contract.report and order,payphone orders,fcc rcd at,id.at.previously,psps had received no revenue for originating certain calls such as subscriber and other number calls and were prohibited from blocking callers from making some of those calls such as access code calls.see bell frontier communications servs,fcc rcd,com.car.bur hereinafter bureau order.the commission concluded that psps must be compensated for all such calls,and determined that ixcs,as the primary beneficiaries of those calls,should be responsible for providing that compensation.see id.at,report and order,payphone orders,fcc rcd at.
to implement paragraph b,the fcc ruled that in order to receive compensation for completed calls originating from its payphones,a psp that is also a local exchange carrier lec psp,see supra note,must be able to certify that it has complied with several requirements,including the institution of effective intrastate tariffs reflecting the removal of charges that recover the costs of payphones and any intrastate payphone subsidies.order on reconsideration,payphone orders,fcc rcd at.the fcc delegated to its common carrier bureau the authority to make any necessary determination as to whether a lec has complied with all requirements for compensation.id.at.
verizon is a lec psp that offers local exchange and payphone services in the northeast and states.global crossing is an ixc that provides both interstate and intrastate telephone toll service.since october,when the per call compensation requirement became effective,verizon has delivered calls from its payphones to global crossing.
in june,in order to obtain compensation for calls originating from verizon payphones and carried by global crossing,verizon presented global crossing with signed letters attesting that it had complied with all of the conditions for receiving compensation,including the elimination of intrastate subsidies.global crossing replied that it would not pay compensation until verizon provided additional information,specified by global crossing,establishing that verizon had in fact satisfied the compensation eligibility the removal of those subsidies.in june,representatives of verizon and global crossing met with staff of the common carrier bureau,who advised that under the fcc rules and orders,ixcs must compensate a lec payphone service provider upon receipt of the lec certification of eligibility without further inquiry or requirements.bureau order,fcc rcd at.nonetheless,global crossing continued to refuse to pay,and,on july,verizon filed a formal complaint with the fcc pursuant to the complaint alleged that global crossing had violated,as well as,by failing to compensate verizon for more than calls.complaint.
in september,the common carrier bureau held that verizon had adequately certified its compliance with the prerequisites for receiving compensation and ordered global crossing to pay verizon for applicable past and future calls.bureau order,fcc rcd at.the bureau determined that t he term certification does not mandate that a lec payphone service provider prove to the ixc payor that it has satisfied each compensation eligibility prerequisite,but rather requires that a lec attest authoritatively to an ixc payor that such lec payphone service provider has satisfied each prerequisite.id.emphasis added.the bureau found that interpretation to be consistent with prior commission orders,and permissible under the language of.id.at.and it held that if global crossing or any other ixc wished to question the veracity of a lec certification,it was obliged to do so by filing its own complaint with the commission,rather than by simply refusing to make payment.id.at.
the fcc affirmed the bureau decision in all respects.order on review,bell frontier communications,fcc rcd,wl hereinafter fcc order.the commission also refused to consider global crossing affirmative defense that verizon in fact,had not qualified for payphone compensation.id.at.the commission held that this affirmative defense was irrelevant to evaluating global crossing obligation to pay upon receiving certification,and was not properly before the bureau in the context of a complaint filed by a lec psp.id.t he proper way for an ixc to challenge a lec failure to remove unlawful subsidies,the fcc declared,is to initiate a section proceeding at the commission.id.at.
global crossing contends that the fcc determination,that an ixc must pay a lec psp compensation merely upon certification that the lec has discontinued subsidizing its payphone service,is neither consistent with of the telecommunications act nor the product of reasoned decisionmaking.we consider these two arguments below.
in addressing global crossing statutory argument,we apply the framework of chevron natural resources defense council,d we first ask whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue,in which case we must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.id.at.if,however,the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,we move to the second step and defer to the agency interpretation as long as it is based on a permissible construction of the statute,id.at,and is reasonable in light of the act text,legislative history,and purpose,southern cal.edison ferc.
global crossing asserts that permitting verizon to receive compensation merely upon its certification that it has discontinued subsidies is inconsistent with the express language of,which requires the commission to promulgate regulations that discontinue all intrastate and interstate payphone subsidies in favor of a compensation plan.b b.that language,global crossing argues,ties the timing of the receipt of compensation to the removal of the subsidies,rendering verizon unqualified to receive compensation until it first removes all of its subsidies.reply br.at.by allowing verizon to rely on certification alone,petitioner continues,the fcc permitted the lec psp to receive per call compensation without regard to whether it had in fact discontinued its payphone subsidies.
the fcc does not disagree that requires verizon to discontinue subsidies before it may receive compensation.indeed,the bureau decision emphasize s that a lec certification letter does not substitute for the lec obligation to comply with the requirements for compensation,and that lecs must satisfy the requirements to be eligible to receive compensation.bureau order,fcc rcd at.the commission rightly notes,however,that the statute is silent regarding the mechanism the fcc should adopt to ensure
