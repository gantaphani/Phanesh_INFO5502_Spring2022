the telecommunications act of requires the local phone companies that were spun off from the old to supply services that will enable new entrants to compete in the business.it is conventional to call the established phone companies incumbent local exchange carriers ilecs,their rivals competitive local exchange carriers clecs,and the services that the clecs want to buy unbundled network elements or unes.the act requires ilecs to negotiate with clecs for contracts that specify the price that clecs pay for unes.if they can not agree either initially or when the contracts expire,then state utilities commissions may arbitrate the dispute.this is an unusual sense of arbitration because it has most elements of standard ratemaking and is reviewable in federal court,another change made by the act,but unlike ratemaking this process does not occur unless private entities are unable to work out their own bargain.state commissions are required to follow directions issued by the federal communications commission,which has decided that the price of unes should be based on the cost that an efficient ilec would incur to provide the service using modern technology.that the total element incremental cost approach or telric,see still another big departure from ratemaking,which was based on historical costs.the supreme court lengthy opinion in verizon communications fcc,d,describes how the system works and holds that telric is a valid way to implement the act.
illinois bell had been operating subsidiary in illinois before ma bell breakup,and it was spun off as a subsidiary of ameritech,which comprised all operations in the midwest.by the time of the act,a decade after the divestiture,the old local subsidiaries had joined many other firms in offering service in competition with.the act enabled to turn the tables,and it began to offer local service,competing with its old operating companies using unes purchased under the new statute.
the first wave of contracts in illinois was negotiated amicably,but when they began to expire illinois bell took the position that prices should be substantially increased,to which the clecs did not agree.instead of asking for arbitration,illinois bell filed with the illinois commerce commission icc,an acronym no longer ambiguous after the abolition of the interstate commerce commission a tariff stating the price at which it would make unes available to all clecs.any clec could take that price or negotiate for something better,with arbitration to follow if need be.
before the icc could act,the illinois legislature stepped in and directed the agency to use exactly the old contract formula with two adjustments lower fill factors and higher depreciation.a fill factor is the proportion of an efficient network that will be used at any given time.it makes no sense to build new network elements ilecs build on the assumption that demand will grow,and this enables them to choose equipment and avoid disruptions such as digging up the streets every month to add new cable.if an efficient fill factor is,then the capital component of the telric price for a une is double what it would be at,for each une effectively must compensate the ilec for the equipment necessary to supply two circuits.similarly,higher depreciation raises the telric price because it implies that capital equipment must be replaced faster.the state legislature required the icc to use fill factors and depreciation favorable to illinois bell,and to tamper with nothing else.
in its role as a clec sued its former subsidiary,and the federal district court held that this statute violated the act because only an agency,and not a legislature,may act on behalf of a state.we disagreed with that conclusion but held that the statute is invalid nonetheless,because it had disabled the icc from setting a proper telric rate.communications of illinois,illinois bell telephone,cir.to follow telric the agency must look at the current cost of providing unes and can not freeze any element of the calculation.our opinion added that the choice of fill factor and depreciation rate are just sidelights the agency should concentrate on the bottom line whether the rate per une is a sound estimate of costs in competition rather than on ingredients,for in competition supply and demand,not particular items of cost,determine prices.our opinion wrapped up by instructing the icc to reinstate,and resolve,the tariff proceeding that illinois bell had initiated.
two years later the icc finished the job,issuing a,opinion that raised the price per une by more than the clecs wanted but not as much as illinois bell had proposed.a group of clecs filed was not among them.in the interim ameritech had merged with sbc formerly southwestern bell,and sbc in turn had acquired what was left of and sbc then changed its own name to.so once again is in the business of both long distance and local telephone service,but there is much more competition in both segments of the market than years ago with cell phone providers,cable tv proprietors,and companies offering both local and long distance service in competition with landline carriers.the act is itself technologically creaky the assumptions of a decade ago no longer describe the state of competition in this business,and with the advent of competition from so many new sources the whole regulatory assumes that each ilec retains a natural monopoly on local cabling and open to question.the fcc has moved away from the act model to the extent the law allows and has permitted proprietors of new technologies to act as pure competitors,without an obligation to share their facilities with business rivals.see,national cable telecommunications association brand x internet services,d.verizon communications law offices of curtis trinko,llp,d antitrust laws do not require ilecs to cooperate with clecs in sharing or selling facilities.a requirement may delay innovation.see marc bourreau pinar dogan,strategies in the local loop,am.econ.papers proceedings.but open competition is not an option for landline services offered by ilecs,to which the act squarely applies.thus we,like the icc,must apply telric to illinois bell tariff.
the clecs contend that the icc made three errors,each of which increased the price per une it set the fill factor too low,it set depreciation too high,and it assumed an inefficient mix of equipment.illinois bell filed its own suit,contending that the price per une had been set too low because the icc had not allowed it to earn a fully competitive rate of return on investment.other arguments were made in the district court but have not been renewed on appeal,so we disregard them.the district court concluded that the icc acted properly with respect to fill factors and depreciation but had erred with respect to the equipment mix and the rate of return on investment,and it ordered the commission to revise the tariff accordingly.d.the district judge also considered a further issue whether the act preempts all tariff proceedings,as the clecs maintain.the judge gave a negative answer,and we start with that subject because it has the potential to make everything else irrelevant.
wisconsin bell,bie,cir,on which the clecs rely,holds that states may not insist that ilecs file tariffs for unes.the act starts with contracts rather than tariffs,see a,and state regulators serve as arbitrators rather than,b.forcing ilecs to file tariffs is equivalent to compelling them to make public their reservation price that is,the lowest price they will accept in bargaining.that would unhinge the act system,we concluded,for it would give the clecs an extra opportunity they could take the offer if it turned out to be attractive,or bargain for still lower prices in the knowledge that the price never could exceed the tariff.in ordinary contracting,by contrast,someone who rejects an initial offer takes the chance that the final deal will be at a higher price.we held that states must respect the statute framework bargaining precedes the involvement of regulatory officials,and in bargaining the parties may keep their reservation prices to themselves and may raise their demands as part of the bargaining proce
