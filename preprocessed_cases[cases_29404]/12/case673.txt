this case involves the fcc regulation of special access broadband lines that connect individual businesses to their incumbent local exchange carriers.businesses need dedicated special access lines to utilize essential broadband applications.in many areas,however,only one incumbent local exchange carrier usually,verizon,or qwest maintains the special access lines that connect to individual businesses in that locale.the last mile for broadband business customers thus differs from the analogous last mile for residential customers,who typically have at least two wires into their homes over which they can obtain internet service namely,their traditional telephone and cable lines.the ilecs current control of most special access lines into businesses forms the backdrop for the fcc action in this case.
applying its statutory forbearance authority,the fcc largely eliminated what the commission refers to as pricing regulation with respect to special access well as those of two smaller ilecs,embarq and frontier.but at the same time,the fcc maintained basic title ii regulation on those ilecs special access lines,including requirements for interconnection and that ilecs prices be just,reasonable,and not unreasonably discriminatory.
a coalition of businesses,as well as competitive broadband providers that lease special access lines from the ilecs,argue that the fcc decision was arbitrary and capricious under the administrative procedure act.they contend that the fcc must continue to impose not just regulation but also pricing regulation on ilecs with respect to their special access lines.we disagree.applying the deferential arbitrary and capricious standard,we find the fcc decision to recalibrate the degree of regulation imposed on the ilecs special access lines to be reasonable and reasonably explained.we therefore deny the petitions for review.
the background leading to this case is familiar to many,but we recount it briefly.in so doing,we will simplify the story a bit and strive to keep the jargon to a minimum.
federal communications law historically distinguished telephone systems and cable systems.on the one hand,wireline telecommunications services have been governed by title ii of the communications act of,which imposes various requirements on telecommunications carriers.
by contrast,cable services have been governed by a separate set of obligations set forth in title vi of the act.cable services have generally been exempt from mandatory regulation.
broadband services do not correspond to the old regulatory divide a residential customer can obtain or broadband internet access over the telephone line through digital subscriber line dsl service offered by local telephone companies,or through cable modem service offered by cable companies,among other newer alternatives provided by satellite companies and electric companies.see cable telecomm.ass brand x internet,d.
the fcc ultimately decided that services offering the same essential functions to residential customers should not be regulated under different statutory frameworks simply because of the wire used.to harmonize its regulatory approach,the fcc ruled that many obligations would not apply to residential broadband lines,whether dsl or cable modem.see internet over cable declaratory ruling,see also wireline broadband order,see generally brand x,at.daniel spulber christopher yoo,rethinking broadband internet access,harv.tech.
unlike residential customers who typically rely on their telephone or cable wires to obtain broadband internet service,business customers ordinarily can obtain essential broadband services only through a dedicated special access line owned by an ilec such as,verizon,or qwest.see worldcom,fcc,lawrence sullivan,is competition policy possible in high tech markets an inquiry into antitrust,intellectual property,and broadband regulation as applied to the new economy,case res.because one ilec usually controls the only special access line to an individual business,there is of course concern that the ilec might charge unduly excessive rates or improperly discriminate against unaffiliated broadband service providers seeking to lease its lines.
as a starting point,the fcc has determined that title ii pricing and regulations largely still apply to the ilecs special access lines,absent forbearance.see wireline broadband order,at.the issue for the fcc,therefore,has been when and how much to forbear from applying the title ii obligations using its statutory forbearance authority.see.to put that choice into context,some overview of title ii and the fcc regulations is necessary.
title ii imposes certain mandatory requirements on interstate telecommunications carriers.for example,telecommunications carriers must charge just and reasonable rates.id.b.telecommunications carriers must not engage in unreasonable discrimination.id.a.and telecommunications carriers must allow other carriers to interconnect with their networks.id.a.
additional statutory pricing regulation also applies to what the fcc refers to as dominant carriers.as relevant here,dominant carriers are typically subject to regulation or price caps accompanied by stringent tariff advance filing rules,whereas common carriers are not.see id.b,a compare,with id.a ii,c 
title ii was enacted in in part to regulate monopolistic telephone service,at a time when broadband service obviously was not offered.as congress and the fcc have recognized,regulation of broadband can pose different issues and challenges than regulation of local telephony.
in,to guide the fcc regulation of broadband in the residential and business markets,congress enacted of the telecommunications act.
section directs the commission to encourage the deployment of broadband on a reasonable and timely basis.naturally,there are different ideas about the best means to achieve that statutory example,some advocate a more approach which would spur more competition and others favor a more,approach.
interestingly,and perhaps not surprisingly given the compromises necessary to reach agreement on such a massive piece of legislation,congress did not choose between those competing philosophies for broadband regulation.to be sure,the preamble to the act does say that it is to promote competition and reduce regulation,stat,emphasis added.but speaks in very broad terms and instructs the fcc to facilitate broadband deployment by utilizing,in a manner consistent with the public interest,convenience,and necessity,price cap regulation,regulatory forbearance,measures that promote competition in the local telecommunications market,or other regulating methods that remove barriers to infrastructure investment.and mandates that,if broadband capability is not being sufficiently deployed,the commission shall take immediate action to accelerate deployment of such capability by removing barriers to infrastructure investment and by promoting competition in the telecommunications market.
the general and generous phrasing of means that the fcc possesses significant,albeit not unfettered,authority and discretion to settle on the best regulatory or deregulatory approach to statutory reality that assumes great importance when parties implore courts to overrule fcc decisions on this topic.
as contemplated by,the fcc has utilized forbearance from certain title ii regulations as one tool in its broadband strategy.forbearance decisions are governed by the communications act,codified as amended at,which provides that any telecommunications carrier may file a petition with the fcc requesting that the commission forbear from applying any communications act provisions or fcc rules to specific services.under,the fcc must grant forbearance if enforcement is unnecessary to ensure that rates and practices are just,reasonable,and not unreasonably discriminatory enforcement is unnecessary to protect consumers and forbearance is consistent with the public interest,in that it will promote competitive market conditions and enhance competition among providers of telecommunications services.
until recently,ilecs such as,verizon,and qwest had been subject to both basic and pricing regulation with respect to their specia
