ranger cellular and miller communications,appeal from an order of the federal communications commission fcc rejecting challenge to four licenses issued by the fcc to provide cellular phone service in rural markets.we conclude that the appellants lack standing to challenge the validity of the licenses,and we therefore dismiss that challenge for want of jurisdiction.although have standing to challenge the fcc denial of their alternative demand for a refund of their filing fees,we affirm that denial because it was based on a reasonable reading of the agency own regulation.
we have recently set forth some of the history of this litigation in a related case,ranger cellular miller communications,fcc,i,and discuss only the necessary background here.historically,the fcc first awarded cellular licenses using comparative hearings,and then,starting in,also began awarding them by lottery.after,the commission employed lotteries exclusively.appellants filed applications in and to participate in lotteries for cellular telephone licenses in eight rural service area rsa markets,but lost each lottery in which they participated.the commission awarded most of the licenses to initial lottery winners,but by the the initial winners were disqualified in each of the eight rsas.the fcc planned to hold relotteries to determine replacement winners,and,in the meantime,granted interim operating authority to cellular telephone licensees in adjacent areas to provide service.see i,at in the matter of implementation of competitive bidding rules to license certain rural service areas,notice of proposed rule making,fcc rcd,wl hereinafter competitive bidding rules,nprm.
before the fcc was able to award the permanent licenses,however,congress enacted the balanced budget act of,pub,stat.with limited exceptions,the balanced budget act amended the communications act by terminating the fcc authority to issue any license or permit using a system of random selection after july,i a,and requiring it to use instead a system of competitive bidding,id.j in april,concluding that it was without authority to process the pending mutually exclusive rsa applications pursuant to the rules and requirements of the lottery system,the fcc dismissed without prejudice all pending applications for the cellular telephone licenses at issue in this case,including.in the matter of certain cellular rural service area applications,fcc rcd,wl dismissing pending applications for six of the rsa markets in the matter of cellular rural service area applications in markets and,wtb april,at dismissing pending applications for two of the rsa markets.
on january,the fcc proposed holding an auction open to all interested bidders at which it would award licenses for those rsas for which licenses had not yet been awarded or designated.competitive bidding rules,nprm,fcc rcd at.by that time,there were only four such rsas.id opposed that proposal,contending that both a provision of the balanced budget act and principles of equity required the fcc to limit the pool of bidders to those that had filed applications prior to july.the commission rejected those contentions and implemented its open auction proposal.in the matter of implementation of competitive bidding rules to license certain rural service areas,report and order,fcc rcd,wl hereinafter competitive bidding rules,report and order.although eligible to do so,did not participate in the auctions.on june,the fcc completed the auctions,and thereafter petitioned this court for review.on july,we rejected arguments and denied their petition.i,at.
in the present action,challenge the validity of the remaining four of the eight rsa licenses for which they originally applied.three of those licensees won their respective lotteries in and,but were disqualified in because their percentage of foreign ownership exceeded the statutory limits.in re applications of cellwave telephone services,futurewave general partners,and great western cellular partners,fcc rcd,wl b.this circuit upheld those dismissals.great cellular partners fcc,wl cellwave.services fcc.in december,however,congress passed the launching our communities access to local television act of local television act,which directed the fcc to reinstate the three dismissed applicants.see district of columbia appropriations act of fy,pub,stat.pursuant to the local television act,the fcc awarded those licenses to the congressional designees in march.in an application to the fcc,challenged those awards on the ground that,in directing the reinstatements,the local television act violated the constitutional separation of powers by overruling the final judgment of this court.
also submitted a petition for reconsideration to the fcc wireless telecommunications bureau wireless bureau,challenging a fourth license that the fcc issued to zephyr in.following the disqualification of an initial lottery winner,zephyr application had been selected in an april relottery.its license had not yet been issued,however,when the balanced budget act was passed in,and zephyr was among the pending applications that the fcc dismissed in.in,the fcc reinstated zephyr application and awarded it a license.in the matter of zephyr,fcc rcd,wl wtb.argued that the award to zephyr conflicted with the provision of the balanced budget act that barred the issuance of licenses using lotteries after july.see i a.finally,also sought reconsideration of the wireless bureau rejection of their request,in the alternative,for a refund of their initial filing fees in the event that their other challenges were denied.
on may,the fcc rejected challenges to the award of the four licenses.in the matter of certain cellular rural service area applications,opinion and order,fcc rcd,wl hereinafter opinion and order.the commission found that the local television act required it to reinstate the three congressional designees and that it lacked the power to declare an act of congress unconstitutional.id.at.the commission also concluded that,although the balanced budget act barred it from conducting new lotteries after july,the act did not bar the fcc from processing zephyr application by using the results of a lottery that had taken place prior to that date.id.at.the commission did not address alternative request for a refund of filing fees,leaving the wireless bureau rejection in place.
now appeal both the denial of their challenges to the four licenses and the denial of their request for a refund.
the fcc advances a threshold objection to challenge to the four licenses,asserting that the appellants lack standing to raise such a claim.as the supreme court has explained,the irreducible constitutional minimum requirements of standing are 
that the plaintiff have suffered an injury in fact an invasion of a judicially cognizable interest which is a concrete and particularized and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical that there be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of the injury must be fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant,and not the result of the independent action of some third party not before the court and that it be likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.
bennett spear,d accord lujan defenders of wildlife,d.the question here is whether satisfy the third,redressability prong.we conclude that they do not.
contend that their injury would be redressed by vacating the award of the four challenged licenses because,if the licenses were withdrawn,would have a reasonable chance of obtaining them.the appellants concede that,if the awards were vacated,the balanced budget act would require the fcc to reassign the licenses via auction.reply br.at but they contend that such an auction would have to be closed that is,limited to bidders from the original pool that applied for the lotteries in and.id.at.and because the remaining members of that original pool are a small number of small companies like,the appellants believe they would have a reasonable chance of submitting winning bids.id.at.
the flaw in this argument is that the consequence of a victory on this appeal would no
