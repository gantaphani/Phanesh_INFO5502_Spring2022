defendants avelino leon and victor aceves were arrested as part of an investigation into the drug trafficking organization,which was believed by law enforcement agencies to be one of the most violent drug trafficking organizations in the republic of mexico.defendants seek to suppress the contents and all fruits of five wiretaps that were instituted as part of the investigation,claiming that the wiretaps violated california law,subd.d and the fourth amendment in that the government affidavits in support of the applications failed to establish necessity for the wiretaps.
both the superior court and the court of appeal determined that the wiretaps were lawful and denied defendants motion to suppress.we affirm.
background 
the five wiretaps at issue and,wiretap extension,and wiretap extension and part of a multiagency task force investigation of a major narcotics trafficking organization that culminated in the arrest of people in the united states.the arrests included narcotics suppliers,importers,distributors,transporters,and customers.approximately kilos of cocaine,pounds of marijuana,million in united states currency,and numerous firearms including assault weapons were seized.
evidence obtained from the wiretaps was used to prosecute defendants avelino leon and victor aceves in state court.after the superior court denied their motions to suppress the contents of the wiretaps and any evidence seized therefrom,leon pleaded no contest to possession with intent to distribute in excess of kilos of cocaine and was sentenced to years in prison.aceves pleaded no contest to conspiracy to sell in excess of kilos of cocaine,as well as use of a false compartment in a motor vehicle with intent to conceal controlled substances,and was sentenced to years,eight months.
the los angeles county district attorney application for wiretap,dated january,was supported by an affidavit from stephen diederich,a special agent with the federal drug enforcement administration.the application described target telephone as a prepaid cell phone subscribed to by one guillermo rodriguez of west street in lawndale and requested authorization to intercept communications by rodriguez,leon,aceves,unidentified males and,and other coconspirators.special agent diederich stated that guillermo rodriguez was an unidentified person and that the lawndale address was a fictitious defendants leon and aceves did reside at west street in lawndale.diederich explained that,in his experience,drug traffickers frequently use prepaid cell phones because no identification is required,the phones can be thrown away at any time,and the replacement phone can not be traced back to the user.
the affidavit described an ongoing investigation using wiretaps into a drug trafficking organization with associates in los angeles.the investigation had resulted in the arrests of several conspirators and the issuance of arrest warrants for other fugitives.a prior wiretap on a discarded prepaid cell phone wiretap had revealed numerous contacts during the period of april to june between narcotics traffickers from the los distribution network and an unidentified male,who was believed to be a united manager for the organization.special agent diederich believed that target telephone was being used by the holder of the discarded cell phone that was the subject of the prior wiretap,or by a person playing a similar role in the organization,because the phones had dialed more than two dozen numbers in common.prior intercepts of conversations involving those common numbers related to the manufacturing of methamphetamine,money laundering,and illegal border crossings.
the affidavit declared that a wiretap was necessary in order to achieve the objectives of the,obtaining direct evidence to convince a jury beyond a reasonable doubt of the full scope,extent,and personnel of the narcotics trafficking conspiracies the identity and role of all suppliers of narcotics to the identified conspirators the identity and role of the main customers of the identified conspirators the stash location where the narcotics were stored before distribution the organization method of distributing narcotics and the management and disposition of proceeds generated by the organization narcotics trafficking.special agent diederich then listed the investigative techniques he had already used or had considered using in the investigation and explained why these techniques were not likely to succeed in identifying all members of the organization and establishing beyond a reasonable doubt the full scope of the conspiracy.these techniques included the use of a confidential informant the conduct of physical surveillance the use of pen registers,devices,toll analysis,and telephone subscriber information search warrants and trash searches and witness interviews,grand jury subpoenas,and grants of immunity.diederich noted,in particular,that he had been unable to identify the true user of target telephone or to locate the target telephone physical whereabouts.
special agent diederich also explained that,based on his training and experience,leaders of narcotics trafficking organizations often do not physically handle the narcotics.because traffickers issue logistical instructions by telephone and thus avoid contact with the narcotics,law enforcement would be able to discover,through the interception of target telephone,when narcotics shipments arrive and which cell heads are to receive those shipments.
los angeles county superior court judge larry fidler approved the application on january,finding probable cause to believe that the target subjects had committed,were committing,and were about to commit offenses involving the importation,possession for sale,transportation,and sale of cocaine and conspiracy to commit these offenses,subd.a probable cause to believe that communications concerning these crimes had been,were being,and would be made over target telephone,and that information concerning those crimes would be obtained through the interception,subds.b,c and that normal investigative procedures had been tried and had failed or reasonably appeared either to be unlikely to succeed if tried or to be too dangerous,subd.d.the wiretap was approved for days.
the remaining wiretaps 
based on the information obtained from wiretap,special agent diederich confirmed that leon was the user of target telephone and submitted a new application wiretap for that cell phone,four other cell phones,and two pagers.the affidavit disclosed that aerial surveillance in january had proved unhelpful,that the intercepted conversations had been extremely coded and the participants had identified themselves for the most part only by moniker,and that the identities of the users and the physical whereabouts of most of the phones were unknown.
the affidavits for the remaining wiretap application extensions recounted the progress of the investigation,including the seizure of eight kilos of cocaine from a los angeles hotel and the seizure of in cash at the los angeles international airport in january,the seizure of pounds of marijuana at an alhambra apartment in february,and the seizure of kilos of cocaine in three separate incidents in april and may.the affidavits also recited that the seizures nonetheless had yielded little information as to the organization source of supply or method of distribution that the task force attempts at physical and aerial surveillance had been detected and,on occasion,compromised and that leon appeared to be coordinating a large shipment of narcotics in the near future.on september,agents from the drug enforcement administration arrested people,including leon and aceves.
discussion 
in general,california law prohibits wiretapping.people zepeda th,d see.the wiretap act of authorized specified law enforcement officials to apply for a court order to intercept wire communications,but only where there was probable cause to believe the target was involved in the importation,possession for sale,transportation,manufacture,or sale of heroin,cocaine,pcp,or methamphetamine in specified quantities,or in a conspiracy to commit those offenses.former,subd.a,added by stats,ch.in,the legislature enacted section et in order to expand california wiretap law to conform to the federal law.com.on crim,on bill reg.sess.as amended,thus,the district attorney or other specified individual could apply to the presiding judge of the superior court or a designee for an order to intercept not only wire communications but also electronic digital pager and electronic cellular telephone communications.former,added by stats,ch.the new scheme also expanded the list of target crimes to include murder,solicitation to commit murder,the commission of a crime involving the bombing of public or private property,or aggravated kidnapping,former subd.a,added by stats,ch.subsequent amendments added to the list of target crimes the participation in a criminal street gang,subd.a,amended by,approved,as well as felonies involving weapons of mass destruction or restricted biological agents,subd.a,amended by stats,ch.
under current section,the designated judge may authorize a wiretap if there is probable cause to believe that an individual has committed,is committing,or is about to commit one or more of the listed crimes,subd.a there is probable cause to believe that communications concerning the illegal activities will be obtained through that interception,subd.b there is probable cause to believe that the communications device will be used by the person whose communications are to be intercepted,subd.c and n ormal investigative procedures have been tried and have failed or reasonably appear either to be unlikely to succeed if tried or to be too dangerous,subd.d section d.
defendants do not challenge the issuing court finding of probable cause as to any of the wiretaps.they complain only that the wiretap applications were not supported by an adequate showing of necessity within the meaning of section d,and that the evidence seized as fruit of the wiretaps must be suppressed under section because defendants claim of constitutional error parallels their claim of statutory error,we begin with their claim that the wiretap applications failed to support judge fidler finding of necessity under section d.people jackson th,fn,d see generally people mckay cal th,fn,d.
our analysis of section is necessarily informed by title iii of the omnibus crime control and safe streets act of,united states code sections,which provides a comprehensive scheme for the regulation of wiretapping and electronic surveillance.people otto cal th,d.as we have previously observed,title iii establishes minimum standards for the admissibility of evidence procured through electronic surveillance state law can not be less protective of privacy than the federal act.otto,supra,cal th at,d.with respect to necessity,the sole issue presented here,state law and federal law employ identical language.each requires the judge,before authorizing a wiretap,to find that normal investigative techniques have been tried and have failed or reasonably appear to be unlikely to succeed if tried or to be too dangerous.c,d.
the requirement of necessity is designed to ensure that wiretapping is neither routinely employed as the initial step in criminal investigation united states giordano,d nor resorted to in situations where traditional investigative techniques would suffice to expose the crime.united states kahn,fn,d.the necessity requirement can be satisfied by a showing in the application that ordinary investigative procedures,employed in good faith,would likely be ineffective in the particular case.mcguire cir.as numerous courts have explained,though,it is not necessary that law enforcement officials exhaust every conceivable alternative before seeking a wiretap.id.at see also annual review of criminal procedure,investigation and police practice electronic surveillance geo,fn.collecting cases.instead,the adequacy of the showing of necessity is to be tested in a practical and commonsense fashion,that does not hamper unduly the investigative powers of law enforcement agents.oriakhi cir.a determination of necessity involves a consideration of all the facts and circumstances.united states hyde cir,quoting,sess,reprinted in cong.admin.news.

a.the application for wiretap 
we begin our review of judge fidler findings of necessity by examining the affidavits filed in support of the wiretap applications,subd.a b see united states martinez cir.in light of defendants arguments in this court,we need focus only on wiretap application the affidavit in support of this wiretap application established probable cause to believe that communications involving the importation,transportation,and sale of cocaine had been,were being,and would be made over target telephone by the target subjects and also established the necessity for the wiretap.
the affidavit began by recounting an investigation begun in into the drug trafficking organization,which engaged in the transportation of quantities of cocaine from mexico into the united states.the investigation resulted in the arrest in june of jorge castro,a member of the organization,and other coconspirators,as well as the seizure of kilos of cocaine and over million in proceeds.unfortunately,even after the arrests,many of the distribution cells to which castro had delivered cocaine remained intact.through wiretaps on a target telephone,the task force had discovered that an unidentified person was in contact with narcotics traffickers from the los distribution network cells that used to receive cocaine from the castro organization and with numerous telephone numbers known to be used by members of the organization.based on its investigation,the task force believed the unidentified person who had used the discarded target telephone was a united manager for the organization,with responsibilities that paralleled those formerly held by castro.although the discarded target telephone was deactivated for lack of payment in july,the task force believed,based on the large number of telephone numbers in common,that target telephone was being used by the same person or a close associate.
the affidavit also noted that target telephone was a prepaid cell phone and had been purchased by someone providing a fictitious address and possibly a fictitious name.drug traffickers frequently use prepaid cell phones because no identification is required for activation,the phone can be discarded at any time,and law enforcement will be unable to track down the user new telephone.
the discussion of the necessity for the wiretap was set forth in a separate section of the affidavit consisting of numbered paragraphs.the affidavit stated that normal investigative techniques had failed,appeared reasonably unlikely to succeed if tried,or were too dangerous to achieve the objectives of the investigation,that is,to obtain direct evidence that will convince a jury beyond a reasonable doubt of a.the full scope,extent and personnel of the narcotics trafficking conspiracies to which i believe the target subjects belong b.the identity and role of all suppliers of narcotics to the identified conspirators c.the identity and role of the main customers of the identified conspirators d.the stash location where the narcotics are stored before distribution e.the organization method of distribution of narcotics and f.the management and disposition of proceeds generated by the organization narcotics trafficking.the affidavit then listed the investigative techniques the task force had used or had considered using,with an explanation as to why each was unlikely to succeed in identifying all members of the organization and establishing beyond a reasonable doubt the full scope of the conspiracy 
as to undercover agents and confidential informants,the affidavit stated that a confidential informant could not be introduced at that time because the true user of target telephone and the phone physical whereabouts were unknown.nor,for the same reasons,would it be useful to introduce an undercover agent.when the user of target telephone was identified,the task force would consider the use of a confidential informant or undercover agent.such a person,however,would be unlikely to assist in achieving the goals of the investigation,inasmuch as members of a large narcotics trafficking organization generally deal only with known and trusted individuals the organization structure is compartmentalized such that suppliers,transporters,distributors,customers,and money launderers do not even know each other and the organization could become suspicious merely by having an unknown person attempt to engage the organization.
as to physical surveillance,the affidavit reiterated that the user of target telephone and the phone whereabouts were unknown and therefore could not be subjected to physical surveillance.the task force had conducted limited physical surveillance of defendants residence,but nothing significant was observed.special agent diederich also stated,based on his training and experience with over narcotics investigations as an agent with the drug enforcement administration,that physical surveillance alone,without wiretap intercepts,could not achieve this investigation objectives.although physical surveillance can be useful in confirming the fact of meetings and other interactions among participants,such observations are generally insufficient to prove their purpose or their content.moreover,inasmuch as narcotics traffickers run trivial errands most of the time,it was highly likely that blanket surveillance would be detected by the target prior to the pickup or delivery of any significant amount of narcotics,which would compromise the larger investigation.narcotics traffickers,such as the ones here,use sophisticated countersurveillance driving techniques to thwart surveillance.wiretap intercepts,by contrast,would permit the task force to assemble surveillance for specific meetings and to conduct the surveillance at the meeting place,not at the target home,which further reduces the risk that the surveillance would be detected.
as to pen registers,devices,toll analysis,and subscriber information,the affidavit explained that these measures,at best,could provide only a list of the telephone numbers called and the identity provided to the telephone provider but not the content of or the parties to the calls.inasmuch as toll records had already been used to establish the connection between the discarded target telephone and target telephone,little more could be gained by these methods of investigation without the assistance of a wiretap.the affidavit also stated that narcotics traffickers often use fictitious information or the assistance of unwitting persons as subscribers for their telephones in order to thwart investigation into their illegal pointed out that such false information had indeed been given for target telephone.
as to search warrants,the affidavit explained that they would not be effective because the true user of target telephone and the phone physical location were unknown.search warrants at this stage thus could result in law enforcement compromising the larger investigation with minimal results.once the wiretap revealed the timing of cocaine deliveries and stash locations,the task force would consider the use of search warrants.however,such searches alone would not disclose the full scope of the organization criminal activities,the methods used by members of the organization,or the identities of those involved.special agent diederich added that,in his experience,records kept by narcotics conspirators are coded and difficult to interpret.
as to witness interviews,grand jury subpoenas,and immunity,special agent diederich declared,based on his training and experience,that these were unlikely to,indeed,would likely investigation.narcotics dealers and customers are unwilling to talk to police or testify before grand juries or at trial because of fears for their safety or for their own culpability.even when granted immunity,a member of the organization who was of sufficient rank to provide meaningful testimony about the entire organization would be unlikely to share it because of the fear of retribution against himself or his family.for these reasons,diederich believed that any attempt to contact a member of the organization would likely cause that person to inform other members of the organization and thus jeopardize the investigation.
as to trash searches,the affidavit reiterated that the true user of target telephone and the phone physical location were unknown.once locations were identified,the task force would consider the use of trash searches.however,even if trash could be removed without detection and thus without compromising the investigation,special agent diederich declared,based on his experience,that it would be unlikely to yield significant evidence.narcotics traffickers go to great lengths to destroy evidence that is possibly incriminating and frequently will dispose of their trash at a site away from their residence.
as to consensual recordings,the affidavit stated that these techniques are subject to the same limitations as confidential informants and undercover agents,discussed above.
special agent diederich concluded by emphasizing that,in his experience,leaders of narcotics trafficking organizations rarely touch the contraband themselves and coordinate the logistics of their criminal activities over the phone.he therefore believed that the only viable means of building an effective case against the target subjects was to intercept their telephone communications,including those made over target telephone.
b.the record supported the finding of necessity for the wiretaps within the meaning of section d 
defendants attack judge fidler finding of necessity on a number of grounds.none has merit.
boilerplate allegations 
defendants complain first that the affidavit included boilerplate discussion of the limitations of traditional investigative techniques and failed to identify any ways in which the investigation into this drug trafficking conspiracy differed from drug trafficking conspiracies generally.although it is true that g eneralities,or statements in the conclusory language of the statute,are insufficient to support a wiretap application cline cir,the affidavit here did not simply reiterate conclusory language.it instead analyzed with particularity the limitations of each alternative investigative technique in achieving the goals of this investigation.that many of those limitations are common to most drug conspiracy investigations does not necessarily preclude a finding of necessity.thompson cir.in cases of this nature,the same reasons for futility of certain investigative techniques will frequently recur.but the fact that drug investigations suffer from common investigatory problems does not make these problems less vexing.milton cir.there is thus no requirement that the government establish that an individual narcotics investigation differs in some particular way from an ordinary narcotics investigation.necessity is a function of the specifics of the case,not its uniqueness.if a seemingly ordinary drug investigation requires a title iii wiretap,and the government establishes that necessity with the particulars of a given investigation,no more is needed.the ordinariness of the investigation does not preclude a finding of necessity for the use of wiretaps to further the investigation.martinez,supra,at.
defendants reliance on united states kalustian cir,which contained some contrary language in suppressing electronic surveillance evidence in a gambling investigation,is misplaced.there,no mention was made of the defendants or the particular circumstances to be investigated.united states tufaro.hence,kalustian teaches no more than that an affidavit composed solely of conclusions unsupported by particular facts gives no basis for a determination of compliance with the necessity requirement.united states spagnuolo cir,see also united states williams,distinguishing kalustian as involving generalized and conclusory statements that other investigative procedures would prove unsuccessful.by contrast,the affidavit here described with particularity the problems with conventional investigative techniques,including those posed by the fact that the identity of the user and the location of target telephone were unknown.
defendants reliance on blackmon cir,in which a divided panel of the ninth circuit suppressed the fruits of a wiretap in a narcotics investigation,is likewise unconvincing.in that case,the panel majority found that the affidavit contained material misstatements,including untrue claims that surveillance of blackmon had been attempted and had failed and that cooperating informants possessed only limited knowledge concerning the scope of the criminal enterprise,and omitted any discussion of the potentially successful use of informants,including one who had special access to blackmon.id.at.because of these defects,the court elected to review the affidavit,purged of its misstatements,de novo,without deferring to the judicial finding of necessity below.id.at dis.opn.of wardlaw,see cir,distinguishing blackmon.here,however,we have found and defendants have conceded that the judicial finding of necessity below should be reviewed deferentially and that the affidavits contain no material misstatements or omissions.inasmuch as the ninth circuit has subsequently explained that its holding in blackmon was premised on a finding that the affidavits supporting the wiretap applications were plagued by material misstatements and omissions fernandez cir,we do not find blackmon persuasive here.canales gomez cir,distinguishing blackmon on the ground that n o such misstatements are alleged in this case accord,martinez,supra,at.
the relevance of the conspiracy allegations 
defendants argue next that section d does not set forth a lower standard of necessity for conspiracy cases.we agree that a mere allegation that a person is a member of a conspiracy is not a sufficient reason to obtain a wiretap carneiro cir,but the people make no such argument here.they argue instead,correctly,that the fact of a conspiracy is a circumstance to be considered,along with all the other facts and circumstances,in determining whether conventional investigative techniques have failed,are unlikely to succeed if tried,or are too dangerous to try.for example,persons involved in a conspiracy almost invariably will discuss their plans,methods,and goals with other members of the conspiracy.a solitary criminal,on the other hand,is unlikely to discuss the crime with others.concerted action,moreover,increases the likelihood that the criminal object will be successfully attained and decreases the probability that the individuals involved will depart from their path of criminality.callanan united states,d accord,people zamora cal d.and,u nlike individual criminal action,which comes to an end upon the capture of the criminal,collective criminal action has a life of its own.like the hydra of greek mythology,the conspiracy may survive the destruction of its parts unless the conspiracy is completely destroyed.for even if some or many of the conspirators are imprisoned,others may remain at large,free to recruit others eager to break the law and to pursue the conspiracy illegal ends.mcguire,supra,at.thus,in many cases,the existence of a conspiracy will suggest not only that there will be communications in order to plan the crime,but that such planning will occur almost exclusively during such communications.furthermore,the existence of the conspiracy may not only increase the likelihood any given crime will succeed,but also the likelihood the criminal enterprise will survive the arrest of less than all of its is precisely what occurred when the government made its first round of arrests of members of the drug trafficking organization.in sum,the existence of a conspiracy,while not determinative,is an important factor in analyzing the necessity for a wiretap.scott united states,d when the investigation is focusing on what is thought to be a widespread conspiracy more extensive surveillance may be justified in an attempt to determine the precise scope of the enterprise.
in this case,no one disputes that telephones were the primary means of communication among the conspirators.it would have been difficult if not impossible by means other than wiretap to determine the scope of the conspiracy or to develop enough evidence to successfully prosecute the conspirators.carrillo d,accord,khan cir.
failure to exhaust or otherwise justify the failure to attempt normal investigative techniques 
defendants then argue that the government failed to exhaust several investigative techniques.as they concede,however,the adequacy of the showing concerning other investigative techniques is to be tested in a practical and commonsense fashion,citation that does not hamper unduly the investigative powers of law enforcement agents smith,supra,at and that does not mandate the indiscriminate pursuit to the bitter end of every device bennett cir.the government need only lay a factual predicate sufficient to inform the judge why other methods of investigation are not sufficient.williams cir.we can not say that judge fidler acted unreasonably in finding that normal investigative techniques had failed or were unlikely to succeed if tried in this case.
a confidential informants 
defendants,pointing to a sealed portion of the affidavit that indicated the existence of a confidential informant,fault the affidavit for failing to explain why the investigation could not proceed through that informant.yet defendants fail to explain how the informant could even have identified the user of target telephone,whose identity and location were unknown,without raising suspicion.as the affidavit explained,members of the organization could be alarmed by an informant simply approaching one of them and could become concerned that the organization was under investigations.more generally,the affidavit recited that narcotics organization are compartmentalized in order to protect the organization and that confidential informants therefore would not be successful in identifying the full nature and scope of the organization.canales gomez,supra,at.under these circumstances,the government could reasonably have concluded that attempting to connect the informant to this part of the organization would have aroused the suspicions of other participants,thus endangering both its informant and the investigation,without providing sufficient information to achieve its goals.carter,cir.
b pen registers 
defendants complain that the affidavit merely identified the limitations of pen registers and similar techniques and therefore could not establish necessity for a wiretap.we disagree.a lthough the affidavit assertions of inadequacy might appear boilerplate,the fact that drug investigations suffer from common investigatory problems does not make these problems less vexing.thompson,supra,at.moreover,the affidavit stated that the task force had already compared toll records for target telephone with the discarded target telephone,which had provided the basis for their suspicion that the users were the same or close associates,and announced that the task force intended to initiate a pen register on target telephone.because these alternate techniques had not and could not identify the persons making or receiving the communications,the contents of the conversations,or whether the communications were in furtherance of the drug operation,they could not significantly advance or achieve the objectives of the investigation.carrillo,supra,d at see also decoud cir.
c search warrants 
defendants once again fault the affidavit for relying on limitations that would apply to most if not all narcotics investigations.what defendants overlook,however,is that the affidavit also explained why those generic limitations applied to this investigation.in particular,defendants do not challenge special agent diederich statement that a t this time,i know of no locations at which to execute search warrants,given that the stash locations,the timing of deliveries,the identity of the user of target telephone,or the user location were all unknown.defendants also challenge the affidavit failure to discuss the possibility of searching their residence,which was known to t
