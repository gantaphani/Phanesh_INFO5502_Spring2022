in this limited civil action arising under united states code section,commonly known as the telephone consumer protection act of tcpa or the act,we must determine whether a state or federal statute of limitations correctly applies,where plaintiff is asserting a private right of action for damages for violations of the act.the matter was certified for transfer to this court on the motion of the superior court appellate division,after it affirmed the trial court judgment on the pleadings in favor of the defendant and respondent,the sender of the disputed communications from whom the plaintiff seeks damages under the act.both courts determined that the action was under california law.code civ,subd.a cal.rules of court,rule.
plaintiff edward sznyter,in propria persona appellant,alleges he incurred damages due to his receipt in of two sets of two advertising faxes sent to him by the defendant and respondent,robert malone,a professional corporation respondent.appellant complaint was dismissed after the trial court granted a defense motion for judgment on the pleadings,finding that the action was filed too late under the limitations period applicable to a statutory cause of action pursuant to section,subdivision a.
appellant argues the trial court erred in failing to apply the limitations period set forth in united states code section,which is a federal catchall statute of limitations that applies to cases in which the federal statute giving rise to the action was enacted after and does not specify its own limitations rules.he further contends supplemental discovery was erroneously denied.
we agree with appellant that the federal provision controls,for the reasons specified below.since we will reverse on that issue,we find it unnecessary to address the alleged discovery errors,and direct that the trial court conduct further appropriate proceedings.
factual and procedural history 
acomplaint,discovery request and motions 
the complaint was filed as a limited civil action on may,in san diego superior court.appellant alleges he received four facsimile transmissions from respondent between may,and january,in violation of the tcpa.he claims he had two telephone numbers and there were eight violations,for which he sought in damages,along with treble damages,for a total of for the receipt of those advertising transmissions.b b,c.
the briefs and the superior court file show that this is the second complaint filed by appellant for two of the same alleged violations.in,his previous small claims action was dismissed by the small claims court,on the grounds that there was then no recognized state private right of action under this statutory scheme.after another appellate court issued a published decision,kaufman acs systems,th,d kaufman,finding that a private right of action in state court was permissible under the tcpa statute,appellant filed the current complaint.
appellant served written discovery on respondent on november.respondent provided responses on december,stating,among other things,that he had retained a company called for advertising purposes and believed they were acting in accordance with the applicable law.correspondence ensued between appellant and counsel for respondent about the adequacy of the responses.apparently,on february,appellant served respondent with a notice of motion to compel supplemental responses.that document showed a proposed hearing date of march,but its proof of service does not also include any supporting documents,such as points and authorities,declarations,or a statement that leave of court had been obtained as a departmental prerequisite to filing a motion to compel supplemental responses,subd.c,subd.c.
on february,respondent filed his motion for judgment on the pleadings on the grounds that appellant complaint was by the applicable state limitations period for a claim based upon statute,subd.a setting a period for the filing of a n action upon a liability created by statute,other than a penalty or forfeiture.under this view,appellant had only until january,three years after the last fax received,to file the complaint.respondent argued that the language of the tcpa sufficiently referenced those state procedural rules,because united states code section b allows a plaintiff to pursue a private right of action seeking damages if otherwise permitted by the laws or rules of court of a state 
appellant responded that since the tcpa was not enacted until,and since the above quoted language in b does not expressly provide for a clearly applicable limitations period,then the federal statute of limitations found in united states code section a should apply,providing a limitations period,as follows except as otherwise provided by law,a civil action arising under an act of congress enacted after the date of the enactment of this section may not be commenced later than years after the cause of action accrues.united states code section,the catchall statute,part of the judicial improvements act,was enacted in.jones donnelley sons,d jones.
judgment on the pleadings and appeals 
following oral argument,the trial court confirmed a tentative ruling granting judgment on the pleadings for respondent.the court determined appellant action was,on the basis that the statute of limitations for a private right of action under the tcpa should be the state law applicable to statutory causes of action,section,subdivision a.the trial court explained at the hearing 
the tcpa,which is what you are seeking to enforce here,says that you can file a private action if it otherwise permitted by the laws of the state.and obviously this is the state of california.okay.so if you are going to seek to enforce the tcpa in california,then you have to look at what the tcpa says.you can file that action as long as you comply with whatever laws apply to such an action in the state courts of that state and the state of california law is this a then you have to bring that within three years.
the court further found the federal limitations statute should not apply because the tcpa otherwise provided for a limitations period,through its reference to the permission of the laws or rules of court of a state.b.further,no tolling period applied,due to the previous small claims action or otherwise.these rulings disposed of the action in its entirety.
appellant filed his notice of appeal to the appellate division of the superior court on april,referring to both the judgment and the denial of discovery.the appellate court affirmed the trial court rulings,and issued an order certifying transfer to this court,based on the need for uniformity of decision or to settle an important question of law,which it identified as follows the statute of limitations applicable to these cases.there are no published california cases addressing this issue.as most tcpa claims are brought in small claims court and are not appealed,this case presents a rare opportunity to obtain a published decision by the court of appeal on this recurring issue.cal.rules of court,rule.
discussion 
to resolve the question of which statute of limitations should apply to this case,we first outline the relevant statutory language and previous interpretations of the tcpa on related procedural points.we then refer to the policies generally applicable to california limitations rules,and also,due to the date of enactment of the tcpa,we consider the applicability of the federal catchall statute of limitations found in united states code section.in jones,supra,d,the united states supreme court analyzed the policies promoted by the federal catchall statute of limitations,such as uniformity of decision,in the comparable context of civil rights cases arising under recent amendments to united states code section that postdated the federal catchall provision.
with that background,we can then explain the applicability of the federal catchall statute in this situation.
tcpa statutory scheme background 
the tcpa is one section of chapter of title of the united states code,found at united states code section et wire and radio communication.under the tcpa,and specifically subdivision b,a private right of action to seek damages for violations may be pursued as follows a person or entity may,if otherwise permitted by the laws or rules of court of a state,bring in an appropriate court of that state b an action to recover for actual monetary loss from such a violation,or to receive in damages for each such violation,whichever is greater if the court finds that the defendant willfully or knowingly violated this subsection or the regulations prescribed under this subsection,the court may,in its discretion,increase the amount of the award to an amount equal to not more than times the amount available under subparagraph b of this paragraph.
this subdivision,united states code section b,was interpreted in kaufman,supra,th,d,for purposes of clarifying that individuals who were recipients of unsolicited facsimile advertisements were allowed to bring either class actions against companies sending the faxes,or individual complaints on their own private rights of action in state court.other constitutional issues involving free speech and due process were also extensively addressed,but those problems are not presented in the case before us.id.at,d.
in adler vision lab telecommunications,d,the court characterized the statutory phrase in united states code section b,if otherwise permitted by the laws of a state as ambiguous.in its ruling,the district court adhered to the reasoning of other cited cases,kaufman,supra,th,d,in rejecting the notion that states must take affirmative action to provide their citizens with a forum for tcpa claims.adler,supra,at.instead,the district court recognized that a private right of action is authorized under united states code section b.the court said that the weight of the authority held that this term simply acknowledges the principle that states have the right to structure their own court systems and that state courts are not obligated to change their procedural rules to accommodate tcpa claims.adler,supra,at.
the private right of action issue is settled,and for our purposes,kaufman is mainly instructive in its reference to the legislative history of the tcpa.the court rejected arguments against permitting class actions under the act,by citing to remarks by the sponsor of the act,senator hollings,to the effect that he hoped that states will make it as easy as possible for consumers to bring tcpa actions,preferably in small claims court.citation.but the senator also said,the act does not,because of constitutional constraints,dictate to the states which court in each state shall be the proper venue for such an action,as this is a matter for state legislators to determine.citation.the senator expect ed that the states would act reasonably in permitting their citizens to go to court to enforce this act.citation.kaufman,supra,th,d.
further,in kaufman,supra,th at pages to,d,the court referred to a law review article also discussed by the parties here,biggerstaff,state court and the telephone consumer protection act of must states can states,biggerstaff.that article addressed a different procedural question than is presented here whether enabling legislation was required by the states to facilitate pursuing a private right of action under the tcpa.regarding that point,the article states w hen a state court hears a case brought under a federal law,local laws control procedure,jurisdiction,administration,and venue.it is often said that federal law takes the state courts as it finds them,the particulars of a tcpa case jurisdiction,venue,residency,amount in controversy,must fit the administrative and jurisdictional rules of the state court hearing the case.the supremacy clause does not reach these administrative and procedural issues congress can not command which court in a state has jurisdiction over tcpa claims.nor can it mandate the modes of procedure biggerstaff,supra at,fns.omitted.
the biggerstaff article took the modes of procedure term from the early case of mondou new york,representing the concept that when federal law is enforced in state courts,federal law does not normally operate to enlarge or regulate the jurisdiction of state courts,or to control or affect their modes of procedure.id.at.rather,where a state court ordinary jurisdiction,as prescribed by local laws,is appropriately invoked in conformity with those laws,then the federal law may be enforced and is susceptible of adjudication according to the prevailing rules of procedure.id.at.biggerstaff,supra,at,referring to that case as second employers liability cases also citing to howlett rose,d federal law is enforceable in state courts not because congress has determined that federal courts would otherwise be burdened or that state courts might provide a more convenient both might well be because the constitution and laws passed pursuant to it are as much laws in the states as laws passed by the state legislature.the supremacy clause makes those laws the supreme law of the land,and charges state courts with a coordinate responsibility to enforce that law according to their regular modes of procedure.
in our case,there is no dispute that california courts may have jurisdiction over a timely filed case asserting a private right of action under the tcpa,but that does not answer the limitations question.
state limitations rules and procedure tolling 
in a closely related context,choosing a limitations provision in a state court case in which more than one state statute could potentially apply to that single cause of action,the california supreme court has set forth the following rules to resolve the problem to determine the statute of limitations which applies to a cause of action it is necessary to identify the nature of the cause of action,the gravamen of the cause of action.citations.t he nature of the right sued upon and not the form of action nor the relief demanded determines the applicability of the statute of limitations under our code.citation.hensler city of glendale cal th,d.generally,a statute of limitations will begin to run upon the occurrence of the last element essential to the cause of action.see neel magana,olney,levy,cathcart gelfand cal d.
in norgart upjohn cal th,d,the supreme court analyzed the policies promoted by statutes of limitations,including discovery and tolling rules,and determined that t he two public policies identified one for repose and the other for disposition on the equally strong,the one being no less important or substantial than the other.citations.to establish any particular limitations period under any particular statute of limitations entails the striking of a balance between the two.to establish any such period under any such statute belongs to the legislature alone citation,subject only to constitutional constraints citation.ibid.
as a threshold matter,we now address appellant argument that he is entitled to an tolling period for the time lapse between the dismissal of his small claims action and the filing of his current limited civil action,due to the issuance during that time period of the leading kaufman decision kaufman,supra,th,d,which clarified that a private right of action was authorized by the tcpa.appellant is arguing that the san diego and los angeles superior courts were refusing to process cases alleging private rights of action under the tcpa,based upon their of the statute and case law.
we must reject this contention that appellant allegations of damage from the faxes are somehow entitled to the benefit of delayed accrual or tolling,simply because of the pendency of that other litigation.first,the small claims court is a division of superior court,subject to the same general limitations rules,see cal.judges benchbook,small claims court and consumer law cjer,small claims trial judges should recognize and deal with limitations issues sua sponte if necessary.the superior court may treat an action as a limited civil case if specified conditions are satisfied,concerning the amount in controversy and other factors.this does not affect the rules regarding the limitation of actions otherwise provided in section et.
if appellant is relying on an exception to the retroactivity of a judicial decision to seek tolling,he is mistaken.see gentis safeguard business systems,th,d several factors are relevant in determining whether an exception to the general rule of retroactivity is warranted,including the reasonableness of the parties reliance on the former rule,the nature of the change as substantive or procedural,retroactivity effect on the administration of justice,and the purposes to be served by the new rule.citations.citation.citation.merely because the kaufman decision kaufman,supra,th,d clarified widespread confusion about private rights of action in this context does not excuse appellant from acting diligently to preserve his rights during the time period that the other cases were pending.he could have filed another case sooner outside of the small claims jurisdiction.
also,to the extent appellant is claiming that he should be excused,for constitutional reasons,from filing earlier due to the pending kaufman decision kaufman,supra,th,d,the applicable rules do not support that claim.even though generally,the operation of statutes of limitations is considered to be a procedural matter in california,if a limitations period has been legislatively shortened,constitutional and substantive issues will arise concerning retrospective application if i n a given case,that retrospective application may violate due process by in effect eliminating the plaintiff right.if the time left to file suit is reasonable,no such constitutional violation occurs,and the statute is applied as enacted.if no time is left,or only an unreasonably short time remains,then the statute can not be applied at all.aronson superior court d.it is a question of law whether a party has a reasonable time after a change in the law to file an action.ibid.
this record does not support a conclusion that appellant was unreasonably foreclosed from taking action to protect his rights due to the sequence of events involving the small claims dismissal or the issuance of the kaufman decision kaufman,supra,th,d.see also witkin,cal.procedure ed.appeal,court opinions operate differently from legislation because courts declare law rather than make law.the issue still remains whether the state or federal statute of limitations for this tcpa action should apply to this complaint.
guidance in federal and case law 
the operative question is whether the federal catchall statute of limitations,applicable to any actions arising under federal statutes that were enacted after december,and that do not contain their own limitations period,should control here in light of the precise language of the tcpa.see witkin,cal.procedure ed supp.the language in united states code section b,if otherwise permitted by the laws or rules of court of a state,a person may bring an action,is ambiguous.
because the tcpa was enacted in,and contains this ambiguity regarding procedures,we deem it appropriate to turn to jones,the leading interpretation of the federal catchall statute that was enacted in in response to existing problems with the practice of borrowing state limitations rules.in jones,supra,d,the supreme court explained the purpose of united states code section is to supply the following a general,limitations period for any federal statute subsequently enacted without one of its own.jones,supra,at,fn.citing north star steel thomas,d a uniform nationwide limitations period for a federal cause of action is always significantly more appropriate than a rule that applies in some states but not in others.citation.jones,supra,at,fn.the jones case arose under united states code section.there,the supreme court relied in part on one of its previous cases,wilson garcia,d wilson,which we will next briefly discuss,in order to seek guidance for the interpretation of the subject introductory language of united states code section a except as otherwise provided by law,a civil action arising under an act of congress enacted after the date of the enactment of this section may not be commenced later than years after the cause of action accrues.italics added.
for our current purposes,the lesson of wilson is that w hen congress has not established a time limitation for a federal cause of action,the settled practice has been to adopt a local time limitation as federal law if it is not inconsistent with federal law or policy to do so.wilson,supra,d,italics added.to decide if utilizing california limitations statute for liabilities created by statute is inconsistent with federal law in this context,we seek to implement congress evident purposes in creating the tcpa private right of action,and in allowing it to be enforced in state courts.
in,the united states supreme court in jones analyzed whether an amendment to an existing federal statute,where the amendment postdated december,when statute of limitations was created,would create rights that were subject to the new catchall limitations statute.the supreme court said yes,because such a plaintiff claim against a defendant was made possible by a enactment.that construction best serves congress interest in alleviating the uncertainty inherent in the practice of borrowing state statutes of limitations while at the same time protecting settled interests.it spares federal judges and litigants the need to identify the appropriate state statute of limitations to apply to new claims but leaves in place the borrowed limitations periods for causes of action,with respect to which the difficult work already has been done.jones,supra,d,italics added.the main reasoning of the court was as follows nothing in the text or history of supports an interpretation that would limit its reach to entirely new sections of the united states code.an amendment to an existing statute is no less an act of congress than a new,statute.what matters is the substantive effect of an creation of new rights of action and corresponding the format in which it appears in the code.jones,supra,at.under that rationale,the date of enactment of the newly created right is the key consideration,at least in federal court,applying federal law.
united states code section includes a practice commentary giving the background of the enactment of this statute,and it points out that under federal law,if there is any doubt at all about how the statute of limitations should be treated in a given instance,it is usually safer to treat it as a matter of substance,as the york case does guaranty trust york,rather than as one of mere procedure.prac.commentary by david siegel,foll.
the author of the practice commentary to united states code section also interpreted its phrase,e xcept as otherwise provided by law,as requiring some degree of specificity in a newly enacted federal statute that creates a given claim,with respect to providing a controlling period of limitations,in place of the period set out in section.prac.commentary,supra,foll.such specificity appears to be lacking in united states code section b.
in bunnell department of corrections th,d bunnell,in the course of outlining the rules applicable to establishing limitations periods for federal claims,for which no federal statute of limitations had been supplied,the court relied on the supremacy clause of the united states constitution art.vi,cl,for the rule that state law may not impede or burden valid laws enacted by congress.however,the general rule is that where an action founded on a federal statute is properly brought in the state courts,the law of the state,in the absence of any contrary provisions in the federal statute,controls in matters of practice and procedure.citation.citation.bunnell,supra,th at,d.in bunnell,the main problem before the court was whether any state tolling provisions should apply to the plaintiff federal cause of action,where there was also an applicable federal wiretap law that expressly contained a limitations period without any tolling provision.the court concluded those state tolling provisions did not prevail over the federal law.id.at,d see,limitation of actions,pp.if a federally created right has no specific period of limitations,state courts,like federal courts,apply the most analogous state period of limitations,including the state tolling provision,as long as it is not inconsistent with
