in the wake of the september,terrorist attacks,the president authorized the national security agency nsa to conduct a warrantless,electronic surveillance program on millions of american telephones.numerous lawsuits have claimed the program was illegal and unconstitutional,alharamain islamic foundation,bush,cir,including a consolidated action for damages against allegedly cooperating telecommunications providers,see in re nsa telecomms.records,d,see also dep t of justice,office of inspector,a review of the federal bureau of investigation use of exigent letters and other informal requests for telephone records describing three unnamed telecommunications carriers cooperation with the fbi.the merits of those claims,however,are not at issue here.
this case concerns the discussions between telecommunications carriers including their lobbyists and attorneys and the government,as the carriers sought retroactive liability protection for any participation in the program.this appeal concerns the extent to which the public has the right to information about those discussions and related lobbying efforts under the freedom of information act foia.
background 
enactment of the foreign intelligence surveillance act amendments 
efforts to provide liability protection for the providers began in.in april of that year,as part of a broader discussion of reforming electronic surveillance laws,the department of justice doj sent a legislative proposal to congress,which included a provision creating retroactive immunity for telecommunications providers alleged to have participated in the surveillance activities.in august,congress enacted the protect america act of paa,stat,a temporary measure,which did not include a liability shield.
contemporaneously with the paa debate,news organizations such as the new york times and newsweek reported on a campaign involving some of washington most prominent lobbying and law firms to pressure the bush administration to quickly approve a measure wiping out all private lawsuits against them for assisting with the warrantless surveillance program.the news accounts highlighted the providers hidden role in the political battle,and newsweek claimed director of national intelligence mike mcconnell mcconnell had raise d the stakes,stating in a recent interview that the lawsuits could bankrupt these companies.
congress designed the paa as a stopgap,and allowed it to expire on february.one day before the paa expiration,mcconnell discussed the need for statutory protection for the carriers,stating in a tv interview,the companies are telling us if you ca protect us,the cooperation you need is not going to be there.on february,doj and the office of the director of national intelligence odni issued a joint press release noting the private partners are cooperating for the time being,but the government also expressed concern because the carriers have indicated that they may well discontinue cooperation if the uncertainty over their liability exposure persists.news reports claimed at t in fact stopped cooperating with the government for six days after the expiration of the paa.similar reports indicated verizon expressed its concerns to the government but did not cease its assistance.
in july,congress passed,and the president signed,the foreign intelligence surveillance act of amendments act of fisa amendments act,stat,updating fisa on a more permanent basis than did the paa.as their lobbyists had sought,the legislation included a liability shield for the carriers.under title viii of the act,section,procedures for implementing statutory defenses,established the immunity procedure.
specifically,section provided that a civil action may not lie or be maintained in a federal or state court against any person for providing assistance to an element of the intelligence community,and shall be promptly dismissed,so long as the attorney general certified either that a defendant provided assistance pursuant to a number of reasons,such as court order or presidential authorization,see a,stat.at,or certified that the person did not provide the alleged assistance,id.a emphasis added.
eff foia requests 
after passage of the paa but before enactment of the fisa amendments act,the electronic frontier foundation eff made a foia request to odni and five doj components together defendants or the government seeking all records from september,through december,concerning briefing,discussions,or other exchanges agency officials had with members of congress,and representatives or agents of telecommunications companies concerning amendments to fisa,including any discussion of immunizing telecommunications companies or holding them otherwise unaccountable for their role in government surveillance activities.frontier found.office of the dir.of intelligence,d,eff.
some four months later,eff submitted a second round of foia requests to the same agencies seeking all agency records concerning briefings,discussions,or other exchanges between the agencies and representatives or agents of telecommunications companies concerning amendments to fisa,or shielding the companies from liability as a result of their cooperation with government surveillance activities.this round of foia requests also sought information regarding communications from the agencies to members of congress or their staffs,as well as agency communications,regardless of subject matter,with a number of named,telecommunications industry employees and lobbyists 
in both foia letters,eff sought expedited processing of their requests.see a e v ii,c,and d ii.when the agencies failed to timely respond,eff filed two separate actions,which were later consolidated by the district court.
procedural history 
on april,the district court granted a preliminary injunction requiring odni and doj to expedite processing of eff december foia requests.eff,d at.the parties negotiated a schedule for processing the june requests.
in response to the preliminary injunction,odni and doj released many documents,but withheld others pursuant to a number of foia exemptions and privileges.under exemption protecting or documents privileged in civil litigation,b,defendants withheld email messages and other information exchanged between the agencies and congress,the agencies and the telecommunications carriers,and the agencies and other parts of the executive branch,including the white house.
defendants also withheld the identities of telecommunications company representatives under exemption permitting the withholding of information specifically exempted from disclosure by statute,b,and exemption permitting withholding of certain personnel,medical,and similar files for which disclosure would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.b.
eff challenged withholdings related to unclassified communications between and among executive agencies,congress,the white house,and telecommunications carriers,concerning amendments to fisa.it also challenged defendants withholding of the identities of individual agents or representatives of the carriers within both the released and withheld communications.the parties each moved for summary judgment,which they agreed to consolidate,and the district court denied the government motion,granted eff,and ordered the government to disclose the contested documents.
after the district court rejected defendants motions for reconsideration and refused a temporary stay pending the solicitor general determination regarding appeal of the disclosure order,defendants sought the stay in this court.we granted a stay pending appeal to allow the solicitor general the opportunity to decide which part s of the summary judgment order to appeal.
defendants decided not to appeal the district court order as it pertained to information defendants exchanged with congress and with the telecommunications firms,and the government then disclosed the content of all communications between the agencies and congress and the agencies and telecommunications carriers,though redacted the identities of telecommunications firms and their agents or representatives.this substantial disclosure left only two types of information defendants continue to withhold.
under exemption,defendants are withholding materials claimed to have been circulated solely within the executive branch.defendants also continue to withhold the previously redacted identities of telecommunications firms and their agents or representatives involved in the fisa amendments act communications under exemption and exemption.

standard of review under foia 
foia was enacted to create a judicially enforceable public right to secure government documents.epa mink,see also dep t of state ray,foia was enacted to facilitate public access to government documents.the statutory scheme provides public access to government information shielded unnecessarily from the public and establishes a judicially enforceable public right to secure such information from possibly unwilling official hands.dep t of air force rose,internal quotation marks omitted.foia purpose was thus to ensure an informed citizenry,vital to the functioning of a democratic society,needed to check against corruption and to hold the governors accountable to the governed.john doe agency john doe,internal quotation marks omitted.
at the same time,foia contemplates that some information may legitimately be kept from the public.lahr ntsb,cir.the statute contains nine exemptions,pursuant to which the government can withhold information otherwise available for disclosure.see b.foia strong presumption in favor of disclosure means that an agency that invokes one of the statutory exemptions to justify the withholding of any requested documents or portions of documents bears the burden of demonstrating that the exemption properly applies to the documents.lahr,at quoting ray,at.because of its overarching goal of public disclosure,foia exemptions are to be interpreted narrowly.id.

information on carriers and their agents lobbying communications 
foia exemption 
the government argues it is entitled to withhold the names of the participating carriers and their agents pursuant to foia exemption.due to confusion evident in the parties for summary judgment,the district court did not squarely address the factual or legal basis of the government exemption argument.
foia exemption allows a responding agency to withhold information specifically exempted from disclosure by statute.b.the government argues two statutes justify its withholdings first,section c of the national security act of,obligating the director of national intelligence to protect intelligence sources and methods from unauthorized disclosure,i see also cia sims,and second,section of the national security agency act of,which prevents disclosure of the organization or any function of the national security agency,or any information with respect to the activities thereof,or of the names,titles,salaries,or number of persons employed by such agency,stat,codified at note.
under these statutes and exemption,the government summary judgment brief argued,odni and doj withheld information that could reveal whether any particular telecommunications carrier has assisted,or may in the future assist,the government with intelligence activities.the government claimed disclosure could deter telecommunications companies from assisting the government in the future,and disclosure provides our adversaries with valuable information about our intelligence sources,methods,and capabilities.
the government argument was predicated on the following inference revealing the identity of carriers and their agents working for a carrier liability shield would allow foreign intelligence agents to determine contours of nsa intelligence operations,sources,and methods.in other words,knowledge of which firms were and were not lobbying for liability protection could lead to inferences regarding the firms that participate in the surveillance program.eff disputes the propriety of this inference.however,because the district court did not address exemption due to confusion in the parties summary judgment briefing,we remand for the district court to address these claims in the first instance.see pac.fisheries,united states,cir.
eff motion opposing the government summary judgment motion is likely the source of the district court confusion.the government relied on the following statement from eff motion in claiming eff abandoned its objection to the government withholding the names of telecommunications firms and agents under exemption eff has decided not to challenge the withholding of any material under exemptions,or e.the district court,in passing,mentioned this same statement from eff motion in failing to discuss exemption in its summary judgment ruling.
although eff statement seems to abandon its exemption challenge,other language contradicts such a conclusion.for example,the sentence quoted above ended in a footnote,which included the following in some cases,the government claims exemptions in conjunction with exemptions.eff continues to challenge the exemption and withholdings to the extent the records can be disclosed without revealing classified information or the government intelligence sources and methods.in the same paragraph with the confusing sentence,eff went on to claim,as a result of eff efforts to narrow the scope of the litigation,the only material still at issue relates to unclassified communications between and among executive agencies,congress,the white house,and telecommunications companies concerning amendments to fisa,and the identities of individual agents or representatives of the carriers within those communications.
the government reply to eff claimed eff had clearly abandoned its challenge of exemption withholdings,and the government did not discuss the merits of whether releasing names of telecommunications firms and their agents was adequately withheld under exemption.
eff countered,claiming the government arguments under exemption were coextensive with the exemption arguments.eff explained,a s noted in eff opening brief,despite not challenging exemption directly,eff continues to challenge the exemption and withholdings to the extent that records can be disclosed without revealing classified information or the government intelligence sources and methods.it continued,t he identities of the individuals contacting the government would reveal neither classified information nor the government intelligence sources and methods.the parties thus placed the district court in the difficult position of determining,over disputed claims,whether exemption claims were actually at issue.
the district court seemed to accept the government assertion that eff abandoned its exemption challenge,but,then,when it found the government could not withhold the same documents under exemption,it ordered them released without considering the documents for which the government also claimed exemption.assuming the district court found eff abandoned its exemption arguments,these would appear to be validly withheld documents under the government supposedly unchallenged exemption claim.
a single valid exemption is sufficient to support withholding.see milner,at painting indus.of haw.mkt.recovery fund dep t of air force,cir.therefore,if the district court found eff had abandoned its argument against exemption withholding,the documents the government withheld pursuant to exemption should not have been ordered released.if the district court found eff was actually challenging whether releasing the names of telecommunications firms and their agents constituted an unauthorized disclosure of intelligence sources and methods,it should have undertaken that analysis.
based on the nature of eff challenge,we take the latter position.because the district court did not review the governments arguments pursuant to exemption,we remand for it to conduct the exemption review.see pac.fisheries,at.a remand is particularly appropriate because our review of foia determinations presupposes the district court has determined a contested issue.see milner,at berman cia,cir.
the record indicates eff never conceded its challenge to withholding the names of the carriers and their agents despite its statement it was abandoning its exemption challenge.thus,finding eff did relinquish this challenge,and deciding the issue solely under exemption,would not be an accurate reading of eff arguments as a whole,nor is it reason to reject all challenges to the government withholding of the carriers and agents identities.
the government claims that releasing identities of firms and individuals working for a carrier liability shield will create an inference of the government sources of intelligence.determining whether this claim is meritorious may require factual determinations,and it also may it may reviewing court to view the disputed documents in camera as opposed to simply relying on the vaughn indices currently in the record.further,our procedure for reviewing foia exemption determinations is not perfectly applicable where,as here,the district court did not make an actual determination.see milner,at berman,at.
for the foregoing reasons,we vacate and remand the district court exemption analysis,to the extent one exists,for the district court to address whether the government properly withheld telecommunications firms and their agents identities pursuant to foia exemption.
foia exemption 
defendants also claim they are entitled to withhold the names of the telecommunications carriers and their agents pursuant to exemption to protect the agents personal privacy.because satisfying a single foia exemption is all the government must show to withhold a given piece of information,see berman,at,we must also reach the exemption issue.
the district court found the public interest in an informed citizenry outweighed the carriers agents not substantial privacy interests.for the reasons explained below,we affirm the district court on the exemption summary judgment grant for eff.
exemption removes personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy from foia disclosure requirements.b.in considering whether exemption applies to a particular request for information,we must consider,first,whether the information is contained in a personnel,medical,or similar file,and,second,whether release of the information would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of the person privacy.dep t of state.post,finding citizenship status properly withheld under exemption.in conducting this second inquiry,we balance the individual privacy interest against the extent to which foia central purpose of opening agency action to public scrutiny would be served by disclosure.dep t of def.fed.labor relations,see lahr,at a court must balance the privacy interest protected by the exemptions against the public interest in government openness that would be served by disclosure.
the first question is thus whether communications documented in the records in question constitute similar information as that contained in personnel and medical files under exemption.as the government points out,eff does not contest whether the emails are similar files.though this may be a closer question than the government describes,we assume without deciding that the documents at issue here qualify as similar files.see ass of home builders norton,assuming without deciding that the documents in question were similar files because invasion of privacy question was dispositive and more straightforward.
we next consider whether release of the information would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of that person privacy.post,at.t o determine whether a record is properly withheld,we must balance the privacy interest protected by the exemptions against the public interest in government openness that would be served by disclosure.lahr,at.
the district court concluded that there is some,although not a substantial,privacy interest in the withheld documents indicating the identities of the private individuals and entities who communicated with the odni and doj in connection with the fisa amendments.it found,however,that the public interest in an informed citizenry weighs in favor of disclosure because there is a strong public interest in disclosure of the identity of the individuals who contacted the government to protect telecommunications companies from legal liability for their role in government surveillance activities.we agree.
because exemption cases often involve a dispute over whether to redact a government employee name,or a record of an individual in a large government database,there is little authority on the privacy interest under exemption when a private individual voluntarily seeks to engage with and persuade the government on a policy position.however,as described below,the few cases considering a private party attempting to influence government policy typically find in favor of disclosure,lacking countervailing concerns not present in this case.see,alliance for the wild rockies dep t of the interior,d.
perhaps the most factually analogous case is people for the american way foundation national park service,in which a district court rejected exemption withholding of the identities of a group urging the national park service to alter the video shown at the lincoln memorial to remove photographs and video coverage of demonstrations that occurred at the lincoln memorial,including gay rights,and war footage.d.discussing exemption,the court stated,w hen a citizen petitions his government to take some action,courts have generally declined to find the identity of the citizen to be information that raises privacy concerns under exemption.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
the cases considering this issue largely reason along the same lines.although some cases have found little public interest in disclosing the name of a constituent writing to a member of congress,they recognize the obvious distinction between that and the public interest in knowing which politically active groups affect government decision making.see id.distinguishing constituent letters from more involved forms of policy influence.compare strout parole comm n,cir finding considerable privacy interest in individuals writing to oppose parole request,and kidd dep t of justice,d,providing personal identifying information commonly found in constituent letters to members of congress does not advance the purposes of foia and,as such,may be withheld from foia requests,and voinche fbi,there is no reason to believe that the public will obtain a better understanding of the workings of various agencies by learning the identities of private citizens who wrote to government officials,with kurzon dep t of health human,cir rejecting government exemption argument to withhold names of scientists turned down for research funding,holding that although the protection of professional reputation,even in this strict sense,is not beyond the purview of exemption,it is not at its core,and lardner dep t of justice,no.jdb,wl,at,holding public interest in identifying persons influencing presidential pardon power outweighed modest privacy interest,and judicial watch of florida,dep t of justice,d,depriving the public of knowledge of the writer identity would deprive the public of a fact which could suggest that their justice department had been steered by political pressure rather than by the relevant facts and law,and alliance for the wild rockies,d at names and addresses of individuals who submitted comments on proposed rulemaking could not be withheld under exemption because of public interest in disclosure.
here,we balance the public interest in obtaining information about the effects of lobbying on government decision making against the privacy concerns of telecommu
