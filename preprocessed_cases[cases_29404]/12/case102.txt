in or the date is disputed,at t corporation at t entered into an international telecommunications services agreement agreement with katel limited liability company katel,an international telecommunications carrier,to govern the exchange of phone calls between at t in the united states and katel in kyrgyzstan.the essence of the agreement was that katel would build the necessary infrastructure in kyrgyzstan,and at t would use that infrastructure for a fee.the parties began exchanging telecommunications traffic shortly afterward.in,at t began sending its telecommunications traffic to kyrgyztelecom kt,a competitor of katel.soon thereafter,at t began using an intermediary service to route its calls to kyrgyzstan and stopped paying kt moreover,since it was no longer using katel services,it was not paying katel,either.
katel bought an assignment of rights from kt,and sued at t in the united states district court for the southern district of new york holwell,on march,claiming breach of contract,tortious interference with contractual relations,and an entitlement to fees pursuant to the international telecommunications regulations.the district court granted summary judgment to at t on all claims,and this appeal is taken from the judgment.
the controversy turns on the interplay between two paragraphs of the agreement.paragraph provides,inter alia,that as soon as katel and at t establish direct circuits,the parties will begin routing traffic between the republic of kyrgyzstan and the united states on these circuits,using the indirect transit routes via russia and turkey only when direct circuits are not capable of carrying the offered traffic.paragraph,entitled privileges,provides that n othing in this agreement shall be deemed to restrict or prejudice the rights of either party to enter into similar service agreements with other parties.
transmission arrangements.in or,at t and katel entered into the agreement and began sending telecommunications traffic to one another.in early,at t contracted with kt to provide international telecommunications services in kyrgyzstan at the same time,at t stopped sending traffic to katel and has sent none since.but soon thereafter at t stopped paying kt for its call termination services.on october,representatives from at t,katel,and kt met at at t new jersey headquarters.at t conceded that it owed money to katel or kt or both,but the parties could not resolve the muddle,and katel initiated this litigation.
in the meantime,at t continued sending direct and indirect traffic to kt until may,at which point it adopted a different method of routing calls into kyrgyzstan refile.under a refile arrangement,the originating carrier at t sends the traffic to a carrier,and pays it the carrier then sends the traffic into the terminating country and pays the terminating carrier.the fcc has recognized refile as an economically rational way for an international telecommunications provider to structure its business dealings with other carriers.see in re int l settlement rates.thus at t delivers the calls to the third party and does not deliver the calls to kyrgyzstan directly or indirectly.in short,at t washed its hands of business in kyrgyzstan.
litigation.on march,katel sued at t in the southern district of new york.recognizing that kt might be a necessary party,katel unsuccessfully invited kt to join the litigation.to forestall any possible rule b motion,katel bought an assignment of kt rights against at t through may.katel and kt executed a russian language assignment,and on the same day an english language assignment that was intended to replicate the russian language assignment and that could be used by katel to defeat a rule b motion.
on september,kt intervened in the t lawsuit and moved to compel arbitration against katel pursuant to the terms of the russian language assignment katel contends that kt intervention was inspired by at at t then moved to file an interpleader counterclaim by which it would deposit with the district court the sum of,the amount that all parties agreed was owed to katel kt for the period through may.the court granted at t motion the parties stipulated that this was the amount owed and the litigation was stayed pending the outcome of their arbitration,which was to determine how the interpleaded funds would be divided between them.the arbitrator ultimately ruled that katel was entitled to the full amount,and on october,the district court ordered that the funds be disbursed to katel.
meanwhile,in the t litigation,the parties had filed for summary judgment.at oral argument on february,katel argued that at t breached the agreement by failing to adhere to paragraph requirement that it use katel infrastructure to send calls to kyrgyzstan at t tortiously interfered with katel business relations with kt and at t owed reimbursement to katel for traffic sent by at t to for periods when at t did not use katel equipment or virtue of the international telecommunications regulations itrs.
in an oral decision,the district court ruled for at t on all claims.as to breach of contract,the court concluded that paragraph makes the agreement a contract that allows at t to use other means to route traffic into kyrgyzstan that absent any such obligation to send a specific amount of traffic through katel,at t did not breach the agreement when it stopped using katel circuits and that paragraph concerns how traffic will be whether at t is required to offer any traffic to katel.
as to tortious interference,the district court ruled that the declaration of katel principal ross jacoby on which katel wholly relied offered no more than conclusory allegations that at t had sought to drive a wedge between katel and kt.separately,the court held that at t had a reasonable basis to believe that kt rather than katel was authorized to do business in kyrgyzstan,and to act upon that belief.
as to the itrs,the court held that they confer no private right of action.
at a status hearing two weeks after this summary judgment ruling,the district court ordered katel to submit in writing the nature of any remaining claims it had against at katel responded that its only remaining claim concerned payment it believed at t owed for the period january,through april.after some additional discovery,at t moved for summary judgment,which the district court granted on the ground that katel offered no evidence that at t owed anything other than the sum it had already lodged with the court.in addition,the district court denied a motion by katel to reopen discovery for the purpose of disclosing jacoby as an expert witness on the custom and practice of the international telecommunications industry.
this appeal.katel raises five arguments on appeal at t breached the agreement by not using katel services to terminate calls in kyrgyzstan even if at t was not in breach,industry custom and practice required at t to pay katel for calls terminating in kyrgyzstan katel presented sufficient evidence on its tortious interference claim the itrs provide a private right of action and the district court abused its discretion in denying katel motion to reopen discovery for the purpose of disclosing jacoby as an expert witness.
analyzing the arguments seriatim,we affirm.
katel contends that at t breached the agreement by sending telecommunications traffic to kyrgyzstan by means other than the at link referenced in paragraph of the agreement.
