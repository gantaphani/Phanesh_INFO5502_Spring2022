this appeal requires us to address whether,under the telecommunications act of,an incumbent local exchange carrier must exclude its operator services from its local telephone services package offered to new market entrants for resale.because we disagree with the district court determination that an incumbent carrier does have to exclude operator services from its complete services package made available for resale,we reverse.
background 
congress enacted the telecommunications act of the act to instigate competition in local and long distance telephone markets by lifting the shackles of monopoly regulation,at,reprinted in.accordingly,the act imposes certain duties upon incumbent local exchange carriers.these carriers historically had a monopoly over local markets because they owned the physical networks needed in supplying telecommunication services.of particular importance to this appeal is these carriers resale duty,which requires incumbents to provide their complete retail package of services to prospective entrants in the intrastate telephone market.c supp.v.entrants then can compete with incumbents by reselling these services to their own customers.id.
to effectuate their resale and other enumerated duties under the act,incumbents must negotiate interconnection agreements with prospective market entrants.incumbent carriers and new entrants are first to enter into good faith negotiations to detail the terms for such interconnection.a.should the parties fail to reach agreement on all terms,the act provides for binding arbitration before the relevant state public service commission.b c.once the state commission approves the arbitration agreement,an aggrieved party may bring an action in district court to determine whether the agreement meets the requirements of the act.e.
appellant,bellsouth telecommunications,bellsouth,is an incumbent carrier in the florida intrastate telephone market,and appellee,communications of the southern states,is a prospective entrant into that market.pursuant to the act,bellsouth and began negotiations over an interconnection agreement,but the parties could not agree on all terms,including the particular services bellsouth would offer to for resale.as a result,and bellsouth entered into binding arbitration before the florida public service commission the commission or fpsc.the commission concluded,among other things,that if wanted to purchase bellsouth local telephone services for resale,it would have to purchase bellsouth operator services,which were part of the basic package of telephone services bellsouth offered to its own retail customers.
unsatisfied with the fpsc conclusions,commenced this action under e against bellsouth,the fpsc,and the fpsc commissioners in their official capacities in the northern district of florida.the district court reversed the fpsc on the operator services issue based on its interpretation of the act and on accompanying federal communication commission fcc regulations.the district court concluded that bellsouth had to eliminate its operator services from its services package offered to for resale.upon entry of judgment,bellsouth,the fpsc,and the fpsc commissioners sought review from this court on the limited question of whether the district court erred with regard to the operator services issue.
ii.discussion 
a.the standard of review 
whether the act and accompanying fcc regulations require operator services to be eliminated from an incumbent local telephone services package offered to new entrants for resale is a purely legal question.consequently,we review de novo the district court determinations on this issue.united states plummer,cir.
b.the telecommunications statutory landscape 
historically,states exclusively regulated intrastate telephone service,and the fcc generally lacked jurisdiction over such service.see b.states like florida treated local telephone service networks as natural monopolies and granted certain exchange carriers exclusive franchises for providing local services.as the fcc explains,i n the old regulatory regime government encouraged monopolies state and federal regulators devoted their efforts over many decades to regulating the prices and practices of telecommunications monopolies and protecting them against competitive entry.
in return for an exclusive franchise,florida local carriers had their telephone rates regulated and were required to provide universal service,which mandates local phone rates based on the policy that local phone service should be affordable by all who wish it and subsidized from some other source,including and business service.see communications of the southern states,marks,so d.florida implemented its universal service framework through tariff agreements instituted between the fpsc and local carriers under this tariff regime,monopoly carriers were to provide affordable local telephone service to residential customers where the expense would otherwise create economic discentives to providing service.this framework ensured that affordable telephone service was available in all locales throughout the state.
the telecommunications structure premised on exclusive franchises and subsidized local services began to undergo rapid change in the.the goals of the act included opening local telephone markets to competition and eliminating the exclusive franchise system.see a.the act aimed to shift monopoly markets to competition as quickly as possible,at,reprinted in at.in lieu of exclusive local carriers,the act institutes a regulatory framework that encourages new entrants to enter local markets.to facilitate new entry,the act provides three distinct entry paths for potential competitors.first,the new entrant can build new network facilities to compete with the facilities already owned by incumbent local carriers,at.at.second,it can buy access to network elements owned by incumbents on an unbundled basis by purchasing access to individual pieces of an incumbent telecommunications network,such as local loops and local switching devices,that can then be used by the entrant to offer competing local services.c unbundled access provision.third,it can buy retail telephone services offered by incumbents and then resell these services to its own customers.c resale provision.because the unbundled access provision and resale provision are particularly significant to this case,we will discuss each in turn.
under the unbundled access provision,incumbent carriers have t he duty to provide to new entrants nondiscriminatory access to network elements on an unbundled basis at any technically feasible point.c.n etwork element s are defined broadly to include any facility or equipment used in the provision of a telecommunications service,as well as features,functions,and capabilities provided by any facility or equipment.unbundled access permit s new entrants to offer competing local services by purchasing from incumbents at prices,access to elements which they do not already possess,unbundled from those elements that they do not need.at,emphasis added.to use a simple analogy,the unbundled access provision is akin to requiring one car manufacturer to sell a competitor access not to one of its completed vehicles,but to the individual elements of the vehicle,such as the engine,radiator,and tires,all of which the manufacturer has unbundled,or segregated out,for the competitor convenience.
additionally,the act provides a distinct pricing mechanism for purchase of network elements from incumbents.new entrants are to obtain access to these elements at rates,terms,and conditions that are just,reasonable,and nondiscriminatory.c.in turn,these rates are to be based on the cost determined without reference to a or other proceeding of providing network elements and may include a reasonable profit.d a b.
the resale provision creates a separate set of duties for incumbents.incumbent carriers must offer for resale at wholesale rates any telecommunications service that the carrier provides at retail to subscribers who are not telecommunications carriers.c a emphasis added.to continue our previous analogy,the resale provision is akin to requiring the car manufacturer only to provide its competitor access to the completed vehicle itself without permitting separate,unbundled purchase of individual vehicle parts.
congress also provided a completely separate and distinct pricing methodology for the resale provision.this methodology provides that incumbent carriers are to recoup the full retail rate they currently charge customers for complete telephone services minus any marketing,billing,collection,and other costs that will be avoided by the local exchange carrier in selling at wholesale to a new entrant.d.thus,unlike the pricing rule for the unbundled access provision,the resale pricing rule begins with the current retail rate as the proper baseline for calculation,not with cost.
the act and its introduction of these new entry paths into local telecommunications markets revolutionized the telecommunications industry.the act implementation,however,continues to operate against a backdrop of state tariff arrangements and universal service mechanisms that create a potential patchwork quilt of state subsidies intended to promote telephone subscribership.at.indeed,although congress intended for the act to facilitate competition,at the same time it specifically codified its commitment to universal service mechanisms.see.the act itself contemplates a partnership to sustain universal service.see b there should be specific,predictable and sufficient federal and state mechanisms to preserve and advance universal service.f every telecommunications carrier that provides intrastate communications services shall contribute in a manner determined by the state to the preservation and advancement of universal service in that state.thus,even in the present deregulatory climate,states still play a major role in implementing tariff agreements that ensure universal service in intrastate telephone markets.
like other states,florida continues in its commitment to universal service.see.stat.ann.it is the intent of the legislature that universal service objectives be maintained after the local exchange market is opened to competitively provided services.consequently,florida law requires that f or a period of years after january,each local exchange telecommunications company furnish basic local exchange telecommunications service within a reasonable time period to any person requesting such service within the company service territory.id.basic local telecommunications service includes,among other things,emergency services,directory assistance,and operator services.emphasis added.moreover,telecommunications carriers still must file tariff schedules detailing the rates charged for service and the carriers service obligations with the fpsc.see.admin.code ann.local telephone rates also remain subject to fpsc oversight 
in sum,although the act fosters competition,the act continues to operate in a florida telecommunications landscape affected by a history of universal service implemented through required tariff filings.this clash between the act and traditional state pricing regimes can distort competition.as the fcc has noted,s ome policies that traditionally have been justified on universal service considerations place competitors at a disadvantage.other universal service policies place the incumbent at a competitive disadvantage.at.
this distortion is particularly cogent when a new entrant gains access to an incumbent retail services package under the act resale provision.for instance,new entrants can target for purchase an incumbent retail services in florida markets where the incumbent historically has charged rates because of universal service objectives.then the entrant can resale those services at a rate that undercuts the incumbent artificially high rates.while good for certain consumers,this entry strategy undercuts the incumbent ability to subsidize and recover its historical investments in markets where universal service commitments led to pricing.
conversely,new entrants can use the resale provision to take advantage of artificially low prices in florida markets where service traditionally has been subsidized.because the resale pricing rule uses retail rates as the baseline for determining the compensation owed to incumbents,entrants can purchase from incumbents those complete services offered in markets where retail prices are artificially low because of the historical subsidy system.thus,the new entrant potentially can use the resale pricing mechanism to obtain a cost advantage over an incumbent in markets where retail prices are lower than they otherwise would be absent florida traditional commitment to universal service as reflected in the fpsc set tariff.
operator services relevant to this case 
against this statutory backdrop,the district court interpreted the act resale provision to require the incumbent carrier,bellsouth,to eliminate operator services from its retail telephone services package offered to the new entrant,for resale.communications of the southern states,bellsouth telecommunications,d,communications.the court concluded that the fpsc erred by failing to require bellsouth to exclude the cost of such services from the price charged to for access to bellsouth complete services package.id.
the district court reached this conclusion for two reasons.first,the court determined that operator services constitute other costs under d and consequently should be eliminated from bellsouth complete services package offered to for resale.id.at.second,the court relied on two fcc customized routing provisions,c iii b and at,as a basis for requiring bellsouth to eliminate operator services from its resold services package.id.we reject the district court reasoning.
other costs under d 
the district court premised its decision in part on its finding that operator services are other costs under d,the pricing rule for the resale provision.communications,d at.section d provides that marketing,billing,collection,and other costs that will be avoided by the incumbent should be eliminated from the price of retail services offered to new entrants for resale.emphasis added.the court analogized operator services costs to billing costs and concluded that,like the latter,the former are costs that bellsouth can avoid when it offers its services at wholesale to rather than at retail to consumers.id.at.this conclusion is untenable for several reasons.
of primary importance is the district court failure to interpret the act resale provision in light of the backdrop of historical state universal service commitments and accompanying tariff filing requirements.we have explained that traditional state universal service objectives can distort competition and offer competitive advantages to new entrants like who strategically use the resale provision.can purchase access to bellsouth services offered in markets where rates are artificially high because of a history of subsidized universal service,and then can resell those services at a reduced rate.thus,can undercut bellsouth ability to use an pricing structure to recover historical investments in other florida markets where services have been offered at rates.conversely,can obtain the benefits of florida traditional universal service framework by using the act resale provisions to acquire access to bellsouth services offered in markets where the retail rate is artificially low because of a history of subsidy arrangements.therefore,can obtain potential cost advantages over bellsouth.
strategy in this case suggests that it plans to use the act resale provisions to exploit these advantages.regarding the operator services issue,has insisted on proceeding under the resale provision and its retail rate pricing methodology.proceeds in this manner despite the fact that bellsouth concedes that if proceeded under the unbundled access provision,bellsouth would have to exclude operator services facilities from other network elements offered to.refusal to so proceed suggests that the company is taking advantage of competitive distortions caused by florida history of universal service and accompanying tariff regimes.
although is attentive to how artificial prices caused by a history of universal service in florida can accrue to its benefit under the resale provision,simultaneously ignores this framework whenever it might suggest a need for constrictions on its entry path.thus,in argument over whether operator services constitute other costs under d,the history of universal service in florida goes unmentioned.we find that just the opposite should be the case.the meaning of other costs should be historically contextualized and read in view of the costs imposed on local carriers because of a history in florida of universal service and an accompanying tariff regime.otherwise,new entrants like can benefit from traditional state subsidy arrangements while ignoring the costs they impose on bellsouth and other local carriers.such a result would conflict with the act commitment to ensuring that incumbents receive fair compensation for providing access to their services for resale.see.
consequently,in determining whether operator services constitute other costs under d,we must consider bellsouth universal service commitments under florida law.as part of florida commitment to universal service,each local carrier in florida is required to provide basic local telephone service within a reasonable time to anyone who requests it within the carrier service area for an period after january.stat.ann.basic local phone service includes operator services.at oral argument,counsel for bellsouth stated that bellsouth tariff agreement requires it to provide operator services in florida.that operator services are a required element of bellsouth local telephone services package indicates that such services are not mere costs akin to marketing,billing,and collection under d.it instead suggests that operator services are an essential component to bellsouth local service,inextricably interwoven with the proper transmission of telephone communications,not a cost rightly viewed as avoidable or ancillary to basic telephone service.section of florida statutes also states that florida considers operator services a necessity,an integral service conducive to the smooth operation of a carrier telecommunication platform.it follows that the district court erred in conflating operator services with more peripheral costs like marketing,billing and collection by requiring bellsouth to extricate operator services from its complete services package made available to for resale.
apart from our decision based on the tradition of universal service in florida,we conclude that the district court misinterpreted d for two additional reasons.the first is based on a proper interpretation of that section according to the principle that general terms following a series of more specifically enumerated terms refer to items similar in structure and function to the enumerated terms.united states sepulveda,cir.in view of this principle,the specifically enumerated terms under d marketing,billing,and encompass the scope of what constitutes other costs.that is,other costs should be read as referencing activities similar in structure and function,sepulveda at,to the three specific activities listed.marketing,billing,and collection are activities that center on the promotion of telephone services and on generating and collecting revenue from such services.operator services are not similar in structure or function to promotional or activities such services instead are activities that shore up the smooth operation and transmission of telecommunications over the service network.it follows that operator services can not be deemed other costs under d.
we also disagree with the district court because,in interpreting d,the court improperly focused on the resold services package the new entrant,wanted to offer to its own customers,not on the services package offered by the incumbent,bellsouth,to its current retail customers.the district court observed that operator services generate costs akin to billing because b oth are features that a reseller might reasonably choose to provide for itself.communications,d at emphasis added.section d,however,states that other costs include only those that will be avoided by the local exchange carrier,here bellsouth.emphasis added.as the fcc has explained,other costs are those that an incumbent would no longer incur if it were to cease retail operations and instead provide all of its services through resellers.at,thus,the standard for what constitutes other costs is the services package offered by the incumbent to its current retail customers,irrespective of the services package the new entrant wants to offer to its own customers when it resells the incumbent services.it is undisputed that bellsouth offers operator services as part of its basic services package to retail customers.whether wants to offer its own operator services to prospective customers does not change this fact.the district court therefore erred in its interpretation of d by focusing on desire to offer its own operator services instead of on bellsouth current retail package,which includes such services.
customized routing under c iii b and at,
beyond the other costs argument under d,the district court relied on and at,to justify its decision regarding operator services.the court observed that under these two fcc provisions,bellsouth,as an incumbent carrier,has a duty to provide new entrants like with customized routing.communications,d at.from the district court perspective,customized routing is the functional equivalent of requiring bellsouth to provide local service without operator services for resale.id.the district court reliance on the two customized routing provisions in concluding that bellsouth had to eliminate operator services from its resold services package,however,is misplaced.
the primary problem with the district court customized routing discussion is that such routing is an obligation placed on incumbents under the unbundled access provision,not the resale provision,and so it is inapplicable to the present action.we turn first to c iii b.section does address an incumbent customized routing obligations to new entrants but the section is titled specific unbundling requirements.emphasis added.this reference to unbundling contextualizes because unbundling is a term of art under the reference indicates that the fcc is discussing an incumbent obligations when a new entrant purchases access to the incumbent facilities under the unbundled access provision,not the resale provision.indeed,is contained in subpart d of the fcc interconnection rules,but the rules governing resale of services by an incumbent are set forth in subpart g.it follows that c iii b is inapplicable to the present dispute over operator services between bellsouth and,a dispute that only concerns the act resale provision.
we reach a similar conclusion with regard to at.paragraph provides that incumbent s must unbundle the facilities and functionalities providing operator services and directory assistance from resold services and other unbundled network elements to the extent technically feasible.id.at.emphasis added.as with,the reference here to unbundle indicates that paragraph refers to an incumbent obligations under the unbundled access provision.unlike,however,there is reference in paragraph to resold services,which at first glance might suggest that the paragraph also creates incumbent obligations under the resale provision.upon closer inspection,this suggestion proves erroneous.
paragraph is found in section v of the fcc first report and order,entitled access to unbundled network elements,not section viii,entitled resale.the reference to the term of art unbundled in the section title again suggests that paragraph only concerns obligations under the unbundled access provision.moreover,if the fcc meant the paragraph to impose obligations under the resale provision,the paragraph would have appeared,or one akin to it would have appeared,in section viii,resale.there is no paragraph,however,that is analogous to found in the resale section.
in fact,in own comments to the fcc proposed order,called for the fcc to adopt a rule directing incumbents to make local service available for resale without operator services.see reply brief for app
