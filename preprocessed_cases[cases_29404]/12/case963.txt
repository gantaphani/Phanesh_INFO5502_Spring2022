the district attorneys of three northern california,san mateo,and from a judgment dismissing their suit for injunctive relief and civil penalties under the unfair competition law ucl.the trial court sustained a general demurrer by respondent public utility without leave to amend after concluding its subject matter jurisdiction over the suit was preempted.for reasons that will appear,we affirm.
background 
acting in the name of the people,appellant district attorneys filed their complaint in the alameda county superior court on september,seeking statutory remedies including injunctive relief under the ucl for alleged unfair and deceptive advertising by respondent the complaint targeted three services marketed to telephone customers by the blocking,custom calling features,and inside telephone wire repair the subject of the alleged deceptive practices.with respect to the marketing of each service,the complaint alleged,the utility had deceived its customers by false and misleading advertising.pacific bell and telesis group filed a general demurrer to the complaint,contending that because administrative proceedings seeking comparable relief for the identical alleged misconduct were pending before the public utilities commission commission,the superior court subject matter jurisdiction over the cause was ousted by section of the public utilities code unspecified statutory references are to this code.
the proceedings before the commission to which respondent referred in its demurrer were commenced in by several consumer advocacy groups and labor unions,which filed serial administrative complaints attacking the utility marketing of its call blocking,custom service,and inside wire repair services,the same marketing practices challenged by appellants in this lawsuit.some of these administrative complaints included claims that the challenged conduct violated the ucl.the separate proceedings were consolidated before an administrative law judge,who held two weeks of evidentiary hearings and filed a tentative ruling for the commission review on december.
the administrative law judge alj found respondent had failed to meet the disclosure standards prescribed in the relevant public utilities statute because customers were not fully informed about the two call blocking options.regarding the custom calling issue,the alj found respondent sales strategy was designed to convey a mistaken impression to customers and failed to meet the requirements of its current tariff.she also found respondent had failed to present customers with sufficient information regarding alternative inside wire repair services.the alj decision recommended multiple remedies,including ordering respondent to deposit million in a customer education fund and imposing a fine in the amount of million,half of which would be stayed pending compliance with the decision.both the alj proposed ruling and a competing tentative ruling by assigned commissioner neeper,recommending somewhat different remedies,were appealed to the full commission,where they are pending review 
following briefing and oral argument,the superior court sustained respondent demurrer without leave to amend,ruling it lacked jurisdiction to proceed in light of the ongoing adjudicatory proceedings before the commission challenging identical conduct and asserting similar claims for relief.this appeal timely followed.
this appeal presents the intersection collision might be more apt of competing legislative policies embodied in separate statutory schemes.on the one hand,in those matters lying within its broad administrative ken,the legislature has decreed the preemptive power of the commission to oust,under articulated circumstances,the exercise of all judicial jurisdiction except that of the supreme court and the court of appeal,subd.a.on the other hand,the legislature has conferred similarly broad powers on public law enforcement by the state attorney general and its county district enforce statutory remedies against consumer fraud and other unfair business practices under the ucl.bus,people mckale cal d.the question presented by this appeal is,when the two schemes collide,which scheme trumps 
respondent public utility contends that,because the subject matter of appellants ucl complaint in the superior court is substantially identical to the subject of adjudicatory proceedings currently pending before the commission,the trial court jurisdiction to proceed is preempted by section and the cases construing it.the appellant district attorneys counter with the proposition that their law enforcement role under the ucl is of equal dignity with the commission regulatory jurisdiction and that this parallel lawsuit should be permitted to go forward apace,notwithstanding the concurrent administrative proceedings.neither side cites case or other legal authority squarely for or against appellants position.we have found none.although we must decide the case in the absence of authority directly in point,there are standards to which we resort for guidance.
in san diego gas electric superior court cal th,d,covalt,our supreme court considered whether a claim for damages and related relief brought against a public utility by homeowners,stemming from fears that nearby electrical high transmission lines exposed them to the threat of cancer,was preempted by section.the utility had set up the statute as a jurisdictional defense,arguing the suit was barred by the commission statutory jurisdiction to regulate electrical powerlines.the trial court overruled a demurrer to the complaint,but the court of appeal reversed.granting review,the supreme court affirmed the appellate ruling ordering the demurrer sustained without leave to amend.covalt,supra,cal th at,d.building on its prior decision in waters pacific telephone cal d,the covalt court wrote u nder the waters rule an action for damages against a public utility pursuant to section is barred by section not only when an award of damages would directly contravene a specific order or decision of the commission,when it would reverse,correct,or annul that order or decision,but also when an award of damages would simply have the effect of undermining a general supervisory or regulatory policy of the commission,when it would hinder or frustrate or interfere with or obstruct that policy.covalt,supra,cal th at,d,italics added.
the opinion in cellular plus,superior court th,d,is an instructive example of circumstances under which judicial jurisdiction is not ousted by section.plaintiffs alleged price fixing claims against two cellular telephone service companies,asserting an unlawful antitrust conspiracy in violation of the cartwright act.bus,et see cellular plus,superior court,supra,th at,d.in sustaining defendants demurrer to the complaint,the trial court ruled the utilities were immune from cartwright act liability because of the commission exclusive jurisdiction over utility ratemaking.relying on the jurisdictional formulation in waters,supra,cal d,the court of appeal reversed.we can not conceive,it wrote,how a price fixing claim under the cartwright act could hinder or frustrate the puc supervisory or regulatory policies.the only apparent policy of the puc that could be affected is its regulation of rates charged by cellular telephone service providers.however plaintiff does not dispute that the puc has jurisdiction over rates,nor does it seek any relief requiring the puc to change any rates it has approved.plaintiff is merely seeking treble damages and injunctive relief for alleged price fixing under the cartwright act.cellular plus,superior court,supra,th at,d.
and in stepak american.d,plaintiffs were minority shareholders of a public utility that had merged with another utility.alleging the merger was unfair to them,plaintiffs sought declaratory relief and an injunction halting the merger.the utilities moved to dismiss,asserting the commission not only had exclusive jurisdiction to approve the merger,but in administrative proceedings had determined it was fair to minority shareholders.reversing a trial court order dismissing the suit on jurisdictional grounds,the court of appeal relied on waters,supra,cal d,our case is distinguishable from waters and other cases where the subject of the superior court action is addressed by commission regulation.citations.we are aware of no declared supervisory and regulatory policies ever formulated or relied on by the commission on the subject of safeguarding minority investor interests.applying the waters test of jurisdiction,we can not conceive of how the superior court award of damages or other relief to wronged minority shareholders would hinder or frustrate declared commission policy.stepak american,supra,at.the rule to be derived from this line of cases was encapsulated by the high court in covalt,supra,cal th at pp,d,when the bar raised against a private damages action has been a ruling of the commission on a single matter such as its approval of a tariff or a merger,the courts have tended to hold that the action would not hinder a policy of the commission within the meaning of waters and hence may proceed.
on the other side of the line lie those cases holding superior court jurisdiction is preempted by section under identifiable circumstances.for example,schell southern cal.edison d.involved legislation requiring the commission to establish baseline quantities of natural gas and electricity for residential distribution at below market rates.plaintiff sued the utility for damages and declaratory relief,contending that as the owner of a recreational vehicle park he was entitled to purchase and distribute gas and electricity to his tenants at baseline rates.in prior proceedings under the statute,the commission had designated baseline quantities on an interim basis,ruling the statutory term residential customer did not include transient trailer parks such as plaintiff.affirming the trial court sustention of a demurrer without leave to amend,the appellate court took judicial notice of administrative matters pending on the commission docket challenging the rate classification for baseline quantities and the exemption of recreational vehicle parks.id.at.noting the commission had directed the defendant public utility to conduct a study of the need for and feasibility of changes in tariff rates,the court concluded that the decision as to whether or not residential recreational vehicle parks should be charged at the same rate as similar parks is clearly within the exclusive purview of the puc as part of its continuing jurisdiction over rate making and rate regulation in provision of baseline service to residential customers of the electric and gas corporations.id.at.
in brian pacific bell d,this court affirmed dismissal of a suit by parents seeking damages and injunctive relief requiring telephone companies to adopt a specific technology customer access codes to restrict minors access to sexually explicit messages.because the commission had held hearings on the issue and was pursuing an ongoing investigation into the optimal means of restricting such access by minors,section applied to preempt the courts from exercising jurisdiction over litigation aimed at producing the same result.id.at.the covalt opinion formulated the rule expressed in this latter line of cases as being one in which the relief sought would have interfered with a broad and continuing supervisory or regulatory program of the commission,and the courts have found such a hindrance and barred the action under section.covalt,supra,cal th at,d.
it is not difficult to foresee that in this litigation factual and legal conflicts with ongoing commission proceedings are,if anything,even more likely to arise than they were in covalt,supra,cal th,d,here,the commission is not engaged in preliminary rulemaking as in covalt,but in actually adjudicating concrete claims for relief against the utility growing out of the same marketing practices attacked by appellants in their complaint in this case.the legal and factual issues before the commission in the adjudicatory proceedings described above are,in other words,identical to those presented to the superior court by appellants ucl complaint,a xerox copy,as respondent counsel put it in argument before the trial court.appellants ucl suit thus falls within the literal language of section,as a proceeding in which the trial court exercised jurisdiction to reverse,correct or annul an order or decision of the commission,subd.a.in light of that circumstance,if appellants were private litigants,this would be an a fortiori case for affirmance under the statute and the cases construing it.the narrow question we must decide,then,is whether the public character of appellants takes the case out of the preemption formulation applied in covalt and the precedents on which it rests.
appellants,along with the attorney general and the california district attorneys association cdaa as supporting amici curiae,present an array of arguments to distinguish their lawsuit from ucl litigation brought by private plaintiffs.first,they contend the legislature has,at least by implication,carved an exception to the preemption imposed by section for those ucl proceedings prosecuted by the attorney general and subsidiary law enforcement agencies.the argument hinges on a single sentence in the high court opinion in people pacific land research cal d,pacific land research,that a ucl action filed by the people seeking injunctive relief and civil penalties is fundamentally a law enforcement action designed to protect the public and not to benefit private parties.id.at.that case,however,was a suit by the attorney general seeking restitution for fraudulent land sales the court made the statement relied on in reaching the conclusion that public ucl proceedings did not require the notice to the class of affected consumers that a private class action would require.id.at.relatedly,appellants argue the remedies under the ucl are cumulative,and in addition to other remedies,including those available before the commission,citing section of the business and professions code 
notwithstanding the accuracy of the court statement in pacific land research,supra,cal d at page,we think its broad generality is insufficient to overcome contrary high court precedent in a closely analogous area that,as we explain,is persuasive on the issue whether ucl litigation by law enforcement officials is exempt from the preemptive sweep of section.in farmers ins.exchange superior court cal th,d,farmers,the attorney general instituted proceedings under the ucl seeking injunctive relief and civil penalties against several insurers for their alleged failure to offer eligible insureds the good driver discount established by passage of.id.at,d.defendant insurers sought to stay the litigation pending resort to administrative proceedings before the insurance commissioner,whose department administers.both the trial court and the court of appeal denied the stay requests,the latter on the ground that the ucl proceeding was cumulative to other remedies and thus not foreclosed by the availability of administrative relief.id.at,d.granting review and reversing,the supreme court ordered the suit stayed,holding it was subject to the doctrine of primary jurisdiction requiring initial resort to administrative proceedings before the insurance commissioner ibid.
in reaching that determination,the high court expressly considered the claim of the people that ucl proceedings brought by law enforcement officials were exempt from the primary jurisdiction doctrine.rejecting the unsupported and novel claim that because the attorney general is the chief law enforcement officer of the state,actions filed by him should not be subject to the primary jurisdiction doctrine,the court said that the reasons supporting the doctrine apply to private citizens and the attorney general alike,and the two classes of plaintiffs should be treated equally.farmers,supra,at,d.given this analogous precedent,we think the case for rejecting appellants argument in the context of preemption under section is,if anything,even stronger than it was in farmers.for here,we deal with a statute through which the legislature,in the exercise of its plenary power over the commission and its authority cal,art.xii,has allocated subject matter jurisdiction between the judiciary and the commission.unlike the primary jurisdiction doctrine,which as the farmers opinion notes is flexible and discretionary farmers,supra,cal th at,d,the legal conception of subject matter jurisdiction a court fundamental power to not it is the opposite.abelleira district court of appeal cal d,lack of jurisdiction in its most fundamental or strict sense means an entire absence of power to hear or determine the case,an absence of authority over the subject matter.under its constitutional authority to vest the commission with subject matter jurisdiction,the legislature in its wisdom has determined the courts lack the power to proceed in cases that would interfere with the commission operations.for section purposes,the issue of interference is a jurisdictional,not a discretionary,touchstone 
as for the argument that jurisdiction over this suit is exempt from ouster by section because the ucl remedy is cumulative,a lthough the ucl scope is sweeping,it is not unlimited specific legislation may limit the judiciary power to declare conduct unfair.if the legislature has considered a situation and concluded no action should lie,courts may not override that determination.communications,los angeles cellular telephone cal th,d.section declares the remedies afforded by the ucl to be cumulative.as the court in farmers,supra,cal th at page,d,put it,section merely reflects a legislative intent that the remedy under section not displace any other remedy that might exist.the provision does not purport to confer a jurisdictional exception for ucl proceedings,whether brought by public or private plaintiffs.the argument thus runs afoul of elementary principles of subject matter jurisdiction a court must possess jurisdiction to proceed before any consideration of remedies is appropriate.
second,appellants contend prosecution of this ucl proceeding by law enforcement officials promotes commission policies,citing several speeches and publications by commissioners past and present praising the enforcement partnership among the cdaa,the attorney general,and the commission enforcement staff.we have no doubts whatever concerning the accuracy of these comments or the considerable value public law enforcement provides in assisting an agency with extremely broad regulatory powers.the argument,however,overlooks the distinguishing and decisive feature of this fact that specific adjudicatory proceedings before the commission raising the identical challenges to the utility marketing practices and seeking comparable remedies are in full swing the potential for conflict and contradiction arising from simultaneous parallel proceedings is manifest for,as the court of appeal wrote in a case addressing section preemption,pratt coast trucking,d,no sensible person should for a moment contend that there is an area within which the commission and the courts can legitimately reach exactly opposite and conflicting conclusions on a given set of facts.id.at.quoted with approval in waters,supra,cal d at.
indeed,the conclusion that section operates to deprive a trial court of subject matter jurisdiction to decide the same claims pending before the commission in adjudicatory proceedings antedates the interference formulation adopted by the court in waters,supra,cal d at page,miller railroad commission cal d,after water company was declared a public utility by the trial court which set its rates,the commission set different rates at petitioner request the trial court then held utility in contempt,ruling the commission acted without jurisdiction commission then set a higher rate and petitioner sought review.held trial court lost jurisdiction after the commission acted upon the commission assumption of jurisdiction over the activities of the utility,any order or judgment of the superior court in conflict with the orders of the commission is to that extent ineffective and of no binding effect pacific.superior court sokol cal d,prohibition by utility to bar superior court from proceeding to trial on customer claim of wrongful termination of service.held prior commission ruling utility did not act wrongfully in terminating service ousted court subject matter jurisdiction.the mandate of the legislature,violated by the superior court is to place the commission,insofar as the state courts are concerned,in a position where it may not be hampered in the performance of any official act by any court except to the extent and in the manner specified in the code itself respondent superior court was therefore without jurisdiction to pass upon the question here presented people ex rel.public util.com.ryerson d.after commission determined carrier had undercharged customer and directed it to recover uncollected revenue,carrier sued customer parties stipulated freight bills should be reformed to reflect their rate agreement and judgment entered thereon commission then sued to vacate judgment.held the judgment of reformation constituted,in effect,a judgment reviewing and annulling the order of the commission and,hence,was in excess of the court jurisdiction,citing pratt,supra,d.
last and somewhat dramatically,appellants assert the outcome of this appeal will determine whether pacific bell is beyond the reach of this state consumer laws.at stake is the public most significant protection against deceptive advertising and whether the public loses law enforcement advocacy,resources,relief and sanctions which the legislature has specially designated to prosecutors through court proceedings.the result we reach in this case,however,places only a modest limitation on the law enforcement partnership between the commission and the people as represented by the attorney general and county district attorneys.that is so because the jurisprudence of commission preemption supports concurrent subject matter jurisdiction where administrative events that trigger preemption under section are not present.
as the case law demonstrates,the doctrinal contours of section as they have been developed by the court of appeal in specific situations are as modest as they are straightforward.in circumstances under which the commission has not exercised jurisdiction to regulate the subject at issue,the superior courts possess a concurrent subject matter jurisdiction that is not preempted by section,leslie superior court th,d complaint against utility alleging violations of county building code not preempted the puc has not promulgated rules concerning the construction,maintenance or grading of access roads.nor has it purported to exercise its authority over such matters cellular plus,superior court,supra,th,d prosecution of antitrust price fixing claims against cellular telephone companies would not hinder or frustrate commission regulatory policies and were not preempted stepak american,supra,d.suit by minority shareholders of public utility that had merged seeking injunction halting the merger not preempted court was aware of no declared supervisory and regulatory policies ever formulated or relied on by the commission on the subject of safeguarding minority investor interests pierce pacific gas electric d.tort suit not preempted where commission had not acted to limit utility liability for malfunctioning overhead wires vila tahoe southside water utility d.suit for injunction and damages for refusal to make water hookup not preempted where commission had completed ratemaking proceedings and directed utility to adopt rates.
on the other hand,as covalt points out cal th at,d,in cases such as schell southern cal.edison,supra,d,and brian pacific bell,supra,d,the courts held the suits preempted under section because so long as the matter was before the commission as part of its ongoing inquiry,the superior court had no jurisdiction over the matter covalt at,d,see also ford pacific gas th,d trial court lacked jurisdiction over plaintiff wrongful death action against utility based on decedent exposure to electric and magnetic fields in light of commission prior determination that scientific evidence was insufficient to establish dangerousness of such fields.
the principle at work in these cases is nice
