a labor union in houston,texas sought permits from the city for parades and rallies in support of a strike.the city gave only partial approval.the union sued,claiming the ordinances under which the permits were processed violated the first amendment.the district court granted some relief.we proceed slightly further in invalidating the city rules than did the district court but leave most of the city scheme intact.we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand.
the service employees international union,local seiu is the plaintiff.among its members are janitors in houston.while in contract negotiations in october through november,seiu staged a strike.the goals of the strike were to be furthered by parades,marches,and rallies in downtown houston.the target audience for these highly visible protests was those who worked in the houston office buildings in which many seiu janitors were employed.optimal visibility,therefore,would have been in the middle of the workday.seiu members planned to use megaphones and bullhorns to amplify their message.
seiu applied for permits to conduct the parades,marches,and rallies it planned.the city denied several of its requests.seiu suit challenged three of the ordinances that restricted its plans.a preliminary injunction was entered permitting seiu to proceed with some of its planned activities.the labor dispute has been resolved.the legal dispute continues.
a summary of the relevant ordinances is where we begin.
a.the ordinances 
the three challenged city ordinances require permits for certain categories of noise,authorizing parades,and controlling some uses of parks.during the course of the litigation,there have been amendments to some of the ordinances.because seiu seeks to have us invalidate many of the restrictions,the relevant language is found in the latest version of the ordinances that has been included in the record.a sketch of each current ordinance follows.
the sound ordinance 
the sound ordinance bans noise that annoys,disturbs,injures,or endangers the comfort,repose,health,peace,or safety of others.sound ordinance,houston,code of ordinances ch,a.there are several enumerated exemptions.among them is an exemption for church bells when used as part of a religious observance or service during daytime hours,but only if limited to no more than five minutes per hour.id.j.also exempted are sounds produced by activities on public parks and playgrounds,and on public or private school grounds,including,but not limited to,school athletic and school entertainment events.id.k.
sound amplification,including by a bullhorn or a megaphone,is generally prohibited.id.a.amplification of sound above a certain decibel level requires a permit.id.the sound ordinance limits permits for the same location to two per period.id.a.
the parade ordinance 
the city regulates processions on its roadways.parade ordinance,houston,code of ordinances ch,art.ix.the regulation defines the covered processions this way 
parade means a procession of pedestrians,vehicles,or animals,or any combination thereof,traveling in unison along or upon a street,road,or highway,organized and conducted for the purposes of attracting the attention of the general public expressing or celebrating views or ideas by use of verbal,visual,literary,or auditory means of communication.
id.ch,art.ix.
that definition of parade closes with the statement that a procession of vehicles operated in compliance with ordinary traffic laws or a procession of pedestrians along or upon public sidewalks or private property,is not a parade under the terms of the ordinance.id.
parades are prohibited except on issuance of a permit by the city.id.a.a traffic and security control plan may be required of the if it opts against using police services.id.g.weekday parades in downtown houston may begin either at or,must last no more than an hour,and can not extend for more than ten street intersections.see id.b.
the parks ordinance 
permits generally are not required to use city parks but are necessary in order to hold any public meeting or gathering in certain designated locations.parks and recreation ordinance,houston,code of ordinances ch,art.iii.a.some of those locations are described generically building or facility for which a rental fee is imposed,or a baseball field,or other area specifically designated and equipped for sporting or recreational events id.a.gatherings in certain specific locations,such as the houston zoo or the arboretum,also require permits.id.a.a provision concludes the listing any other improved and specially maintained area so designated by a rule or regulation promulgated pursuant to section of the ordinances.id.a.a map is to be maintained by the parks director indicating the areas requiring permits for public meetings or gatherings.id.b.the city concedes that no such map exists.
the parks ordinance requires the permit to be issued if the objective requirements for the permit are met,but denied if certain subjective failings exist.id.the latter failings include the size and nature of the meeting is inappropriate for the designated area requested or the proposed function would be disruptive to or incompatible with,or cause an adverse effect on the use of the designated area by others.id.
claimed deficiencies in ordinances 
the following are the features of the ordinances that are still in issue and are said to have unconstitutionally limited seiu activities 
the sound ordinance limit of two permits for any single location in a period.
the parade ordinance restrictions on downtown weekday parades to two windows.
in addition to specific features of the ordinances that impacted seiu,it is also claimed that each ordinance is unconstitutional in its entirety for more general reasons 
the sound ordinance contains exceptions that are not narrowly tailored.
the parade ordinance definition of a parade is,vague and not narrowly tailored.
the parks ordinance failure to define what constitutes a public meeting or gathering and to designate the relevant areas in parks create vague and inadequately tailored provisions.
the claims before the district court were more numerous.on some,relief was granted and the city has not appealed.on others,no ruling on summary judgment was made.seiu voluntarily dismissed the latter in order to proceed with an appeal.the only remaining challenges are what we have just described.
district court proceedings 
on october,seiu filed suit in the district court for the southern district of texas challenging the constitutionality of the three ordinances.two individuals and seiu are the current plaintiffs,all of whom are meant when we refer to seiu,unless in context it is clear that we are referring only to the union.the only current defendant is the city.
seiu contended that all three ordinances were facially invalid in their entirety.seiu sought a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction barring the city from enforcing portions of the ordinances.a preliminary injunction was granted on october,prohibiting enforcement against seiu of certain provisions of the parade and the sound ordinances.
in august,the parties filed for summary judgment.on march,the motions were granted in part and denied in part.the court invalidated a parks ordinance provision requiring to obtain additional security,concluding it to be impermissibly and vague,and a parade ordinance provision requiring notice for obtaining a parade permit which was held to be a prior restraint on speech.the district court also found that an challenge to a provision of the sound ordinance raised a genuine issue of material fact and denied summary judgment as to that issue.the court granted summary judgment to the city on all other claims and denied damages.
seiu dismissed all claims on which the district court did not rule.it then appealed on the issues we earlier identified.there is no.
ii.discussion 
this court reviews a grant of summary judgment de novo.sossamon lone star state of,cir.we apply the same standards in reviewing the evidence and applying the law as the district court.id.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.if the movant demonstrates that there are no genuine issues of material fact,the burden shifts to the opponent of the motion to establish that there are.sossamon,at.
on appeal,seiu arguments raise four issues of first amendment jurisprudence regulations narrowly tailored regulation of time,place,and manner of expression prior restraints and vagueness.we begin by reviewing first amendment principles relevant to those issues.
first amendment principles 
the first amendment provides that congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech.const.amend.i.it applies to the states through the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.chiu plano indep.sch,cir citing cases.the state is sharply circumscribed in its right to restrain expression in places which by long tradition or by government fiat have been devoted to assembly and debate.perry educ.ass perry local educators ass n.among such places identified by tradition or fiat are streets and parks.id.generally,a park or a street will be considered a traditional public forum in which government entities are strictly limited in their ability to regulate private speech pleasant grove city,utah summum,citing cornelius naacp legal defense ed.fund.
the foundation on which we build our understanding is that a municipality may regulate expressive conduct in a public forum to protect public health,safety,or welfare.beckerman city of tupelo,cir.unit a.if a regulation is to be allowed,the state must show that its regulation is necessary to serve a compelling state interest and that it is narrowly drawn to achieve that end.perry,at citing carey brown.that standard is one of strict scrutiny.chiu,at.a regulation of speech will not satisfy strict scrutiny if there is a less restrictive means that would be at least as effective in achieving the legitimate purpose that is being served.reno aclu.
a regulation has been defined as one that creates distinctions between favored speech and disfavored speech.horton city of houston,cir.such regulation also can be identified when it creates a substantial risk of eliminating certain ideas or viewpoints from the public forum.id.a regulatory scheme that requires the government to examine the content of the message that is conveyed is regardless of its motivating purpose.writers project,ragland,quoting fcc league of women voters of.
on the other hand,regulations of time,place,and manner of expression in a public forum are permitted when they are narrowly tailored to serve a significant government interest,and leave open ample alternative channels of communication.perry,at.using this test to judge the constitutionality of a regulation is an application of intermediate scrutiny.horton,at.in the context of intermediate scrutiny,narrow tailoring does not require that the least restrictive means be used.ward rock against racism.as long as the restriction promotes a substantial governmental interest that would be achieved less effectively without the restriction,it is sufficiently narrowly tailored.id.at.
regulations that require speakers to obtain permits before disfavored and must be confined by narrow,objective,and definite standards.shuttlesworth city of birmingham.the relevant question is whether the challenged regulation authorizes suppression of speech in advance of its expression.ward,at emphasis in original.there is a heavy presumption of invalidity for prior restraints that grant the licensing authority broad discretion.forsyth county,nationalist movement.
finally,regulations can be vague.because the first amendment needs breathing space,government regulation must be drawn with some specificity.howard gault.rural legal aid,cir.regulation of speech must be through laws whose prohibitions are clear.flexibility in a statute is permissible,but the statute must provide fair notice so that its prohibitions may be avoided by those who wish to do so.grayned city of rockford.vagueness challenges usually must show that the law has a capacity to chill constitutionally protected conduct,especially conduct protected by the first amendment.roark hardee lp city of austin,cir quoting united states gaudreau,cir.
vagueness can be ameliorated by a state court authoritative interpretations,if they provide sufficient clarity.see broadrick oklahoma.we also have searched in some situations for binding limits placed on an ordinance by a municipality governing body.beckerman,at.there is,though,no authority lying in a federal court to conduct a narrowing of a vague state regulation.id.we take the state and local regulations as we have been given them.
it is against this constitutional backdrop that we consider seiu challenge to the three houston ordinances.
constitutionality of the three houston ordinances 
we will first discuss the relevant sections of the sound ordinance,then those of the parade ordinance,and finally,those of the parks and recreation ordinance.there will be some references to prior discussions as we proceed.
sound ordinance 
seiu has two kinds of complaints about the sound ordinance.the broad challenge is that exceptions to the permitting requirements cause the ordinance not to be a narrowly tailored regulation of time,place,and manner of expression.the narrower challenge concerns a limit on the number of sound amplification permits granted per month.
we start with claims that some exceptions are.the houston sound ordinance,section,lists sixteen sounds that do not require permits,classifying them as defenses to charges of violations of the ordinance.these sixteen defenses include sounds generated by church bells,activities,construction,and events at public parks.
seiu does not argue that these defenses interfered with its planned activities.that is important because a lawsuit is not a general license for a federal court to examine all provisions of a municipal ordinance and decide if any are flawed.first amendment challenges do not eliminate the need for a party to demonstrate it has constitutional standing.seiu must show that it has suffered,or imminently will suffer,a concrete and particularized the injury is fairly traceable to the defendant conduct and a favorable judgment is likely to redress the injury.houston chronicle publ g city of league city,cir citing lujan defenders of wildlife.
these elements of injury,causation,and redressability are an irreducible constitutional minimum,lujan,at,no more subject to being waived in first amendment cases than in any other.reflective of this,the supreme court carefully examined claims against municipal ordinances to determine,provision by provision,if there were a claimant with standing to challenge it,city of dallas.
beyond this minimum,certain requirements for standing exist,ones arising from judicial prudence and not from the constitution.ward santa fe indep.sch,cir.the one potentially relevant here is usually called third party standing,or more descriptively,that litigants must assert their own legal rights and not those of others.id.citing warth seldin.
the prudential consideration of standing is not applied when a plaintiff demonstrates that a provision that validly restricts its own speech is overbroad.sec y of state of joseph munson,erwin chemerinsky,const.law principles and polices,at ed.an overbroad statute validly regulates some expressive conduct but also reaches substantial protected speech.city of houston,hill.if there is a case or controversy,a litigant whose own activities are unprotected may nevertheless challenge a statute by showing that it substantially abridges the first amendment rights of other parties not before the court.vill.of schaumburg citizens for a better env t.the refusal to apply the usual bar to asserting the rights of is because protected speech may be inhibited by the overly broad reach of the statute.id.
we agree with the clarity brought to the issue by one of our sister circuits that the plaintiff must establish injury under a particular provision of a regulation that is validly applied to its conduct,then assert a facial challenge,under the overbreadth doctrine,to vindicate the rights of others not before the court under that provision.camp legal def.fund,city of atlanta,cir emphasis added.thus,if seiu is limited by one provision of an ordinance and makes a facial challenge due to the overbreadth of a different provision,there is no constitutional standing,there is no case or controversy,as to the separate provision.
we now apply these principles.as to the sound ordinance,seiu claims that provisions regarding historical,construction noises,noises from parks and school grounds,and church bells,are.no overbreadth challenge is made on appeal,which means seiu has no standing to seek to vindicate the rights and interests of others as to them.
it is argued,though,that these defenses so undermine the reasonableness of the entire ordinance as to prevent it from being a narrowly tailored regulation of time,place,and manner of expression.we examine the questioned defenses to determine how fundamentally whatever defects they may have would affect the reasonableness of the entire sound ordinance 
we note that the district court held the sound ordinance to be.restrictions are those that are justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech.boos barry,quoting.state bd.of pharmacy.citizens consumer council.houston justifies its sound ordinance generally by noting that noise regulation is a legitimate state interest,and the city prohibitions on certain sounds serve that interest.
among the questioned exceptions is for activities conducted on public parks,public playgrounds,and public or private school grounds the city has not excepted noise that arises only from specific kinds of activity at those sites or excepted educational groups to make noise anywhere in the city on the basis of their status.houston,code of ordinances ch,k.
construction noises are excepted from permit requirements,but,presumably,building permits have been issued.see id.e.other exceptions are for events occurring in facilities permanently erected for purposes of public events.see id.d.another exception is explained by the fact that the city likely lacks authority to regulate noise made by railroad operations or aircraft in flight.id.f.
most of the sounds that appear as defenses are the unavoidable consequences of daily life in a modern urban environment or emanate from other permitted or protectable speech events.the city does not have to regulate what is basically unregulatable,the municipal equivalent of a household trying to say it is unacceptable for a baby to cry.the argument that houston must require permits for noises such as those generated at a playground,a sports stadium,and a construction site in order to make its sound ordinance proper is premised on a world.allowing them does not bar houston from requiring permits for other sounds.within that context,most of the excepted sounds are a traditional and generally unobtrusive aspect of the urban environment.stokes city of madison,cir.
if any of the exceptions identified by seiu raises a question of being,it is only the following two.one allows,without a permit,the ringing of church bells or church chimes when used as part of a religious observance or service during daytime hours,for a maximum of five minutes per hour.houston,code ch,j.the other provision is for noise produced by patrons and participants using cannons and gunfire during historical battle for which a pyrotechnic permit was obtained and the explosives were inspected by the fire marshal.id.d.because the ordinance excepts only cannon and gunfire sounds that are part of a historical battle,the the explosive conduct is said to be relevant.
we know that protecting the public from excessive noise is a significant government interest.ward,at.the question is whether the sound ordinance is narrowly tailored in satisfying that interest.there has not been narrow tailoring if the ordinance sweeps far more broadly than is necessary to further the city legitimate concern of noise control.knowles city of waco,cir quoting ward,at.
what constitutes a reasonable,narrowly tailored regulation depends on a variety of factors,including the character of the place in which the regulation is enforced.noise restrictions applicable to busy downtown centers will be viewed differently than those applicable to quiet residential neighborhoods.grayned,at.greater or lesser efforts to minimize noise and traffic depending on the time of day and location in order to protect the,tranquility,and privacy of the home have been held to be significant government interests.ward,at citation omitted.
in one of our precedents,we held that exceptions could invalidate ordinances by undermining the ostensible purpose of the measure,making them unconstitutional time,place,and manner regulations.knowles,at.we considered a parade ordinance adopted by the city of waco that exempted,with only minor variation,groups of students engaged in educational or recreational activities,and all government agencies acting within the scope of their official functions.id.at.traffic control was the significant government interest said to motivate the ordinance,but we concluded that the breadth of the exceptions belied the argument that the ordinances were narrowly tailored for purposes of traffic flow and safety.see also beckerman,at striking down similar regulation as unconstitutional.the city of waco could offer no rational explanation of how the traffic disruption caused by one hundred students marching down the street was any different than the disruption caused by one hundred protestors doing the same.knowles,at.see also beckerman,at same.
in knowles,the court struck down the entire parade ordinance.knowles,at.that remedy was necessary because the ordinance potentially criminalizes such a broad range of expressive and legitimate conduct that it is hardly tailored at all,and certainly not narrowly tailored.id.at.
in beckerman,we found some provisions in a tupelo,mississippi parade ordinance to be a prior restraint,while others were overbroad or vague.beckerman,at.the plaintiffs had not sought a permit,and the court stated that their challenges were anticipatory.id.at.standing had not been challenged.we briefly reviewed precedents that allowed facial challenges to ordinances that provided overly broad discretion to officials.id.only some of the provisions were stricken,as opposed to the entire ordinance.id.at.that was appropriate because,once substantial overbreadth is shown,only the offending portions should be stricken if that is practicable.brockett spokane arcades.
we conclude that houston sound ordinance does not suffer from the kind of fundamental flaws identified in these precedents.it makes reasonable distinctions among categories in the level of disruption caused by noise that requires a permit and noises that come from exempted sources.out of sixteen defenses,only two raise some analytical questions.though churches are numerous,historical cannon fire presumably is not.these exceptions limit the reach of the ordinance,a fact that does not equate to insufficiently narrow tailoring.if there are defects in the church bell and historical reenactment exceptions,and we do not so conclude,they do not result in a fatal absence of narrow tailoring.if pruning of those two defenses is required by the first amendment,it can not be done in this suit.
seiu has a personal stake in the remaining part of its challenge to the sound ordinance.it argues that a limitation of two permits per location per period is invalid.narrow tailoring is again the concern.seiu argues that the ordinance failure to distinguish between the needs of different parts of the city in imposing the twice per restriction is strong evidence that the ordinance is not narrowly tailored.the crucial question is whether the manner of expression is basically incompatible with the normal activity of a particular place at a particular time.reeves mcconn,cir quoting grayned,at.
in reeves,we struck down a houston ordinance banning all amplification in the downtown business district except between the hours of and on sundays.id.at.the city had argued that this limitation was justified to pre
