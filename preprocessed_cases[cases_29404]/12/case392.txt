when metro east center for conditioning and health chose a new vendor for local phone service,it neglected to name an interstate carrier,so one was assigned at communications,which played that role for six months february through july before metro east specified a different carrier.qwest tariff on file with the federal communications commission had two pertinent provisions first,it set the monthly minimum fee per line the presubscription charge that each customer must pay second,it provided that any dispute would be resolved by arbitration.we use the past tense because the tariff was canceled on july,as part of the fcc detariffing program.today qwest uses a published statement of rates and rules,which presumably may be varied by contracts.but the tariff was in force when the parties dispute arose and thus governs its resolution.metro east contends that it uses centrex service so that the monthly fee was cents per line qwest believes that metro east is not a centrex user and that the tariff therefore specified a monthly charge of.the total in contention is about,and the simplified procedures of arbitration are especially attractive for disputes.but metro east believes that the controversy is so small that neither arbitration nor ordinary litigation makes sense.it filed this suit seeking to represent a class of all customers who qualify for but did not receive the cents monthly rate under the tariff.qwest replied with a motion to dismiss the suit and compel arbitration.
qwest interstate tariff says,among other things 
any claim,controversy or dispute,whether sounding in contract,statute,tort,fraud,misrepresentation,or other legal theory,related directly or indirectly to the services,whenever brought and whether between the company and the customer or between the company or the customer and the employees,agents or affiliated businesses of the other party,shall be resolved by arbitration as prescribed in this section.the federal arbitration act,not state law,shall govern the arbitrability of all claims.
under of the federal arbitration act,only the parties agreement supports arbitration.yet a tariff is a set of terms created and filed unilaterally by a carrier.customers do not agree to these terms,though they are binding unless the federal agency with which they have been filed disapproves them.see,central office telephone,d cahnmann sprint,cir.no private agreement can displace a tariff terms.see maislin industries,primary steel,d.because the federal arbitration act makes an agreement essential,the district court concluded,qwest customers need not arbitrate any dispute with it.d.the order denying qwest motion to compel arbitration is immediately appealable under a b.
the district court approach has a gotcha quality the clause requiring arbitration refers to the federal arbitration act and as a consequence precludes arbitration.yet it is almost never right to read legal language as.the district judge understood the clause as saying every dispute must be arbitrated,provided,however,that no dispute is arbitrable.why would someone put such a clause in a tariff,a contract,or any other document people draft documents to achieve some objective,and although the meaning of words can be elusive even after taking into account both linguistic and economic contexts,see beanstalk group,am general,cir,and some words may turn out to be redundant or otherwise carry no weight,it is not sensible to construe a substantial passage of a legal text as pointless.when one sentence seems to cancel out the rest of a,it is essential to ask whether that sentence must devastate its surrounding language.is there no alternative reading of either the contract or the arbitration act that will enable the whole clause to survive 
it is hard to think of one an agreement for purposes of means no more than an offer and acceptance that produces a legally binding document.tariffs,like contracts,have that quality.the tariff is an offer that the customer accepts by using the product.the terms have legal effect indeed,by virtue of federal law a tariff is more conclusive than a contract and is said to have the status of a regulation,see cahnmann,at,though a tariff also may be enforced through suit just as a contract may be enforced.no surprise that we have referred to tariffs as a species of contract.see,arsberry illinois,cir.accord,atlantic gulf stevedores,alter,cir penn central general mills,cir.tariffs differ from private contracts only to the extent that they are not subject to alteration one customer or one clause at a time or to nullification by a court on grounds such as unconscionability.instead a tariff must be enforced as written unless the regulatory agency intervenes.metro east supposes that to form an agreement with qwest it must engage in individual negotiation,clause by clause.a tariff is a proposition and thus not an agreement by these lights.yet we have held that form contracts,offered on a basis,are agreements for purposes of the arbitration act.see,koveleskie sbc capital markets,cir hill gateway,cir.carnival cruise lines,shute,d enforcing a clause included among three pages of terms attached to a cruise ship ticket.tariffs are no different on this dimension.
arbitration often comes with the territory,so to example,with a job or with membership in the national association of securities dealers.see,circuit city stores,adams,d mastrobuono shearson lehman hutton,d liss levin,cir.although these requirements may be can not join the nasd without accepting its arbitration regimen,and often an investor can not trade securities through nasd members without committing to remain agreements because the person could have chosen to do something else.a securities dealer may elect a different occupation by making a living at securities trading he agrees to live by the rules applicable to securities dealers.likewise a business such as metro east that wants to make interstate phone calls can shop among tens of rivals for the best combination of price and terms.if customers value the ability to litigate by more than the incremental cost of litigation compared with arbitration,then one or more of the carriers will offer that option.even if none does,the price the carriers charge in competition will reflect the terms of the transaction.
so this tariff does not suffer from a wound.metro east has agreed to arbitrate within the meaning of.nonetheless,metro east insists,it should be entitled to litigate because arbitration is too expensive for an dispute the filing fee alone is greater,because arbitrators need not entertain class actions,and so on.this is the sort of litany that the federal arbitration act is supposed to silence arbitration has disadvantages compared with litigation but has benefits too,and private parties are entitled to choose in order to maximize their own satisfaction.an arbitral forum can serve as a sort of tribunal in a way that a federal district court can not.if arbitration offers benefits to qwest and detriments to customers such as metro east,these benefits are reflected in a lower cost of doing business that in competition are passed along to customers.there is lots of competition in interstate telecommunications service.customers therefore are compensated through lower rates for any net loss they may experience in arbitration.they ca accept the lower rates recall that metro east contends that it is entitled to an especially favorable fee of cents per line per month while avoiding the means that made lower rates possible.
what is more,arbitration may offer net benefits to all concerned.the filing fee for arbitration exceeds the stakes of this so does the filing fee for litigation in a federal district court,and the discovery procedures of litigation may be more expensive for both sides than are the procedures used in arbitration.qwest tariff calls for arbitration under the auspices of the american arbitration association,using its expedited procedures without discovery.this curtails the cost of the proceedings and allows swift resolution of small disputes on written submissions.a firm such as metro east can provide documents from itself or its local carrier suppor
