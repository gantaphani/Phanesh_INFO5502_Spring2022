the district court for the district of columbia granted htc corporation and htc america,htc motion for summary judgment of invalidity of claims and of patent,owned by ipcom gmbh,kg ipcom.the district court concluded that those claims were indefinite because they claimed both an apparatus and method steps.we reverse the district court judgment because the district court misconstrued the claims,which cover only an apparatus.
as an alternative basis for invalidating claims and,htc argues that the claims are indefinite because the patent specification fails to disclose corresponding structure for the claims limitation.on this point,we agree with the district court that the specification adequately discloses a processor and transceiver for use in performing the functions recited in these claims.although the district court was wrong to conclude that a processor and transceiver alone provide sufficient structure for the asserted claims,htc waived any other legitimate attack on the adequacy of the disclosures with respect to claims and.we,thus,find that the district court was correct to deny summary judgment on htc alternative indefiniteness claim.
htc sued ipcom in and sought a declaration that it did not infringe a valid and enforceable claim of one of ipcom patents.ipcom filed a counterclaim and alleged infringement of two additional patents,including the patent.
the patent covers a handover in a cellular telephone network.a cellular telephone called a mobile station in the patent maintains a link with a tower called a base station.a handover occurs when a mobile station switches from one base station to another.this happens,for example,when a person using a cellular telephone travels in a car between coverage areas.the invention,in principle,reduces the chance of interrupted service during a handover.
claim recites 
a mobile station for use with a network including a first base station and a second base station that achieves a handover from the first base station to the second base station by 
storing link data for a link in a first base station,
holding in reserve for the link resources of the first base station,and 
when the link is to be handed over to the second base station 
initially maintaining a storage of the link data in the first base station,
initially causing the resources of the first base station to remain held in reserve,and 
at a later timepoint determined by a fixed period of time predefined at a beginning of the handover,deleting the link data from the first base station and freeing up the resources of the first base station,the mobile station comprising 
an arrangement for reactivating the link with the first base station if the handover is unsuccessful.
patent ll filed,emphasis added.
claim is identical to claim,except that the phrase in claim that reads,at a later timepoint determined by a fixed period of time predefined at a beginning of the handover,deleting the link data from the first base station and freeing up the resources of the first base station is modified in claim to read,at a later timepoint determined based on a message from one of the mobile station and the second base station regarding a successful completion of handing over the link,deleting the link data from the first base station and freeing up the resources of the first base station id.emphasis added.the distinction is immaterial to this appeal.
in its opening claim construction brief,htc moved for summary judgment of invalidity on the ground that the limitation arrangement for reactivating,found in the last paragraph of claims and,was indefinite because the patent failed to disclose structure corresponding to the claimed function.the district court rejected that argument because,the court believed,a person of skill in the art would understand that the corresponding structure was a processor and transceiver.htc ipcom gmbh,cv,ecf at.htc,however,also argued for summary judgment on the ground that claims and were indefinite because they claimed both an apparatus and method steps.the district court agreed with that argument and granted summary judgment of invalidity of claims and.id.at.
the district court ruling only partially disposed of the claims in the case.the parties stipulated,and the district court agreed,to enter final judgment on the summary judgment ruling and certify the matter for immediate appeal.see.b.the parties also stipulated that claim,in addition to claims and,was indefinite under the district court reasoning.our opinion and judgment apply to claim as well.
the district court erred when it held the claims indefinite for claiming an apparatus and method steps.first,the district court misconstrued the claims.then,the district court applied to the erroneous construction this court precedent prohibiting hybrid claiming of apparatus and method steps.the prohibition on hybrid claiming is inapplicable to claims and when they are correctly construed.
the district court erred in construing claims and because it failed to adhere to the principles of claim construction set forth in phillips awh,en banc.to facilitate our claim construction analysis,we recite the relevant portion of the claims again,annotate them with numbered paragraphs,and emphasize key terms 
a mobile station for use with a network including a first base station and a second base station that achieves a handover from the first base station to the second base station by 
storing link data for a link in a first base station,
holding in reserve for the link resources of the first base station,and 
when the link is to be handed over to the second base station 
initially maintaining a storage of the link data in the first base station,
initially causing the resources of the first base station to remain held in reserve,and 
at a later timepoint deleting the link data from the first base station and freeing up the resources of the first base station,the mobile station comprising 
an arrangement for reactivating the link with the first base station if the handover is unsuccessful.
patent ll,emphases added.the parties disagree whether the mobile station or the network,both recited in paragraph,implements the six functions enumerated in paragraphs.if the mobile station implements the functions,the claims are indefinite because they recite both an apparatus the mobile station and method steps the functions enumerated in paragraphs.if the network performs the functions,the claims are not indefinite because the claims merely describe the network environment in which the mobile station must be used.the district court concluded,without complying with phillips claim construction principles,that the mobile station implements the functions recited in paragraphs.
the district court did not examine adequately the claims themselves.phillips,at.claims and begin by reciting,in the first paragraph,a mobile station to be used with a network.immediately following network are the phrase including a first base station and a second base station and the clause that achieves a handover from the first base station to the second base station by implementing the six enumerated functions.modifiers should be placed next to the words they modify.william strunk,white,the elements of style ed.a reader,therefore,may assume that the phrase beginning with including and the clause beginning with that achieves modify network.
supporting that assumption,the claims the mobile station in paragraph after the enumerated functions.the mobile station is followed by a functional limitation in paragraph the mobile station comprising an arrangement for reactivating the link with the first base station if the handover is unsuccessful.patent ll,ll emphasis added.the claims would read in a disjointed manner if they were to recite the mobile station in the first paragraph,modify the mobile station with the six enumerated functions,and then,without a transition,recite the mobile station again in paragraph,followed by yet another modifier.had the claim drafter intended that format,the drafter likely would have followed the recitation of the mobile station in paragraph with further comprising instead of comprising to signal that additional modification would be attached to the mobile station.
words of a claim are generally given their ordinary and customary meaning.vitronics conceptronic.the plain language of claims and indicates that the network,not the mobile station,performs the enumerated functions.
in addition to examining the claim language,the district court should have referred to the specification to understand the claims.phillips,at.the specification is in parity with the claim language,confirming that the network,rather than the base station,performs the enumerated functions.as the specification explains,the first base station,not the mobile station,initially stores link data t he data required for the link initially remain stored in bs the first base station,and initially bs does not reassign the resources required to maintain the link with the ms mobile station.patent ll.this is consistent with the claims first five enumerated functions in paragraphs storing link data for a link in a first base station,holding in reserve for the link resources of the first base station,and,when the link is to be handed over to the second base station,initially maintaining a storage of the link data in the first base station and initially causing the resources of the first base station to remain held in reserve.the specification then explains that,after a successful handover,the first base station,not the mobile station,deletes the held resources bs can therefore delete the information and,respectively,the resources that were held in reserve can be assigned elsewhere.id.ll.this is consistent with the claims sixth condition recited in paragraph,in which,at a later timepoint,link data are deleted from the first base station and free up the resources of the first base station.
htc fails to cite any part of the specification indicating that the mobile station implements the six functions.the mobile station,htc argues,is the quarterback of the handover because the specification speaks in terms of the mobile station performing a handover.the specification,however,does not suggest that the mobile station must actually implement the six functions to perform a handover.in one scenario described in the specification,the mobile station sends the first base station a handover notify message indicating that it is trying to perform a handover to another base station.patent ll.the first base station not the mobile station holds resources in reserve and maintains link data while the second base station attempts to establish a link to the mobile station.id.ll.meanwhile,the first and second base stations swap authentication parameters for the mobile station.id.ll.the first base station does not delete the link data it is holding in reserve until it receives confirmation from the second base station not the mobile the handover was successful.id.ll.thus,although the mobile station performs the handover,the base stations are actually implementing the six functions.the specification confirms that the six functions define the network environment they are not functions performed by the mobile station.
a court should also look to the prosecution history when construing a claim.phillips,at.the district court noted that,in an office action response,the applicants of the patent distinguished a prior art reference that the examiner cited by arguing that the cited section of the prior art reference clearly describes a process that is completely different from the claimed process app.emphasis and brackets in original.the district court believed that the applicants use of the word process was an acknowledgement that claims and recite method steps.
the district court placed too much weight on the applicants use of the word process when the claim language and the specification indicated that the applicants did not claim a process.claim language and the specification generally carry greater weight than the prosecution history.b ecause the prosecution history represents an ongoing negotiation between the pto and the applicant,rather than the final product of that negotiation,it often lacks the clarity of the specification and thus is less useful for claim construction purposes.phillips,at.an attorney single reference to a process in the office action response is unpersuasive when weighed against the plain language of the claims and the specification,both of which clearly indicate that the enumerated functions are part of the network environment.
like the district court,htc places too much weight on the prosecution history.in addition to seizing on the applicants use of the word process,htc argues that the applicants acquiesced when the examiner called the six enumerated functions steps.that fact carries little weight.the examiner was also referring,in most instances,to a pending method claim,which the applicants later withdrew.
the cases that htc cites do not change our view.in ventana medical systems,biogenex laboratories,this court held that an examiner restriction requirement and a patentee remarks during prosecution were insufficient to support a finding that the patentee disavowed a particular claim scope.ipcom office action response,likewise,is insufficient to support a finding of disavowal.in fuji photo film international trade commission,this court rejected a patentee argument that the applicant failure to recite a taking lens as a means in a claim was an inadvertent omission.the examiner had suggested that the applicant omitted the taking lens a suggestion that the applicant never contested.id.at.the applicant prosecution conduct in fuji provided a much clearer indication of the applicant understanding of the invention than in this case.
although the district court was correct in considering the prosecution history,the claim language and specification in this case are better sources for the correct construction.
a court may also look to extrinsic evidence,such as dictionaries and expert opinions.phillips,at.the parties do not rely on extrinsic evidence in connection with this issue.the claim language and the specification provide ample support for the conclusion that the six enumerated functions are part of the network environment and are not method steps.
based on its erroneous claim construction,the district court held that claims and are indefinite because they claim an apparatus and method steps.see ipxl holdings.the claims do not contravene ipxl when properly construed.
the claim at issue in ipxl read as follows 
the system of claim including an input means wherein the predicted transaction information comprises both a transaction type and transaction parameters associated with that transaction type,and the user uses the input means to either change the predicted transaction information or accept the displayed transaction type and transaction parameters.
id.quoting patent ll filed june.we held the claim indefinite because the claim failed to make clear whether infringement would occur when one creates a system that allows the user to change the predicted transaction information or accept the displayed transaction,or whether infringement occurs when the user actually uses the input means to change transaction information or uses the input means to accept a displayed transaction.id.the ipxl claim,in other words,was ambiguous because it recited both a system that allowed a user to practice a method step and the user practicing the method step.claims and are different.they do not recite a mobile station and then have the mobile station perform the six enumerated functions.the claims merely establish those functions as the underlying network environment in which the mobile station operates.
claims and are similar to a claim we found definite in microprocessor enhancement texas instruments,mec.the claim structure was as follows 
a method of executing instructions in a pipelined processor comprising structural limitations of the pipelined processor the method further comprising method steps implemented in the pipelined processor.
id.at quoting patent filed.the mec claim made clear that direct infringement was limited to practicing the claimed method in the pipelined processor possessing the required structure.id.claims and,likewise,make clear that infringement occurs when one makes,uses,offers to sell,or sells the claimed apparatus the mobile station which must be used in a particular network environment.both the mec claim and the claims in this case feature what the mec court called a format.id.although the mec court acknowledged that such a format is unconventional,the court found the claim sufficiently clear to apprise a person of when infringement occurs.id.the unconventional format of claims and,likewise,does not preclude the claims from being definite.
finally,ipcom moves that we take judicial notice of several patents that it claims would be jeopardized if we were to hold claims and indefinite.appellee br.we deny the motion as moot because the claims are definite.
htc argues,as an alternative basis for invalidity,that claims and fail to disclose corresponding structure sufficient to satisfy the principles governing claims.although the district court was wrong when it found that a processor and transceiver alone supplied sufficient structure,htc failed to preserve the argument that the specification fails to disclose an algorithm sufficient to transform the processor and transceiver into a computer designed to implement the claimed functions.htc argued only that the specification reference to cellular telephones was insufficient to convey use of a processor and transceiver with sufficiently complex hardware to perform the handover function described in claims and.
the mobile station recited in paragraphs of claims and is a mobile station comprising an arrangement for reactivating the link with the first base station if the handover is unsuccessful.the parties agree that the term arrangement for reactivating is a limitation.
a patentee may express an element in a claim for a combination as a means or step for performing a specified function without the recital of structure,material,or acts in support thereof.when a patentee invokes such claiming,the claim shall be construed to cover the corresponding structure,material,or acts described in the specification and equivalents thereof.id.
to determine whether a limitation is definite,a court applies a analysis.first,a court identifies the particular claimed function.med.instrumentation diagnostics elekta ab,citation omitted.the parties agree aside from immaterial differences in their respective articulations that the function of the term arrangement for reactivating is to reactivate the link with the first base station if the handover is unsuccessful.the district court conducted its analysis based on that articulation the parties do not ask us to disturb it.
after identifying the particular claimed function,a court,in the second step of the analysis,looks to the specification and identifies the corresponding structure,material,or acts that perform that function.id.citation omitted.the district court concluded that the structure corresponding to the arrangement for reactivating limitation was a processor connected to a transceiver and programmed to formulate and send messages to reactivate the link,if the handover is unsuccessful.although the specification does not literally disclose a processor and transceiver,the district court stated that it had no doubt that one skilled in the art would immediately deduce that a processor with a transceiver was the structure indicated by the term.
on this point,we agree with the district court.whether a specification adequately sets forth structure corresponding to a claimed function is viewed from the perspective of one skilled in the art.budde harley davidson.although the specification here does not literally disclose a processor and transceiver,a person skilled in the art would understand that the mobile device would have to contain a processor and transceiver.one of htc own experts,christopher rose,acknowledged that,at the time of invention,a mobile station would have to be able to talk to the network,which means you got to have a transceiver and some sort of processor.something has to handle the data.the district court relied on rose testimony.
htc argues that the district court and ipcom placed too much stock in rose testimony.rose,htc argues,merely observed during his deposition that processors and transceivers were among the components found in mobile phones at the time of invention.rose,moreover,specifically opined in a declaration that the patent did not disclose or suggest to one skilled in the art any specific structural configuration for a processor and transceiver to perform the recited functions.
the district court did not clearly err in relying on rose deposition testimony.although indefiniteness is a question of law,we review a trial court factual findings in support of its legal conclusion for clear error.tech.licensing videotek,citations omitted.htc offers no basis,nor can we discern one,for unsettling the district court finding and placing more weight on rose declaration than his deposition testimony.indeed,even if rose deposition testimony stands for nothing more than that processors and transceivers were among the components found in mobile phones at the time of invention,his testimony is probative of the perspective of those skilled in the art.
another expert,vijay madisetti,further supported the district court conclusion.madisetti referred to one scenario,described in the specification,in which it is determined that a handover is required because the quality of the link between the mobile station and first base station has fallen below a certain value.that scenario,madisetti opined,tells one of ordinary skill in the art that the mobile station is able to receive messages through the use of a transceiver and monitor the link quality,which processors typically do in assessing whether the quality of such signals falls below a certain level.madisetti went on to explain that various other functionalities described in the patent conveyed to one skilled in the art that a processor was needed for accomplishing the claimed functions.the expert testimony supports the district court conclusion.
htc also contends that,even if one skilled in the art would know that use of a processor and transceiver were needed,one would not understand exactly how that processor and transceiver would be configured,what its precise circuitry,components,or schematics would be or what controllers would be employed.htc ipcom gmbh,cv,ecf at htc opening markman br.ecf at markman hr g tr.our case law does not require that level of hardware disclosure,however.as long as a sufficient algorithm describing how a computer will perform the function is disclosed,reference to such processors will suffice to overcome an indefiniteness challenge.see intel via.
contrary to htc view,examination of the specification from the perspective of a skilled artisan does not convert an indefiniteness inquiry into an enablement inquiry.we are not analyzing whether a skilled artisan could have devised a processor and transceiver with all necessary component parts but whether a skilled artisan would have understood the specification as requiring a processor and transceiver.this approach is consistent with our precedent.tech.licensing,at citations omitted.
the district court,in sum,did not err in finding that the specification disclosed a processor and transceiver to one of skill in the art,and that no additional hardware disclosure was needed.
the district court misstated the law,however,when it stated that disclosure of a processor and transceiver alone was sufficient to provide structure to these claims.the processor and transceiver amount to nothing more than a computer.we have consistently required that the structure disclosed in the specification be more than simply a general purpose computer or microprocessor.aristocrat techs.austl.pty int l game.computers or processors can be programmed to perform very different tasks in very different ways.id.accordingly,simply disclosing a computer as the structure designated to perform a particular function does not limit the scope of the claim to the corresponding structure,material,or acts that perform the function,as required by sectio
