plaintiffs directv,and echostar satellite,llc,providers of satellite television programming,brought this suit claiming that north carolina system of taxing television programming violates the dormant commerce clause of article i of the united states constitution.the district court granted defendant norris tolson motion to dismiss,concluding that plaintiffs suit is barred by the tax injunction act and principles of comity,that plaintiffs lack standing,and that plaintiffs failed to state a claim on which relief can be granted.we hold that plaintiffs suit is barred by principles of comity and therefore affirm.
consumers have two main choices for the purchase of subscription television programming traditional cable providers and direct broadcast satellite dbs providers.both types of service provide substantially the same programming,but each uses a different means to deliver that programming to subscribers.
cable providers deliver their programming through networks of coaxial or fiber optic cables laid in trenches,alongside roads,or hung on utility poles.these networks are physically connected to subscribers homes.thus,cable providers rely on the use of public for the delivery of their programming.historically,cable providers in north carolina have been required to obtain franchises from city and county governments entitling them to operate within designated franchise areas.in exchange for these franchises,local governments,with the authorization of the north carolina general assembly,have typically levied franchise taxes on cable providers.
by contrast,dbs providers transmit their programming from satellites orbiting the earth from space directly to satellite dishes mounted on or near subscribers homes.accordingly,dbs providers do not rely on public for the delivery of their programming,and federal law prohibits local governments from charging franchise taxes or fees to dbs providers.telecommunications act of,title vi,a,stat.reprinted at,historical and statutory notes.
north carolina has amended its taxation of television programming several times in recent years.prior to,neither satellite nor cable tv providers were subject to sales tax on their gross receipts.at the same time,cities and counties had statutory authority to grant franchises to cable operators,see.and west,and to levy a franchise tax typically of cable operators gross receipts in the franchise exchange for those franchise rights.see.and west.
beginning in,north carolina imposed a sales tax on the gross receipts of dbs providers.see.a west.cable operators continued to pay franchise taxes to localities as they had done before.the net effect of the tax,therefore,was that both cable and dbs providers paid of their gross receipts to the state its political subdivisions.plaintiffs unsuccessfully challenged this scheme on commerce clause grounds in north carolina state court.see directv,state.
beginning in,north carolina imposed a sales tax of on the gross receipts of both cable and dbs providers.see.and a west.cable providers continued to pay franchise taxes to local governments,but were permitted to take a credit against the state sales tax in the amount they paid in local franchise taxes.see.b west.the net effect of this scheme was that both satellite and cable providers paid of their gross receipts to the state its political subdivisions.
in,further amendments to north carolina taxation of television providers created the tax scheme at issue in this lawsuit.see an act to promote consumer choice in video service providers and to establish uniform taxes for video programming services,sess.laws the amendments.the amendments revoked the authority of local governments to charge franchise taxes to cable providers and vested franchising authority with the north carolina secretary of state.see id.at the same time,the amendments eliminated the tax credit available to cable providers,subjecting them to the full state sales tax on gross receipts.see id.the amendments also provide that a portion of the proceeds of the state sales tax on cable and dbs providers be distributed to local governments.for those local governments that previously imposed franchise taxes on cable providers,the amount of this distribution is based on the revenue formerly generated by those taxes.see id,adding.i.counties or cities that did not charge franchise taxes also receive a portion of the state tax revenue under the amendments,in amounts based on their populations.see id.accordingly,just as they did in,both cable and dbs providers now pay taxes equal to of their gross receipts.those taxes,however,are paid only to the state,which in turn distributes a portion of the proceeds to local governments according to state law.
we turn briefly to a discussion of the constitutional principles underlying plaintiffs claims.the commerce clause provides that congress shall have the power t o regulate commerce among the several states.const.art.i,cl.this grant of affirmative congressional authority carries with it an implied or dormant restriction of the power of states to regulate interstate commerce,prohibiting them from enacting laws that impose substantial burdens on commerce between the states.dennis higgins,d internal quotation and citation omitted.the clearest example of a state law that violates the dormant commerce clause is one that facially discriminates against interstate commerce,such as a protective tariff or customs duty.west lynn creamery,healy,d see also distillers new york state liquor,d.even a facially neutral state law,however,violates the dormant commerce clause when its effect is to favor economic interests over interests,at.likewise,a state runs afoul of the dormant commerce clause even when it joins an otherwise constitutional tax with an otherwise constitutional subsidy in a way that benefits economic interests and burdens interests.thus,in west lynn,the supreme court struck down a massachusetts milk pricing order that combined a tax on milk sales with an otherwise permissible subsidy of massachusetts dairy farmers because,taken together,the two provisions had a discriminatory effect.at.the court emphasized that state economic regulation must be considered as a whole,and found particularly troubling the fact that the proceeds from the tax were used to create a subsidy to one of the groups hurt by the tax,the dairy farmers.id.at.
plaintiffs are the two main providers of dbs service in north carolina and nationally and are two of only three companies that own and operate dbs satellites.they brought this suit in under,alleging that north carolina tax credit for cable providers violated the dormant commerce clause because the credit was granted to companies based on their distribution of television programming.after the amendments became effective,plaintiffs amended their complaint to challenge north carolina present tax scheme.plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that sections through of the amendments violate the dormant commerce clause,a permanent injunction barring the state from enforcing section of the amendments,and attorneys fees and costs.
plaintiffs argue that north carolina present taxation scheme is no different from that struck down by the supreme court in west lynn,because it combines an evenhanded tax on sales of subscription television programming with a subsidy available only to cable providers and funded from the proceeds of the tax.although no distributions of sales tax proceeds are made directly to cable providers,and although not all localities that do receive these distributions previously charged franchise taxes,plaintiffs argue that an unconstitutional subsidy exists because c able providers no longer have to pay franchise fees,but continue to receive the valuable right of access to publicly owned they formerly obtained through the payment of such fees.there is no constitutional difference,plaintiffs claim,between payments directly to cable providers and the distributions made to north carolina political subdivisions under the amendments.plaintiffs argue that the alleged subsidy imposes a significant cost disadvantage on dbs providers,who are forced to fund the subsidy.plaintiffs further claim that because dbs providers use distribution facilities and cable operators necessarily use distribution facilities,the subsidy discriminates against dbs providers in violation of the dormant commerce clause.
the district court dismissed plaintiffs amended complaint on several grounds.first,the district court held that plaintiffs suit is barred by the tax injunction act,tia or the act and related principles of comity.second,the district court held that even if the suit were not barred,plaintiffs lack standing to challenge north carolina taxation scheme because they lack an injury in fact and because the injury they claim can not be redressed by the relief they seek.third,the district court held that even if plaintiffs did have standing,their amended complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.in so holding,the district court concluded that the amendments provide no subsidy to cable operators and therefore do not discriminate against interstate commerce.plaintiffs now appeal.we review de novo the district court dismissal of plaintiffs amended complaint.palmer city nat.bank of virginia,cir.
the supreme court long ago recognized the important and sensitive nature of state tax systems and the need for restraint when deciding cases that affect such systems.fair assessment in real estate ass n,mcnary,d.as the court has explained 
it is upon taxation that the several states chiefly rely to obtain the means to carry on their respective governments,and it is of the utmost importance to all of them that the modes adopted to enforce the taxes levied should be interfered with as little as possible.any delay in the proceedings of the officers,upon whom the duty is devolved of collecting the taxes,may derange the operations of government,and thereby cause serious detriment to the public.
dows city of chicago,wall.accordingly,the court has articulated a principle of comity that reflects the scrupulous regard for the rightful independence of state governments which should at all times actuate the federal courts,requiring federal courts,when the comity principle applies,to deny relief in challenges to state tax laws in every case where the asserted federal right may be preserved without it.fair assessment,at.internal quotation and citation omitted.
this comity principle found legislative voice in the enactment of the tax injunction act,which provides that t he district courts shall not enjoin,suspend or restrain the assessment,levy or collection of any tax under state law where a plain,speedy and efficient remedy may be had in the courts of such state.but while the tia reflects the antecedent comity principle,the principle itself is broader than the act and was not restricted by its passage.fair assessment,at.indeed,the supreme court has continued to apply it in tax cases,see,id.at.great lakes dredge dock huffman,as well as in other contexts.see,younger harris,d holding that comity principles prohibit federal courts from enjoining pending state criminal prosecutions except in extraordinary circumstances.
in fair assessment,the supreme court addressed the applicability of the comity principle to suits bringing constitutional challenges to state tax laws under.the court acknowledged that and its jurisdictional counterpart,authorize immediate resort to a federal court whenever state actions allegedly infringe constitutional rights.at.citing monroe pape,d.nevertheless,the court explained that actions challenging state tax laws are inherently intrusive,threatening to disrupt state tax collection and to chill even actions of state officials.id.at.therefore,the court held that taxpayers are barred by the principle of comity from asserting actions against the validity of state tax systems in federal courts so long as plain,adequate,and complete remedies are available in the state courts.id.at.it is clear that this holding applies to claims for both legal and equitable relief under.see great lakes.lawyer hilton head pub.serv.dist,cir.
in applying these principles to this case,we begin our analysis with the relief sought by plaintiffs.in their prayer for relief,plaintiffs ask the district court to declare that sections through of the amendments violate the commerce clause of article i and article vi of the united states constitution.as explained above,these sections repealed the system of local franchise taxation previously in place in north carolina,repealed the tax credit formerly available to cable providers,and provide for the distribution of part of the proceeds of the state sales tax to local governments in lieu of the franchise taxes those governments collected previously.accordingly,the relief requested in plaintiffs amended complaint would have the effect of restoring the system of local franchise taxation coupled with tax credits to cable providers that existed prior to the enactment of the amendments.
on appeal,plaintiffs contend that they never meant to ask for a declaration that section of the provision restoring the tax credit to cable providers that plaintiffs claimed was unconstitutional in their original unconstitutional.they characterize the inclusion of section in their prayer for relief as inadvertent and urge us to construe the ir complaint liberally to effectively eliminate this request.notably,although plaintiffs intimate that the district court erred in not affording them an opportunity to amend,the record reflects that plaintiffs themselves made no motion to do so in the district court.
we need not resolve the matter,however,because we conclude that even if we ignore plaintiffs request to restore the tax credit to cable providers,principles of comity nevertheless preclude the federal courts from entertaining plaintiffs suit.plaintiffs admit that they seek an order declaring that the provisions in the amendments repealing local government authority to charge franchise fees be declared unconstitutional.brief of appellants at.as plaintiffs explain,such an order would restore the power of local governments to determine,in their own discretion,whether or not to charge such fees for the benefits they confer on cable systems.id.at.in essence,plaintiffs ask us to mandate the reinstatement of local franchise taxing authority,a prerogative that north carolina general assembly has seen fit to reserve to itself.it is just this sort of federal court interference in state taxation that the principle of comity is intended to avoid.
plaintiffs,however,contend that tax comity considerations do not apply to their requested relief because franchise taxes are really not taxes at all,but instead are rent or fees paid to local governments for the use of public.thus,we turn our analysis to the nature of the franchise charges at issue here.
because the principle of comity reflects the recognition that states should be free from federal interference in the administration of their fiscal operations,we interpret the term tax broadly for purposes of our jurisdictional inquiry.see valero terrestrial caffrey,cir.we have previously considered the factors a court should consider in determining whether a charge constitutes a tax or a fee 
the classic tax is imposed by the legislature upon a large segment of society,and is spent to benefit the community at large.the classic fee is imposed by an administrative agency upon only those persons,or entities,subject to its regulation for regulatory purposes,or to raise money placed in a special fund to defray the agency expenses.
id.internal citations omitted.accordingly,we consider three factors what entity imposes the charge what population is subject to the charge and what purposes are served by the use of the monies obtained by the charge id.when this inquiry places the charge somewhere between the classic tax and the classic fee,it is the purpose behind the statute that imposes the charge,as reflected in the ultimate use of its proceeds,that is the most important factor.id.
we conclude least for purposes of our comity charges levied on cable providers by north carolina political subdivisions prior to the amendments were taxes.these charges were imposed not by an administrative or regu
