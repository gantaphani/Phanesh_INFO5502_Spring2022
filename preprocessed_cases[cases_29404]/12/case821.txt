the petitioner,small business in telecommunications sbt,seeks to challenge rulemaking orders of the federal communications commission fcc or commission that,inter alia,devised service and competitive bidding rules as well as technical and operational rules for mhz specialized mobile radio smr service for the reasons set forth below,we dismiss the petition for review with respect to the upper channel first reconsideration order and deny the petition with respect to the lower channel report and order and the lower channel reconsideration order.
background 
in the fcc created the smr service.smr licensees use in the mhz and mhz ranges to provide land mobile communications services on a commercial basis.in order to accommodate new uses of the bandwidth,including cellular telephone and data transmission services,and to respond to changes in statutory law,see fresno mobile radio,fcc,in the commission adopted a regime for the upper channels of the smr bandwidth which planned to auction licenses for each of economic areas ea.each ea license includes a large block of for an entire geographic area,thereby making and licensing unnecessary.to help ea licensees obtain the contiguous spectrum needed to provide competitive services,the commission determined that any ea licensee can require any incumbent smr licensee to relocate to the lower channels of the smr spectrum,provided the ea licensee gives the displaced licensee comparable facilities and spectrum,pays its relocation expenses and ensures a seamless transition between the old and new frequencies.see in the matter of amendment of part of the commission rules to facilitate future development of smr systems in the mhz frequency band,first report and order,wl.although the commission adhered to the new regulatory scheme for the upper channels of smr bandwidth,it ultimately changed its procedure to give small businesses an advantage in the auction process by allowing bidding credits for which only small businesses could qualify it maintained its definitions of small business but adjusted for the deletion of the installment payment plan.see upper channel first reconsideration order.
in june the commission adopted a similar set of rules for the lower channels.again,the fcc decided to auction the new ea licenses,each of which was intended to cover a wide geographic area and a large block of spectrum.as before,the commission decided to aid small businesses with bidding credits but deferred deciding whether to eliminate installment payments.it again used the definitions of small business based on average gross revenue.the fcc also required an ea licensee displacing an incumbent licensee to reimburse the incumbent for relocation expenses.see lower channel report and order.
on september,the petitioner filed two petitions for reconsideration.one requested the fcc to reconsider portions of the lower channel report and order while the other sought reconsideration of the upper channel first reconsideration order.on october,the petitioner filed a consolidated supplement to petitions for reconsideration,contending that the fcc failed to obtain the requisite approval of its small business definitions from the small business administration sba.ja.the last paragraph of the consolidated supplement requested that the commission reconsider its orders in accord with the foregoing,obtain necessary prior approval from the small business administration,provide necessary time prior to the scheduling of its auction in accord with j e sic,and take such other action that is necessary to cause its decisions and orders to be rendered in accord with applicable statutory law.ja.
on october,the fcc issued its lower channel reconsideration order,in which it addressed the issues raised both in sbt petition for reconsideration of the lower channel report and order and in sbt consolidated supplement.the commission rejected the petitioner contention that the failure to obtain sba approval of the small business definitions suspended the operation of the lower channel report and order until the sba approval was secured,explaining that the sba had by then approved the definitions.lower channel reconsideration order.the commission also reiterated that payment of relocation costs by an ea licensee to an incumbent licensee will not be due until the incumbent has been fully relocated and the frequencies are free and clear.id.at.on october,the petitioner filed a petition for review of both the lower channel reconsideration order and the lower channel report and order as well as the upper channel first reconsideration order.see small business in telecommunications fcc.filed.the respondents moved to dismiss on the ground that the petition was premature because the lower channel reconsideration order had not yet been published in the federal register.the petitioner then moved for voluntary dismissal,which the court granted.the lower channel reconsideration order was subsequently published in the federal register on december.fed.reg.
on december,the fcc issued its upper channel second reconsideration order,denying the petitioner petition for reconsideration of the upper channel first reconsideration order.the commission stayed with its decision to eliminate installment payments,rejecting the contention that installment payments were necessary to ensure a meaningful opportunity for small businesses to participate in the mhz smr auction.see in the matter of amendment of part of the commission rules to facilitate future development of smr systems in the mhz frequency band,second memorandum opinion and order on reconsideration,wl upper channel second reconsideration order.the upper channel second reconsideration order was published in the federal register on july.
on december,the petitioner filed a petition for review of the federal communications commission memorandum opinion and order on reconsideration in the matter of amendment of part of the commission rules implementation of sections n and of the communications act and implementation of section j of the communications act adopted on september,lower channel reconsideration order.petition for review,filed.on january,the petitioner filed a certificate as to parties,rulings and related cases,noting the above cited lower channel reconsideration order as well as the lower channel report and order.certificate as to parties,rulings and related cases,filed.on april,the petitioner moved to amend the certificate to include amendment of part of the commission rules to facilitate future development of smr systems in the mhz frequency band,pr docket,memorandum opinion and order on reconsideration,fcc rcd upper channel first reconsideration order,as a ruling under review.motion to amend certificate as to parties,rulings and related cases,filed.the petitioner motion declared that the upper channel first reconsideration order is an underlying order to the lower channel reconsideration order released on october,in the same matter,which order is the primary order on review in the case.id.the motion was granted on april.
discussion 
the petitioner argues that in issuing the lower channel report and order,lower channel reconsideration order and upper channel first reconsideration order,the fcc violated a c iii and d by failing to obtain prior sba approval of its small business definitions,j by failing to allow interested parties sufficient time to participate in the mhz smr auction and a by failing to address the economic impact of relocation on small business incumbent licensees.because we dispose of the petitioner challenges to the upper and lower channel orders in different ways,we address the orders separately.
upper channel first reconsideration order 
the federal rules of appellate procedure govern procedure in the united states courts of appeal,fed,as do the circuit rules of our circuit.see circuit rule.rule a of the federal rules of appellate procedure requires that a petition for review specify the order or part thereof to be reviewed.fed.a c.failure to specify the correct order can result in dismissal of the petition.entravision holdings,llc fcc.a mistaken or inexact specification of the order to be reviewed will not be fatal to the petition,however,if the petitioner intent to seek review of a specific order can be fairly inferred from the petition for review or from other contemporaneous filings,and the respondent is not misled by the mistake.id.at collecting cases.it is undisputed that the petitioner failed to specify the upper channel first reconsideration order in its petition for review filed december,accordingly,we examine not only the petition for review but also other documents contemporaneously filed therewith to determine whether we can fairly infer the petitioner intent to seek review of the upper channel first reconsideration order.our caselaw provides instructions for undertaking this task.
in entravision holdings llc fcc,the petitioner,entravision,specified only the order denying reconsideration and not the underlying order it later sought to challenge in its brief.entravision,at.even though entravision petition noted the underlying order in setting out the history of the proceedings,the court held that it could not determine whether entravision intended to seek review of the underlying order.it then looked at entravision contemporaneous filings.see id.at.entravision docketing statement filed within one month of its petition,also specified only the reconsideration order.additionally,entravision preliminary statement of issues,filed the same day,identified only two issues,both of which relate d exclusively to the commission denial of reconsideration.id.after looking at the contemporaneously filed documents as well as the petition for review,the court concluded that it can not fairly infer that entravision intended to seek review of the underlying order.id.
by contrast,in martin ferc,the court held that the petitioner intent to seek review of the certificate order,instead of the rehearing order specified in its petition,was evident from a contemporaneously filed same day motion to stay.the court found that by attaching to the motion a copy of his application for rehearing,in which the petitioner took issue with the certificate order,the petitioner had sufficiently identified the certificate order as the order from which his challenge to the commission action arose.additionally,the court found that the nature of the motion to stay itself sufficed to indicate that the petitioner purpose in filing his petition for review was to obtain review of the certificate order.the court also looked at the docketing statement which indicated he was challenging the certificate order as well as the rehearing order.id.at.finally,the court found that the commission understood the petitioner to be challenging the certificate order as was apparent from its responsive filings.see see also schoenbohm fcc,fair to infer intent from concise statement of reasons required by c to be filed together with notice of appeal,which failed to specify correct decision.
we came to the opposite conclusion in southwestern bell telephone fcc.there,the petitioner,southwestern bell,requested the court to consider its petition for review of a reconsideration order,which the court held was unreviewable,to include an investigation order,which was reviewable.the court denied the request.it noted that the petition for review named only the reconsideration order and only that order was appended to the petition,see,and that the docketing statement mentioned and attached only the reconsideration order.finally,the court stated that southwestern bell preliminary statement of issues both began and ended by referring to the reconsideration order and included only those issues raised in its petition for reconsideration.the court concluded in short,nothing prior to the brief filed in this court by appellate counsel gave the commission any notice of southwestern bell intent to seek review of the investigation order.nor should that intent have been obvious.id.
in city of benton nrc,per curiam,the petitioner conceded that it had named the wrong order in its petition.nevertheless,it argued that the nuclear regulatory commission was not prejudiced because the agency knew which order it wanted to challenge.the court explained that w hichever order acc intended to ask the court to review,it named the wrong order in its petition.fed.a requires that acc petition be dismissed for failing properly to designate the order to be challenged.id.at emphasis original.the court,citing john copanos sons,fda,noted that a petition for review designating only one order issued in an administrative proceeding was not adequate to obtain review of any other order included in the same administrative record.the court rejected the reasoning of ins,cir refusing to allow a mere technicality in pleading to result in a denial of an opportunity for petitioner to obtain a decision on the merits and concluding that we should treat the petition for review of the immigration judge order as effective,although inept,attempt to seek review of the final order of the board,and dismissed the petition.
these cases illustrate that the court considers not only the contents of the petition for review but also any documents affixed thereto or filed contemporaneously therewith in ascertaining the petitioner intent.here sbt failed to designate in its petition for review the order that it ultimately challenged in its brief.sbt petition for review named only the lower channel reconsideration order it included neither the upper channel first reconsideration order nor the upper channel second reconsideration order.sbt attached only the lower channel reconsideration order to its petition.likewise,sbt certificate as to parties,rulings and related cases,filed january,failed to mention either upper channel order the certificate designated only the lower channel reconsideration order and the underlying lower channel report and order 
sbt also filed a docketing statement on january,listing the docket numbers as pr doc.gn doc.pp doc.in entravision,martin and southwestern bell,the court considered the docketing statement as a contemporaneous filing from which it could infer the petitioner intent.although the two lower channel and two upper channel orders at issue share the same docket number,the manner in which the petitioner described the dates of the orders indicates to us that it sought review of the lower channel orders only.it described the orders as released dates,second order.its use of second order instead of second orders or second order and reconsideration order manifests that it sought review of only one of the july,orders.sbt description of the challenged order as second order also indicates that it sought review of the lower channel report and order,which was entitled second report and order,and not the upper channel first reconsideration order,which was entitled memorandum opinion and order on reconsideration.and,as we have held in the past,the petitioner designation of only one order does not suffice to obtain review of any other order that is part of the same administrative record even if the order specified has the same docket number as another order sought to be reviewed.john copanos sons,at.
on april,almost four months after it filed its petition for review,sbt filed a motion to amend certificate as to parties,rulings and related cases.we do not regard this document to be a filing contemporaneous with the petition for review.the dictionary definition of contemporaneous is existing or occurring during the same time.webster third international dictionary we use the term contemporaneous filing to include documents filed at or near the same time as the petition for review.see,entravision,at martin,at.although these documents can include docketing statements,certificates as to parties,rulings and related cases,and statements of issues as well as documents attached to the petition for review,the petitioner motion to amend filed almost four months after its petition for review is plainly not a contemporaneous filing moreover,we could easily conclude from the motion to amend that it was not sbt intent to seek review of the upper channel first reconsideration order at the time it filed the petition for review,but instead an afterthought occurring several months down the road accordingly,we find nothing in the petition for review or documents filed contemporaneously therewith from which we can fairly infer that the petitioner sought review of the upper channel first reconsideration order in its petition for review 
the petitioner next argues that the lower channel report and order and the upper channel first reconsideration order are part of a single consolidated rulemaking,thereby making the separate identification of the upper channel order surplusage.to support its contention,sbt points to its consolidated supplement to petitions for reconsideration filed october,maintaining that it worked to combine the two petitions for reconsideration,both of which were denied in the lower channel reconsideration order.nevertheless,sbt had filed two separate petitions for reconsideration the first request ed that the commission reconsider its decisions within the lower channel report and order.ja.the second,filed the same day,request ed that the commission reconsider its decisions within its upper channel first reconsideration order.ja.the filing of two separate petitions for reconsideration indicates not only that the lower channel report and order and the upper channel first reconsideration order are separate orders but also that sbt viewed them as such notwithstanding they arose from the same rulemaking proceeding.
contrary to sbt claim,moreover,its consolidated supplement nowhere expressly requested that the commission consolidate the petitions for reconsideration.rather,it argued that the commission failed to obtain sba approval of its small business definitions in the commission orders.ja.the fcc responded separately to the issues raised in the supplement,addressing only the issues regarding the lower channel rulemaking in the lower channel reconsideration order.see lower channel reconsideration order.although the appendix to the lower channel reconsideration order,listing the petitions addressed in the order,noted an sbt petition for reconsideration as well as sbt supplement,by the time the petitioner filed its petition for review on december,the fcc had issued its upper channel second reconsideration order,putting sbt on notice that the fcc had also denied sbt petition for reconsideration of the upper channel first reconsideration order.the petitioner argument that the commission lower channel reconsideration order ignored issues included in its petition for reconsideration of the upper channel first reconsideration order further manifests that sbt believed the fcc treated the petitions separately,responding to one in its lower channel reconsideration order and to the other in its upper channel second reconsideration order.accordingly,we must dismiss sbt petition for review to the extent that it attempts to challenge the upper channel first reconsideration order because it failed to designate that order in accordance with fed.a c.
even if we found no violation of rule a c,we would nevertheless dismiss the challenge to the upper channel first reconsideration order because it is incurably premature.a party that files a petition for reconsideration before an agency render s the underlying agency action nonfinal and hence unreviewable with respect to th at party.united transp.union icc.therefore,a party that stays before an agency to seek reconsideration of an order can not at the same time appear before a court to seek review of that same order,any more than the party could literally be in two places at the same time.bellsouth fcc.
the petitioner filed a separate petition for reconsideration of each of the smr orders.its two petitions had the effect of making both the lower channel report and order and the upper channel first reconsideration order nonfinal as to it,for the purpose of judicial review,until entry of the lower channel reconsideration order and of the upper channel second reconsideration order respectively.see.imposes a jurisdictional bar to judicial consideration of petitions filed prior to entry of the agency orders to which they pertain.western union.fcc.entry of the agency order occurs on the date the commission gives public notice of the order.see b western union,at.the fcc rules identify the date of public notice as the date of publication in the federal register.b.on december,the date the petitioner filed its petition for review,the upper channel second reconsideration order denying the petitioner petition for reconsideration of the upper channel first reconsideration order had not been entered making the petition for review incurably premature as to the upper channel first reconsideration order.bellsouth,at.
sbt responds that the upper channel second reconsideration order was a duplicate order which again denied sbt consolidated petitions and supplement.reply br.we fail to understand how the petitioner could have rightfully determined that although the duplicate order did add to the record,it was not significant for the purpose of the court jurisdiction.id.aside from its bare assertion,the petitioner has no record support for its claim.paragraph six of the lower channel reconsideration order states in response to the lower channel report and order,the commission received a number of pleadings requesting reconsideration,modification or clarification of its rules relating to mandatory relocations,interference,spectrum block size,geographic area licensing,and partitioning and disaggregation.we address these concerns below.at.throughout the discussion portion of the lower channel reconsideration order,the commission primarily referred to the lower channel report and order.although it did mention the upper channel first reconsideration order in a limited context,see,id.at,it addressed only those arguments presented in sbt petition for reconsideration of the lower channel report and order not sbt petition for reconsideration of the upper channel first reconsideration order we thus find no merit in sbt contention that the upper channel second reconsideration order was a duplicate order relieving it of the obligation to separately challenge that order.
lower channel orders 
we turn to sbt challenge to the lower channel report and order and lower channel reconsideration order.sbt makes two claims the fcc failure to obtain sba approval of its small business definitions violated a c iii and d and the commission final regulatory flexibility act frfa analysis in the lower channel first report and order was invalid under a.
a c provides unless specifically authorized by statute,no federal department or agency may prescribe a size standard for categorizing a small business concern,unless such proposed size standard iii is approved by the administrator of the sba.sbt argues that in failing to obtain the sba administrator prior approval of its definition of small business,the fcc violated its statutory duties under title and title.the fcc acknowledges that it did not have sba approval at the time it adopted the lower channel report and order on june.nevertheless the sba had approved the definitions before the fcc commenced the lower channel auction,see ja,approval letter for lower channel auction.the sba tardy approval does not,in our view,nullify the entire rulemaking the sba approved the definitions before the auction and sbt failed to show that any of its members were harmed in any way by the timing of the sba approval 
the petitioner next asserts that the frfa analysis contained in the lower channel first report and order violated a.pursuant to a an agency is required to include in its frfa analysis a description of the steps the agency has taken to minimize the significant economic impact on small entities consistent with the stated objectives of applicable statutes.the petitioner challenges the fcc decision to require ea licensees to pay relocation costs to an incumbent licensee for expenses incurred from relocating from the upper channels to the lower channels only after the relocation is complete and the upper channel frequencies are clear.see lower channel reconsideration order.it maintains that the fcc failed to describe what steps it took to minimize the eco
