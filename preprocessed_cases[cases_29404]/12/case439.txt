in these two consolidated cases the state of missouri sued american blast fax,and,for violating statutory restrictions on unsolicited fax advertising.the district court held that the relevant part of the telephone consumer protection act of tcpa,b c,violated the first amendment guarantee of freedom of speech,and dismissed the action missouri ex rel.nixon am.blast fax,d.intervenor united states and missouri appeal collectively the government.we reverse.
american blast fax and fc provide promotional services by transmitting client advertisements to the fax machines of potential customers.in response to numerous consumer complaints,missouri sought injunctions and civil penalties against the two companies,alleging that they had violated the provision of tcpa making it unlawful to send an unsolicited advertisement to a telephone facsimile machine.b c.an unsolicited advertisement is defined in the statute as any material advertising the commercial availability or quality of any property,goods,or services which is transmitted to any person without that person prior express invitation or permission.id.a.
the fax companies moved to dismiss the complaints,arguing that b c was an unconstitutional restriction on their freedom of speech.the district court decided that the legislative record was insufficient to decide the constitutional questions and ordered an evidentiary hearing,converting the motions to ones for summary judgment.it also granted the motion of the united states to intervene.
at the hearing,the government presented evidence that unsolicited fax advertising shifts costs to the recipients who are forced to contribute ink,paper,wear on their fax machines,as well as personnel time.there was also evidence to show that a fax advertisement interferes with the recipients use of their machines by preempting the fax line for the time it takes to send a message.witnesses testified on behalf of the attorneys general of florida and washington that their offices had been receiving increasing numbers of complaints about unsolicited fax advertisements.the defendant companies presented evidence that technological advances had reduced the amount of costs and interference experienced by recipients and that fax advertising benefits both advertisers and consumers.
the district court approached the constitutional questions by applying the four part test for restrictions on commercial speech under central hudson gas electric public service commission,d.the court questioned whether the government had shown that there was a substantial governmental interest in restricting unsolicited fax advertising.it noted the absence of empirical data on costs or evidence that the majority of unsolicited fax advertisements involved commercial speech.it also observed that complaints about unsolicited faxes had increased despite the legislation and that several less restrictive options were available,such as a national no fax database,and it concluded that the government had not demonstrated that the b c restriction would materially alleviate the asserted harm or that it was sufficiently narrow.after concluding that b c violated the first amendment,the district court granted the pending motions and dismissed the action.
the united states and missouri appeal.they argue that the statute is constitutional and that the district court erred in its application of the central hudson test.they contend that there was sufficient evidence to demonstrate a substantial government interest in restricting unsolicited fax advertisements and that tcpa materially advanced that interest and was not more extensive than necessary.they argue that technological changes have not eliminated the burdens imposed on recipients of unwanted fax advertising and that the district court was wrong to substitute its own judgment for the conclusion of congress that the restriction was the minimum necessary to protect the public.they also point out that no other federal court has found this statute unconstitutional.see destination ventures,fcc,cir,aff g.texas am.blast fax,d,kenro,fax daily.
the parties agree that the fax advertisements in question are commercial speech,and the supreme court has recently indicated that central hudson remains the test for the constitutionality of a restriction on commercial speech.see thompson states med,d.under central hudson 
we ask as a threshold matter whether the commercial speech concerns unlawful activity or is misleading.if so,then the speech is not protected by the first amendment.if the speech concerns lawful activity and is not misleading,however,we next ask whether the asserted governmental interest is substantial.if it is,then we determine whether the regulation directly advances the governmental interest asserted,and,finally,whether it is not more extensive than is necessary to serve that interest.each of these latter three inquiries must be answered in the affirmative for the regulation to be found constitutional.

fc argues that the government has not shown a substantial governmental interest.it contends that the asserted interest,preventing unwanted fax advertising from shifting advertising costs to unwilling consumers and interfering with their fax machines,is insufficient to justify the statutory restriction.it contends that the government has not produced empirical data to support its assertion and that technological progress has reduced any harm to a de minimis level.see edenfield fane,d government must demonstrate that the harms it recites are real.
we do not agree with fc that the government must produce empirical studies to show the significance of the harm it seeks to remedy,for the supreme court has pointed out that it may demonstrate the substantiality of its interest with anecdotes,history,consensus,and simple common sense.florida bar went for it,d quoting burson freeman,d van bergen minnesota,cir external evidence of harm unnecessary in case involving content neutral speech restriction.in this case,the legislative record and the evidence produced in the district court adequately demonstrate the potential harm of unrestrained fax advertising.
we first turn to the legislative history,which predates the passage of tcpa.a hearing on predecessor bills showed that congress had become aware of a junk fax problem from media reports and legislative initiatives in many states.telemarketing practices hearing on,and before the subcomm.on telecomm.and fin.of the house comm.on energy and commerce,cong.statements of chair markey and rinaldo,subcomm.on telecomm.and fin.of the house comm.on energy and commerce.a maryland official testified that even though his state had passed a measure to ban unsolicited commercial fax advertisements,federal legislation was required for a full solution to a problem likely to grow in scale.id.at statement of john glynn,maryland office of people counsel.the subcommittee was also presented with research which indicated the pervasive nature of this type of advertising.it was reported that at least one fax advertiser could routinely send fax advertisements per week and that business owners are virtually unanimous in their view that they do not want their fax lines tied up by advertisers trying to send messages.id.at footnote omitted statement of robert ellis,indiana university school of law.
in hearings held in,the of the center for the study of commercialism described the numerous nuisance faxes he had received and complained that they not only use the recipient paper,but also prevent faxes from being sent out and prevent legitimate faxes from coming in.hearing on,and before the subcomm.on communications of the senate comm.on commerce,and,cong.statement of michael jacobson.a house subcommittee heard from the chair of the florida public service commission that t he junk fax advertiser is a nuisance who wants to print its add sic on your paper and seizes your fax machine so that it is not available for calls you want or need.issues hearing on and before the subcomm.on telecomm.and fin.of the house comm.on energy and commerce,cong.statement of thomas beard.tcpa was subsequently enacted in that same year.
the hearing held in the district court in also produced evidence that the harms of unsolicited fax advertising are real and have not been eliminated by technological changes.there was evidence that unsolicited fax advertisements can shift to the recipient more than one hundred dollars per year in direct costs,that it takes thirty seconds for a one page fax to be received,that most machines can still only receive one fax at a time,that currently eighty percent of all faxes are printed on paper,and that unsolicited fax advertising interferes with company switchboard operations and burdens the computer networks of those recipients who route incoming faxes into their electronic mail systems.the record evidence from that hearing indicates that the costs and amount of interference resulting from unrestrained fax advertising continue to be significant.see destination ventures,at u nsolicited fax advertisements shift significant advertising costs to consumers.
we conclude that the government has demonstrated a substantial interest in restricting unsolicited fax advertisements in order to prevent the cost shifting and interference such unwanted advertising places on the recipient.
fc contends that there are several reasons why the tcpa restriction on commercial faxes can not survive the third part of the central hudson test,which requires a showing that the regulation directly advances the governmental interest asserted.states.at quoting central hudson,at.see also rubin coors brewing,d government carries the burden of showing that the challenged regulation advances the government interest in a direct and material way.internal quotation marks omitted.this step helps ensure that there is a reasonable fit between the legislature ends and the means chosen to accomplish them.lorillard tobacco reilly,d internal quotations marks omitted.
fc argues that if a restriction treats commercial and noncommercial speech differently,there must be a basis for the difference that is relevant to the asserted governmental interest.fc contends that this case is just like city of cincinnati discovery network,where an ordinance was found unconstitutional because there was not a good fit between the asserted aesthetic interest and the ban on only commercial newsracks on the street.see,d.fc argues that a noncommercial fax shifts costs and interferes with a recipient fax machine just as much as a commercial fax.
this case is different from discovery network,however,because the distinction between commercial and noncommercial faxes is relevant to the asserted governmental interest.in discovery network the only justification advanced by the city for singling out commercial newsracks was the low value of commercial speech,a position which the court refused to adopt.at.when congress enacted tcpa,however,it had found that calls are less intrusive to consumers because they are more expected,at.there is no reason to doubt that congress also believed for the same reason that noncommercial faxes did not present the same problem as commercial faxes and therefore distinguished between them.the supreme court has indicated that congress may rely on various forms of evidence to distinguish between different types of speech.see florida bar,at.for example,restrictions on speech may be justified by reference to studies and anecdotes pertaining to different locales altogether and history,consensus,and simple common sense.id.quoting freeman,at.the legislative history here shows that tcpa distinction between commercial and noncommercial fax advertising is relevant to the goal of reducing the costs and interference associated with unwanted faxes.we agree with the ninth circuit that this distinction is justified destination ventures,at.
fc also argues that the restriction on fax advertising can not directly and materially advance the asserted governmental interest because gaps in the statute coverage limit its effectiveness.unsolicited live telemarketing calls,some types of unsolicited commercial faxes,and unsolicited noncommercial faxes are not restricted,and fc contends that tcpa thus resembles the statutes struck down in coors,at,and greater new orleans broadcasting association united states,d.
tcpa is quite different from the statutes at issue in coors and greater new orleans.in coors,the government claimed that legislation prohibiting the display of alcohol content on beer labels advanced the legislative interest in curbing strength wars by beer brewers who might seek to compete for customers on the basis of alcohol content.at.the supreme court found overall irrationality in the statute since it did not apply to advertisements,and alcohol content in a product could be widely disclosed by other means such advertising would appear to be a more influential weapon in any strength war than labels.id.at.moreover,the statutory restriction did not apply to wine,spirits,or the term malt liquor.id.at.the asserted governmental interest in suppressing competition based on high alcohol content was therefore unlikely to be advanced.likewise,in greater new orleans the court was skeptical about the government position that legislation banning advertisements for private casino gambling served the governmental interests of reducing the social costs associated with gambling and helping states restrict it.at.the court found the government position inconsistent with its simultaneous support for tribal casino gambling which could involve the same social costs.id.at.inconsistencies and discrepancies in these two pieces of legislation therefore showed that the statutes were not likely to advance their asserted purposes.see id.at.coors,at.
tcpa by contrast contains no inconsistency that renders it incapable of materially advancing the government asserted interest.while there is differential treatment in tcpa of unsolicited fax advertisements and live telemarketing calls,the difference is consistent with tcpa goal to protect members of the public from bearing the costs of unwanted advertising thus,tcpa treats live telemarketing solicitations differently if they impose costs on the recipient.while they are generally permitted unless an individual has registered an objection to being contacted,see c,e iii,they are prohibited when they result in out of pocket costs for the recipient,see b a iii prohibiting calls made without consent to any telephone number assigned to a paging service,cellular telephone service,specialized mobile radio service,or other radio common carrier service,or any service for which the called party is charged for the call.because of the cost shifting of fax advertising,it was consistent for congress to treat unsolicited fax advertisements differently than live telemarketing calls.the distinction in no way undercuts the tcpa goal of protecting the public from unwanted advertising costs.
fc also argues that the legislation was made unconstitutionally inconsistent by a statutory interpretation of the federal communications commission fcc.the fcc has interpreted tcpa not to prohibit the sending of unsolicited commercial faxes to a recipient with whom a sender has an established business relationship.see in the matter of rules and regulations implementing the telephone consumer protection act of.even if one assumes that this fcc interpretation is entitled to deference and is part of the governing law,it does not undermine the governmental interest in reducing the cost shifting and interference caused by unwanted commercial faxes.it would not have been unreasonable for congress to conclude that a preexisting business relationship is an indication that a fax advertisement would be welcome.congress in fact made this distinction explicit with respect to telephone solicitations.see a.we can not conclude that this exemption renders the statute so pierced by exemptions and inconsistencies,greater new orleans,at,or overall irrational,coors,at,that it can not
