one of the fastest growing subjects of consumer complaints is the practice of slamming,wherein one telephone carrier company surreptitiously gains control over the service provided by another without notice to the customer slamming is prohibited by the law of this state.in this case,plaintiff robert lovejoy,individually and doing business as lovejoy drilling,filed a lawsuit claiming that defendant at t corporation att slammed his number and that he lost his business as a result.
plaintiff appeals from a judgment in favor of att after the trial court granted att motion for judgment on the pleadings,dismissing his complaint which alleged a single count of fraud.att has filed a protective,urging that,even if the judgment on the pleadings was erroneously granted,it should have gotten out of the case earlier on a motion for summary judgment.
we will conclude that the trial court erred in granting the motion for judgment on the pleadings,and that the order denying att motion for summary judgment was correct.we will reverse and remand with directions.
procedural background 
plaintiff originally filed a complaint alleging that pacific bell pac bell and several doe defendants tortiously allowed his business telephone service to be terminated without his knowledge.the complaint was later amended to name att as a doe defendant.plaintiff was granted leave of court to file a amended complaint for negligence and fraud against att only,alleging that att caused the switching and then cancellation of his telephone service without his consent.
att brought a motion for summary judgment,primarily on the ground that plaintiff action was barred by the filed rate doctrine,which will be explained in detail,infra.the court ruled that the negligence count was barred by the filed rate doctrine,but denied att motion as to the fraud cause of action.
plaintiff proceeded to trial under a first amended complaint,alleging a single cause of action for fraud.in chambers,att brought a number of motions,including one for judgment on the pleadings,which the court granted.since this action was effectively terminated by the granting of the motion,we summarize the allegations of the pleading in some detail 
the first amended complaint 
at all times pertinent,plaintiff operated a business known as lovejoy drilling,while att and pac bell were both in the business of providing telephone numbers.in september,plaintiff contracted with pac bell to provide his business with an number,which was good for the entire state.
on february,all further calendar references are to that year att informed pac bell,who was acting as plaintiff agent,that att had written authorization from plaintiff to be the provider of his number.pac bell,however,refused to release the number without proof of written authorization.
on march,att represented to a third entity,lockheed ims,that it had written authorization to take over plaintiff number.this representation was no time did plaintiff ever authorize such a switch,either orally or in writing.att knew the representation was false,and made it for the sole purpose of obtaining plaintiff as a customer for their own personal monetary gain.as a direct and proximate result of the false representation to lockheed,pac bell released plaintiff number to att.plaintiff had no knowledge of the all times,he continued to believe that pac bell was his carrier.this practice is known as slamming in the telecommunications industry.
prior to february plaintiff had long distance telephone service with att.once att obtained plaintiff number it hid the charges for service in its long distance billing the billing statement remained the same and did not indicate plaintiff was being charged for service.
in august,plaintiff became embroiled in a payment dispute with att over his long distance bill.as a result of the dispute,att disconnected plaintiff long distance service.the termination of service disconnected plaintiff service as well.however,plaintiff had no idea his service had been terminated as a result of the payment dispute.
in march,plaintiff discovered that his number had been assigned to someone in michigan,who had been getting six to calls per day requesting plaintiff services.as a proximate cause of the fraudulent conduct by att,plaintiff lost his business,was required to file bankruptcy,and suffered emotional distress.
the appeal 
iapplicable on the pleadings 
a motion for judgment on the pleadings is analogous to a general demurrer.citation.the task of this court is to determine whether the complaint states a cause of action.all facts alleged in the complaint are deemed admitted,and we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation by reading it as a whole and all of its parts in their context.citations.we are not concerned with a plaintiff possible inability to prove the claims made in the complaint,the allegations of which are accepted as true and liberally construed with a view toward attaining substantial justice.citations.lance camper manufacturing republic indemnity th,d.
review of a judgment on the pleadings requires the appellate court to determine,de novo and as a matter of law,whether the complaint states a cause of action.citation.for purposes of this review,we accept as true all material facts alleged in the complaint.citation.denial of leave to amend after granting a motion for judgment on the pleadings is reviewed for abuse of discretion.citation.ott agri,th,d.
the fraud cause of action 
in a nutshell,plaintiff alleges that his business had service with pac bell and long distance service with att that att knowingly and falsely represented to pac bell that plaintiff wished to switch his service to att that when pac bell refused to release the number due to the lack of a signed authorization,att went to another agency and made the same false representation that as a result of this second representation,pac bell was induced into releasing the number to att that att thereafter billed plaintiff for service but hid the billing charges so that plaintiff had no idea his service had been switched that when plaintiff got into a billing dispute with att over his long distance bill,att pulled the plug on not only his long distance service but unknown to him his service as well and that,by the time plaintiff found out his number had been disconnected,he lost his business and ended up in bankruptcy.
the trial judge believed these allegations failed to state a cause of action for fraud.in its written ruling,the court gave three reasons for granting att motion plaintiff failed to plead that att intended to drive him out of business since a fraud defendant is not liable for unintended consequences,proximate cause was lacking plaintiff did not,nor could he,plead that he relied on att false representation,but instead pleaded that he was totally unaware of it and the complaint fails to state a cause of action for indirect misrepresentation because plaintiff was unable to plead that att either intended or had reason to believe that its misrepresentation regarding the switch would be repeated to him and that he would act on it.
we will first analyze the complaint for the defects cited by the trial court and then separately determine whether the complaint states a cause of action,mindful that,as an appellate court,we are not bound by the determination of the trial court,but are required to render our independent judgment on whether a cause of action has been stated.hoffman state farm fire casualty th,d.
failure to plead that defendant intended the type of damage caused to plaintiff 
the trial court found the complaint insufficiently demonstrated a proximate connection between att alleged fraud and the damage,explaining its reasoning as follows a complete causal relationship between the fraud or deceit and the plaintiff damages is required.citation.the defendant must intend to induce a particular act of the plaintiff and is not liable in fraud for unintended consequences.citation.and it must be shown that the plaintiff actually and justifiably relied upon the defendant misrepresentation in acting to his detriment.conrad bank of america th,d conrad.plaintiff has pled that defendant purpose was to obtain plaintiff as a customer for monetary gain.plaintiff has not pled that defendant intended plaintiff to act to his detriment.instead,inferentially,defendant wanted to keep plaintiff as a service customer for monetary to drive him out of business.italics added.
the court ruling implies that,in order to state a cause of action for fraud it is necessary that the defendant intend to cause the plaintiff to suffer a particular type of damage.that is not the law.
section of the restatement second of torts restatement states one who fraudulently makes a misrepresentation of fact for the purpose of inducing another to act or to refrain from action in reliance upon it,is subject to liability to the other in deceit for pecuniary loss caused to him by his justifiable reliance upon the misrepresentation.italics added.section of the restatement states the general rule that o ne who makes a fraudulent misrepresentation is subject to liability to the persons or class of persons whom he intends or has reason to expect to act or to refrain from action in reliance upon the misrepresentation,for pecuniary loss suffered by them through their justifiable reliance in the type of transaction in which he intends or has reason to expect their conduct to be influenced.italics added.
the elements of fraud,which give rise to the tort action for deceit,are a misrepresentation false representation,concealment,or nondisclosure b knowledge of falsity or scienter c intent to defraud,to induce reliance d justifiable reliance and e resulting damage.lazar superior court cal th,d,italics added see also,molko holy spirit cal d.
these quotations make clear that the only intent by a defendant necessary to prove a case of fraud is the intent to induce reliance.moreover,liability is affixed not only where the plaintiff reliance is intended by the defendant but also where it is reasonably expected to occur.
the dictum in conrad quoted by the trial judge in his written decision and relied upon extensively by att simply can not be read for the proposition that a fraud cause of action fails unless the defrauding defendant intends the plaintiff to suffer a particular harm in reliance on the fraud.
in conrad,the plaintiffs,who lost their business in bankruptcy,won a jury verdict against a bank for an alleged false promise to make them a loan based upon a bank officer obscure reply no problem when plaintiffs informed him they would be needing a loan in the future to meet expenses.the trial court granted a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and we affirmed.conrad,supra,th at,d.in addition to upholding the trial court determination that plaintiffs claim was barred for failure to list it in their bankruptcy petition id.at,d,we detected a host of problems with regard to proof of the elements of fraud.in the unfortunate passage relied on by the trial court,we said,the defendant must intend to induce a particular act of the plaintiff and is not liable in fraud for unintended consequences.id.at,d.however,when read in conjunction with our entire discussion,it is clear that what was fatal to the plaintiff claim was lack of proof of intent to induce reliance and lack of detrimental reliance we have considered the record to identify potential candidates for detrimental reliance by plaintiffs but find none of the candidates sufficient to support a cause of action for fraud.ibid.
few defrauding defendants give any serious thought to the nature or quality of the harm which could befall the victims who rely on their deceptive acts.it would be unconscionable and nonsensical for such perpetrators to escape liability because of their indifference to the consequences of their opprobrious behavior.to the extent the conrad dictum and the case it cites,carlson murphy d,can be read for the proposition that a defendant is not liable in fraud for damage that he does not anticipate,or indeed intend to occur,we reject both as inconsistent with california law.
other problems with the complaint 
despite the foregoing flaw in the trial court reasoning,the complaint encounters other significant obstacles if viewed as an attempt to plead a cause of action for fraud based on an affirmative misrepresentation of fact by att to pac bell.
as the trial court noted,r eliance is an essential element of a fraud cause of action.mirkin wasserman cal th,d.nowhere does the complaint allege that att misrepresentation to a third party regarding plaintiff intent to switch service was relied upon by plaintiff to his detriment.rather the complaint steadfastly alleges plaintiff was at all material times,unaware of the misrepresentation.
it is true that california courts recognize the principle of indirect misrepresentation,under which a knowingly false statement is no less actionable because it was made to an intermediary who then conveyed it to the party ultimately injured.varwig,d.massei lettunich d.however,this doctrine requires that the defendant intend or has reason to expect that it will be repeated and acted upon by the plaintiff.italics added,geernaert mitchell th,d see also shapiro sutherland th,d rest d torts,supra.plaintiff does not allege that att either intended or expected its false statement regarding the switch in service to reach his ears.just the opposite was true to be successful,att plan required that the switch be concealed from plaintiff so that he would not act on it,a plan which the complaint alleges att implemented by hiding the charges in its phone bill.
nor does the doctrine of indirect reliance help plaintiff.under the principle of indirect reliance,a fraudulent misrepresentation is actionable if it was communicated to an agent of the plaintiff and was acted upon by the agent to plaintiff damage.a classic example of indirect reliance would be a drug manufacturer misrepresentation to physicians about the safety of its drug.a patient injured by the drug is permitted to sue the manufacturer for fraud without proof that his doctor repeated the falsehood to him,under the theory that the doctor was acting as plaintiff agent.allen searle,grinnell charles pfizer d.the concept does not work here even if we accept plaintiff hypothesis that pac bell relied on the misrepresentation in its capacity as his agent because of the tenuous proximate connection between pac bell reliance on the false statement release of plaintiff number to att and the loss of business of which plaintiff complains.
clearly,the real reason plaintiff lost his business was because the switch in service was concealed by att.because att suppressed this material fact,plaintiff had no idea that the termination of his long distance service would also disconnect his number.the disconnection,which sabotaged his business,occurred because plaintiff was kept in the dark about the switch in service.this raises the crucial question despite its flaws in pleading affirmative fraud,did the complaint state a valid cause of action for fraudulent concealment we believe it did.
fraudulent concealment as a viable theory 
not every fraud arises from an affirmative misstatement of material fact.the principle is fundamental that deceit may be negative as well as affirmative it may consist of suppression of that which it is one duty to declare as well as of the declaration of that which is false.citations.thus section of the civil code provides one who wilfully deceives another with intent to induce him to alter his position to his injury or risk,is liable for any damage which he thereby suffers.section of the civil code in relevant part provides a deceit,within the meaning of the last section,is either.the suppression of a fact,by one who is bound to disclose it,or who gives information of other facts which are likely to mislead for want of communication of that fact lingsch savage d.
according to section of the restatement,a party who by concealment or other action intentionally prevents the other from acquiring material information is subject to the same liability to the other,for pecuniary loss as though he had stated the nonexistence of the matter that the other was thus prevented from discovering.t he elements of an action for fraud and deceit based on concealment are the defendant must have concealed or suppressed a material fact,the defendant must have been under a duty to disclose the fact to the plaintiff,the defendant must have intentionally concealed or suppressed the fact with the intent to defraud the plaintiff,the plaintiff must have been unaware of the fact and would not have acted as he did if he had known of the concealed or suppressed fact,and as a result of the concealment or suppression of the fact,the plaintiff must have sustained damage.marketing west,sanyo fisher usa th,d.
reading the complaint liberally and as a whole,all of these elements are present.initially att slammed plaintiff telephone number,appropriating it for itself through false representation to third parties,but the misrepresentation did not complete the tort.after the slam,att allegedly suppressed the switch and concealed it from plaintiff by hiding the charges within its long distance bill.the surreptitious switch and its concealment from plaintiff was a breach of duty by att to plaintiff,a long distance customer.it may be inferred that att concealed the switch with fraudulent intent,for the purpose of making a profit it may also be inferred that plaintiff,who was unaware of the switch,would have acted differently had he known of the suppressed fact.specifically,plaintiff would never have permitted termination of his att long distance service had he known that it would have the simultaneous effect of pulling the plug on his number.at a minimum,plaintiff would have acted differently,by taking steps to ensure a continuity of service on which he relied for his livelihood.a complete proximate cause relationship between the suppression or concealment of the material fact and plaintiff damage is thus readily deducible from the complaint.
it is apparent that the alleged tort committed by att was not merely the slamming of plaintiff telephone number.this conduct merely set the stage for att willful suppression of material fact,which forms the basis of plaintiff cause of action for negative fraud.
stevens superior court d.stevens illuminates our point.stevens involved a fraud complaint by a patient against a hospital,alleging that the hospital allowed unlicensed foreign physicians to practice medicine on its premises.id.at.the patient alleged that defendant hospital concealed this fact from her,that one of the unlicensed physicians participated in a cesarean section procedure which was performed on her,and as a result she suffered serious bodily injury.the superior court sustained a demurrer without leave to amend due to the absence of any allegation that any agent of the hospital made a direct,affirmative representation upon which she relied concerning the doctor licensed status.id.at.
the stevens court reversed.the court noted that i t is,established by statute that intentional concealment of a material fact is an alternative form of fraud and deceit equivalent to direct affirmative misrepresentation,subd,and,subd.stevens,supra,d at.further,w here failure to disclose a material fact is calculated to induce a false belief,the distinction between concealment and affirmative misrepresentation is tenuous.both are fraudulent.an active concealment has the same force and effect as a representation which is positive in form.id.at,citing outboard marine superior court d,italics added.the court concluded that the complaint adequately pleaded a cause of action for fraudulent concealment.stevens,supra,at.
important to the stevens result was the fact that the hospital retention of an unlicensed doctor did not complete the tort,but was only a first step in the perpetration of the fraud.the conduct which formed the gravamen of the action was the willful concealment of that fact from the patient,with its concomitant increased risk to her health.stevens,supra,d at.similarly here,att wrongful appropriation of plaintiff number through false pretenses was not the sum of its tortious activity.it was the subsequent fraudulent concealment from plaintiff,with its attendant risks to his business,which forms the linchpin of the fraud claim.
when viewed as a cause of action for negative fraud rather than affirmative misrepresentation,the complaint suffers none of the defects noted by the trial court.there is no problem with reliance,since the only type of reliance required is that the plaintiff must have been unaware of the fact and would not have acted as he did if he had known of the concealed or suppressed fact.marketing west,supra,th at,d.here,it is alleged that when plaintiff allowed his long distance service to be terminated over a billing dispute,his telephone service,on which his business depended,was also terminated because the two were secretly tied together by att.nor is there an insurmountable proximate cause problem.owing to the concealment,plaintiff number was unknowingly terminated,causing his business to dry up.the complaint thus pleads an ascertainable and identifiable proximate cause connection between att deceptive conduct and the damage 
we conclude the complaint states a cause of action for fraudulent concealment despite its apparent label as fraud based on affirmative misrepresentation.it is an elementary principle of modern pleading that the nature and character of a pleading is to be determined from its allegations,regardless of what it may be called,and that the subject matter of an action and issues involved are determined from the facts alleged rather than from the title of the pleadings jaffe carroll d.the trial court erred in granting att motion for judgment on the pleadings based on a failure sufficiently to plead the elements of fraud.
the filed rate doctrine 
even if the trial court erred in granting its motion for judgment on the pleadings based on inadequate pleading,att contends judgment on the pleadings should be upheld on the alternative ground that plaintiff fraud claim is barred by the filed rate doctrine.the filed rate doctrine was not relied on by the trial court in granting judgment on the pleadings.furthermore,in denying att earlier motion for summary judgment,the court ruled the filed rate doctrine posed no bar to the action.however,since we must affirm if the judgment was correct on any theory see hendy losse cal d,d,belair riverside county flood control dist.cal d,we take up the issue.
the federal communications act the fca requires telecommunication common carriers to file schedules,known as tariffs,with the fcc federal communications commission.these tariffs must show all charges and the classifications,practices and regulations affecting those charges.a.the contents of the tariff are subject to fcc approval.b.these filed tariffs are the equivalent of federal regulations which have the force of law.citations.duggal capital communications services,th,d duggal.
the filed rate doctrine forbids a regulated entity to charge rates for its services other than those properly filed with the appropriate federal regulatory authority.citation.t he fca does not permit either a customer ignorance or the carrier misquotation of the applicable rate to serve as a defense to the collection of the filed rate.citation.unless and until suspended or set aside,this rate is made,for all purposes,the legal rate,as between carrier and customer.the rights as defined by the tariff can not be varied or enlarged by either contract or tort of the carrier.citations.fax telecommunicaciones,v.at t cir,fax.

att fcc tariff,which was in effect at the time,limits its liability for interruption in telephone service att maintains that because plaintiff is seeking damages for termination of his service,he is seeking relief which would contravene the prescribed tariff,a result forbidden by the filed rate doctrine.att is mistaken.
