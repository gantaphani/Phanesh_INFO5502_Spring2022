introduction 
the americans with disabilities act ada mandates that individuals with hearing or speech disabilities have access to telecommunications relay services trs,which are telephone transmission services enabling such individuals to communicate in a manner functionally equivalent to how individuals without disabilities communicate.a,b.interstate trs providers are compensated for the costs of providing trs from a fund the trs fund governed by the federal communications commission fcc.c iii.in two declaratory rulings,the fcc articulated three restrictions on trs providers which petitioners challenge in this case.first,the fcc prohibited providers from using revenues received from the trs fund to lobby customers.telecomms.relay,hereinafter declaratory ruling.second,it prohibited providers from using customer data collected in the course of providing trs for lobbying or any other purpose except the handling of trs calls.id.at telecomms.relay,hereinafter declaratory ruling.third,the fcc prohibited providers from engaging in various marketing practices designed to increase trs usage.declaratory ruling,at declaratory ruling,at.
sorenson communications,sorenson and goamerica,goamerica,two trs providers,raise statutory and constitutional challenges to these restrictions.exercising jurisdiction pursuant to a and,this court concludes the restriction on using revenue from the trs fund for lobbying is arbitrary and capricious because the fcc provided no explanation for why lobbying was singled out for prohibition.this court also concludes the restriction on the use of customer data violates the first amendment as an impairment of providers right to engage in political and commercial speech without any showing the restriction is narrowly tailored to advance a significant government interest.goamerica challenge to the restriction on abusive marketing practices is dismissed under a because goamerica failed to present its argument to the fcc prior to seeking judicial review.
ii.background 
the ada mandates that individuals with hearing or speech disabilities have access to trs.a,b.various types of trs exist.declaratory ruling,at.one type of trs is video relay service vrs,which enables a person with a hearing disability to remotely communicate with a hearing person by means of a video link and communications assistant.id.at.the vrs customer communicates with the communications assistant by sign language,and the communications assistant communicates with the hearing person by voice.see a.
trs customers do not pay the costs associated with the service.d d.providers of traditional telephone voice transmission service are obligated to make trs available to persons with hearing and speech disabilities.id.b.the costs associated with interstate and intrastate trs are compensated by way of funds administered by the federal and state governments,respectively id.d b.the trs fund is financed by interstate telecommunications providers on the basis of interstate telecommunications revenues.c iii a.trs providers are compensated out of the trs fund at a rate determined by the fcc.id.c iii e.for vrs,the fcc sets tiered compensation rates that vary depending on the size of the provider.declaratory ruling,at.vrs is compensated at a higher rate than most other forms of trs,and the number of people using vrs has increased in recent years.id.at.for the fund year,nearly percent of the trs fund was attributable to vrs.id.
in,the fcc decided to examine whether it should revise its rate structure for trs.further notice of proposed rulemaking telecomms.relay.in its notice of proposed rulemaking,the fcc sought comment on a broad range of issues concerning the compensation of providers of trs from the interstate trs fund.id.these included numerous issues relating to the cost recovery methodology used for determining the trs compensation rates paid by the fund,as well as the scope of the costs properly compensable under section and the trs regime as intended by congress.id.at.the notice also proposed new methodologies for calculating compensation rates.id.at.
in the declaratory ruling,the fcc changed how it calculates compensation rates.declaratory ruling,at.those changes are not at issue in this appeal.in addition to changing the compensation methodology,the fcc also used the declaratory ruling to clarify issues regarding improper incentives and marketing practices on the part of some trs providers.declaratory ruling,at.because customers do not pay for the service,the fcc explained,providers could encourage them to make calls they might not otherwise make.id.at.the fcc reminded providers of a public notice regarding impermissible marketing practices.id.at.it went on to note it was still receiving reports of vrs providers offering improper incentives to trs customers,and it reaffirmed the prohibitions on improper incentives and marketing practices.id.at.
the fcc also declared that providers may not use a consumer or call database to contact trs users for lobbying or any other purpose.id.at.it explained that using a customer profile information to contact the customer was an improper use of such data,and declared that providers could not contact customers to inform them about pending trs compensation issues.id.the fcc further declared that providers engaging in improper marketing practices or misusing customer information would be ineligible for compensation from the fund.id.
after the declaratory ruling was issued,sorenson petitioned the fcc to reconsider the prohibition on using customer data to contact customers for lobbying or any other purpose,arguing the prohibition violated the administrative procedures act apa and the first amendment.see declaratory ruling,at.counsel for hands on video relay services.hands on also submitted three ex parte letters to the fcc.in those letters,hands on stated it supports much of the declaratory ruling,which addresses certain abusive marketing practices,such as contacts made by provider representatives urging vrs consumers to make more calls using a provider service.the letters went on to list statutory and constitutional concerns with the portion of the declaratory ruling which prohibits providers from contacting for any reason consumers who have registered with a provider.
in response to the concerns expressed by vrs providers,the fcc issued the declaratory ruling for the purposes of clarification.id.at.in the declaratory ruling,the fcc clarified that the restriction on the use of customer information for any purpose does not prohibit contacts directly related to the handling of trs calls.id.at.as examples,it explained providers could contact customers to inform them of a service outage,respond to a call for emergency services,assist in the delivery of emergency services,or provide technical support for trs products or services.id.it also stated providers could use such data to comply with a federal statute,a commission rule or order,a court order,or other lawful authority.id.quotation omitted.
in the declaratory ruling,the fcc also explained providers were prohibited from using revenue from the trs fund to contact customers and attempt to persuade them to support the provider position on matters pending before the fcc,since the payments from the fund are only intended to compensate providers for the costs of providing trs.id.at.finally,with respect to impermissible financial incentives and marketing practices,the fcc clarified that such practices are prohibited regardless of whether the provider uses customer call data or similar,privately collected information.id.at.
sorenson and goamerica filed petitions seeking judicial review of the declaratory rulings.both challenge the prohibition on using trs revenues to contact customers for lobbying or advocacy purposes.they both also challenge the prohibition on using customer data to contact customers for lobbying or any purpose other than the handling of relay calls.goamerica alone challenges the prohibition on abusive marketing practices.after sorenson and goamerica filed petitions for review of the declaratory rulings and their challenges were consolidated in this court,a panel of this court granted a stay of enforcement of the challenged portions of the declaratory rulings pending appeal.
iii.discussion 
restriction on use of trs revenues for lobbying or advocacy purposes 
the various challenges to the fcc rulings are premised on both statutory and constitutional grounds.it is a fundamental rule of judicial restraint for courts,p rior to reaching any constitutional questions,to consider nonconstitutional grounds for decision.jean nelson,d quotations omitted.this court,therefore,considers petitioners statutory arguments first.
sorenson argues the restriction on using trs funds to lobby customers is arbitrary,capricious,or contrary to law in violation of the apa,a.the fcc asserts the restriction is a logical action taken to counteract a specific problem.an agency action is arbitrary and capricious under the apa if,inter alia,the agency fails to examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.motor vehicle mfrs.ass of state farm mut.auto.ins,d quotation omitted.the same standard of review applies to both initial policy decisions and subsequent changes in policy.fcc fox television stations,d.review under the arbitrary and capricious standard is narrow in scope,but is still a probing,review.qwest commc ns int l,fcc,cir quotation omitted.an agency action is entitled to a presumption of validity,and the burden is upon the petitioner to establish the action is arbitrary or capricious.citizens comm.to save our canyons krueger,cir.the court must rely upon the reasoning set forth in the administrative record and disregard post hoc rationalizations of counsel.olenhouse commodity credit,cir.
in the declaratory ruling,the fcc explained providers were not permitted to use revenues from the trs fund for lobbying or advocacy activities directed at customers because it found e vidence in the record that at least one service provider has bombarded deaf persons with material seeking to persuade them to support the provider position on matters pending before the fcc.declaratory ruling,at footnote omitted.according to the fcc,using revenue from the trs fund to engage in that kind of advocacy is inconsistent with the purpose of the trs fund.id.the fcc went on to state that t he trs fund is designed to ensure that persons with hearing and speech disabilities have access to the telephone system.it was not intended to finance lobbying by providers directed at end users.the commission is under no obligation to fund such activities out of the public fisc.id.quotation omitted.the rationale for the restriction,therefore,was that lobbying end users was not an activity the trs fund was intended to compensate,and therefore monies from the trs fund were not permitted to be used for that purpose.
the fcc does not reimburse vrs providers for actual costs.instead it compensates them based upon a tiered price cap formula.declaratory ruling,at.from provider data of expected costs and levels of usage,the fcc sets a compensation rate for providers.id.one rationale for this approach is to give providers an incentive to innovate and reduce costs.see id.at.if a provider can deliver vrs at an actual cost lower than the fcc estimated cost,it retains the difference.the fcc has noted that in prior years estimated costs generally exceeded actual costs.id.at.
under this compensation scheme that allows vrs providers to retain payments in excess of actual costs,the fcc singled out lobbying as the one expenditure for which trs fund proceeds could not be used.the interdiction of the use of payments from the trs fund for lobbying was premised on the fund limited design to ensure that persons with hearing and speech disabilities have access to the telephone system.declaratory ruling,at.
the fcc justification is inconsistent with the logic of a price cap based compensation system.the fcc has chosen to reward efficient providers by allowing them to retain the savings generated by providing trs at a low cost.it does this by compensating providers regardless of their actual costs in providing trs.this reward mechanism is only effective if providers are permitted to decide how to spend those savings.regardless of the validity of the fcc concern regarding the purpose of the trs fund,it made no attempt to explain how restricting the use of revenues from the trs fund is consistent with its choice of a price cap scheme which itself seeks to reward efficiency and increase market access by allowing providers to retain cost savings 
under the fcc broad rationale,any expenditure apart from the actual cost of providing trs is inconsistent with the purpose of the fund.lobbying expenditures,however,are the only expenditures prohibited.it is true the fcc is not required to address all problems in one fell swoop,and may focus on problems depending upon their acuteness.ass of broadcasters fcc.nonetheless,the fcc must still articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action.motor vehicle mfrs,at.the fcc made no attempt to explain why lobbying expenditures were deserving of prohibition while all other uses of fund revenues were not.
because the fcc chosen cost recovery system allows providers to spend revenues from the trs fund however they choose,the fcc inadequately explained its restriction on the grounds that lobbying expenditures are inconsistent with the purpose of the trs fund.declaratory ruling,at.the fcc further failed to provide any reason why lobbying expenses are deserving of prohibition when all other business expenditures are permissible.absent these justifications,the prohibition on lobbying expenditures is arbitrary and capricious in violation of a.the declaratory ruling is hereby remanded to the fcc for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.because the restriction is unlawful under the apa,this court does not consider the constitutional challenge.
restriction on use of customer data 
notice and comment challenge 
goamerica contends the restriction on the use of customer data constitutes a legislative rule and,as such,was improperly issued without notice and comment.the fcc argues the restriction is an interpretative rule which does not require notice and comment see b a.under the apa,legislative rules can be issued only following notice and comment procedures.ballesteros ashcroft,cir,aff in relevant part on reh g,cir.a rule is legislative when it has the force of law,and creates new law or imposes new rights or duties.fdic schuchmann,cir quotation omitted.interpretative rules,by contrast,advise the public of the agency construction of the statutes and rules which it administers.shalala guernsey mem,d quotation omitted.the agency own label for its action is not dispositive.truckers united for safety fed.highway.
in support of its argument that the restriction on the use of consumer data is an interpretative rule,the fcc points to a prior order the order where it stated,trs customer data may not be used for any purpose other than the provision of trs.telecomms.relay,hereinafter order.this was codified as a regulation stating,trs customer data may not be used for any purpose other than to connect the trs user with the called parties desired by the trs user.c.the fcc argues the order and the regulation created the restriction on the use of customer data,and the declaratory rulings at issue in this case serve only to remind regulated entities of this obligation.therefore,the fcc argues,the restriction on the use of customer data was an interpretative rule,not subject to the apa notice and comment requirements.
goamerica argues the order concerned an entirely different issue and context.the relevant portion of the order concerned the transfer of customer data during changeovers between providers.order,at.to minimize disruptions in trs,outgoing providers were ordered to give customer data to incoming providers.id.at.to protect the privacy expectations of customers,however,the fcc also prohibited providers from using customer profile information for any purpose other than to connect trs calls.id.according to goamerica,the restriction on the use of customer information applies in the narrow context when providers are replaced without the knowledge and consent of customers.the fcc use of this restriction in the current context is entirely different,goamerica argues,and the fcc has conceded the new restrictions were not motivated by privacy concerns.because the restriction arises in a new context and is meant to achieve a different purpose from the restriction in the order,goamerica contends it constitutes a new rule for which notice and comment were required.
the regulation at c restricting the use of customer data came about in the context of transfers between outgoing and incoming providers,but the regulation unambiguously prohibits the use of customer data except to connect trs calls.the declaratory rulings at issue in this case did not create any new duties with respect to customer data,but merely informed providers of the fcc interpretation of the existing regulation.as a consequence,the restriction contained in the declaratory rulings was an interpretative rule,and the fcc was not required to comply with notice and comment procedures.
arbitrary and capricious challenge 
sorenson and goamerica both argue the restriction on the use of customer data was arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law in violation of a.an agency must provide a rational explanation when it departs from an existing regulation or position.utahns for better transp.of,cir.sorenson and goamerica argue the prohibition on using customer data to contact customers runs directly contrary to prior and ongoing fcc requests for providers to engage in outreach efforts to customers.goamerica also argues the prohibition is contrary to the fcc prior interpretation of the statute requiring trs to be functionally equivalent to the telephone service available to persons without disabilities.a.
in support of the argument that the prohibition is contrary to prior fcc positions regarding customer outreach,goamerica cites specifically to c,which requires telecommunications carriers to make the public aware of the availability of trs.sorenson claims fcc staff recently contacted the company asking for help in publicizing the transition to digital television.the declaratory ruling clarified that providers could use customer data to comply with a federal statute,a commission rule or order,a court order,or other lawful authority.declaratory ruling,at quotation omitted.consequently,the restriction does not create competing obligations for providers or conflict with prior positions of the fcc.if another order or regulation requires providers to communicate with customers,it prevails.there is no conflict between the new restriction on the use of customer data and other fcc orders and regulations.
goamerica also argues the prohibition is contrary to the fcc prior interpretation of the ada functional equivalence mandate.the ada defines trs as telephone transmission services that enable persons with disabilities to use the telephone system in a manner functionally equivalent to how it is used by persons without disabilities.a.goamerica contends the fcc has interpreted the statutory phrase functionally equivalent broadly to require providers to do such things as retain auxiliary power sources for their facilities,handle complaints regarding enforcement issues,allow customers to make trs calls from public telephones using coins,and provide phone numbers for customers.according to goamerica,this broad interpretation of functional equivalence demonstrates a requirement that trs customers enjoy the same relationship with their providers as persons without disabilities.it further argues this relationship includes the ability to solicit feedback from trs customers.additionally,if providers are unable to notify customers of pending changes to trs being contemplated by the fcc,goamerica predicts customers will be less likely to participate in the proceedings,and the fcc will be more likely to take action contrary to the ada.
the fcc has never interpreted the ada to require trs customers to have the same relationship with their telecommunications providers enjoyed by persons without disabilities.by its very nature the trs relationship is different from the traditional telecommunications relationship because trs customers do not pay for the costs associated with the service.d d.the one regulation cited by goamerica that even touches upon the relationship is the regulation requiring providers to handle complaints from customers.c.this regulation does not support goamerica position,however,because it does not address functional equivalence.instead,it implements separate,specific statutory clauses regarding complaints.e,g.goamerica cites no other regulation to support its position that functional equivalence requires the trs relationship to be identical to the traditional telephone relationship.it likewise cites no authority for its argument that a necessary aspect of this relationship is the ability to solicit feedback regarding service.the prohibition on the use of customer data therefore does not conflict with prior interpretations of the functional equivalence mandate,and consequently it is not arbitrary or capricious.
goamerica also claims functional equivalence may be threatened in the future if it is unable to warn customers in the event the fcc decides to undertake proceedings that would diminish functional equivalence.this argument relies upon a chain of questionable inferences and is purely speculative,as goamerica identifies no pending fcc action that threatens functional equivalence.such speculation does not render the prohibition arbitrary,capricious,or contrary to law.
constitutional challenge 
goamerica and sorenson argue the fcc restriction on the use of customer data is a violation of the first amendment under west,fcc,cir.in west,this court considered a challenge to the fcc regulations regarding the use of consumer proprietary network information cpni by telecommunications providers.id.at.cpni was defined as information pertaining to the quantity,technical configuration,type,destination,and amount of use of a telecommunications service that is made available to the telecommunications carrier by the customer solely by virtue of the relationship as well as information contained in the bills received by customers.id.at.the fcc prohibited telecommunications providers from using cpni to market services to which customers did not already subscribe unless the customer opted in and gave affirmative approval to the provider.id.at.this court struck down the restriction as an unconstitutional infringement on commercial speech because the fcc failed to demonstrate its regulations restricted no more speech than necessary to safeguard the asserted state interests in protecting privacy and competition.id.at.
as a threshold matter this court was required to determine whether the regulation affected speech at all,since on its face it only regulated the use of data.id.at.this court concluded the regulation did restrict speech because it made the speech between providers and customers more difficult by limiting the ability of providers to target their speech to a particular audience.id.while providers could still conceivably contact the intended audience by indiscriminately broadcasting their speech to a larger audience,the speech was still impaired because the providers preferred channel of communication was eliminated.id.
sorenson and goamerica argue west is directly on point.they contend the fcc is restricting the ability of providers to use their preferred channel of communication to contact their intended audience.as a result,they claim the restriction must withstand first amendment scrutiny.the fcc attempts to distinguish west on the grounds that it is not preventing providers from contacting customers directly so long as they do not use information derived from participation in the trs program.the information at issue in this case,the fcc argues,was gathered as a result of participation in a government program.because the providers only have this information as a result of the service provided to the government,the gover
