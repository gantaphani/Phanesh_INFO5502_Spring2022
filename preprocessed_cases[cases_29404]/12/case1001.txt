plaintiffs brought an action in the circuit court of madison county challenging the constitutionality of section of the public utilities act ilcs west,which abated proceedings then pending before the illinois commerce commission and mandated that million be refunded to certain customers of telecommunication services.on plaintiffs motion for summary judgment,the circuit court declared section invalid on the grounds that it violated the prohibition against special legislation set forth in article iv,section,of the illinois constitution of.const,art.iv,and denied the illinois constitution guarantees of due process and equal protection.const,art.i.because the circuit court judgment declared a statute of this state invalid,the appeal was taken directly to our court.a.for the reasons that follow,we now reverse.
telephone companies in illinois have long been regulated as public utilities.as such,their rates were determined by administrative agencies.before a telephone company could alter the price of its services,it was required to give days notice to the illinois commerce commission commission and the public.ilcs a,a west.the commission could then suspend the effectiveness of the price change for up to months while deciding whether to approve it.ilcs b,a west.
in,the general assembly enacted the universal telephone service protection law of ilcs et west,which created two classifications of telephone services competitive and noncompetitive ilcs west.generally speaking,noncompetitive services remain subject to the requirements discussed above.see ilcs a west.under section b of the universal telephone service protection law ilcs b west,however,an incumbent provider is now allowed to declare a service competitive with respect to an identifiable class of customers such as business customers in a certain geographic area if such service,or its functional equivalent,or a substitute service is reasonably available from more than one provider.this categorization is significant because once a service has been declared competitive,prices can be changed immediately simply by filing a new tariff and,in the case of an increase,providing notice to customers.ilcs a west.
the power of telecommunications providers to declare a service competitive is not unrestricted.section b of the universal telephone service protection law confers on the commission the authority to investigate the propriety of any classification of a telecommunications service on its own motion and requires it to investigate the propriety of any classification where a complaint has been filed.ilcs b west.the statute sets forth standards for evaluating whether a service should be reclassified as competitive see ilcs c west and provides that i n any hearing or investigation,the burden of proof as to the proper classification of any service shall rest upon the telecommunications carrier providing the service ilcs b west.where the reclassification of service as competitive is successfully challenged,the commission has the power to order the carrier to refund any overcharges that may have resulted from the improper classification.it may also order other remedies as authorized by the statute or seek appropriate relief in a court of competent jurisdiction.ilcs e west.
on february,illinois bell telephone company,doing business as sbc illinois,filed a tariff with the commission reclassifying many of the business services it provided to small business customers as competitive.after illinois bell reclassified its services,it raised rates for many of those services.pursuant to the authority conferred on it by section b of the universal telephone service protection law ilcs b west,the commission initiated an investigation of illinois bell actions.hearings were conducted during which a substantial evidentiary record was compiled.the commission hearing examiners assigned to the matter ultimately submitted a proposed order to the commission finding that illinois bell had wrongfully reclassified many of its small business services as competitive and that such reclassification resulted in unwarranted and significant rate increases.the proposed order,dated march,concluded that illinois bell should refund the price increases it had charged affected customers.
in accordance with section of title of the administrative code.as amended by.reg,eff.august,the parties were permitted to file exceptions to the proposed order and replies to the exceptions.while the matter was still pending,and before the commission issued a final order in the case,the general assembly enacted public act.that legislation made numerous changes to various statutes concerning telecommunications.it repealed section of the universal telephone service protection law ilcs west,which would have repealed the entire universal telephone service protection law as of july,and extended the life of the statute,as amended,until june,ilcs west at the same time,it added an entirely new section to the law,section ilcs west,which declared 
a any action or proceeding pending before the commission upon the effective date of this amendatory act of the general assembly public act in which it is alleged that a telecommunications carrier has improperly classified services as competitive,other than a case pertaining to section,shall be abated and shall not be maintained or continued.
b all retail telecommunications services provided to business end users by any telecommunications carrier subject,as of may,to alternative regulation under an alternative regulation plan pursuant to section of this act shall be classified as competitive as of the effective date of this amendatory act of the general assembly public act without further commission review.rates for retail telecommunications services provided to business end users with or fewer access lines shall not exceed the rates the carrier charged for those services on may.this restriction upon the rates of retail telecommunications services provided to business end users shall remain in force and effect through july,provided,however,that nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit reduction of those rates.rates for retail telecommunications services provided to business end users with or more access lines shall not be subject to the restrictions set forth in this subsection.
c all retail vertical services,as defined herein,that are provided by a telecommunications carrier subject,as of may,to alternative regulation under an alternative regulation plan pursuant to section of this act shall be classified as competitive as of june,without further commission review.retail vertical services shall include,for purposes of this section,services available on a subscriber telephone line that the subscriber pays for on a periodic or per use basis,but shall not include caller identification and call waiting.
d any action or proceeding before the commission upon the effective date of this amendatory act of the general assembly public act,in which it is alleged that a telecommunications carrier has improperly classified services as competitive,other than a case pertaining to section,shall be abated and the services the classification of which is at issue shall be deemed either competitive or noncompetitive as set forth in this section.any telecommunications carrier subject to an action or proceeding in which it is alleged that the telecommunications carrier has improperly classified services as competitive shall be deemed liable to refund,and shall refund,the sum of to that class or those classes of its customers that were alleged to have paid rates in excess of noncompetitive rates as the result of the alleged improper classification.
e any telecommunications carrier subject to an action or proceeding in which it is alleged that the telecommunications carrier has improperly classified services as competitive shall also pay the sum of to the digital divide elimination fund established pursuant to section of the eliminate the digital divide law,and shall further pay the sum of to the digital divide elimination infrastructure fund established pursuant to section of this act.
the effect of the foregoing legislation was to abate the commission case against illinois bell,render all illinois bell business services competitive within the meaning of the universal telephone service protection law without future review,require illinois bell to make million in refunds to the customers who would have been affected by the now abated commission proceedings against it,and obligate the company to deposit million into the digital divide elimination fund and an additional million into the digital divide elimination infrastructure fund.
after section took effect,the commission complied with the new law requirements and dismissed the proceedings it had initiated to challenge illinois bell reclassification of its small business services as competitive.shortly thereafter,a lawsuit was filed in the circuit court of sangamon county on behalf of a purported class of illinois bell small business customers,seeking to overturn section on the grounds that it constituted impermissible special legislation and denied the plaintiffs due process and equal protection rights in violation of the illinois constitution of.the circuit court denied plaintiffs motion for partial summary judgment,rejected plaintiffs request for class certification,and granted illinois bell motion to dismiss.plaintiffs did not appeal.
almost one year later,a similar action was filed in the circuit court of madison county.the plaintiffs in that action,which is the one before us today,are two illinois businesses that sought to represent a class of all illinois bell business customers who used between and telephone lines.as grounds for their complaint,the madison county plaintiffs alleged that they were harmed by enactment of section of the universal telephone service protection law because the regulatory proceedings abated by the new law would have enabled them to recover substantially larger refunds than the statute mandates.they further asserted that by declaring illinois bell services to be competitive,section will permit the company to collect excessive and noncompetitive rates from them in the future without review by the commission or the courts.
as amended,the madison county complaint contained six counts.counts i,iii and v each sought the same relief a declaration that section violates the special legislation,due process and equal protection provisions of the illinois constitution of and an order requiring the commission to reinstate the regulatory proceedings abated by section enactment the only difference between counts i,iii and v was the composition of the purported class on whose behalf the respective counts were asserted.count i dealt with the entire class of illinois bell business customers with between and telephone lines.counts iii and v each dealt with subsets of that class.count iii was brought on behalf of business customers with between and lines,while count v sought relief on behalf of business customers with between and lines.
counts ii,iv and vi paralleled counts i,iii and v,but sought alternative relief in the event plaintiffs constitutional challenges were rejected.specifically,they prayed for an accounting to determine how much of the statutorily mandated refunds should properly be paid to the class of business customers plaintiffs represented,and creation of an account to hold the refund money until the appropriate allocation is determined and the refunds are made.by order of the circuit court,these alternative counts were held in abeyance pending resolution of plaintiffs constitutional challenge.
because plaintiffs complaint challenged the constitutionality of a state statute,and because the state was not already a party to the proceedings,plaintiffs were required to notify the attorney general that they were raising the constitutional issue.a.the requisite notice was given.the attorney general did not elect to participate in the case and filed no petition to intervene.see c.
in august of,the circuit court ruled that this proceeding could be maintained as a class action.the following month,the court entered an order denying a motion filed by illinois bell to dismiss counts i,iii and v of plaintiffs complaint and granting partial summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs and against illinois bell on those three counts.in its order,the court declared section of the universal telephone service protection law invalid on the grounds that it violated the prohibition against special legislation set forth in article iv,section,of the illinois constitution of.const,art.iv,and denied the illinois constitution guarantees of due process and equal protection.const,art.i.because the court believed that section was severable from the remainder of the legislation enacted by public act,the court further ruled that its ruling did not affect the balance of the new law.the question of whether the court should order reinstatement of the administrative proceedings abated by section enactment was not reached.the court determination that the statute was invalid obviated the need to address the alternative relief requested in counts ii,iv and vi of plaintiffs complaint.
illinois bell promptly appealed the circuit court judgment.as noted at the outset of this opinion,because the judgment declared a statute of this state invalid,the appeal was taken directly to our court pursuant to supreme court rule a a.
before we reach the merits of illinois bell appeal,a threshold jurisdictional issue must be addressed.the record shows that illinois bell filed its notice of appeal before the circuit court had the opportunity to consider plaintiffs request that the commission be ordered to reinstate the proceedings abated by section.there is no indication that plaintiffs intended to abandon that request.it therefore appears to remain pending and unresolved.
the existence of that unresolved claim is problematic because to trigger direct review under rule a,it is not enough that the circuit court declared a statute invalid.the court must also have entered final judgment in the case.a final judgment is a determination by the court on the issues presented by the pleadings which ascertains and fixes absolutely and finally the rights of the parties in the lawsuit.a judgment is final if it determines the litigation on the merits so that,if affirmed,nothing remains for the trial court to do but to proceed with its execution.flores dugan.
the judgment here does not satisfy that test.the court order did not terminate the litigation.as just indicated,the question of whether the commission should be ordered to reinstate the abated administrative proceedings remains pending.resolution of that question involves substantive legal and factual issues beyond those attendant to plaintiffs claim for declaratory relief.if we were to affirm,the circuit court would therefore have more to do than simply undertake the administrative and ministerial responsibilities associated with execution of a judgment.
having said that,we also note that plaintiffs unresolved claim for affirmative relief against the commission has little,if any,practical significance.for reasons plaintiffs have not addressed,they did not name and have never attempted to make the commission a defendant in these proceedings,nor have they joined any agents,employees or anyone else in active concert or participation with the commission.as a result,no injunction or restraining order issued by the circuit court in this case would be binding on the commission.see ilcs west.any attempt to compel the commission to take particular action with respect to administrative proceedings involving illinois bell would have to come in a separate action.accordingly,the ultimate disposition of this particular case is unlikely to be any different even if we were to affirm.
under these circumstances,dismissing illinois bell appeal for failure to comply with rule a would serve no purpose other than to delay resolution of the pivotal issue in this case,namely,whether the circuit court erred in declaring section unconstitutional.our court has jurisdiction to permit direct appeals from other than final judgments,and where the order appealed from rests on a finding of a statute unconstitutionality,we have assumed jurisdiction under rule a,notwithstanding the finality requirement.desnick department of professional regulation.based on these considerations,we shall proceed with our review of this case.
because illinois bell appeal arises from an order granting summary judgment,our review is de novo.progressive universal insurance of illinois liberty mutual fire insurance.de novo review is also appropriate because the order from which the appeal is taken declared a statute unconstitutional.see arvia madigan.
in undertaking our review,we begin with the principle that all statutes are presumed to be constitutional.the party challenging the constitutionality of a statute has the burden of rebutting the presumption of validity and clearly establishing a constitutional violation.village of chatham county of sangamon.our court has a duty to uphold the constitutionality of a statute if it is reasonably possible to do so.village of lake villa stokovich.
on this appeal illinois bell first takes issue with the circuit court determination that section of the universal telephone service protection law violates the special legislation clause of the illinois constitution.that provision states 
the general assembly shall pass no special or local law when a general law is or can be made applicable.whether a general law is or can be made applicable shall be a matter for judicial determination.const,art.iv.
the meaning of this provision was recently taken up by our court in crusius illinois gaming board.we held in that case that the special legislation clause prohibits the general assembly from conferring a special benefit or privilege upon one person or group and excluding others that are similarly situated.while the legislature has broad discretion to make statutory classifications,the special legislation clause prevents it from making classifications that arbitrarily discriminate in favor of a select group.our inquiry into special legislation issues is therefore twofold.first,we must determine whether the statutory classification at issue discriminates in favor of a select group.if it does,we must then consider whether the classification is arbitrary.crusius,at.
in support of the circuit court judgment,plaintiffs argue here,as they did in the court below,that section can not pass special legislation scrutiny because illinois bell is the only entity to benefit from its provisions.this argument is without merit.it is true that illinois bell was the only telecommunications carrier involved in the type of commission proceedings mentioned in subsections a,d and e of the legislation ilcs a,d,e west at the time the legislation was enacted as well as being the only telecommunications carrier then subject to alternative regulation within the meaning of sections b and c of the statute ilcs b,c west.the mere fact that a law may affect only a single entity does not,however,render the law invalid under the special legislation clause.see,crusius,statute affecting single riverboat gambling licensee upheld against special legislation challenge chicago national league ball club,thompson,rejecting constitutional challenge to validity of statutes that applied only to wrigley field.likewise,laws will not be regarded as improper special legislation merely because they affect only one class of entities and not another.see kaufman,litwin feinstein edgar,d.to contravene article iv,section,of our constitution.const,art.iv,the statute must confer on a person,entity,or class of persons or entities a special benefit or exclusive privilege that is denied to others who are similarly situated.see in re marriage of blaisdell,d.
section terminated administrative proceedings pending against illinois bell and declared that certain of its services would be classified as competitive,enabling illinois bell to increase rates for those services.at the same time,however,the statute required the company to refund million to certain of its customers and to pay an additional million into digital divide elimination funds established by statute.whether this action can be construed as conferring a benefit or privilege on illinois bell is vigorously contested by the parties.we need not resolve that question,for even if illinois bell position improved as a result of the legislation,the advantages received by illinois bell were not denied to others who were similarly situated.they could not have been,for there were no other telecommunications carriers whose situation was similar to illinois bell.as we have just observed,illinois bell was the only telecommunications carrier involved in the type of commission proceedings mentioned in subsections a,d and e of the legislation ilcs a,d,e west at the time the legislation was enacted and was the only telecommunications carrier then subject to alternative regulation within the meaning of subsections b and c of the statute ilcs b,c west.
if any telecommunications carrier believed that section afforded illinois bell an advantage it was denied,there is no evidence of it in the record before us.plaintiffs arguments focus instead on the harm consumers would suffer under the new law.consumers,however,are not similarly situated to the telecommunications carriers from which they purchase services.accordingly,their harm is not relevant to the question of the law discriminatory effect.
by its terms,article iv,section,of our constitution.const,art.iv,only prohibits passage of a special law when a general law is or can be made applicable.where,as here,an entity is uniquely situated,nothing in article iv,section,or any other part of our constitution bars the general assembly from enacting a law tailored to address the conditions presented by that unique situation.see county of bureau thompson.because no other carrier was shown to be similarly situated to illinois bell,section can not be said to have discriminated in favor of a select group.
even if that were not the case and section did discriminate in favor of illinois bell,plaintiffs special legislation challenge could not succeed.the special legislation clause does not prohibit all classifications.as already discussed,it only forbids legislative classifications that are arbitrary.in re petition of the village of vernon hills.in determining whether a statute violates this standard,courts generally apply the same standards applicable to challenges brought under the equal protection clause of our constitution.const,art.i.where,as here,the statute under consideration does not affect a fundamental right or involve a suspect classification,we review it under the deferential rational basis test.under this test,the statute is constitutional if the classification it establishes is rationally related to a legitimate state interest.crusius,at.if any set of facts can be reasonably conceived that justify distinguishing the class to which the statute applies from the class to which the statute is inapplicable,then the general assembly may constitutionally classify persons and objects for the purpose of legislative regulation or control,and may enact laws applicable only to those persons or objects.in re petition of the village of vernon hills,at.
the universal telephone service protection law is premised on a recognition by the general assembly of the changing nature of the telecommunications industry ilcs e west and a legislative determination that 
consistent with the protection of consumers of telecommunications services and the furtherance of other public interest goals,competition in all telecommunications service markets should be pursued as a substitute for regulation in determining the variety,quality and price of telecommunications services and that the economic burdens of regulation should be reduced to the extent possible consistent with the furtherance of market competition and protection of the public interest.ilcs b west.
a fundamental problem in attaining these objectives is that the telephone industry in illinois has long been dominated by illinois bell.illinois bell owned much of the state telecommunications infrastructure and operated what was essentially a regulated monopoly of the telephone business.in this regard illinois
