recently,in fox tv stations fcc,the court addressed the national television ownership caps,remanding the national caps for justification by the federal communications commission and vacating the rule,at.in so doing,the court construed h of the telecommunications act of,stat.act,to carr y with it a presumption in favor of repealing or modifying the ownership rules,at.the local television ownership rule now on review allows common ownership of two television stations in the same local market if one of the stations is not among the four highest ranked stations in the market and eight independently owned,operational television stations remain in that market after the merger.see review of the commission regulations governing television broadcasting,report and order,fcc rel,local ownership order,on,fcc rel,reconsideration order codified at b.sinclair broadcasting group,sinclair challenges the local ownership rule on three principal grounds it contends that limiting common ownership of television stations in a local market to those with eight independent voices is arbitrary and capricious,failing to fully grandfather existing local marketing agreements violates g of the act,is impermissibly retroactive,and constitutes an unlawful taking of property in violation of the fifth amendment and the restrictions violate the first amendment.we hold that the commission has failed to demonstrate that its exclusion of media in the eight voices exception is not arbitrary and capricious.accordingly,we remand the local ownership rule to the commission for further consideration.
the duopoly rule prohibited common ownership or control of television stations with overlapping grade b signal contours.see b.when the rule was promulgated in,the television marketplace consisted only of television stations and a small number of cable systems whose primary purpose was to retransmit the signals of broadcast stations.in,the commission issued a notice of inquiry noi,launching an investigation into whether to relax restrictions on the television industry in view of changes in the video marketplace in the past years,as reflected in a staff working paper.see review of the policy implications of the changing video marketplace,notice of inquiry,fcc rel.we summarize the rulemaking background relevant to sinclair contention that the eight voices exception is arbitrary and capricious.
a year after issuing its noi,the commission issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to consider changes to several of the structural rules that governed the television industry.see review of the commission regulations governing television broadcasting,notice of proposed rulemaking,fcc rel.june.june,notice.the commission sought comments,with specific facts,data,and studies,on whether and how we might modify the contour overlap rule to afford broadcasters greater flexibility,yet avoid undue harm to our underlying competition and diversity concerns,and whether we should further modify our local ownership rules to permit common ownership of television stations with overlapping contours under certain limited circumstances.in regard to the latter,the commission sought comment on whether it should require that a minimum number of television stations remain in the market after mergers of existing stations.the commission observed that a minimum of six independently owned stations would provide outlet capacity for abc,nbc,cbs,fox,and two independents and permit mergers in of the top markets.
in,the commission issued a further notice of proposed rulemaking,proposing a new analytical framework for evaluating economic and diversity issues in view of developments that had altered the telecommunications landscape and changes in the local marketing agreements lmas rules for radio.see review of the commission regulations governing television broadcasting,further notice of proposed rule making,fcc rel,further notice.among other things,the commission sought guidance on the threshold number,if any,as would be necessary to ensure a minimum number of independent voices in a community.the commission observed that a standard,looking to the merger guidelines of the justice department and federal trade commission,might be too low as their purpose lay in defining the point at which heightened antitrust scrutiny is required,and not in encouraging a wide array of voices and viewpoints.the commission also sought comment on the extent to which television ownership rules should take into account the existence of other competing media.the commission noted the prospect of increased penetration in the video marketplace by cable,direct broadcast satellite dbs,and wireless cable,as well as the emergence of telephone video dialtone service,and the roles of radio and newspapers as sources of information and news.however,in view of evidence that several of these alternatives are subscription services and lack the public interest obligations of broadcast stations,the commission requested evidence on the extent to which sources can be considered for diversity purposes as substitutes for broadcast television.the commission stated its tentative beliefs that,although it saw no reason to include other electronic media,cable ought to be included as a substitute for television stations for diversity purposes if information was provided that would enable the commission to determine the extent to which cable should be counted.while acknowledging that the question was closer,the commission further explained it could not consider each radio station and each newspaper as being the equivalent of a broadcast television station because television is more immediate than newspapers,has public interest obligations not shared by newspapers,has more visual impact than either newspapers or radio,and is used by more people as their primary news source than are either radio or newspapers.the commission further stated,in regard to ownership caps,that guidelines may be necessary for counting lmas capturing more than of a station airtime,similar to the radio lmas rule,and sought information about the prevalence,purpose,and private and public benefits of lmas in the television market.the commission also sought comment on whether further relaxation of the cross ownership rule was needed.
then,on february,congress enacted the telecommunications act of,stat.act.focusing on the need to promote the policies and purposes of this act favoring diversity of media voices,vigorous economic competition,technological advancement,and promotion of the public interest,convenience,and necessity,act b,congress itself revamped the landscape for radio ownership and the national rules for television ownership while leaving the local rules for television to the commission.specifically,as to radio,the act eliminated the numerical limit on national ownership and relaxed common ownership restrictions in local radio markets,provided a specific minimum number of radio station voices remained,depending on the size of the market and provided no party owned,operated,or controlled more than of the stations in any market.see act a b see also implementation of sections a and b of the telecommunications act of broadcast radio ownership,order.march.as to television,the act eliminated the nationwide cap on common ownership and increased the national audience reach limit from to,allowing common ownership of television stations provided no single entity dominated more than percent of the national viewing audience.see act c fox tv stations,at.regarding local television ownership rules,congress directed the commission to conduct a rulemaking proceeding to determine whether to retain,modify,or eliminate its limitations on the number of television stations that a person or entity may own,operate,or control,or have a cognizable interest in,within the same television market.act c.as to the commission waiver policy of allowing a single entity to own a combination in the largest markets if independent voices remained,congress directed the commission to extend this policy to the largest markets.id.d.congress further directed the commission to conduct a biennial review of all ownership rules to determine whether any of such rules are necessary in the public interest as a result of competition.id.h.the act also addressed lmas,see id.g,which we discuss in part iv.
in october,the commission issued a second further notice of proposed rulemaking addressing the duopoly rule,the rule,and lmas.see review of the commission regulations governing television broadcasting,second further notice of proposed rule making,fcc adopted,rel,second further notice.the commission sought comment on its tentative conclusion that common ownership of television stations within a single market defined as nielsen designated market areas,or dmas should be permitted so long as their grade a signal contours narrower than grade b did not overlap.the commission reported that,in response to its proposal in the notice to permit common ownership within the same geographic community so long as six independently owned broadcast stations remained,the submitted comments suggested floors from seven to ten with nbc suggesting seven.on the question of substitutability of sources for broadcast,there was lack of unanimity among the parties as well as a lack of evidence,and the commission renewed its request for evidence on substitutability.at this point,the commission proposed to exclude other media from the count of minimum independent voices in a local market until we observe further marketplace developments,suggesting the possibility of further deregulation as part of its future biennial review.the commission also sought comment on whether existing lmas should be grandfathered if lmas were counted towards ownership caps.
in the local ownership order,the commission relaxed the duopoly rule by narrowing the geographic scope from a grade b contour approach to a dma test.see local ownership order.thus,common ownership of television stations is permitted without regard to contour overlap if the stations are in separate nielsen dmas.common ownership of stations in the same dma is permitted,provided their grade b contours do not overlap continuing the previous rule or,where there is grade b overlap,one of the stations is not among the four stations in the market based on audience share as measured by nielsen or any comparable professional,accepted rating service,at the time the application is filed and eight independently owned,and operational television stations commercial and noncommercial will remain the exception.based on its finding that b roadcast stations,particularly television stations,reach large audiences and are the primary source of news and entertainment programming for americans,and also because there remain unresolved questions about the extent to which television alternatives are widely accessible and provide meaningful substitutes to broad stations,the commission determined that the only medium to be counted for purposes of the exception is broadcast television,unlike the minimum voices exception in the rule,where certain local newspapers and cable television stations are counted.mergers will be presumed to be in the public interest if one of the stations in a proposed combination is a failed or failing station,or is not yet constructed.as to lmas,as proposed in the second further notice,lmas entered prior to november,will be grandfathered,conditioned on the outcome of the biennial review lmas entered on or after that date have two years to conform to the local ownership rule.in a separate order issued simultaneously with the local ownership order,the commission stated that television lmas will count towards the television ownership caps if the lma involves more than of a station air time.see review of the commission regulations governing attribution of broadcast and interests,report and order,fcc rel,attribution order,on,fcc rel.
taking into account geographically large dmas where viewers on the outskirts of a dma may not receive the signal of some broadcasters in the dma,the commission,in a reconsideration order of january,determined to count towards the eight voices only those stations whose grade b signal contour overlaps with the grade b contour of one of the stations in the proposed merger.reconsideration order.the commission otherwise generally affirmed the local ownership rule on reconsideration,rejecting the first amendment challenges to ownership restrictions presented in the initial rulemaking.id.
we address in part ii a threshold jurisdictional issue raised by the commission.concluding that we have jurisdiction to consider sinclair challenges to the local ownership order as well as the reconsideration order,we address in part iii sinclair contention that the commission acted arbitrarily and capriciously in promulgating the local ownership rule in part iv sinclair challenge to the commission regulation of television lmas and in part v sinclair first amendment contentions.
sinclair petition for review stated that it sought review of the report and order issued january,and attached a copy of the reconsideration order of that date,which sinclair denominated as the tv ownership order the petition did not mention the underlying local ownership order of august.in interstate commerce commission brotherhood of locomotive engineers,the supreme court held an agency reconsideration order is not a final order for purposes of judicial review.see,d.absent new evidence or changed circumstances presented to the agency upon reconsideration,the court lacks jurisdiction to hear a challenge to an agency order denying reconsideration of its earlier administrative ruling.see,southwestern bell telephone fcc,beehive telephone company,fcc,entravision holdings,llc fcc.sinclair maintains,however,that its intent to seek review of the local ownership order could be inferred from the statement of issues that it filed with its docketing statement as well as from its emergency motion for a stay.the commission disagrees.
the law in this circuit on when a petitioner failure to designate the correct order is fatal has evolved.on the one hand,the court has held,citing federal rule of appellate procedure a c,that unless an agency order is specified in the petition for review,the court lacks jurisdiction to review the order.thus,in city of benton nuclear regulatory comm n,it was irrelevant that a docketing statement named one of the correct agency orders and attached a copy of the unnamed order because the named order was merely a nonfinal interlocutory order and was issued while the final order was still pending.id.at.similarly,in john copanos and sons,fda,the court declined to infer an intent to appeal unnamed agency orders from the petitioner reference to a prior order even though they were part of the same administrative record.in small business in telecommunications fcc,the court likewise declined to infer an intent to appeal an order issued two years earlier that was not part of the same proceeding,stating that petitioner motion to amend the rulings under review,filed four months after the petition,implied that the unnamed ruling was merely an afterthought occurring several months down the road.id.at.the petitioner also had not argued that its intent to appeal the unnamed order could be fairly inferred from a reference in the statement of issues.see id.at.
in cases,on the other hand,looking to federal rule of appellate procedure c b,the court held in brookens white,per curiam,that a mistake in designating the judgment should not result in loss of the appeal as long as the intent to appeal from a specific judgment can be fairly inferred from the notice and the appellee is not misled by the mistake.id.at quoting moore ward,moore federal practice,ed.this approach was confirmed by the supreme court,which instructed in smith barry,d,that rule requirements are to be liberally construe d such that when papers are technically at variance with the letter of rule,a court may nonetheless find that the litigant has complied with the rule if the litigant action is the functional equivalent of what the rule requires.rule was amended in to provide that a n appeal must not be dismissed for informality of form or title of the notice of appeal,or for failure to name a party whose intent to appeal is otherwise clear from the notice.fed.c.
for purposes of the instant appeal,the distinction between administrative appeals under rule a c and civil appeals under rule c b all but evaporated when the court deemed a petition for review under rule to be analogous to a notice of appeal under rule.in southwestern bell,the court,upon noting that no party had suggested that a rule petition is not analogous to a notice of appeal under rule,proceeded to apply the brookens test in looking at contemporaneously filed documents to determine whether the intent to appeal an order unnamed in the petition for review could be fairly inferred.at n.other circuits had taken a similar approach in construing rule a.see gottesman ins,cir ins,cir see also shell oil fed.power comm n,cir.the court in southwestern bell found no mention of the unnamed order in either the docketing statement or the preliminary statement of issues.at.observing that the lack of prejudice is a necessary,not sufficient,condition for excusing a petitioner mistake in naming the order of which review is sought,the court denied the petition for review of an unreviewable order.id.at.if the unnamed agency order is not mentioned in any contemporaneously filed documents,the defect can not be cured because the agency has not received adequate notice.see id.at.similarly,in entravision holdings,at,the court held it lacked jurisdiction to review an agency order that was mentioned only in describing the reconsideration order,concluding that the clear import is that only the reconsideration order is under review.id.in contrast,where the unnamed underlying order was mentioned in a contemporaneously filed document,such as the docketing statement or certificate of rulings on review,or discussed in a timely stay motion,the court held that it had jurisdiction because the petitioner intent was fairly inferrable and thus the agency received adequate notice.see martin ferc.likewise,where the certificate of rulings being appealed identified an order not named in the petition for review,but the order was described in the petition for review in terms indicating that an appeal of the unnamed underlying order was intended,the court held it had jurisdiction to review the underlying order because the petitioner intent could be fairly inferred.see city of oconto falls ferc.
the commission,relying on entravision,small business in telecommunications,and southwestern bell,maintains that because sinclair contemporaneously filed documents,including its certificate of counsel,refer only to,and attach a copy of,the reconsideration order,sinclair boilerplate arbitrary and capricious issue in its statement of issues was insufficient to give fair notice of its intent to appeal more than the reconsideration order.there is some merit to the commission position.sinclair is a large,sophisticated company represented by experienced counsel who could be expected to name in the petition for review the order or orders sinclair seeks to appeal,in accordance with the appellate rules of procedure.nevertheless,consistent with instruction from the supreme court with regard to rule and this court gloss onto rule a c of rule c harmless error standard,the court is required to look beyond the petition for review.thus,for example,in schoenbohm fcc,the court concluded that the petitioner statement of reasons expressly list ing each of his challenges to the underlying order sufficed to raise the substantive merits of the underlying agency order.id.at.similarly,in independent petroleum ass of america babbitt,and damsky fcc,the court concluded that the petitioners statements of issues provided clear indication to the agency of petitioners intent to appeal the underlying agency order that was not named in the petition for review.babbitt,at damsky,at.
sinclair statement of the issues can not be cast aside as readily as the commission suggests.as the commission would have it,sinclair arbitrary and capricious issue is simply a boilerplate claim raised in every agency case and is unlike both the statement of issues in schoenbohm that could have referred only to the underlying order and not the reconsideration order,and the notice of appeal in damsky that referred to the underlying order.the distinctions are not so fine as the commission suggests.sinclair statement of issues named the new local television ownership regulations as the source of each of its issues,three involving challenges under the constitution and a fourth issue stating that the commission acted arbitrarily,capriciously,and otherwise contrary to law in imposing the new local television ownership regulations on broadcasters.boilerplate or not,the fourth issue,fairly read,can only refer to the local ownership order of august,and thus gave notice to a reasonably intelligent person that sinclair intended to make a substantive challenge to the underlying local ownership order and not only to the reconsideration order.sinclair statement of issues,which was filed with its docketing statement,was filed days after the petition for review,in accordance with the order of the clerk of this court.by contrast,sinclair reliance on its motion for a stay,which was filed days after the petition for review,can hardly be considered a contemporaneous filing.see small business in telecommunications,at.moreover,as in schoenbohm and damsky,the commission does not claim it was prejudiced or misled,see schoenbohm,at damsky,at,and we find neither for the commission addressed both orders in its brief.oconto falls,at martin,at.
accordingly,because sinclair intent to appeal the local ownership order can be fairly inferred from its contemporaneously filed statement of issues,the court has jurisdiction to consider sinclair challenges to both orders.
sinclair challenge to the local ownership rule as arbitrary and capricious focuses primarily on the exception,contending that it lacks any rational foundation or connection to the amorphous goal of diversity.in its view,the commission plucked the number eight out of thin air and arbitrarily defined voices to exclude media that were included in the rule.sinclair contends that there is no longer any threat that diversity of programming sources,much less diversity of viewpoints,will be diminished if the commission does not limit ownership of television stations in local markets,and,consequently,the commission has failed to show the local ownership rule is necessary in the public interest.sinclair observes that the commission acknowledged both that the video marketplace has changed substantially since when it first promulgated the duopoly rule,and that a theory exists that common ownership can lead to better and more varied programming.
in reviewing a contention that an agency rule is arbitrary and capricious,the court generally examines whether the commission has considered the relevant factors and has provided a reasoned explanation for its action that does not run counter to the evidence before it.motor vehicle mfrs.ass state farm mut.auto.ins,d see also fcc.where issues involve elusive and not easily defined areas such as programming diversity in broadcasting,fcc national citizens committee for broadcasting,d nccb,our review is considerably more deferential,according broad leeway to the commission determinations.see fcc.our review here is necessarily informed,however,by congress instruction in h of the act that,in addition to reviewing its ownership rule biennially to determine whether any of such rules are necessary in the public interest as a result of competition,t he commission shall repeal or modify any regulation it determines to be no longer in the public interest.act h.this sentence appears as the last sentence of congress instruction that the commission review each of its ownership rules every two years which the court characterized as designed to continue the process of deregulation.fox tv stations,at.the court in fox tv stations concluded that s ection h carries with it a presumption in favor of repealing or modifying the ownership rules,id.at,thus limiting the commission authority only to retain a rule necessary in the public interest.act h.so understood,we first look to the commission explanation of the local ownership rule in the local ownership order and reconsideration order and then turn to sinclair challenges to the exception.
in the local ownership order,the commission focused on ensuring a sufficient number of independently owned outlets to maximize the available independent viewpoints in a given local market.it took as a basic tenet of national communications policy that the widest possible dissemination of information from diverse and antagonistic sources is essential to the welfare of the public in diversity quoting turner broad,fcc,d.that outcome,the commission explained,is,in its judgment,significantly less likely with greater concentration of media ownership.in concluding that continued local ownership restrictions were required in the public interest,the commission noted that in metro broadcasting,fcc,d,overruled on other grounds adarand constructors,pena,d,the supreme court upheld the commission judgment that there is a positive correlation between a station ownership and its editorial viewpoint.the commission noted further that in nccb,at.at,the court held that the commission had acted rationally,despite the inconclusiveness of the rulemaking record,in finding that diversification of ownership would enhance the possibility of achieving greater diversity of viewpoint.observing also that ownership carries with it the power to select,to edit,and to choose the methods,manner and emphasis of presentation,local ownership order quoting metro broadcasting,at.at,the commission found that broadcast television station owners provide essential services,including local and national news,election results,weather advisories,access for candidates,children educational programming,and other public interest programming.both independent stations and the networks local affiliates,the commission found,air programming,primarily local news and sports.therefore,the commission concluded,reiterating its goal from,the greater the diversity of ownership in a particular area,the less chance there is that a single person or group can have an inordinate effect,in political,editorial,or similar programming sense,on public opinion at the regional level.as to the need to ensure economic competition,the commission reasoned that c ompetition is likely to be greater in markets where many separate firms vie to serve the customer than in markets where few firms serve the market.but for our conclusion in part iii c,infra,the commission adequately explained how the local ownership rule furthers diversity at the local level and is necessary in the public interest under h of the act.
the commission determined,in view of changes in the video marketplace since,that because there may be some intermedia substitutability in the markets served by broadcasters,this justifies some relaxation of our local television ownership rules,as it suggests that consumers and advertisers may have more viable alternatives to broadcast stations than they once had.because of the high degree of consolidation in the broadcast industry since the passage of the act,with a resultant downward trend in the number of station owners in each market,and in recognition of the economic benefits of common ownership,the commission confronted what it described as an exercise in line drawing between allowing broadcasters to realize economic efficiencies and service benefits,and ensuring diversity and competition.the commission found that broadcast television is the primary source of news and information for most americans,local ownership order,and concluded that only a limited degree of relaxation of local ownership restrictions was warranted in view of unresolved issues about the extent to which alternatives provide meaningful substitutes to broadcast stations and are widely accessible.first,the commission found that the total number of television and radio stations had increased by more than since,while consumer choice had been increased by the introduction of dbs,cable,home satellite dishes,open video systems,the internet,and the less well known sources,wireless cable mmds and single building cable smatv systems.but,second,the commission observed that many sources are still establishing themselves in the marketplace and generally do not provide an independent source of local news and informational programming.third,the commission reported that,despite repeated requests for evidence regarding the degree to which cable,dbs,home satellite dishes,open video systems,the internet and other alternative media serve as economic substitutes for broadcast television,it had received no evidence quantifying intermedia substitutability and was aware of no definitive empirical studies.
sinclair does not contest that,in fact,this was the state of the record before the commission.rather,as the commission suggests in its brief,sinclair is focusing on a changed television market,with highly diverse programming,that in its view ownership restrictions can not help achieve,while the commission has focused largely on viewpoint diversity.see,local ownership order br.of respondent at.the latter addresses station owners bringing unique points of view to the selection of material they air the former addresses the number of different types of programs on the air,regardless of whether they reflect differing editorial viewpoints.the commission concludes in its brief on appeal that,consequently,sinclair contention that the commission failed to present substantial evidence that ownership diversity will lead to programming diversity is beside the point.in any event,sinclair overstates the burden on the commission.in nccb,the supreme court stated that 
as the court of appeals observed,d iversity and its effects are elusive concepts,not easily defined let alone measured without making qualitative judgments objectionable on both policy and first amendment grounds.national citizens committee for broadcasting,at,at.moreover,evidence of specific abuses by common owners is difficult to compile the possible benefits of competition do not lend themselves to detailed forecast.fcc rca communications.in these circumstances,the commission was entitled to rely on its judgment,based on experience,that it is unrealistic to expect true diversity from a commonly owned combination.nccb,at.at.
sinclair reliance on lamprecht fcc,is misplaced,for the expectation that a particular type of person,women,will select particular types of programming is not the same as the expectation that a variety of owners will present a variety of editorial viewpoints.to the extent sinclair maintains that consideration of competition is beyond the proper purview of the commission,it is simply wrong.see nccb,at.at.insofar as sinclair relies on the commission findings that the media market has changed since and that consolidated ownership may result in diversity of programming,sinclair fails to acknowledge that the scarcity rationale adopted by the supreme court in national broadcasting united states.broad.red lion broadcasting fcc,d,is both at issue in television broadcasting and binding on this court.see fox tv stations,at.in fcc league of women voters,d,the supreme court stated we are not prepared to reconsider our longstanding scarcity rationale without some signal from congress or the commission that technological developments have advanced so far that some revision of the system of broadcast regulation may be required.absent such signals,the court has refused to abandon the scarcity rationale.see turner,at.at.
our review of sinclair challenges to the exception proceeds in recognition that the commission has wide discretion to determine where to draw administrative lines,and,therefore,the court will reverse that choice only for abuse of discretion.see at.thus,the court is generally unwilling to review performed by the commission unless a petitioner can demonstrate that the lines drawn are patently unreasonable,having no relationship to the underlying regulatory problem.cassell fcc,quoting home box office,fcc.choosing the number eight and defining voices are quintessentially matters of line drawing invoking the commission expertise in projecting market results.the commission,observing that it has historically used tests as a means of promoting diversity,concluded,upon taking into account current marketplace conditions,that the standard strikes what we believe to be an appropriate balance between permitting stations to take advantage of the efficiencies of television duopolies while at the same time ensuring a robust level of diversity.
we leave for another day any conclusion regarding the commission choice of eight.there is an obvious interrelatedness between the commission choice of eight and its definition of voices.succinctly put,sinclair contends that the commission has not provided any justification for counting fewer types of voices in the local ownership rule than it counted in its rule on of radio and television stations.we agree,for notwithstanding the substantial deference to be accorded to the commission line drawing,the commission can not escape the requirements that its action not run counter to the evidence before it and that it provide a reasoned explanation for its action.motor vehicle,at.at.thus,even were we to reject sinclair assertion that the number eight was plucked out of thin air,in view of the rulemaking record,our resolution of sinclair challenge to the commission definition of voices requires that the rule be remanded to the commission.on remand the commission conceivably may determine to adjust not only the definition of voices but also the numerical limit.
the commission included a provision in both the rule and the local television ownership rule.for the rule,the commission included as voices not only broadcast television and radio stations but also independently owned daily newspapers with circulation exceeding five percent of households in the dma,and cable systems providing generally available service to television households in the dma,provided all cable systems,within the dma are counted as one single voice.local ownership order.the commission found that t he public continues to rely on both radio and television for news and information,suggesting the two media both contribute to the marketplace of ideas and compete in the same diversity market.the commission also found,in addressing market shares,that radio and television serve as substitutes at least to some degree for diversity purposes.further,the commission concluded that newspapers and cable systems are an important source of news and information on issues of local concern and compete with radio and television,at least to some extent,as advertising outlets.id.regarding cable systems,the commission acknowledged that public,educational,and governmental channels present local informational and public affairs programming to the public,such as city council meetings.
by contrast,in the local ownership rule the commission excluded all media sources except broadcast television in defining voices.it gave two reasons for doing so.first,the commission stated that its decision to exclude media from its definition of voices was based on its finding that broadcast television remains the primary source of news and information for most americans.id.to support its finding,the commission pointed to a study,america watching,public attitudes toward television,by roper starch worldwide,based on interviews conducted in march.that study compared television generally to newspapers and radio,and then addressed broadcast television programming other than news.the roper study also compared broadcast and cable television as sources of entertainment,finding that of americans watched a program on a broadcast network or local station during a period,and that the four major networks were the type of television that of families with children under age watched,compared to cable and premium cable and the type of television americans make a special effort to watch of the time,compared to for basic cable and for premium cable.at no point,however,did the roper study compare broadcast to television as sources of news,much less as sources of local news.rather,the roper study simply indicated that nearly of adults get most of their news from twice the number that list newspapers as their main source of news and five times the number that list radio.
although the roper study did not differentiate between broadcast and cable television as sources of news,the commission repeatedly points to the study as support for its finding on the primacy of broadcast television in news.this is true when the commission states that the viewpoint a station uses in presenting the news can have a substantial impact on a local election and when it states that broadcast television,more so than any other media,continues to have a special,pervasive impact in our society given its role as the preeminent source of news and entertainment.local ownership order.likewise on reconsideration,in reaffirming that only broadcast tv stations are the primary source of news and other information,the commission points to its original order,which in turn relies on the roper study.see reconsideration order.
the rulemaking record does not fill the evidentiary gap.comments submitted to the commission suggested that the commission report reprinted in the federal communications law journal stated that more than of the public say they depend upon broadcast television for most of their local news,when,in fact,the journal article statement includes neither the word broadcast nor the word local.see bartlett,the soul of a news machine electronic journalism in the century,fed.comm.the commission conclusion that the top stations in each market generally have a local newscast,whereas lower ranked stations often do not have significant local news programming,given the costs involved,offers no further insight on the critical question.indeed,the commission cable competition report,stating that more than half of all viewing hours in cable households during the season were of broadcast signals leaves open the possibility of considerable programming.
the second reason the commission gave for limiting voices to broadcast television involved the unresolved questions about the extent to which alternatives are widely accessible and provide meaningful substitutes to broadcast stations.local ownership order.in the further notice,the commission proposed to include cable systems as well as broadcast,acknowledging that their low market penetration at the time may rapidly change,and sought comments on which suppliers should be included.see further notice.the commission concluded that,in the absence of definitive empirical studies quantif ying the extent to which the various media are substitutable in local markets,the unresolved questions on substitutability precluded further relaxation of local ownership restrictions.the commission explained that t his is a critical issue,for many of the arguments for greater relaxation or elimination of our ownership rules are premised on the assumption that consumers and advertisers have the option of turning to a large number of media.this approach,however,can not be squared with its statutory mandate to repeal or modify any rule that is not necessary in the public interest.fox tv stations,at.
the deficiency of the commission explanation is underscored by the explanation it failed to give for defining voices differently in the and local ownership rules.both rules address monopolization of an industry in view of the limited number of broadcast licenses available in spectrum.the rule addresses the problem of saturation of a community by a single editorial voice through numerous media outlets,allowing ownership of two television stations and a varying number of radio stations depending on the remaining number of independently owned media voices in the market.the commission based its decision to relax the cross ownership restrictions in recognition of the growth in the number and types of media outlets,the clustering of cable systems in major population centers,the efficiencies inherent in joint ownership and operation of both television and radio stations in the same market,as well as the public service benefits that can be obtained from joint operation.local ownership order.it viewed the voice test components of the revised rule to ensure that the local market remains sufficiently diverse and competitive.id.having found for purposes of that counting other media voices more accurately reflects the actual level of diversity and competition in the market,id,the commission never explains why such diversity and competition should not also be reflected in its definition of voices for the local ownership rule.on reconsideration the commission reiterated its earlier reasons for excluding other media from voices in the local ownership rule.see reconsideration order.to the extent the commission stated that o ther video programming distributors,such as cable and dbs,typically do not serve as independent sources of local information as most of any local programming they provide is originated by a broadcast station,it ignores the implications of its findings about cable systems in the rule.
at oral argument,the commission suggested that even assuming complete substitutability of cable news for broadcast news still would leave the of the viewing public that lacks cable dependent on television broadcast news alone,and their sources of diversity would be diminished if media were counted towards the eight voices test.as indicated in the commission third annual report to congress on cable competition,no.cs released january,and the cable competition report,cable,satellite,and other media sources generally are not as widely available as free television broadcasting to viewers.other data pointed to the digital divide,wherein low income persons and minorities do not have access to the newer technologies.in addition,only broadcast stations have public interest obligations.yet these considerations did not deter the commission from including other media in defining voices for the purpose of,and it is not readily apparent why they would do so in defining voices for the purpose of local ownership.
accordingly,we hold that the commission has failed to demonstrate that its exclusion of media from the eight voices exception is necessary in the public interest under h of the act.
challenging the lma grandfathering provisions of the local ownership rule,see local ownership order,sinclair contends that the commission decision to allow only limited grandfathering for lmas is contrary to g of the act,constitutes retroactive rulemaking,and is an unconstitutional taking of property.none of these contentions has merit.
the question of whether the commission had ignored the plain directive of congress,as sinclair contends,is ripe for review.contrary to the position of the commission,sinclair presents a purely legal question that will not benefit from consideration in a more concrete form.see abbott laboratories gardner,d,overruled on other grounds by califano sanders,d fox tv stations,at see also chevron,natural res.def.council,d.
the local ownership rule provides that lmas in effect prior to november,will be grandfathered until the biennial review,a period of approximately five years,when their status will be reviewed on a basis to assess the appropriateness of extending the lma,based on public interest factors,digital tv conversion,marketplace conditions,and equities.see local ownership order.sinclair contends that this is a blatant violation of section g.we disagree.

nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the origination,continuation,or renewal of any television local marketing agreement that is in compliance with the regulations of the commission.
the statute says nothing about grandfathering.hence,the only question is whether the commission interpretation of the statute is reasonable.see chevron,at.at.sinclair reliance on legislative history is to no avail.the senate and house conference reports state that grandfathering was to cover lmas currently in existence upon enactment of this legislation,february.see conf.at conf.at.in view of the express acknowledgment in g that lmas were subject to the commission continuing regulatory authority,the commission could reasonably conclude that congress did not intend permanently to bar the commission from regulating existing lmas.
sinclair contention that the lma grandfathering provision constitutes impermissibly retroactive rulemaking also fails.the local ownership order alters the future effect,not the past legal consequences of lmas.see celtronix telemetry,fcc.the rule does not either alter the past legality of lmas or impose any liability for having engaged in lmas that now constitute an impermissible duopoly or introduce any retrospective duties for past conduct.see directv,fcc,buckeye cablevision,fcc.at most the local ownership order is secondarily retroactive in upsetting expectations at the time the lmas were entered into.see bowen georgetown university hospital,d scalia,concurring.in this regard,the only question is whether the commission action was reasonable.see bergerco canada.because the commission grandfathering decision was consistent with the act and fulfills the public interest in diversity,sinclair fails to demonstrate that the commission decision is unreasonable and not a permissible change of policy notwithstanding that it may upset some expectations.moreover,the commission left open the possibility of further extensions on a case by case basis as part of its biennial review of the local ownership order in.
as to post november lmas,the local ownership order is consistent with the act,and the commission gave notice in the second further notice,that television lmas entered into on or after the adoption date of this notice would be entered into at the risk of the contracting parties hence,sinclair could have no reasonable expectation that post november lmas would remain unaffected.sinclair does not suggest that the lma provisions in the local ownership order were not a logical outgrowth of the commission proposal.see,arizona pub.service epa,see also black media coalition fcc.cir spartan radiocasting fcc,cir.
sinclair fifth amendment takings contention fails too.although the commission contends that this contention is not properly before the court because it was first raised in the petition for reconsideration,its reliance on cellular fcc,is misplaced.sinclair did not seek in its petition for reconsideration to submit new evidence to the commission that the commission declined to receive,as occurred in cellular.rather,sinclair raised a legal argument in its petition that the commission had an opportunity to address on reconsideration.likewise,the commission contention that sinclair claim is not ripe with respect to lmas entered before november is unpersuasive for the same reasons we noted in rejecting the commission contention that sinclair statutory challenge was unripe.see supra part iii 
on the merits,however,the commission brief is persuasive.first,sinclair takings contention appears,the commission suggests,to be challenging the commission decision to consider lmas attributable ownership interests and thereby subject them to the local ownership order.the attribution decision was reached in the attribution order,which is not before the court.see attribution order.second,sinclair fails to show that the grandfathering provision of the local ownership order reaches a certain magnitude as to deprive an owner of the use of property.see.coal mahon.sinclair has neither provided information about the economic impact on its business of lma termination,nor provided a basis on which to determine that there will be significant interference with its expectations.see penn cent.transp.city of new york,d.sinclair consolidated comments to the commission simply recount sinclair growth and anticipated growth,showing its use of lmas in some instances,only to conclude summarily that full grandfathering to encompass the full length of the lmas including contract term,renewals and assignments permitted by the contract is necessary to avoid considerable economic harm to the broadcast television industry.somewhat more helpfully,sinclair states in its brief that each lma without stating how many there are has a contract term of five years w
