plaintiffs,michigan bell telephone company,ameritech michigan and verizon north,incorporated collectively plaintiffs,appeal the district court order denying their request for a preliminary injunction of of the michigan telecommunications act of mta.mta abolished a fee imposed upon customers known as the end user common line charge eucl.defendants,john engler,governor of the state of michigan,and david svanda,robert nelson and john strand,commissioners of the michigan public service commission mpsc,the district court order enjoining another provision of the mta,which froze regulated telephone rates at their may,level until december,except for services the mpsc deemed competitive.the provisions of the mta at issue applied only to telephone service providers with more than the plaintiffs.
for the following reasons,we affirm the district court order preliminarily enjoining mta,and reverse the district court denial of the plaintiffs motion for enjoinment of mta.
facts and procedural background 
plaintiffs each provide local telephone service to over customers in the state of michigan.together,the plaintiffs supply over of the local telephone service in the state.other companies account for the remainder of local telephone service,but none of them has more than subscribers.
the plaintiffs charge their michigan customers a monthly fee for local exchange service.this service includes a certain number of local telephone calls which originate and terminate within a defined calling area.the plaintiffs also offer local toll service,which covers calls not defined as either local or long distance.the plaintiffs charge customers on a basis for local toll calls.
the plaintiffs also charge their customers other fees,two of which are the interstate end user common line charge presently and the intrastate end user common line charge.verizon imposes an intrastate eucl monthly charge of,and ameritech imposes a monthly intrastate eucl charge.further,prior to the enactment of mta,the plaintiffs could impose,or increase at any time,the intrastate eucl charge without prior approval of the mpsc,or a hearing before that body.the only limitation on the intrastate eucl charge is that it must remain below the interstate eucl rate set by the federal communications commission fcc.
on july,act of the public acts of the state of michigan for was signed by governor john engler,and took immediate effect.act amended the mta to ensure that every person has access to just,reasonable,and affordable basic residential telecommunication service,and to allow and encourage competition in providing telecommunication services.comp.laws a,b.as stated previously,two provisions of act are at issue herein and abolishes the intrastate eucl and,freezes telephone rates for service providers with more than subscribers until december,unless a provider services are deemed competitive by the mpsc in various circumstances.
in the proceedings before the district court,the plaintiffs argued,inter alia,that mta and violate the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.the plaintiffs assert that these provisions are facially unconstitutional because they do not provide a mechanism through which telephone service providers may ensure that they receive a just and reasonable rate of return on their investment.as noted above,the district court denied the plaintiffs motion for preliminary injunction with respect to mta,and granted it with respect to.on september,the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of the district court order and simultaneously moved this court for an emergency injunction of mta.on september,chief judge martin granted the plaintiffs emergency motion.
severability 
as an initial matter,the court must determine whether mta,the rate freeze provision,may be severed from which abolishes the eucl.the plaintiffs argue that the two provisions may not be severed,and,therefore,the district court should have enjoined both statutory provisions.michigan severability statute provides 
if any portion of an act or the application thereof to any person or circumstances shall be found to be invalid by a court,such invalidity shall not affect the remaining portions or applications of the act which can be given effect without the invalid portion or application,provided such remaining portions are not determined by the court to be inoperable,and to this end acts are declared to be severable.
comp.laws.the michigan supreme court explained the operation of an identical provision in another statute as follows 
relying on the act severability clause,defendants maintain that the legislature expressly intended to preserve as much of the act as possible.this clause provides.if any portion of this act or the application of this act to any person or circumstance is found to be invalid by a court,the invalidity shall not affect the remaining portions or applications of this act which can be given effect without the invalid portion or application,if the remaining portions are not determined by the court to be inoperable.the doctrine of severability holds that statutes should be interpreted to sustain their constitutionality when it is possible to do so.whenever a reviewing court may sustain an enactment by proper construction,it will uphold the parts which are separable from the repugnant provisions.to be capable of separate enforcement,the valid portion of the statute must be independent of the invalid sections,forming a complete act within itself.after separation of the valid parts of the enactment,the law enforced must be reasonable in view of the act as originally drafted.one test applied is whether the body would have passed the statute had it been aware that portions therein would be declared to be invalid and,consequently,excised from the act.
pletz austin,footnotes omitted.the plaintiffs contend that the michigan legislature coupled the eucl abolishment with the rate freeze to give subscribers rate relief,and thus,severing one from the other will defeat the purpose of enacting two provisions.contrary to the plaintiffs position,enjoinment of mta does not render the remainder of the statute inoperable.severance will give the statute its intended relief in the form of eucl to a lesser extent.telephone service providers must still apply for a rate increase,and the relevant authorities may treat such applications with the intention of protecting consumers from excessive rates.accordingly,the plaintiffs argument lacks merit,and mta may be enjoined with no affect on.
standard of review 
the court reviews the grant or denial of a preliminary injunction for an abuse of discretion.accordingly,this court will not disturb a district court findings of fact unless clearly erroneous,but reviews a district court legal conclusions de novo.see southwest williamson county slater,cir citing sandison michigan high sch.athletic ass n,cir.
a district court must consider four factors in determining whether to issue a preliminary injunction.the district court must consider whether the movant has a strong likelihood of success on the merits whether the movant would otherwise suffer irreparable injury whether issuance of a preliminary injunction would cause substantial harm to others and whether the public interest would be served by issuance of a preliminary injunction.slater,at quoting mcpherson michigan high sch.athletic ass n,cir.the four considerations applicable to preliminary injunction decisions are factors to be balanced,not prerequisites that must be met.six clinics holding,ii cafcomp systems,cir citing washington reno,cir.no single factor will be determinative as to the appropriateness of equitable relief,and the district court weighing and balancing of the equities is overruled only in the rarest of cases.id.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.finally,t he purpose of a preliminary injunction is merely to preserve the relative positions of the parties until a trial on the merits can be held.id.
constitutionality of challenged provisions 
likelihood of success on the merits 
by enacting act,the state of michigan sought to control intrastate telephone rates charged by ameritech michigan and verizon.courts have long held that state imposed regulatory price controls are constitutional within certain limits.pursuant to the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the united states constitution,p rice control is unconstitutional if arbitrary,discriminatory,or demonstrably irrelevant to the policy the legislature is free to adopt in re permian basin area rate cases,d quoting nebbia people of state of new york.emphasis in original.rates enacted by the state must be just and reasonable.see id.at citing federal power commission natural gas pipeline.rates which enable a company to operate successfully,to maintain its financial integrity,to attract capital,and to compensate its investors for the risk assumed certainly can not be condemned as invalid federal power commission hope natural gas.see also calfarm insurance deukmejian,cal d,the just compensation safeguarded to the utility by the fourteenth amendment is a reasonable rate of return on the value of the property used at the time that it is being used for the public service.therefore,the constitution protects utilities from being limited to a charge for their property serving the public which is so unjust as to be confiscatory.duquesne light barasch,d citing covington l turnpike road sandford.federal power commission natural gas pipeline.federal power commission texaco,d see also oklahoma natural gas russell.holding that the plaintiff utility company deserved a remedy for confiscatory rates prendergast new york telephone.same pacific telephone telegraph kuykendall.same banton belt line railway.same.
the due process clause requires a mechanism through which a regulated utility may challenge the imposition of rates which may be confiscatory.see calfarm,supra guaranty ins.gates,cir state farm mut.auto.ins.new jersey.the question,then,is whether the mta adequately safeguards against confiscatory rates,and therefore,ensures a constitutional rate of return.
mta,prohibits any rate increase for every telecommunication service offered to subscribers for more than three years,between may,and december,with two exceptions rate relief may be obtained where,pursuant to mta,a service provider serves fewer than subscribers and where services are determined to be competitive pursuant to mta.the first is inapplicable to the plaintiffs herein,and the second is constitutionally inadequate.
the competitive provision contained in mta,on its face,fails in four respects.first,it does not address the reasonableness of currently regulated rates.second,the mere possibility that regulated rates may become competitive does not reduce or eliminate the possibility that such rates are confiscatory.next,the provision fails to provide for timely relief from confiscatory rates finally,although the plaintiffs have other unregulated income streams,they are not required to subsidize their regulated services with income from rates either deemed to be competitive,or with revenues generated from unregulated services.see railroad commission.calfarm,at.therefore,under mta if the plaintiffs rates became competitive in michigan area code,but were not competitive in the area code and thus remained frozen,they can not be forced to subsidize the frozen rates with revenue from the competitive rates,or from other unregulated service which they offer.in sum,mta does not include any provisions which adequately safeguard against imposition of confiscatory rates.
although mta does not contain adequate safeguards,other provisions of the mta arguably attempt to ensure the plaintiffs receive a constitutional rate of return.mta provides that the rates for basic local exchange service shall be just and reasonable,it defines reasonable rate,or just and reasonable rate,as a rate that is not inadequate,excessive,or unreasonably discriminatory.a rate is inadequate if it is less than the total service long run incremental cost of providing the service tslric.see id.y.the plaintiffs argue that the statutory definition of a just and reasonable rate contained in mta does not pass constitutional muster.the court agrees.the definition contained in mta clearly does not guarantee a constitutionally adequate rate of return for regulated telephone service providers because it merely permits telephone service providers to cover costs,and does not ensure a fair and reasonable rate of return on investment.see in re permian basin,supra.
moreover,the ninth circuit in guaranty national insurance gates,addressed the constitutionality of a nevada insurance statute similar to mta in its definition of an inadequate rate.section of the nevada revised statutes stated,r ates are inadequate if they are clearly insufficient,together with the income from investments attributable to them,to sustain projected losses and expenses in the class of business of which they apply.id.at.the nevada statute essentially preserved insurance companies ability to recoup the costs of their services.the ninth circuit held that although the nevada statute guaranteed that insurers would break even it does not guarantee the constitutionally required fair and reasonable return.id.citing federal power comm hope natural gas.t he fixing of just and reasonable rates,involves a balancing of the investor and consumer interests t he investor interest has a legitimate concern with the financial integrity of the company whose rates are being regulated.from the investor or company point of view,it is important that there be enough revenue not only for operating expenses but also for the capital costs of the business.these include the service of the debt and the dividends on the stock.pursuant to the reasoning set forth in guaranty national,supra,the mta definition of a just and reasonable rate does not guarantee the fair and reasonable rate of return 
furthermore,the definition of an inadequate rate which the district court relied upon does not ensure that telephone service providers receive a constitutionally fair and reasonable rate of return.the michigan legislature has defined tslric as follows 
total service long run incremental costs means,given current service demand,including associated costs of every component necessary to provide the service,of the following 
i the total cost of a telecommunication service,relevant group of service,or basic network component,using current least cost technology that would be required if the provider had never offered the service.
ii the total cost that the provider would incur if the provider were to initially offer the service,group of service,or basic network component.
comp.laws ff.on its face,ff sets the tslric at a level which only accounts for the cost of providing services.under the definition set forth in mta,a rate would only be inadequate if it was set below the cost incurred by the service provider.this clearly does not satisfy the constitutional standard set forth above because it merely ensures cost recovery without guaranteeing a fair and reasonable rate of return on investment.see guaranty national,supra,at.in sum,mta does not define a just and reasonable rate in a manner which guarantees plaintiffs an adequate rate of return on their investment.
the district court also erroneously determined that mta provides adequate safeguards against confiscatory rates.mta states 
in reviewing a rate alteration under subsection,the mpsc shall consider only one or more of the following factors if relevant to the rate alteration as specified by the provider 
a total service long run incremental cost of basic local exchange services.
b comparison of the proposed rate to the rates charged by other providers in this state for the same service.
c whether a new function,feature,or capability is being offered as a component of basic local exchange service.
d whether there has been an increase in the costs to provide basic local exchange service in the geographic area of the proposed rate.
e whether the provider further investment in the network infrastructure of the geographic area of the proposed rate is economically justifiable without the proposed rate.
comp.laws.the district court determined that the last two factors adequately protected plaintiffs right to an adeq
