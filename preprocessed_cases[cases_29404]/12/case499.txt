the city of anacortes the city appeals the district court determination that the city denial of an application by usa,to erect a monopole antenna at a particular location violates a provision of the telecommunications act of,c b.the district court found that proposal was the least intrusive means to close a significant gap in its wireless service in the city,and that the city denial was not supported by substantial evidence.we determine that,although the district court did not have the benefit of our opinion in sprint telephony pcs,county of san diego,cir en banc sprint ii,and therefore failed to recognize that the city denial of the application was supported by substantial evidence,the district court nevertheless properly concluded that the city denial of the application violated c b because the city failed to rebut showing that the denial of the application amounted to an effective prohibition of wireless services.
offers digital wireless voice,messaging and data services.it provides its services through a cellular radio telephone network which is comprised of thousands of cell antenna sites,switching facilities and other network elements.the federal government assigns radio frequency rf channels to each wireless carrier and the rf channels are assigned to the cell sites to enable wireless communications.the district court noted t he limited number of rf channels must be reused at different cell sites,creating potential interference between sites.to minimize such interference,all sites transmit at very low power,resulting in limited coverage from each site.the location of antenna sites is determined by terrain,structure blockage,call volume,and antenna height.
in september,in order to close a service gap and to expand its coverage in the city,applied for a permit to construct an additional wireless telecommunications facility wcf at a particular site h avenue,which is owned by the united methodist church sometimes referred to as the church site.the permit application analyzed eighteen site alternatives and proposed the construction of a monopole with three antennas at the top.
the anacortes municipal code amc regulates the permitting approval process.application was for a special use permit sup the amc also provides that installation of a tower or antenna without a permit is a misdemeanor.
the city planning commission eventually denied the application,and appealed to the city council.the city council held a hearing on the matter and following the meeting,voted to deny the application.on september,the city council entered written findings of fact and conclusions of law denying the application.
on the basis of the testimony of witnesses and other evidence before the city planning commission and city council,the city written findings and conclusions explained that 
the proposed wireless communications facility would have a commercial appearance and would detract from the residential character and appearance of the surrounding neighborhood.the proposed wireless communications facility would not be compatible with the character and appearance of the existing development in the vicinity of h avenue,which is predominantly residences.the proposed wireless communications facility would negatively impact the views from residences in the vicinity of the proposed site.
the city further stated that the predominant land use in the vicinity of the proposed site was residential and that the existing vegetation would not completely screen the proposed tower and the tower would be taller than the existing trees.
the city also concluded that has not established that its proposal to locate a wireless communications facility tower at the h avenue site is the least intrusive on the values that the denial of the application seeks to serve.it determined 
at least four alternative single sites are potentially acceptable to provide coverage as required by,and at least two alternatives would work from an rf coverage perspective.these alternative sites are either on commercially or industrially zoned property,or would provide a site for a proposed wireless communications facility that is not in such close proximity to residences.also offers an service technology that provides another alternative for cellular telephone service.if constructed a wireless communications facility at one or more of the alternate single sites or alternatives,a significant gap in service coverage would no longer exist,even though that coverage would not be identical to that provided by a tower at the h avenue site.
on october,filed a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief in the district court for the western district of washington,alleging violations of sections and of the telecommunications act tca,and c b.the parties filed for summary judgment,and at a hearing held on april,agreed that no material facts were in dispute that might prevent the court from ruling on the respective motions.
on may,the district court granted summary judgment on its claim that the amc,as it related to wireless communications facility,was preempted by.the district court based its ruling on the ninth circuit opinion in sprint telephony pcs,county of san diego,cir sprinti the district court ordered the city to issue a permit allowing to construct the monopole.it also noted that in light of its resolution of the preemption issue,it did not need to address the parties arguments concerning c.
shortly after the district court order,we agreed to rehear sprint i en banc.the city then asked the district court to reconsider its order and to grant a stay of enforcement pending the resolution of the en banc proceedings in sprint opposed the city requests and also asked the district court to rule on its claims under.
on july,the district court denied the city requests for relief and ruled in favor of on its request for relief under.the district court held 
has shown that its proposal was the least intrusive means to close the significant gap,based on its effort to identify alternatives.the city conclusion to the contrary was not supported by substantial evidence.because the city prevented from closing a significant service gap through the least intrusive means available,the city decision has the effect of prohibiting wireless service in violation of section c.
on september,we issued our en banc opinion in sprint ii.the en banc panel disagreed with sprint i and with the court prior opinion in city of auburn qwest,cir,and joined the eighth circuit in holding that a plaintiff suing a municipality under section a must show actual or effective prohibition,rather than the mere possibility of prohibition.at quoting level commc ns,city of louis,cir.
the parties then stipulated that sprint ii was controlling as to claim under,and agreed that the portion of the appeal concerning could be remanded to the district court to allow to withdraw its claim under.we issued an order effectuating the parties stipulation.thus,only the district court grant of relief to pursuant to remains pending before us.
resolution of this appeal requires some appreciation of the purposes behind the telecommunications act of.no,stat,codified as amend in scattered sections of,tabs,and our efforts to discern and effectuate those purposes.when enacting the tca,congress expressed two sometimes contradictory purposes.first,it expressed its intent to promote competition and reduce regulation in order to secure lower prices and higher quality services for american telecommunications consumers and encourage the rapid deployment of new telecommunications technologies.stat.at.in sprint ii,we noted that congress chose to end the states longstanding practice of granting and maintaining local exchange monopolies and that it did so by enacting at internal punctuation and citations omitted.
second,congress was determined to preserve the authority of state and local governments over zoning and land use matters except in the limited circumstances set forth in the conference agreement.sprint ii,at internal punctuation and citations omitted.this legislative purpose was reflected in the enactment of c section c a preserves the authority of local governments over zoning decisions regarding the placement and construction of wireless service facilities,subject to enumerated limitations in c b.one such limitation is that local regulations shall not prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services.sprint ii,at.
in metropcs,city of san francisco,cir,we considered the requirement in c that a local zoning decision be supported by substantial evidence.id.at discussing c b iii.we noted that although the term substantial evidence was not defined in the tca,there appeared to be universal agreement among the circuits as to the substantive content of this requirement this language is meant to trigger the traditional standard used for judicial review of agency decisions.id.at internal citation omitted.furthermore,the substantial evidence inquiry does not require incorporation of the substantive federal standards imposed by the tca,but instead requires a determination whether the zoning decision at issue is supported by substantial evidence in the context of applicable state and local law.id.at.in other words,we must take applicable state and local regulations as we find them and evaluate the city decision evidentiary support or lack thereof relative to those regulations.if the decision fails that test it,of course,is invalid even before the application of the tca federal standards.id.at.we commented that this approach enables us to avoid unnecessarily reaching the federal questions of whether a zoning decision violates the substantive provisions of the tca,and noted that in most cases,only when a locality applies the regulation to a particular permit application and reaches a it supports with substantial a court determine whether the tca has been violated.id.
sprint ii concerned a facial challenge to a local zoning ordinance under of the tca.at.the en banc court generally agreed with the standards set forth in metropcs,and in doing so moved away from the more procedural standard we had endorsed in sprint i and auburn it overruled auburn and joined the eighth circuit in holding that a plaintiff suing a municipality under section a must show actual or effective prohibition,rather than the mere possibility of prohibition.sprint ii,at quoting level commc ns,at.
the en banc court noted that its approach to was buttressed by our interpretation of c.id.it explained that in metropcs,to construe c b i ii,we focused on the actual effects of the city ordinance,not on what effects the ordinance might possibly allow.id.the en banc court concluded 
our holding today therefore harmonizes our interpretations of the identical relevant text in a and c b i ii.under both,a plaintiff must establish either an outright prohibition or an effective prohibition on the provision of telecommunications services a plaintiff showing that a locality could potentially prohibit the provision of telecommunications services is insufficient.
id.at footnote omitted emphasis added.
although sprint ii concerned a facial challenge to a local ordinance pursuant to,its statements as to what a plaintiff service provider had to show provide guidance for our resolution of this challenge to the city denial of a permit pursuant to.for instance,we noted 
a certain level of discretion is involved in evaluating any application for a zoning permit.it is certainly true that a zoning board could exercise its discretion to effectively prohibit the provision of wireless services,but it is equally true and more likely that a zoning board would exercise its discretion only to balance the competing goals of an provision of wireless services and other valid public goals such as safety and aesthetics.
at.we also noted that the plaintiff had not identified a single requirement that effectively prohibits it from providing wireless services,commenting that o n the face of the ordinance,requiring a certain amount of camouflage,modest setbacks,and maintenance of the facility are reasonable and responsible conditions for the construction of wireless facilities,not an effective prohibition.id.
with the benefit of our en banc opinion in sprint ii,we review the district court order holding that the city denial of the permit violates c.we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.metropcs,at.moreover,as suggested in metropcs,we first consider whether the city denial under the amc is supported by substantial evidence.id.at.determining that the denial is supported by substantial evidence under the applicable local laws,we then consider whether the denial violates c.we conclude that because the city failed to adequately rebut prima facie showing that no other location was available and feasible,the district court properly found that the denial of the permit constituted an effective prohibition of coverage.
a.the city denial of the application was supported by substantial evidence.
the amc provides that when considering a special use permit,the city may consider a number of factors including the height of the proposed tower,the proximity of the tower to residential structures,the nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties,the surrounding topography,and the surrounding tree coverage and foliage we,and other courts,have held that these are legitimate concerns for a locality.sprint ii,at stating that the zoning board may consider other valid public goals such as safety and aesthetics see also,llc unified gov t of wyandotte county,cir noting that aesthetics can be a valid ground for local zoning decisions cellular.town of oyster bay,cir recognizing that aesthetic concerns can be a valid basis for zoning decisions voice stream pcs i,llc city of hillsboro,d,
there was substantial evidence concerning these factors.a number of residents claimed that the monopole would have a detrimental impact on the surrounding residential property,that the pole would not be completely screened,and that it would interfere with residents views of the cascade mountains and other scenic views.this evidence is more than a scintilla of evidence,and accordingly the district court should have deferred to the city determination that the evidence was adequate to support its denial of the application under the amc.see metropcs,at stating that this court may not overturn the board decision on substantial evidence grounds if that decision is authorized by applicable local regulations and supported by a reasonable amount of evidence.
b.the city did not rebut showing that the denial of the application constituted an effective prohibition of services.
under the least intrusive means standard,the provider has the burden of showing the lack of available and technologically feasible alternatives.
in metropcs,we recognized that a locality could violate the tca effective prohibition clause if it prevented a wireless provider from closing a significant gap in service coverage.at.such a claim generally involves a analysis requiring the showing of a significant gap in service coverage and some inquiry into the feasibility of alternative facilities or site locations.id.here,the city concedes that there is a significant gap in services in anacortes once the provider has demonstrated the requisite gap,the issue becomes what showing a provider must make in support of its proposed means of closing the gap.id.at.
in metropcs,we adopted the least intrusive means standard used by the second and third circuit.at citing apt pittsburgh,penn,cir omnipoint commc ns,zoning hearing bd.of easttown,cir nextel west unity,cir and sprint spectrum willoth,cir.this standard requires that the provider show that the manner in which it proposes to fill the significant gap in services is the least intrusive on the values that the denial sought to serve.metropcs,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.we noted that this standard 
allows for a meaningful comparison of alternative sites before the siting application process is needlessly repeated.it also gives providers an incentive to choose the least intrusive site in their first siting applications,and it promises to ultimately identify the best solution for the community,not merely the last one remaining after a series of application denials.
id.at.our opinion in metropcs concluded by instructing the district court to apply the least intrusive means standard in its consideration of the prohibition issue on remand.id.
here,cognizant of the least intrusive means standard,submitted a detailed permit application that included an analysis of eighteen alternative sites.the city nonetheless denied the permit,concluding that the church site was not the least intrusive means of closing the gap.
where,as here,there is more than a scintilla of evidence to support a locality disapproval of a particular site for a wcf,a court determination of whether the denial violates the tca turns on an evaluation of the availability and technological feasibility of the alternatives.we read metropcs and sprint ii as holding that the provider has the burden of showing the lack of available and technologically feasible alternatives see sprint ii,at metropcs,at.
the city failed to rebut showing of a lack of available and feasible alternative sites.
in determining whether met its burden of demonstrating that the church site was the least intrusive means,we examine the city stated ground for concluding otherwise.the city findings and conclusions stated 
at least four alternative single sites are potentially acceptable to provide coverage as required by,and at least two alternatives would work from an rf coverage perspective.these alternative sites are either on commercially or industrially zoned property,or would provide a site for proposed wireless communications facility that is not in such close proximity to residences.also offers an service technology that provides another alternative for cellular telephone service.if constructed a wireless communications facility at one or more of the alternate single sites or alternatives,a significant gap in service coverage would no longer exist,even though that coverage would not be identical to that provided by a tower at the h avenue site.
initially,we agree with the district court that service technology is not relevant to a determination of the least intrusive means.this service is not a global system for mobile communications gsm,must be separately purchased by individual customers,requires a broadband internet connection,and only works within the homes of subscribing customers.accordingly,the availability of has no effect on the significant gap in cell phone coverage of anacortes,which it offers in competition with other cell phone service providers.
we next consider the adequacy and technological feasibility of the six alternatives advanced by the city.the city consultant noted four single antenna alternatives anacortes middle school,anacortes police headquarters,washington national guard building,and island view elementary school.however,the consultant noted that these alternatives are all lower in ground elevation,would require at least the same antenna height and would have somewhat lower signal levels in the resident areas that are at the northern and western portions of coverage area of interest.the consultant also found two combinations that could work from an rf coverage perspective a combination of the city water tank at the end of st with either the whitney elementary school st m ave or the guemes island communications tower.he noted that use of the guemes island communications tower would have the advantage of improving coverage along oakes avenue and the san juan islands ferry docking.however,he also commented that a solution may not be feasible because it would require two sites be constructed instead of one,which would raise both the impact of the wcf on the community as well as the construction and operational costs that would have to bear.the consultant concluded that has chosen the best possible location to improve the radio coverage of their pcs gsm network and that few,if any,viable alternative locations exist for in vicinity of their proposed location.
did not rest on the consultant equivocal report,but presented the city with evidence showing that most,if not all,of the possible alternative sites were not available.told the planning commission that the police chief had said that an antenna adjacent to the police headquarters would never be approved due to the proximity to the hospital across the street and the flight patterns of emergency helicopters,and because a tall antenna would meet with great resistence due to the views from the west looking east and the lack of trees in the area to screen a taller pole.also asserts that because the national guard site is next to the police station,these concerns preclude the placement of an antenna there.
moreover,it is questionable whether any public school site was available.first choice for the location of a wcf was anacortes high school.it entered into negotiations with the school district,but the school district declined its proposal.the city argues,however,that during the application process,the school district indicated that it would consider allowing facility at the high school,and that improperly declined to pursue this option asserting that it came too late in the process.responds that because the school district had multiple grounds for declining its initial offer,further negotiations with the school district were not likely to be fruitful.
finally,asserts that the combinations are not feasible because there is no evidence on the record indicating that would have access to or be approved to use the guemes island site.it further asserts that guemes island is within the jurisdiction of skagit county,and the city has no jurisdiction to determine whether a facility there would be permitted.
the issue then is whether the city claim that school sites and guemes island are available is sufficient to allow it to decline proposal.we approach this issue by applying the standard set forth in sprint ii.we must determine whether has shown an effective prohibition on the provision of telecommunications services,or only that the denial of its application could potentially prohibit the provision of telecommunications services.sprint ii,at.furthermore,the determination should be made in a manner that allows for a meaningful comparison of alternative sites before the siting application is needlessly repeated,and gives providers an incentive to choose the least intrusive site in their first siting applications.metropcs,at.
as we have previously indicated,the provider has the burden of showing that the denial of its proposal will effectively prohibit the provision of services.sprint ii,at.a provider makes a prima facie showing of effective prohibition by submitting a comprehensive application,which includes consideration of alternatives,showing that the proposed wcf is the least intrusive means of filing a significant gap.a locality is not compelled to accept the provider representations.however,when a locality rejects a prima facie showing,it must show that there are some potentially available and technologically feasible alternatives.the provider should then have an opportunity to dispute the availability and feasibility of the alternatives favored by the locality.
here,the city has failed to show that there are any available alternatives.the possibility of locating a wcf at the high school or any other public school in anacortes is too speculative to be considered a viable alternative.in declining to entertain proposal to locate the wcf at the high school,the school district cited three reasons upsetting our neighbors,allowing total access to our high school site,and committing the property to this particular long term project.it is by no means clear that an increase in compensation by would overcome any of these concerns.in light of the opposition to the church site,and experience in other localities no school site appeared to be sufficiently available to support the denial of church site application in favor of forcing to pursue a new application with the school district in order to close the significant gap in its coverage.
the alternative of the combination of the city water tank and the guemes island communication tower presents a closer question.the city offered to allow access to the water t
