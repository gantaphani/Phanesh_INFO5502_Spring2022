in the order on review,the federal communications commission affirmed orders by the bureau of wireless telecommunications granting a waiver of for two years to permit aircell,and cellular licensees that had entered into resale agreements with aircell to provide airborne cellular telephone service.see aircell,rcd,wl.petitioners wireless services,bell south cellular,sbc wireless,and cellco partnership seek review of the commission order on three principal grounds first,they contend that the commission violated its rules as well as the licensing scheme of the communications act by granting a waiver that modifies the licenses of existing licensees,and by failing to require aircell to apply for a license to provide a new nationwide radio communications service.second,they contend that the waiver was arbitrary and capricious insofar as it eviscerates the rule,contravenes commission precedent,and violates commission policy to proceed by rulemaking when changing rules affecting a broad segment of industry.third,they contend that the commission failed to provide a reasoned explanation for its conclusion that harmful interference was not likely to result from the aircell system.we grant the petitions in part,remanding the case to the commission for further explanation of one aspect of its waiver decision otherwise we deny the petitions.
section of the commission rules provides,in pertinent part 
cellular telephones installed in or carried aboard airplanes,balloons or any other type of aircraft must not be operated while such aircraft are airborne not touching the ground.when any aircraft leaves the ground,all cellular telephones on board that aircraft must be turned off.
under,the commission has authority to waive its rules if good cause therefor is shown.id.
aircell,began developing and testing a cellular system installed on general aviation aircraft under a special temporary authority from the commission in.two years later,the commission office of engineering technology authorized aircell to operate as an experimental radio station,providing service on a secondary basis.pursuant to d i and ii,stations with secondary status s hall not cause harmful interference to stations of primary services to which frequencies are already assigned or may be assigned at later date,and c annot claim protection from harmful interference from such primary stations.
the aircell system consists of specially engineered handsets,ground stations,and smart aircraft antennae designed to provide airborne cellular communications without creating harmful interference for other cellular networks.aircell ground stations are in rural areas at the cell sites of participating cellular licensees,and customer traffic from the airborne mobile units is interconnected with the public switched network through the switches of aircell participating licensees.in addition to hardware and software modifications designed to provide cellular communications at relatively low power levels,the aircell system seeks to minimize the potential for harmful interference through the use of horizontal polarization,specially shaped antenna patterns,control channels,and frequency coordination with cellular providers.the aircell system was tested by aircell and petitioners on july and,using four sites in texas and oklahoma,and again by petitioners on september,in florida.
on october,aircell filed a petition requesting that the commission waive,among other things,of its rules to permit commercial deployment of aircell service.ten months later,aircell and a number of cellular licensees entering into resale agreements with aircell filed an amended petition to join the waiver request,thereby establishing that the participating licensees had agreed to modifications of their existing cellular licenses to authorize this secondary use of their licensed spectrum.the bureau of wireless telecommunications bureau conditionally granted the waiver requests on december.determining that the aircell system potential for interference should be evaluated according to its performance under normal operating conditions,the bureau found that the record fully supports the conclusion that because of the lower power,special antennas,and other features unique to the aircell mobile unit,the risk of harmful interference that use of an ordinary cellular telephone in an airborne aircraft poses has been satisfactorily addressed.consequently,in the bureau view,the harm that is intended to prevent will most likely not occur,and special circumstances justified a waiver of the general rule.the bureau concluded a waiver was also warranted because the public safety benefits to aircraft that will accrue from the use of the aircell system serve the public interest.further,the bureau observed,aircell voice and data link promotes competition by providing small aircraft and general aviation consumers an alternative to existing services.
the bureau imposed nine special conditions on the waiver,including the requirement that cellular service to airborne terminals be a secondary service,and that participating licensees provide at least thirty days prior notice of service or testing to licensees with transmitter sites within kilometers of their ground stations.the bureau conditions further stipulated that participating licensees had a duty to provide information promptly on request of the commission regarding any complaint of interference,and an obligation to resolve any instance of harmful interference,which was defined as serious degradation,obstruction,or repeated interruption of cellular service.
on three occasions,the bureau conditionally granted waivers for additional licensees.in so doing,the bureau rejected the opposing carriers arguments that,among other things,aircell had taken over obligations of the participating licensees and failed to provide proper advance notice to opposing carriers.on reconsideration the bureau also clarified several waiver conditions and reduced the notification distance from to kilometers,noting that during the tests the airborne received signal was not strong enough to interfere with terrestrial cellular communications,except when the aircell power control system was deliberately disabled for testing purposes.
the commission largely affirmed the bureau orders granting conditional waivers and reset the term of the waivers to begin on june,the effective date of its order.the commission agree d with the bureau technical assessment of the aircell system,including its judgment that there is little risk the system will cause harmful interference to carriers,as well as its evaluation of the system potential benefit for general aviation.aircell,rcd.at.based primarily on the design characteristics of the aircell system and the results of the first day of the field tests on july and,the commission concluded that aircell had carried its burden of affirmatively showing that its system is not likely to cause harmful interference to terrestrial cellular operations.the commission noted that for the july,test,
aircell chose a worst case scenario for site location,the tests were conducted in a rural area where there was no urban noise to mask the aircell signal,and in a manner such that the aircell airborne mobile unit was close to the victim site and far from the aircell partner site.with this configuration,the aircell mobile has to emit its highest power level in order to reach its partner site.even under this configuration,the data from the first day of testing show that there is little likelihood of harmful interference.
id.at.the commission rejected as unpersuasive the evidence presented by the opposing carriers and rejected the opposing carriers remaining arguments that,for example,the aircell system violated their exclusive channel block assignments under a,and that their licenses were improperly modified by the aircell order.by relegating the aircell system to secondary status in the cellular band and requiring advance notification to help ensure that all primary cellular service is protected from harmful interference throughout the waiver term,the bureau had,in the commission view,provided nonparticipating licensees with adequate,indeed redundant,interference protection.id.at.at the same time,the commission disclaimed any reliance on a probability study submitted by aircell.the commission added several other technical operating conditions to ensure that the aircell system will in fact operate within the technical parameters on which the bureau decision was based.id.at.
petitioners raise a variety of objections to the commission order.we address in part a whether the commission violated its rules and the licensing scheme of the communications act by allowing aircell to provide a new nationwide radio communications service without a license.in part b,we address whether the waiver grant was arbitrary and capricious.in part c,we address whether the commission failed to provide a rational explanation for its conclusion that harmful interference was not likely to result from the aircell system.
under our standard of review,the court must uphold the commission order unless it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or contrary to law.a.see also greater boston television fcc.
contending that the commission effectively granted the license application that aircell could not file consistent with commission rules,petitioners maintain that the commission also effectively modified all cellular carriers licenses nationwide without complying with section of the communications act.there is no merit to these contentions.
the two relevant rules relate to geographic exclusivity and protection from interference.the first,a,provides each channel block is assigned exclusively to one licensee for use in that licensee cellular geographic service area cgsa see.the second,d,provides in relevant part within the cgsa determined in accordance with this section,cellular systems are entitled to protection from and channel interference and from capture of subscriber traffic by adjacent systems on the same channel block.the commission interpretations of its rules regarding the rights of cellular licensees,including the right to channel block exclusivity and freedom from interference or signal capture within a given cgsa,are entitled to substantial deference.see thomas jefferson shalala,d trinity broad.of florida,fcc.the court therefore will accept that these rules proscribe only harmful interference within a given carrier cgsa,which we address in part ii c,infra.absent harmful interference,aircell new system does not trammel upon petitioners rights as licensees.see amsc subsidiary fcc.put otherwise,the waiver does not mean that the licensees participating with aircell may provide airborne cellular service in a manner that would conflict with the regulatory protections afforded to nonparticipating carriers under their existing licenses.the commission emphasized the importance of aircell secondary status and advance notification to nonparticipating carriers so that they can steer aircell away from use of particular channels.as the commission explained,with the grant of the waivers nothing changed insofar as the protections to which existing licensees are entitled.
there is likewise no merit to petitioners contention that aircell was required to be licensed.see,supp.so long as the licensees in partnership with aircell maintain actual control over the transmission equipment used in aircell system and continue to abide by their own regulatory obligations,the court has no basis for the commission description of aircell as a reseller.contrary to petitioners contention,the commission expressly rejected the claim that an unauthorized transfer of control of the licensees operations to aircell had occurred.the commission stated that i n the case of a nationwide network such as aircell is attempting to build,the aircell partners,while remaining responsible for complying with commission requirements may reasonably and prudently assign a single entity the task of being a central contact point for system management and termination purposes.aircell,rcd.at.
nor did the commission contravene its precedent in characterizing aircell relationship to its participating carriers as a resale.see resale and shared use,docket,report and order,wl,wl,aff sub nom.fcc,cir,cert.denied,d.as the bureau explained in rejecting the argument that aircell is a service provider seeking status with nonparticipating cellular licensees,aircell holds no cellular license of its own,but instead purchases capacity to support the aircell service from participating cellular licensees pursuant to resale agreements.aircell partners have agreed to modifications of their licenses to permit this secondary use of their licensed spectrum.an analogous situation existed with regard to the credit card facilitator of railroad cellular service in gte airfone,gte railfone,and gte mobilnet,rcd,wl.
for these reasons,the court affirms the commission determination that the only legal obstacle to the launch of aircell system was the bar in.
petitioners challenges to the commission waiver of as arbitrary and capricious are also meritless.
in wait radio fcc,the court explained that the agency discretion to proceed in difficult areas through general rules is intimately linked to the existence of a safety valve procedure for consideration of an application for exemption based on special circumstances.id.at.waiver is thus appropriate when particular facts would make strict compliance inconsistent with the public interest.northeast cellular.fcc.given the commission findings about the unique capability of the aircell system to provide low power cellular service and its contributions to the public interest,petitioners challenge to the commission decision to act by waiver rather than by rulemaking is unpersuasive.
the commission concern has been with the serious risk of harmful interference to terrestrial systems from the greatly enhanced transmitting range of ordinary cellular telephones used aboard airborne aircraft.see airborne use of cellular telephones,rcd,wl.aircell represented to the commission that most conventional cellular systems are optimized for vertical wave polarization as a result,horizontally polarized signals used by the aircell system are less prone to capture by terrestrial receiving antennas.the commission noted that smart antennae mounted on aircraft are designed to transmit specially shaped patterns that reduce the risk of interference.because the commission reasonably interpreted as being intended to protect against only harmful interference from airborne cellular telephone use,petitioners contention that the waiver eviscerates the purpose of necessarily fails.busse broad.fcc.the commission could reasonably conclude that when combined with the use of nonstandard control channels and frequency coordination with nonparticipating licensees,the collective effect of aircell technological design serves to minimize the risk that its operations will degrade the signals of other cellular service providers,thereby addressing the concerns underlying the rule.
in identifying the public interest,see keller communications,fcc,the commission found few viable alternatives that may provide voice communications between pilots and emergency personnel,and can be used to uplink,and air traffic information as well as potentially provide monitoring of airframe and engine operations,serving to better inform ground personnel of aircraft operations.aircell,rcd.at.the commission determination is owed considerable deference.see metro.council of naacp branches fcc,health and med.policy research group fcc.the record before the bureau included supportive statements by the national transportation safety board,the federal aviation administration faa,and the national association of state aviation officials.although the faa did not certify the aircell system as dedicated public safety equipment,the commission observed that the faa noted several public benefits that could be derived from the system,and that on balance,in view of the protections for primary cellular service,these benefits justified granting the waiver.the commission conclusion that the waiver will offer significant public safety benefits is thus amply supported by the record.
