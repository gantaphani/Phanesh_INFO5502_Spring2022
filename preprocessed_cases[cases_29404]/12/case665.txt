this appeal requires us,as a matter of first impression in this circuit,to answer two questions pertaining to of the telecommunications act of what is the preemptive scope of and who may seek enforcement of the provisions of because we disagree with the district court interpretation and application of,and also,in part,because amendments were made to relevant state laws after the district court rendered judgment,we affirm the district court judgment in part,reverse in part,and remand to the district court for further proceedings.
background 
in the preamble to the telecommunications act of the act,congress announced that it was passing a n act to promote competition and reduce regulation in order to secure lower prices and higher quality services for american telecommunications consumers and encourage the rapid deployment of new telecommunications technologies.stat.at.the provisions of the act were intended to supplement and amend the statutory framework established in the communications act of,et,and the end result has been described as a fundamental restructur ing of the local telephone markets.iowa utils,d.the city of coral springs and the town of palm beach collectively,the cities perceived that the act mandated changes in the way they regulated telecommunications services providers in response,coral springs passed ordinance and palm beach passed ordinance,both of which purported to restructure the cities franchising and licensing of telecommunications service providers use of the public in accordance with the new federal law.the cities ordinances were similar in many respects,but they adopted different approaches to several significant issues.
bellsouth was the incumbent local telephone service provider in both of the cities at the time the act,and subsequently when the ordinances,were passed.bellsouth first brought suit in federal district court against coral springs,seeking a declaratory judgment that ordinance was preempted both by florida state law and by of the act.coral springs filed a counterclaim for breach of contract in which it sought to enforce an ordinance passed in that gave it the option to purchase bellsouth facilities.bellsouth moved for summary judgment on its preemption claims and on coral springs counterclaim,and coral springs moved for summary judgment on bellsouth preemption claim.the district court upheld some sections of the ordinance,but found that others were preempted by state or federal law,or both.the district court also granted bellsouth summary judgment on coral springs counterclaim.
after filing suit against coral springs,but before that case was resolved,bellsouth filed a similar suit against palm beach,seeking a declaratory judgment that its ordinance was preempted.palm beach filed a counterclaim seeking compensation under the terms of the ordinance.both parties moved for summary judgment,and the district court,employing the same analysis it had utilized in its order in the coral springs case,upheld parts of the ordinance while striking down others on a mixture of federal and state preemption grounds.in its motion for summary judgment in this case,bellsouth had argued that if a substantial portion of the ordinance were preempted,the entire ordinance should fall.the district court,however,found that the preempted sections were severable,and allowed the sections of the ordinance to stand.because one of the sections of the ordinance that the district court struck down was that governing compensation for use of the,the district court sua sponte granted bellsouth summary judgment on palm beach counterclaim.
the cities appealed,challenging the district court findings of preemption and dismissal of their counterclaims.bellsouth,claiming that the district court erred in upholding sections of the ordinances,or,in the alternative,that the preempted sections were not severable,and,therefore,the ordinances should have been struck down in their entirety.
ii.discussion 
we apply the same legal standards in our preemption analysis that the district court was required to apply in its order granting summary judgment therefore,we review the district court decision de novo.lewis brunswick,cir.because federal preemption of a state or local law is premised on the supremacy clause of the united states constitution,see bosarge united states dep t of,cir,and because of the longstanding principle that federal courts should avoid reaching constitutional questions if there are other grounds upon which a case can be decided,santamorena.military,cir,we first decide whether the ordinances are preempted by florida state law before considering whether they are federally preempted by the act.further,because each city has included a severability clause in its ordinance stating it is the city intention that the remainder of the ordinance remain in effect if part of the ordinance is invalidated,we must address each relevant section of each ordinance in turn,reserving judgment on the preemption of the ordinances as a whole until both the state and federal preemption analyses have been completed.
preemption by florida state law 
under florida statutes,the florida public service commission fpsc has jurisdiction over the regulation of telecommunications companies within the state.local governments are preempted from regulating telecommunications companies except to the extent provided in,which is the provision of state law that historically has governed municipalities power to regulate and tax telecommunications companies use of the public.our analysis of in this case is complicated somewhat by the fact that the statute has been amended twice since these lawsuits were filed,and future amendments are scheduled.when these lawsuits were initiated in august and april,the text of had stood unaltered since.in may,however,was substantially amended.see.laws ch.the district court duly took the amendments to into account when deciding the preemption question in its orders,which issued in january and september of.after the district court had entered its final judgment in both cases,the florida legislature amended again with the passage of the communications services tax simplification law simplification law.laws ch.in order to understand the changes envisioned in the simplification law,we must begin with an assessment of the law that predated it.
under the version of as amended in,it was clear that municipalities were prohibited from exercising their authority to manage the public in such a way as to exert regulatory control over matters that fell under the exclusive jurisdiction of the fpsc or the federal communications commission fcc.stat.supp.municipalities could,however,require telecommunications companies to pay fees of up to one percent of the gross receipts on recurring local service revenues for services provided within the corporate limits of the municipality as consideration for the right to occupy the public.id.at.municipalities also had the power to enter into agreements with telecommunications companies requiring them to pay fees based on the number of miles of cable laid in the public,as well as certain other fees as compensation for the direct,physical use of the and the administrative costs of regulating the.id.at.
the impetus for the simplification law appears to have been,in large part,the need to bring florida law into compliance with the telecommunications act of.to this end,the simplification law mapped out a complicated schedule of amendments to the florida statutes,including transitional amendments to,which took effect on january.laws ch.stat.supp.the transitional version of severely curtails municipal authority over telecommunications companies by prohibiting municipalities from requiring telecommunications companies to enter into a license,franchise,or other agreement as a condition of using the public,id.at a,and by requiring that any municipal regulations pertaining to telecommunications companies use of the public must be related to the placement or maintenance of facilities in such roads or,must be reasonable and nondiscriminatory,and may include only those matters necessary to manage the roads or,id.at b.
the other significant feature of the transitional version of,and the feature that indicates why a transitional provision is necessary,is the requirement that each municipality make an election that will affect the rate it will be able to charge if the local communications services tax lcst,authorized under of the simplification law,takes effect on october.section c requires municipalities to choose whether they will collect certain limited permit fees from communications providers for use of the public if a municipality chooses to charge permit fees,it must reduce the rate of its lcst by,but if it chooses not to charge such fees,it may increase the rate by.because the lcst does not take effect until october,if it takes effect at all,the transitional carries over,in subsections e and f,the language of the version subsections and pertaining to taxes and fees that may be levied on telecommunications companies in the meantime.section is scheduled to be amended again on october,removing the language in subsections e and f entirely to reflect the implementation of the new lcst scheme.see.laws ch.
the lcst is intended to replace the patchwork system by which each municipality had set its own formula within the bounds of prior versions of for how it would tax telecommunications companies use of the public.in of the simplification law,codified at.stat.supp,the florida legislature delegated to the revenue estimating conference rec the responsibility of determining,based on the factors prescribed in that section,what the local communications tax rate should be for each municipality and county in the state.recognizing the difficulties inherent in this task,the florida legislature structured the simplification law to prepare for the contingency that the rec would not be able to establish acceptable rates for the lcsts unless the florida legislature acts before june,on that date section of the simplification law will repeal the transitional amendments to,as well as the october amendments to and the other sections implementing the lcst,and will reinstate the version of with only minor changes on the same day.presumably,if the rec is successful in setting the rates for the lcsts,the florida legislature will repeal and before june so that the october amendments,which comprise the essence of the simplification law,will go into effect as scheduled 
that is the overall plan under the simplification law however,w here a statute is amended after the entry of judgment in the trial court,but before the decision of the appellate court,the appellate court must review the judgment of the district court in light of the law as it now stands,not as it stood when the judgment below was entered.naturist soc y,fillyaw,cir quoting diffenderfer cent.baptist church,d.accordingly,we can only conduct our preemption analysis under the version of the statute that is currently in transitional version of 
preemption of specific sections of coral springs ordinance by the transitional version of 
as a preliminary matter,it is necessary to define some of the key terms as they are used in the state law and in the ordinance.section addresses municipal regulation of telecommunications companies,which are defined in as every corporation,partnership,and person offering telecommunications service to the public for hire,but explicitly not including a n entity which provides a telecommunications facility exclusively to a certificated telecommunications company or a private computer data network company not offering service to the public for hire.ordinance,however,refers to telecommunications facilities,which it defines in section as facilit ies that are used to provide one or more telecommunications services,any portion of which occupies public rights of way.telecommunications services are defined in section as the transmission for hire,of information in electronic or optical form,including,but not limited to,voice,video,or data but does not include broadcasts to the from facilities licensed by the federal communications commission or any successor thereto,cable service or open video service.telecommunications facilities are distinguished from private communications systems,which are defined in section as facilit ies placed in whole or in part in the public right of way for the provision of communications in connection with a person business,but not encompassing in any respect the provision of telecommunications services.the ordinance uses the term communications facility,defined in section,to refer to both telecommunications facilities and private communications systems.
it is clear from these definitions that provisions of ordinance governing telecommunications facilities are subject to preemption by limitations on municipal power to regulate telecommunications companies.provisions of the ordinance regulating private communications systems,however,do not fall within the penumbra of.because no section of the ordinance is preempted by state law as it pertains to private communications systems,our preemption analysis is conducted exclusively in terms of its effect on telecommunications facilities,as that term is defined in the ordinance.
we address each relevant section of the ordinance in turn.
section.franchise required this section requires the operators of telecommunications facilities to obtain franchises prior to providing telecommunications services within coral springs.the franchise requirements in subsections and and the license requirements for telecommunications facilities in subsection are flatly preempted by a,which prohibits municipalities from requiring telecommunications companies to enter licenses,franchises,or other agreements as a condition of using the public to provide telecommunications services.
section.compensation required this section requires the operators of telecommunications facilities to pay the greater of an occupancy fee or a franchise fee to coral springs as compensation for the use of the public.the franchise fee,which is established in section a as of the gross revenues generated by the operator of the telecommunications facility use of the public,is obviously preempted by the prohibition of franchises in a.section states that the occupancy fee,however,is intended to recover ongoing way costs to the city caused by burdens users place upon the,and is to be established on a basis for telecommunications facilities located in the.this type of a fee is specifically authorized by state law,but f establishes several factors that limit the maximum permissible amount of the fee.thus,the occupancy fee is not facially void under state law,but there remains a question as to whether coral springs has in fact limited the rate of the occupancy tax it exacts to comply with the limits outlined in f.because neither party has presented evidence of whether the actual amount of the occupancy fee coral springs has charged exceeds that permitted in f,neither party is entitled to summary judgment on the issue of whether the occupancy tax,as applied,is preempted by state law.
section.general conditions upon use of the district court upheld most of this section,finding it to be a reasonable regulation of what happens on the ground within the,as it consists primarily of straightforward provisions governing the installation,construction,relocation,and maintenance of telecommunications facilities.we find,with the exception of two subsections,that section is not preempted by state law because its provisions fall within the ambit of b,which reserves to municipalities the right to adopt rules or regulations governing the roads and,so long as they are related to the placement or maintenance of facilities in such roads or,are reasonable and nondiscriminatory,and include only those matters necessary to manage the roads or.
the first problem is the second sentence in subsection to section,which reads each operator must respond to requests for information regarding its system and plans for the system as the city may from time to time issue,including requests for information regarding its plans for construction,operation and repair and the purposes for which the plant is being constructed,operated or repaired.as stated previously,under,local governments are preempted from regulating telecommunications companies except to the extent provided in.while coral springs reservation of the power to request information from operators of telecommunications facilities regarding their future plans for use of the constitutes a reasonable regulation of the under b,the second sentence of subsection,by its terms,includes,but is not limited to,requests for information concerning the.because it is not limited to matters involving the,this provision exceeds the municipality grant of authority from the state,and is preempted 
the second problem with section is found in subsection,titled no discrimination.under this subsection,coral springs requires that telecommunications facility operators not discriminate against subscribers,programmers,or residents of the city on the basis of race,color,creed,national origin,sex,age,conditions of physical handicap,religion,ethnic background,marital status,or sexual orientation,and that they comply with federal,state,and local equal employment laws.this subsection also prohibits telecommunications facility operators from discriminating or retaliating against individuals or the city for the exercise of any legally protected right.the requirements in subsection clearly exceed the municipality authority under b to issue regulations related to the placement or maintenance of facilities in its roads or.this subsection includes a savings clause,however,which states that these provisions are s ubject to state and federal law limitations on the city authority.thus,we need not strike down this subsection on a facial challenge because it is effectively.essentially,this subsection stands as a clause in the event that coral springs is granted the authority to regulate these matters in the future.
section.protection of the city and residents under this section,coral springs establishes standards for indemnification,insurance,performance bonds,and a security fund that are required of telecommunications companies seeking to use the public.these are reasonable regulations directly related to the management of the,and are therefore authorized under b.
section.enforcement and remedies subsections administration,remedies cumulative,reservation of authority,and ordinance not a contract,are housekeeping provisions that are necessary to the enforcement of the ordinance but do not actually regulate telecommunications providers these sections are not preempted by state law.
subsections,and of section pertain to licenses and franchises,and are therefore preempted by a,which prohibits these arrangements to the extent they apply to telecommunications companies.
subsection penalties provides for a fine to be levied against any person who violates the ordinance.while the fine may not be used to enforce any section of the ordinance that has been found to be preempted,the power to fine is a police power,and therefore is reserved to the municipality under b.
subsection access to books and records grants coral springs access to all books and records in a telecommunications company possession pertaining to the construction,operation,or repair of the communications facility,and to the extent that the franchise fees or license fees are based upon gross revenue or gross receipts,coral springs claims access to all books and records related to revenues derived from the operation of the communications facility.coral springs power to access documents pertaining to the construction and repair of communications facilities is necessary to its direct regulation of the,and is therefore authorized under b however,under state law it does not have a right to access books and records relating to operations,as that term extends far beyond those matters directly related to the.further,because the franchise and license fee as applied to telecommunications companies is preempted under a,coral springs ability to request financial information for the purpose of determining compliance with such a fee is also preempted.
subsection retention of records,and subsection reports,require the operators of telecommunications facilities to retain records and prepare reports as requested to aid coral springs in determining if the facilities are in compliance with the ordinance.these requirements are valid under b as they are necessary to coral springs regulation of the.
subsection maps requires operators of telecommunications facilities to maintain accurate maps and improvement plans which show the location,size,and a general description of all facilities installed in the.this requirement is valid under b as a reasonable means by which the city can ensure that future construction in the does not interfere with or damage existing communications lines and facilities.
section.transitional provisions subsection addresses the process by which persons operating telecommunications facilities without a franchise or license at the time of the ordinance enactment should file for a franchise or license,and subsection states that persons holding franchises or licenses at the time of the ordinance enactment may continue to operate under the terms of the franchise or license until its expiration.these subsections are preempted by a,which prohibits municipalities from requiring telecommunications companies to enter franchises or licenses.subsection,which states that the passage of the ordinance does not affect persons with existing leases of property in the,is not preempted.
section.application for a franchise this section sets out the process an applicant must undergo and the criteria an applicant must meet in order to obtain a franchise to operate a telecommunications facility in the in coral springs,and also sets out the formula for the calculation of the franchise fee.while coral springs does have the right under a to request some of the information and credentials from a telecommunications company that it requests under section,it clearly may not do so in the context of a franchise application,and it may not charge a franchise fee.this section is preempted in its entirety.
preemption of specific sections of palm beach ordinance by the transitional version of 
the scope of ordinance is significantly broader than that of ordinance,as it regulates telecommunications facilities and services,private communications systems,cable systems,and open video systems.the only provisions of the ordinance subject to preemption by,however,are those pertaining to the regulation of telecommunications facilities and services,as those terms are defined in the ordinance and so our analysis of the ordinance is limited to its effects on those areas.
title i,section.franchise required this section requires the operators of telecommunications facilities to obtain franchises prior to providing telecommunications services within palm beach.it is preempted by a,which explicitly prohibits municipalities from requiring telecommunications companies to enter licenses,franchises,or other agreements as a condition of using the public to provide telecommunications services.
title i,section.compensation required this section requires the operators of telecommunications facilities to pay the following fees i a fee for applying for a franchise ii additional compensation should palm beach expenses in evaluating the franchise application exceed the initial application fee iii the costs of any experts or consultants used in evaluating the application iv an annual occupancy fee and v a franchise fee,established in title ii of the ordinance.
all of the fees associated with a franchise would be preempted by a,which prohibits municipalities from imposing franchise agreements on telecommunications companies.subsection,however,includes a savings clause,stating that the franchise fees need not be paid if state law requires otherwise.thus,while palm beach can not currently charge any of the fees associated with the franchise provisions of the ordinance,we need not strike down this section on a facial challenge because it is.this subsection stands as a clause in the event that palm beach is granted the authority to require franchises of telecommunications companies in the future 
the ordinance does not elaborate on the terms of the annual occupancy fee,other than to state in subsection that it may be charged on a gross revenue or basis.subject to limitations,an occupancy fee based on gross revenues is permitted under state law in e,and a fee based on distance of cable laid is permitted in f.the occupancy fee,therefore,is not facially preempted,but may be preempted if the actual fees charged by palm beach exceed the limitations in.because neither party has presented evidence of the actual amount of the occupancy fee palm beach has charged,neither party is entitled to summary judgment on the issue of whether the occupancy tax,as applied,is preempted by state law.
title i,section.general conditions upon use of this section consists primarily of straightforward provisions governing the installation,construction,relocation,and maintenance of telecommunications facilities.with three exceptions,section is not preempted by state law because its provisions are reasonable rules or regulations related to the placement or maintenance of facilities in such roads or permitted under b.
the first preempted provision is subsection,which reads 
every operator of a communications facility shall make available to other franchisees or licensees any of its conduits that is excess,so long as it is excess,at a reasonable,rental fee the town may require as a condition of issuing any permit for underground conduit the installation of which requires excavation that the franchisee,licensee,or holder of the permit emplace conduit in excess of its present and reasonably foreseeable requirements for the purpose of accommodating other franchisees and licensees for a reasonable charge.
this requirement places a potentially substantial burden on telecommunications companies that,while perhaps furthering palm beach policies for the development of its technological infrastructure,goes far beyond the authority allotted it in b to regulate only those matters necessary to manage the roads or.
the second preempted subsection,states 
every communications facility shall be subject to the right of periodic inspection and testing by the town to determine compliance with the provisions of this ordinance,a franchise or license agreement,or other applicable law.the town shall have the right,upon request,to be notified and present when the communications facility is tested by the operator.each operator must respond to requests for information regarding its system and plans for the system as the town may from time to time issue,including requests for information regarding its plans for construction,operation and repair and the purposes for which the plant is being constructed,operated or repaired.
while palm beach does have certain rights to inspect the telecommunications facilities and request information relating to them,under b it may only do so with respect to matters concerning the physical use and management of the.because this subsection is not so limited,it is preempted.
the third preempted subsection is,titled no discrimination.under this subsection,palm beach requires that telecommunications facility operators not discriminate on the basis of race,color,creed,national origin,sex,age,conditions of physical handicap,religion,ethnic background,marital status,or sexual orientation,in both its provision of service and its employment practices.this subsection also prohibits telecommunications facility operators from discriminating or retaliating against individuals or the city for the exercise of any legally protected right.finally,the subsection requires that telecommunications facilities operators not deny access or levy different rates on customers based on income.the requirements in subsection go far beyond matters necessary to regulate the physical,and therefore exceed the municipality authority under b.
title i,section.protection of the town and residents under this section,palm beach establishes standards for indemnification,insurance,performance bonds,and a security fund that are required of telecommunications companies seeking to use the public.these are reasonable regulations directly related to the management of the,and are therefore authorized under b.
title i,section.enforcement and remedies subsections town manager responsible for administration,remedies cumulative,reservation of authority,no waiver,and ordinance not a contract,are housekeeping provisions that are necessary to the enforcement of the ordinance but do not actually regulate telecommunications providers these sections are not preempted by state law.
subsections,and pertain to licenses and franchises,and are therefore preempted by a,which prohibits these arrangements to the extent they apply to telecommunications companies.
subsection penalties provides for a fine to be levied against any person who violates the ordinance.while the fine may not be used to enforce any section of the ordinance that has been found to be preempted,the power to fine is a police power,and therefore is reserved to the municipality under b.
subsection access to books and records grants palm beach access to all books and records in a telecommunications company possession related to the construction,operation,or repair of the communications facility,as well as all books and records related to revenues derived from the operation of the communications facility.palm beach power to access documents pertaining to the construction and repair of communications facilities is necessary to its direct regulation of the,and is therefore authorized under b however,under state law it does not have a right to access books and records relating to operations or revenues,as those matters are not directly related to the.
subsection retention of records,and subsection reports,require the operators of telecommunications facilities to retain records and prepare reports as requested to aid palm beach in determining if the facilities are in compliance with the ordinance.these requirements are valid under b as they are necessary to palm beach regulation of the.
subsection maps requires operators of telecommunications facilities to maintain accurate maps and improvement plans which show the location,size,and a general description of all facilities installed in the public.this requirement is valid under b as a reasonable means by which the city can ensure that future construction in the does not interfere with or damage existing communications lines and facilities.
title i,section.transitional provisions subsection addresses the process by which persons operating telecommunications facilities without a franchise or license at the time of the ordinance enactment should file for a franchise or license,and subsection states that persons holding franchises or licenses at the time of the ordinance enactment may continue to operate under the terms of the franchise or license until its expiration.these subsections are preempted by a,which prohibits municipalities from requiring telecommunications companies to enter franchises or licenses.subsection,which states that the passage of the ordinance does not affect persons with existing leases of property in the,is not preempted.
title ii,section.application for a franchise this section sets out the process an applicant must undergo and the criteria an applicant must meet in order to obtain a franchise to operate a telecommunications facility in the in palm beach,and also sets out the formula for the calculation of the franchise fee.while palm beach does have the right under a to request some of the information and credentials from a communications company that it requests under this section,it clearly may not do so in the context of a franchise application,and it may not charge a franchise fee.this section is preempted in its entirety.
preemption by of the telecommunications act of 
because sections of both ordinances remain that were not preempted by state law,it is necessary for us to consider bellsouth claim that the ordinances are preempted by of the act,titled removal of barriers to entry.section reads,in relevant part 
a in general 
no state or local statute or regulation,or other state or local legal requirement,may prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the ability of any entity to provide any interstate or intrastate telecommunications service.
b state regulatory authority 
nothing in this section shall affect the ability of a state to impose,on a competitively neutral basis and consistent with section of this section,requirements necessary to preserve and advance universal service,protect the public safety and welfare,ensure the continued quality of telecommunications services,and safeguard the rights of consumers.
c state and local government authority 
nothing in this section affects the authority of a state or local government to manage the public or to require fair and reasonable compensation from telecommunications providers,on a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory basis,for use of public on a nondiscriminatory basis,if the compensation required is publicly disclosed by such government.
d preemption 
if,after notice and an opportunity for public comment,the federal communications commission determines that a state or local government has permitted or imposed any statute,regulation,or legal requirement that violates subsection a or b of this section,the commission shall preempt the enforcement of such statute,regulation,or legal requirement to the extent necessary to correct such violation or inconsistency.
as has been observed by other federal courts,the language and structure of raise two difficult questions of statutory interpretation what is the preemptive scope of and who may seek enforcement of the provisions of see tcg detroit city of dearborn,cir cablevision of boston,public improvement comm n,cir.we must answer these issues of first impression before we can consider whether the remaining sections of the ordinances are preempted by federal law 
substantive limits on state and local authority in 
the heart of is subsection a,which prohibits state and local governments from passing laws or other regulations that may prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the ability of any entity to provide any interstate or intrastate telecommunications service.a.it is beyond dispute that subsection a imposes a substantive limitation on the authority of state and local governments to regulate telecommunications.
the difficult question here pertains to the function of subsections b and c.several federal district courts,including the district court in these cases,have interpreted subsections b and c as imposing substantive limitations on state and local authority in the telecommunications field.primarily in the context of interpreting subsection c,these courts have held that the only regulatory authority retained by the state and local governments is the authority to perform the functions specifically reserved in those subsections.see bell,prince george county,d,rev on other grounds,cir communications of the southwest,city of dallas,d,tcg detroit city of dearborn,aff,cir.at least one district court,however,has interpreted b and c not as limiting state and local authority,but as defining the safe harbors,that is,the exceptions to the general prohibition stated in subsection a.see tcg new york,city of white plains,d.
the confusion arises because of perceived inconsistencies within the structure of the statute.subsection a states the general limitations on state and local government regulation of telecommunications.subsections b and c are structurally identical to one another b begins with the phrase nothing in this section shall affect,and c begins with the phrase nothing in this section affects thus,b and c are couched not in terms of limitation,but of exception to the general rule set forth in a.subsection d,however,states that the fcc shall preempt any state or local statute or regulation that violates subsection a or b of this section.it would seem that if an entity could violate subsection b,then subsection b must impose some sort of substantive limitations,and because they are structured similarly,if b imposes separate limitations,so must c.therein lies the apparent conflict.based on four factors,however,we find that subsection a contains the only substantive limitations on state and local government regulation of telecommunications,and that subsections b and c are safe harbors,functioning as affirmative defenses to preemption of state or local exercises of authority that would otherwise violate a.
when interpreting a statute,it is axiomatic that a court must begin with the plain language of the statute.united states prather,cir.the first and most basic reason for interpreting b and c as safe harbor provisions is that,reading a,b,and c together,it is the only interpretation supported by the plain language of the statute unless one omits the opening phrase in subsections b and c completely or otherwise inflicts some grave injustice on the rules of english grammar,it is not possible to read these subsections as pronouncing separate limitations that a state or local government could violate.because they begin with the phrase nothing in this section shall affect,it is clear that subsections b and c are defining exceptions to a,and that whatever language follows that initial phrase,it derives meaning only through its relationship to a.latent in the opinions of the courts that have read subsections b and c as independent limitations on state and local authority is the maxim that inclusion unis est exclusion alterius,that is,that by expressly reserving certain powers to the state and local governments in b and c,congress must have intended that only those powers be reserved.while this argument may have some appeal at first blush,we note that if we were to read b and c as delineating the absolute boundaries of state and local regulatory authority in the field of telecommunications,the limitation set forth in subsection a would be superfluous.settled principles of statutory construction counsel against such a reading,see mears transp.group florida,cir,particularly when it would violate the plain meaning of the statute.
our second reason for viewing subsection a as the only limitation on state and local governments in and interpreting subsections b and c as exceptions to a is that that is how the fcc has interpreted the statute in,the fcc issued its suggested guidelines for petitions for ruling under section of the communications act.available at.in these guidelines,the fcc stated 
in preparing their submissions,parties should address as appropriate all parts of section.in particular,parties should first describe whether the challenged requirement falls within the proscription of section a if it does,parties should describe whether the requirement nevertheless is permissible under other sections of the statute,specifically sections b and c.
id.thus,it is clear that b and c are exceptions to a,rather than separate limitations on state and local authority in addition to those in a.consistent with this interpretation,if a party seeking preemption fails to make the threshold showing that a state or local statute or ordinance violates a because it may prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the ability of any entity to provide any interstate or intrastate telecommunications service,the fcc has found it unnecessary to consider whether the statute or ordinance is saved by the exceptions in b or c.see,in re missouri municipal league,fcc rec,wl in re minnesota,fcc rec,in re american communications,fcc rec,in re cal.payphone ass n,fcc rec.
the third factor bolstering our conclusion that congress intended subsections b and c to be used defensively by state and local governments comes from the legislative history.the remarks of senator hollings during the senate debate explain how b and c were written into the act 
when we provided that subsection a,the states necessarily came and said,wait a minute,that sounds good,but we have the responsibilities over the public safety and welfare.we have a responsibility along with you with respect to universal service.so what about that how are we going to do our job with that overencompassing sic general section a that you have there.so we added subse
