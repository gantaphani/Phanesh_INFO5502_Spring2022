this suit under erisa for disability payments presents the recurring question whether an employee welfare benefits plan creates an entitlement to lifetime benefits rather than just to benefits that can be terminated by an amendment to the plan.
in michael marrs,an employee of motorola,ceased working because of a psychiatric condition and began drawing disability benefits under motorola disability income plan.six years later motorola amended the plan to place a limit on benefits for disability resulting from certain mental,nervous,alcohol,or mnad conditions,including marrs.such limitations on mnad conditions are common in employee disability plans.rogers department of health environmental control,cir see,krolnik prudential ins,cir hackner long term disability plan for employees of havi group lp,cir kahane unum life ins,cir steven sacher et,employee benefits law,ed.supp dana kaplan,can legislation alone solve america mental health dilemma current state legislative schemes can not achieve mental health parity,quinnipiac health.previously,however,motorola had imposed no time limit on the receipt of such benefits.although marrs had already received benefits for more than two years,he was given an additional two years of benefits,starting on the date of the amendment.that period has ended and the benefits have ceased.
his suit is on behalf of himself and others in the same position,and a class action has been certified.the district court granted summary judgment in motorola favor.in an earlier stage of the litigation,the district court had dismissed two other claims under rule b.marrs renews them on appeal,but they are too clearly without merit to require us to discuss them.
marrs contends that the application of the amendment to persons in his situation violates a provision of the plan that,like the provision in article v of the constitution according to which a state can not by constitutional amendment be deprived of its right to two senators without its consent,limits motorola power to amend the plan.the provision states that no amendment shall adversely affect the rights of any participant to receive benefits with respect to periods of disability prior to the adoption date of the amendment.marrs interprets periods of disability prior to the adoption date to mean one or more periods of disability that began before the plan was amended but may not have ended before then.
that is a forced reading.the reference in the plan to periods rather than period suggests the segmentation of a period of disability,with some segments periods lying before and some after the amendment.it is true that the plan defines the term period of disability to mean one or more periods of absence from active employment due to disability,and if we substituted period of disability prior to the plan for periods of disability prior to the plan we would come closer to marrs preferred interpretation.but the plan provides that only words the initial letters of which are capitalized are defined terms,and so periods of disability can not be equated to period of disability.
marrs interpretation is further undermined by the disability plan that was in force in when he stopped working and that states that if a participant became disabled prior to,the benefit levels specified in the disability income plan in force then would continue in force until the participant returns to work for thirty days.this provision would be surplusage in the superseding plan where it also appears if the plan guaranteed the continuation of disability benefits without diminution even if,as in marrs case,the disability did not arise before.
whether this interpretation of the plan,which is the plan administrator interpretation,is correct or not,it is reasonable and we are inclined to stop with that observation.but marrs asks us to give no weight to the administrator interpretation because the administrator labored under a conflict of interest motorola is both the plan administrator and the payor of benefits awarded under the plan.
marrs cites the supreme court recent decision in metropolitan life ins.glenn,d,which addresses the significance of a conflict of interest by the plan administrator when,as in that case and this one,the plan commits the decision whether to award benefits to the administrator discretion.if the plan did not confer discretion on the administrator,his decision would be entitled to no deference by the reviewing court.
marrs reads glenn to require a more penetrating inquiry into the actions of a conflicted administrator than the earlier case law,which was all over the kathryn kennedy,judicial standard of review in erisa benefit claim cases,am,see also denmark liberty life assurance,cir had required.although normally an employer can amend a welfare benefits plan without regard to the employees interests,hughes aircraft jacobson,d schoonejongen,d,remember that marrs claim is that the amendment curtailing his benefits violated the plan,and that is a claim of wrongful denial of benefits and so the supreme court concern with conflicted administrators would seem pertinent.
true,the issue in this case is the interpretation of a plan document rather than the application of the plan criteria for an award of benefits to particular facts and the interpretation of a contract,unless extrinsic evidence is considered,is usually treated as an issue of law,which an appellate tribunal therefore resolves without deferring to the opinion of the decision maker.but when an erisa plan gives the plan administrator discretion to interpret its terms as well as to determine eligibility for benefits under terms the meaning of which is not questioned,the court can,as the parties to this case agree,reject the administrator interpretation only if it is unreasonable arbitrary and capricious.firestone tire rubber bruch,d carr gates health care plan,cir under the arbitrary and capricious standard,the administrator decision will only be overturned if it is downright unreasonable.a denial of benefits will not be set aside if the denial was based upon a reasonable interpretation of the plan documents citations omitted call ameritech management pension plan,cir.and both the original and the amended plan in this case confer discretion on the plan administrator to construe and interpret the plan,decide all questions of fact and questions of eligibility and determine the amount,manner and time of payment of any benefits hereunder emphasis added.
the administrator is not by virtue of such a grant of authority free to disregard unambiguous language in the plan,id.at swaback american information technologies,cir if fiduciaries or administrators of an erisa plan controvert the plain meaning of a plan,their actions are arbitrary and capricious that would be unreasonable.but the administrator use of interpretive tools to disambiguate ambiguous language is,one would think,by the terms of the plan entitled to deferential consideration by a reviewing court.
yet vallone cna financial,cir,although noting that the plan in that case gave the plan administrator interpretive discretion,treats the question whether benefits claimed by the plaintiffs had vested as a straight issue of contract interpretation.the court seemed to give no weight to the plan administrator judgment,though in the end agreeing with the administrator denial of benefits.but the court was mirroring the parties emphasis,and it did not say that the grant of interpretive discretion to a plan administrator is entitled to no weight,although one passage in the opinion could be thought to imply this.see id.at.any such implication would be in tension with the firestone and carr the former is a supreme court decision,which is a trump.
