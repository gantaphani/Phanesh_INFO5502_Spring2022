appellant coalition coalition appeals two decisions of the federal communications commission fcc,commission which granted the application of the curators of the university of missouri university to renew a license to operate radio station in louis,missouri.in the first decision the fcc granted the application subject to a notice of apparent liability nal against the university in the amount of,denying the coalition petition to deny renewal based on allegations of discriminatory employment practices,curators of of,wl in the second the commission granted the university petition to reconsider and rescinded the nal,curators of of,wl.in each decision the commission rejected the coalition request to designate the application for hearing pursuant to e and on appeal the coalition asks that we remand for just such a hearing.without reaching the merits of the commission decisions,we dismiss both of the appeals because the coalition has failed to establish it has constitutional standing to bring them.
the university filed its license renewal application in september.in january rainbow filed a petition to deny the application under d,asserting that the university had violated the fcc equal employment opportunity eeo rule,by discriminating on the basis of race in its employment decisions.appended to the petition to deny were declarations by one former employee,winnie sullivan,who had filed a discrimination complaint against the university with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc and,subsequently,an unsuccessful suit for discriminatory termination in the eastern district of missouri,and by two other former employees and two unsuccessful job applicants who claimed to have been subjected to discriminatory treatment in the petition,the coalition pointed out that the university renewal application made no mention of sullivan discrimination suit.in its opposition to the coalition petition to deny,the university responded that it did not believe disclosure of sullivan complaint was required because her discrimination suit resulted in a verdict in the university favor.
in may the fcc sent the university a letter asking the university to explain why it had failed to disclose the sullivan discrimination complaint in its eeo report form,which the university submitted with its renewal application and which expressly directed the applicant to set out a brief description of any complaint which has been filed before any body having competent jurisdiction under federal,state,territorial or local law,alleging unlawful discrimination in the employment practices of the station,ja.the letter further directed the university to identify any other employment discrimination complaint s filed against during the current license term.ja.on july,the university submitted an amendment to its eeo report describing the sullivan litigation.
on september,rainbow wrote a letter to the fcc alleging the university had deliberately misrepresented its discrimination record by failing to disclose not only sullivan complaint and lawsuit but also two other eeoc complaints filed against the university one by john schieszer,a former kwmu news reporter who claimed he suffered unlawful retaliation,and one by tessa abrams now marshall,a black interviewee who claimed the university failed to hire her on account of her race.on october,the university submitted a second amendment acknowledging the unsuccessful eeoc complaint filed by schieszer but denying any record or knowledge of a complaint by abrams 
in a decision released january,the fcc denied the coalition petition and approved renewal of the kwmu license.with regard to the alleged discrimination,the commission concluded rainbow had not established a prima facie case justifying a hearing because its petition did not contain specific allegations of fact sufficient to show that a grant of the application would be prima facie inconsistent with the statute requirement that the public interest,convenience,and necessity will be served by granting a license application.at citing d.the commission explained that sullivan complaint had been finally the university that,with regard to the other alleged discriminatees,consistent with longstanding policy and a memorandum of understanding between the fcc and the eeoc,the fcc did not adjudicate their claims but instead referred them first to the eeoc.the commission advised that,i f the individual allegations of employment discrimination in rainbow petition continue to be actionable,the commission will take cognizance of any final determination of employment discrimination.at citing pac.so,wl,wl ksdk,wl,reconsideration denied,wl.radio,wl.
with regard to the misrepresentation charge,the fcc found that the university initial application and the first amendment thereto omitted material,the sullivan litigation and schieszer eeoc complaint but found no evidence of an intent to deceive that would support a finding of misrepresentation or lack of candor.at.the commission nonetheless made license renewal subject to an nal of for willfully omitting material facts in its form in violation of.at rainbow filed a timely notice of appeal of the decision.
the university moved for reconsideration and in an order released february,the fcc with two commissioners dissenting rescinded the nal because the university omissions were not of sufficient gravity to warrant the assessment of a forfeiture under all of the circumstances.at.rainbow filed a timely notice of appeal of this decision as well.
this court has directed that a petitioner whose standing is not selfevident sic should establish its standing by the submission of its arguments and any affidavits or other evidence appurtenant thereto at the first appropriate point in the review proceeding either in response to a motion to dismiss for want of standing or,in the absence of such motion,with the petitioner opening brief.sierra club epa.at this procedural stage,a petitioner must demonstrate,not merely allege,that there is a substantial probability it will suffer injury if the court does not grant relief.id.the petitioner may carry its burden of production by citing any record evidence relevant to its claim of standing and,if necessary,appending to its filing additional affidavits or other evidence sufficient to support its claim.id.at.having reviewed the materials the coalition has submitted,we conclude that it has not met its burden because it has not demonstrated the threshold requirement for associational standing that at least one of its members would have standing to sue in his own right.coalition fcc,citing hunt.state apple adver.comm n,d 
to meet this burden the coalition appended to its opening brief the affidavit of the reverend sammie earl jones,a coalition member who for years has resided in louis and been a regular listener to kwmu.that jones is a member of the station listening audience,however,does not grant automatic audience standing to jones,or through him to the coalition,to challenge a license renewal even when it is alleged the licensee will operate contrary to the public interest.coalition,at.instead,the coalition must demonstrate that it satisfies each of the three prongs of the test for standing.
the irreducible constitutional minimum of standing contains three elements,causation,and redressability.id.quoting lujan defenders of wildlife,d.that is,to establish standing under article iii,a complainant must allege a personal that is fairly traceable to the defendant conduct and redressable by the relief requested.microwave acquisition fcc,quoting suncom mobile data,fcc,quoting branton fcc,quoting allen wright,d,cert.denied,d.further,the injury must be both concrete and particularized and actual or imminent.id.citing lujan,at.the coalition has not identified an injury that satisfies all of these requirements.
to support its claim of injury,the coalition first points to portions of jones affidavit regarding his role as job counselor with the coalition.jones states that the coalition undertake s to place job applicants with employers and vice versa and to train young people and guide their transition into the job market,that he perform s a good deal of this work personally and that i t is a burden on and his own time and resources to keep track of which company discriminates and which does,and to have to counsel young people on how to deal with discrimination when they encounter it,how to avoid it,and how to fight it.jones aff.
in havens realty coleman,d,the united states supreme court established that an organization has constitutional standing to challenge the discriminatory practices of a defendant if those practices adversely affect the activities the person or organization undertakes to fight discrimination.havens realty,an organization devoted to mak ing equal opportunity in housing a reality in the richmond,virginia area,sent black testers to the defendant real estate company apartments and the testers were falsely told there were no apartments for rent.at.because of the real estate company discriminatory practice of steering away black renters,the organization alleged,its efforts to assist minorities gain equal access to housing ha d been frustrated and it was required to devote significant resources to identify and counteract the discriminatory practices.if proven,the supreme court held,this would constitute concrete and demonstrable injury to the organization consequent drain on resources.at.see also fair employment council of greater washington,bmc mktg,organization that sent testers to employment agency had standing to challenge agency discriminatory referral practices based on allegations that defendants practices interfered with the organization community outreach and public education,counseling,and research projects,and also required the organization council to expend resources to counteract defendant alleged discrimination,which closely track ed the claims that the supreme court found sufficient in havens citing havens,at.spann colonial village,finding two equal housing organizations had standing to challenge realty companies racially preferential advertising which discouraged black home buyers and renters from considering defendants housing and required the organizations to expend additional resources to identify and dispel this discouragement citing havens,at.
neither jones nor the coalition has identified such a specific injury directly attributable to the university alleged discrimination.jones says only that he finds it burdensome to keep track of which company discriminates and which does and to counsel young people on how to deal with discrimination when they encounter it.jones aff.unlike the plaintiff in havens,he never says that discrimination at kwmu frustrates any of his efforts or that he must expend resources to identify and counteract kwmu alleged discrimination.indeed,the portion of jones affidavit dealing with counseling never even mentions kwmu.thus,so far as we can tell from jones affidavit,any discrimination at kwmu would constitute simply a setback to his abstract societal interest,havens,at,in advancing racial equity 
it is true that elsewhere in the affidavit jones alleges that kwmu is one of the benchmark institutions in the community,jones aff,and the counseling paragraph claims that i f major institutions,like public radio stations,were to stop discriminating overnight,an enormous burden would be lifted from his shoulders,id.yet jones never explains how an end to discrimination at this particular benchmark institution would perceptibly affect his activities.nor do the affidavits of alleged victims of discrimination at kwmu help the coalition as nothing in the record links the affiants experiences with kwmu to jones counseling efforts.
contrary to what the dissent says,see dissent at,we do not suggest that an affidavit must contain any magic words to support an assertion of standing by the affiant organization.jones affidavit falls short not because the discussion of job counseling omits the name kwmu but because,contrary to the law of this circuit,the affidavit never even states,let alone explains how,the alleged discrimination by kwmu in particular affects jones counseling and outreach efforts,reducing their effectiveness or requiring jones to take concrete action in response.see fair employment council,at noting that as case moved beyond pleading stage,plaintiff,to show standing,needed to offer support for its claim that defendant alleged discrimination has perceptibly impaired its programs spann,at noting that as case moved forward,plaintiffs would have to prove that defendant violation caused them to expend resources or suffer some other concrete injury am.legal found.fcc,dismissing petition to review fcc order for lack of standing because court was unable to discern how of fcc rule caused harm to any discrete activities petitioner might undertake.an affidavit presented at this procedural stage would have to demonstrate that kwmu alleged discrimination has such an impact.see supra.
alternatively,the coalition points to our decision in llerandi fcc,in which we upheld the standing of the appellants,as listeners,to challenge the assignment of two radio licenses on the ground that the assignments violated the commission then duopoly rule,which prohibited common ownership of two am stations with overly overlapping signals.at.as we explained in coalition,the llerandi appellants had standing because they were seeking to take advantage of a prophylaxis the commission had designed to protect listeners from the possibility that programming would be degraded by the creation of a duopoly.at.the coalition claims similar standing because it is seeking to take advantage of a prophylaxis that the commission had designed to protect residents of the service area and listeners of the station from the possibility that a licensee that practiced intentional racial discrimination in its employment decisions,which calls into question its character qualifications,would have its license renewed.reply br.this argument overlooks a cardinal distinction between the duopoly rule and the eeo rule.as the court in llerandi explained,the ultimate point of the duopoly rule was to assure or at least enhance diversification of viewpoints within the broadcast industry.llerandi,at.thus,this court had little difficulty finding that a listener,who would be directly affected by the programming diversity the rule was designed to promote,had standing to challenge the commission alleged violation of the rule.by contrast,the violation alleged here involves a rule which was not designed to affect a station programming.the coalition apparently seeks to revive its theory,which we rejected in coalition,that a listener has public interest standing to challenge the license of a broadcaster that breaks fcc fcc rules regardless whether their violation affects the programming that listeners hear.see coalition,at.as we responded then,while it may be desirable for the commission to vigorously enforce licensee compliance with its rules,it does not follow that the audience is harmed whenever the commission punishes a particular violation with less than the ultimate sanction.at see also kerm,fcc,complainant can not establish standing simply by asserting a role as public ombudsman but must assert injury that is sufficiently unique as to distinguish complainant from any other potential litigant interested in ensuring the faithful enforcement of the act citing sierra club morton,d steel citizens for better env t,d.now,as then,the coalition has failed to establish an actual or imminent effect upon programming to support its claim of listener standing.id.citing sierra club,at.
finally,the coalition relies on our decision in office of communication of united church of christ fcc,to claim listener standing to challenge discriminatory programming based on the self evident impact on program service stemming from intentional race discrimination in employment.reply br.see also jones aff.complaining of being deprived of program service in the public interest,including the multitude of viewpoints held by people of color.as we explained in coalition,however,such standing requires a showing that the challenged fcc action resulted in some actual effect upon the programming of the licensed station otherwise fears of decreased diversity remain purely speculative.at.in ucc the appellants made such a showing,proffering a particularized complaint of the sparse and disrespectful television exposure accorded blacks accompanied by a detailed presentation of the results of appellants monitoring of a typical week programming.at quoting ucc,at.the coalition has not made a comparable showing here.this is not to say that discriminatory employment practices can not in some instances affect programming content and thus cause injury to audience members but to establish standing on this basis a complainant must demonstrate both the existence of injury to the audience and its causal link to the discrimination.the coalition has not done so.
because the coalition has failed to demonstrate actual and redressable injury caused by the challenged license renewal so as to establish article iii standing,we dismiss its appeals from the commission decisions.
so ordered.
in concluding that the coalition fails to demonstrate standing under article iii of the constitution,the court applies a heightened evidentiary standard for causation and redressibility that precedent does not require.according to the court,jones affidavit is insufficient to establish constitutional standing because it fails to explain how the burden on his resources is directly attributable to the university alleged discrimination or how an end to discrimination at this particular benchmark institution would perceptibly affect his activities.op.at.under supreme court precedent and our own case law,jones affidavit alleges all of the facts necessary to establish constitutional standing.
in havens realty coleman,d,the supreme court held that an organizational plaintiff suffers an injury caused by a defendant discriminatory practices when it devotes counseling and referral resources to identifying and counteracting such discrimination.id.at.such concrete and demonstrable injury to the organization the consequent drain on the organization far more than simply a setback to the organization abstract social interests.id.relying on havens,this court has held that an organization establishes article iii injury if it alleges that purportedly illegal action increases the resources the group must devote to programs independent of its suit challenging the action.spann colonial village,see also fair employment council,bmc marketing.under this precedent,jones affidavit sufficiently establishes that the burden on his resources is traceable to the commission unconditional renewal of the university radio station license.
the facts alleged in jones affidavit must be taken to be true.lujan defenders of wildlife,d see sierra club epa.jones describes the university radio station as one of the benchmark institutions in the community,as it is one of only two secular,noncommercial full power radio stations in the community.jones aff.he alleges that discriminates against minority job applicants in the louis area,and that such discrimination is particularly egregious because the university is a public educational institution.id.he states that seeks to ensure that all americans have equal opportunities to work in industries,such as broadcasting,that are essential to democracy,and that t oward this end,counsels job applicants and employers on the subject of equal employment opportunity,and undertake s to place job applicants and guide their transition into the job market.id.
more particularly,jones explains that he personally devotes significant resources to identifying employers that discriminate against racial minorities so as to avoid sending young people off to search for employment at work sites where they will either waste their timing filing applications doomed to be discarded on the basis of race,or be hired and face the frustration of a career where they can never fulfill their full potential because of discrimination based on race.id.he also states that he devotes significant resources to counteracting employment discrimination in the louis area by counsel ing young people on how to deal with discrimination when they encounter it,how to avoid it,and how to fight it.id.these burdens on and jones resources are traceable to the commission unconditional renewal of the university radio station license because,jones explains,b y renewing the university license for for another years without so much as a hearing,the fcc extended,rather than provided relief from,the station ability to continue the alleged pattern of discriminatory employment practices.id.such discrimination may,as this court explained in fair employment council,increase the number of people in need of counseling or reduce the effectiveness of any given level of outreach efforts.at.jones concludes that i f major institutions that provide leadership roles in society as a whole like public radio stations would stop discriminating,the burden on his counseling and referral resources would be lifted from his shoulders.jones aff.emphasis added.
counsel for the commission observed at oral argument that jones affidavit would have been stronger if it had identified a specific instance in which had denied employment to an applicant whom jones had referred or counseled.but counsel did not argue,and indeed could not argue,that the failure to do so rendered jones affidavit insufficient as a matter of law.neither supreme court nor our precedent requires the organization to identify a specific instance in which the defendant discriminated against an individual whom the organization referred or counseled an allegation that the organization expended resources to combat such discrimination is sufficient.see havens,at.fair employment council,at spann,at.although in havens and fair employment council there was evidence that the defendant had discriminated against the organization testers,such evidence was unnecessary to establish standing because the resources devoted to testing did not form the basis of the organization injury.see havens,at.fair employment council,at.indeed,in spann,this court found standing without evidence of the defendant discrimination against the organization testers,relying instead on the organization allegation that the defendants preferential advertising tended to steer black home buyers and renters away from the advertised complexes and thus impelled the organizations to devote resources to checking or neutralizing the ads adverse impact.at.
to the extent that precedent can be read to require the organization to identify the particular burden that the defendant discrimination,as opposed to general societal discrimination,places on the organization resources,see havens,at.fair employment council,at spann,at,jones affidavit is sufficient when read in the light most favorable to him and particularly when read in conjunction with the other affidavits proffered by alleging employment discrimination by.sierra club,at tao freeh,citing anderson liberty lobby,d.jones identifies as one of the benchmark institutions in the community and emphasizes that i t is important for the court to appreciate the vital and unique importance of radio station in our community.jones aff.he explains that the station has a unique role to play in fostering racial dialogue in louis because the university is a public educational institution,which makes the station employment discrimination particularly egregious,id.he specifies that he seeks to place minority job applicants in the broadcasting industry,and that if major institutions with leadership roles in society as a whole like public radio stations would stop discriminating,a significant burden on his counseling and referral resources would be alleviated.id.emphasis added.while other major institutions that engage in employment discrimination may also burden his resources,jones affidavit sufficiently identifies as one of those major institutions whose discriminatory employment practices burden his resources.such practices are documented by the specific facts alleged in the several affidavits of minority job applicants and employees that describe the station discrimination against them.coalition fcc.
according to the court,op.at,jones
