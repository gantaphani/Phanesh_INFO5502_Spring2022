wireless association ctia challenges an order of the federal communications commission determining that the construction of wireless communications towers is an undertaking subject to section of the national historic preservation act,and deferring to a determination by the advisory council on historic preservation the council that section protects not only those properties formally deemed eligible for listing in the national register of historic places the register,but also those that simply meet the criteria for listing.because we conclude the fcc did not err,we deny the petition for review.
congress enacted the national historic preservation act nhpa or the act in to foster conditions under which our modern society and our prehistoric and historic resources can exist in productive harmony.section of the act requires federal agencies to take into account the effects of their undertaking s on historic properties included or eligible for inclusion in the register.id.in doing so,the act does not require a federal agency to engage in any particular preservation activities rather,section only requires that the agency consult the state historic preservation office and the advisory council on historic preservation and consider the impacts of its undertaking.davis latschar.
the council is an independent agency created by the nhpa,with twenty members drawn from the public and private sectors and a professional staff trained in historic preservation.see a.the nhpa directs the council to promulgate such rules and regulations as it deems necessary to govern the implementation of section in its entirety.id.using this authority,the council created what it calls the section process a process that provides how federal agencies meet their statutory responsibilities under section.a.the section process requires agencies to identify undertakings that might affect historic properties,id,identify potentially affected historic properties,id,assess the potential adverse effects of their actions on those properties,id,and seek ways to avoid,minimize or mitigate those effects,id.agencies must complete the section process prior to the approval of the expenditure of any federal funds on the undertaking or prior to the issuance of any license.id.c quotation marks omitted.
as an alternative,the council regulations provide that agencies may develop procedures to implement section and substitute them for the standard section process if they are consistent with the council regulations,id.a,a determination the council itself makes,id.a.agencies and the council may also negotiate a programmatic agreement to govern the implementation of a particular program or the resolution of adverse effects from certain complex project situations or multiple undertakings.id.b.such programmatic agreements are frequently used for undertakings whose effects are similar or repetitive or can not be fully determined prior to approval of the undertaking.id.b.
negotiation of a programmatic agreement requires consultation as appropriate with state or tribal historic preservation offices shpos or thpos,the national conference of state historic preservation officers ncshpo,indian tribes and native hawaiian organizations,other federal agencies,and members of the public.id.b i.programmatic agreements take effect when executed by the council,the agency official and the appropriate when the programmatic agreement concerns a specific region or the president of ncshpo when ncshpo has participated in the consultation.id.b iii.a programmatic agreement binds the agency and satisfies the agency section responsibilities for all individual undertakings of the program covered by the agreement until it expires or is terminated by the agency.id.after being executed by the parties,the agreement has no legal force,however,until after the agency has provided public notice of its terms and allowed for public comment.id.b iv.only then may the agency issue an order that makes the terms of the agreement binding.
this case involves a programmatic agreement negotiated by the federal communications commission fcc or commission,the council,and the ncshpo regarding wireless communications towers.prior to execution of this agreement,wireless communication tower construction was subject to the standard section process established by the council.in august,the fcc convened a working group to develop a programmatic agreement for wireless communications towers.this working group included the fcc,the council,representatives of the wireless communications industry including ctia,and individuals and organizations from the historic preservation community.by june,the working group had drafted a nationwide programmatic agreement npa regarding tower construction.the npa

after the npa was drafted,the fcc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking seeking public comment on the proposed agreement and a draft amendment to its regulations that would incorporate the npa into the commission rules.see notice of proposed rulemaking,nationwide programmatic agreement regarding the section national historic preservation act review process,wl notice of proposed rulemaking or nprm proposing to amend a.on january,following the notice and comment period,the fcc issued the npa order,in which the fcc adopted its proposed changes.see npa order,at.in the npa order,the fcc concluded that construction of a wireless communications tower constitutes an undertaking subject to section of the nhpa.id.at.in addition,the fcc deferred to the council interpretation of the term eligible for inclusion as including properties formally determined eligible for listing on the register and properties that meet the criteria for listing but have not yet received a formal determination.id.at.ctia filed a petition for review challenging those two aspects of the npa order and invoking this court jurisdiction under a and.
even where the parties assure us that we have jurisdiction over a case,we have an independent obligation to be certain.midwest indep.transmission.operator,ferc,citing steel citizens for a better env t,d.section of title,united states code,allows a ny party aggrieved by the fcc final order within days after its entry to file a petition to review,with respect to a final order reviewable under this chapter.id.although neither ctia nor the fcc challenged our jurisdiction in their briefs,we questioned at oral argument whether ctia petition for review was timely with respect to one of its challenges.
ctia filed its petition for review within days of the fcc final order implementing the nationwide programmatic agreement,and seeks to challenge two independent grounds set forth in the npa order in support of the fcc conclusion that tower construction is a federal undertaking subject to the nhpa.as we discuss more fully in section iii,first,the npa order determined that tower construction constitutes a federal undertaking under section because of the fcc registration process,through which the commission may assure,prior to construction,that towers do not pose a risk to air safety,at.second,the npa order determined that tower construction additionally constitutes a federal undertaking because of the fcc approval process for environmental assessments under the national environmental policy act nepa.at.
two earlier commission orders,however,also address the duties of tower owners under the nhpa.in,the commission amend ed its rules to require environmental review before any applicant proceeds with tower construction.amendment of environmental rules,order.as part of that amendment,the commission required tower owners to comply with the nhpa prior to construction so that the commission could address environmental issues early enough in the licensing process to ensure that it fully meets its obligations under federal environmental laws.id.at citing the nhpa,et.the order never explicitly addresses whether tower construction is a federal undertaking under section of the nhpa.instead,the order reasons that any delay in construction that results from requiring an applicant to undergo environmental processing prior to construction,rather than at the licensing stage,is more than offset by the public interest benefits of ensuring,in compliance with federal environmental statutes,that no potentially irreversible harm to the environment occurs.id.at emphasis added.thus,the order determines that requiring compliance with the commission environmental regulations prior to tower construction is in the public interest.
in,the commission explicitly concluded that registering a structure,its tower registration process,constitutes a federal undertaking under the nhpa.streamlining the commission antenna structure clearance procedure,order unlike the order we now review,the order contains no analysis of relevant statutes and regulations in support of that conclusion.see id.
the parties did not address in their briefs whether ctia petition is timely in light of these two orders.after questioning jurisdiction at oral argument,we ordered supplemental briefing.both parties now quarrel over application of the reopening doctrine.the reopening doctrine,in this circuit,is an exception to statutory limits on the time for seeking review of an agency decision.ass of reversionary property owners surface transp,quoting united transp.legislative bd.surface transp,alterations and quotation marks omitted.the doctrine arise s where an agency conducts a rulemaking or adopts a policy on an issue at one time,and then in a later rulemaking restates the policy or otherwise addresses the issue again without altering the original decision.id.on one end of the spectrum,w e have said that when the later proceeding explicitly or implicitly shows that the agency actually reconsidered the rule,the matter has been reopened and the time period for seeking judicial review begins anew.id.citing public citizen nrc.the general principle is that if the agency has opened the issue up anew,even though not explicitly,its renewed adherence is substantively reviewable.id.quoting public citizen,at quoting of am.icc,alterations omitted see panamsat fcc,same.
on the other end of the spectrum,we have concluded that an agency does not reopen a rulemaking or policy determination merely by respond ing to an unsolicited comment by reaffirming its prior position.kennecott utah copper dep t of interior,citing massachusetts icc.nor does an agency reopen an issue by responding to a comment that addresses a settled aspect of some matter,even if the agency had solicited comments on unsettled aspects of the same matter.kennecott,at.
in determining whether an agency reconsidered a previously decided matter,we must look to the entire context of the rulemaking including all relevant proposals and reactions of the agency.reversionary property owners,at quoting public citizen,at alterations omitted.we have,through numerous decisions,summarized several factors that will demonstrate reopening in this circuit.see id.at kennecott,at public citizen,at state of ohio epa.we need not,and do not,revisit the weight given to various factors in distinguishing between reopening an issue and mere ly repeating old reasons for an old policy in response to unsolicited comments.reversionary property owners,at.for in this case,the fcc treatment in the npa order of whether tower construction is a federal undertaking falls comfortably on the reopening side of the spectrum.
as noted,the order determined that requiring tower owners to comply with the nhpa prior to construction would produce public interest benefits by ensuring,in compliance with federal environmental statutes,that no potentially irreversible harm to the environment occurs,at,and the order concluded that the tower registration process constitutes a federal undertaking under the nhpa.at.the commission notice of proposed rulemaking for the npa order did not explicitly state that the commission would not reconsider these conclusions.instead,after identifying several specific issues for review,including whether the npa should provide for exclusion of certain undertakings from routine section review,the nprm requested comments on any other issues related to the draft nationwide agreement.at emphasis added.
this paragraph comes after a previous footnote indicating that the npa contained an illustrative list of commission activities in relation to which undertakings covered by the draft npa may occur,which was attached to the nprm.id.at.that illustrative list proposed that tower construction,to the extent covered by the fcc registration process,would constitute an undertaking under the npa,id.at,as the order previously concluded with respect to the general section process.the draft npa further noted that applicants are required to prepare,and the commission is required to independently review and approve,a environmental assessment ea in cases where a proposed tower or antenna may significantly affect the environment.id.at.
although a general invitation to comment,by itself,may not thr o w the rulemaking open to any possible changes that any member of the public might conjure up with the result that summary denial of such changes becomes reviewable by the courts,reversionary property owners,at,a mbiguity in an nprm may tilt toward a finding that the issue has been reopened,id.at.c onsider ing the cited language in the nprm in the entire context of the rulemaking,id.at quoting public citizen,at,the commission proceedings are fairly read as reopening the issue of why tower constructions constitute federal undertakings subject to the nhpa and the new npa.
the npa order began its discussion of this issue by stating that the commission decline d to revisit,as beyond the scope of this proceeding,the commission existing interpretation that the construction of antennas and support facilities is a federal undertaking under the nhpa.at see also id.at.the commission then went on to clarify that its notice of proposed rulemaking did not seek comment on the question whether the commission should,assuming that it possesses statutory authority to do so,continue our current treatment of tower construction as an undertaking for purposes of the nhpa and that t herefore,the commission decline d to revisit that question in this docket.id.at.this clarification appears to suggest that the commission declined to revisit the question whether it is in the public interest to require historic properties to be taken into consideration prior to tower subject of the order.the commission made no statement that it declined to reconsider whether it had statutory authority to treat tower construction as an undertaking,and in fact proceeded to address this issue.see npa order,at explaining that the commission expressly retained a limited approval authority for all tower construction to the extent necessary to ensure compliance with federal environmental statutes id.at addressing why tower registration constitut es an approval process within the commission q authority.even assuming arguendo the commission could foreclose judicial review of a new reason given for an old conclusion by stating that it is not reopening an issue,the commission did not explicitly do so here.
finally,the npa order indisputably offers two new justifications not found in the order or order.in fact,these two justifications offer the commission first explicit rationales for concluding that tower construction is an undertaking,explaining that the fcc tower registration process and its approval authority under nepa constitute undertakings.looking to the entire context of the rulemaking,reversionary property owners,at quoting public citizen,at,the fcc reopened the undertaking issue ctia challenges where the commission nprm was ambiguous,its order did not foreclose reopening the precise matters at issue,and those matters constituted the commission first legal rationales for its action to date.thus,we have jurisdiction to hear ctia challenge.
ctia urges that the npa order was arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.ctia contends that the fcc erred in concluding that tower construction constitutes a federal undertaking and properties eligible for inclusion under section,include not only proprieties formally designated as such by the secretary of the interior,but also properties that meet the criteria outlined in the statute and implementing regulations.we find no error.
a.the fcc conclusion that tower construction constitutes an undertaking.
section of the nhpa requires federal agencies to take into account the effect of the undertaking.id.emphasis added.thus,whether the protections of section are triggered turns on whether there has been an undertaking.id.the act defines an undertaking as 
a project,activity,or program funded in whole or in part under the direct or indirect jurisdiction of a federal agency,including 
a those carried out by or on behalf of the agency 
b those carried out with federal financial assistance 
c those requiring a federal permit,license,or approval and 
d those subject to state or local regulation administered pursuant to a delegation or approval by a federal agency.
emphasis added.
in sheridan kalorama historical ass christopher,we noted that u pon a first reading,the definition seems actually to confine the notion of an undertaking to a project funded in whole or in part under the direct or indirect jurisdiction of a federal agency,and thus by omission to exclude a federally licensed project from the coverage of the statute,emphasis added.we rejected that reading,however,because it would deprive the references to licensing in of any practical effect.id.we thus held that congress intended to expand the definition of an undertaking formerly limited to federally funded or licensed include projects requiring a federal permit or merely federal approval.id.thus,under sheridan kalorama,a project,activity,or program,does not require federal funding to be an undertaking under section of the nhpa.see id.instead,only a federal permit,license or approval is required.id.c.because the npa order only focuses on whether federal approval,id.c emphasis added,is required for tower construction,npa order,at,our task is relatively straightforward we must determine whether the fcc acted arbitrarily or capriciously in concluding that tower construction requires federal approval.c.
in the npa order,as we have noted,the fcc concluded that tower construction requires federal approval because the commission tower registration process may be viewed as effectively constituting an approval process within the commission section q authority,at,and a limited approval authority retained by the fcc with respect to nepa additionally constitutes federal approval,id.at.
with respect to the first ground,discussing its tower registration regulations implemented pursuant to section q of the communications act of,see npa order,at citing q,the fcc concluded that its tower registration process provides a permissible means by which the commission may assure,prior to construction,that towers do not pose a risk to air safety,id.at.section of the commission regulations requires a party seeking to build a tower to consult with the federal aviation administration faa if the proposed tower meets certain height and location criteria.an owner of such a proposed tower must then register the structure with the commission.a.subject to certain exceptions,an owner must submit a valid faa determination of no hazard as part of the registration request.id.b.if the owner does not or can not submit a no hazard determination,processing of the registration may be delayed or disapproved.id.d.
the npa order concluded that the fcc having conditioned its approval in the regulations upon receiving the requisite faa clearance amounts to an approval process.npa order,at.this conclusion built upon an earlier statement in the order,albeit addressing the commission tower registration process generally and not speaking to the nhpa.there,the fcc noted that p roposal sic antenna structures that are determined by the faa to present a potential hazard to air navigation must be lighted during construction and that the commission registration process is the federal government only method of requiring such safety lighting,as the faa does not have statutory authority to mandate the painting or lighting of antenna structures.at.
ctia argues this registration process is wholly ministerial and thus do es not create federal undertakings.petitioner br.at.ctia directs us to a portion of the order indicating that upon receipt of the faa determination for the structure,the electronic filing capability will enable the owner to register the structure with the commission and receive a registration number within minutes.at emphasis added.ctia argues that because the commission can make this determination within minutes,it must be a ministerial determination and not truly a process amounting to federal approval,c,that would make tower construction a federal undertaking,see.ctia omits from its brief,however,the portion of the order set out with emphasis above upon receipt of the faa determination for the structure.petitioner br.at discussing at.the fcc has chosen,through its registration regulations,to grant approval of a registration if it receives a no hazard determination from the faa.see d.if it does not,as we have noted,the fcc regulations allow the commission in its discretion to delay or disapprove a registration.id.ctia never addresses d,but we fail to see how the commission approval under that section the federal government only method of requiring safety lighting,order,at constitute federal approval,c.thus,the npa order was neither arbitrary nor capricious,see a,in determining that tower construction,to the extent covered by the fcc registration process,constitutes a federal undertaking subject to section of the nhpa 
as a second ground for concluding that tower construction requires federal approval,the npa order concluded that the fcc has expressly retained a limited approval authority for all tower construction to the extent necessary to ensure compliance with federal environmental statutes.at.specifically,among other things,the fcc requires that owners submit for its approval,prior to tower construction,environmental assessments called for by nepa.see npa order,at.where a facility may have a significant environmental impact,the fcc regulations require that an environmental assessment shall be submitted by the owner and ruled on by the commission prior to the initiation of construction of the facility.b emphasis added see npa order,at.
the environmental assessment is a document that explain s the environmental consequences of the proposal and set s forth sufficient analysis for the commission to reach a determination that the proposal will or will not have a significant environmental effect.b.where a proposal,such as a proposed wireless communications tower,has a significant environmental effect,the fcc is required by nepa to consult with expert federal agencies and,following such consultation,to prepare a detailed environmental impact statement eis.see c.
by requiring a ruling on each environmental assessment prior to tower construction,the fcc has retained authority over tower construction in order to ensure that it complies with nepa.whatever else approval may mean,we see no basis for ctia suggestion that the fcc retention of authority to rule on,b,a party submission under nepa can not constitute approval,c.we conclude that the npa order was neither arbitrary nor capricious,see a,in determining that the fcc approval authority under nepa makes tower construction an undertakin
