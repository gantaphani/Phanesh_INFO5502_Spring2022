qwest,the incumbent local exchange carrier ilec in omaha,nebraska,petitioned the federal communications commission for forbearance under c of the communications act,c,from some of its obligations under c and of the act,in the omaha metropolitan statistical area msa.the commission granted the petition in part,relieving qwest of the duty to provide its competitors access to certain unbundled network elements.in re petition of qwest corporation for forbearance pursuant to c in the omaha metropolitan statistical area,fcc rcd,wl order.qwest and several competing local exchange carriers clecs now seek review of various aspects of the commission order.
qwest asserts that the commission failed to act on its forbearance request before a statutory deadline,and that therefore the petition should have been deemed granted in full.the clec petitioners,in turn,challenge the commission grant of forbearance as to c and c b ii,attacking the commission interpretation of d of the act as unreasonable and its analysis under a and b as arbitrary and capricious.qwest claim,however,is barred by the exhaustion requirement of a,a conclusion compelled by in re core communications,core.we find the clecs claims.
qwest petition requested forbearance from many of the statutory and regulatory obligations to which it is subject as the incumbent local exchange carrier in the omaha msa,including its obligations under c and the competitive checklist requirements of c b i vi and xiv.order,fcc rcd at.section of the act provides that the commission shall forbear from applying any regulation or any provision if it determines that the enforcement of such a regulation or provision is not necessary to ensure that rates or services are just and reasonable and are not unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory enforcement is not necessary for the protection of consumers and forbearance from applying such a regulation or provision is consistent with the public interest.a.in evaluating the public interest,the commission must ask whether forbearance will promote competitive market conditions.id.b.section d provides that no petition for forbearance may be granted as to the obligations in c or until the commission determines that those requirements have been fully implemented.id.d.
any petition for forbearance shall be deemed granted if the commission does not deny the petition within one year after the commission receives it,unless the commission extends the deadline an additional days.id.c.the commission timely granted itself a extension and,on the last day of the extended period,issued a news release announcing that it had voted to grant qwest petition in part.news release,fcc grants qwest forbearance relief in omaha msa,joint appendix at.the release stated that the commission was relieving qwest of the obligation to provide unbundled network elements unes to competitors in of qwest wire center service areas,noting the substantial infrastructure investment made by cox communications,in its competitive network in the omaha msa.id.the release explained,however,that the commission was leaving in place the other requirements of c,as well as the obligation under to provide wholesale access to local loops,transport,and switching at just and reasonable prices.id.
the commission issued the text of its order on december,stating,anomalously,that its decision shall be effective on friday,september.fcc rcd at.as prefigured in the release,the order granted qwest forbearance from providing unbundled loops and dedicated transport elements under c,as well as related obligations in c and.the commission found those sections to have been fully implemented within the meaning of d.fcc rcd at.the substantial intermodal competition provided by cox cable plant was sufficient to merit forbearance,the commission held,in light of the continued applicability of other statutory and regulatory provisions designed to promote competition,such as the resale and interconnection requirements under c,and access to loops,switching,and transport services under c b iv vi.fcc rcd at.the commission relieved qwest from the application of certain dominant carrier regulations under and in mass market switched access and mass market broadband internet access services,but it denied the petition in all other respects.id.at.
we begin with qwest claim that its petition should have been deemed granted under c because the commission actions a vote and press release did not constitute a den ial under c.
a provides that t he filing of a petition for reconsideration shall not be a condition precedent to judicial review of any such order of the commission except where the party seeking such review relies on questions of fact or law upon which the commission has been afforded no opportunity to pass.as we noted in core,this circuit has strictly construed a,holding that we generally lack jurisdiction to review arguments that have not first been presented to the commission.at internal quotation marks omitted.while the statute does not require that the commission opportunity be afforded in any particular manner,or by any particular party,coalition for noncommercial media fcc,the commission must have somehow been put on notice of the problem.time warner entertainment fcc,time warner.
qwest acknowledges both the fact that it never raised the issue before the commission and the principle that failure to do so is excused merely because the issue arose unequivocally only at the moment the commission took action.that principle is clear.in core,as here,the commission voted to deny a petition for forbearance and issued a press release within the statutory deadline,publishing its written order only after the deadline had passed like qwest,core then argued,without seeking reconsideration,that its petition should be deemed granted.at.yet,noting our precedents under a,we held that even when a petitioner has no reason to raise an argument until the fcc issues an order that makes the issue relevant,the petitioner must file a petition for reconsideration with the commission before it may seek judicial review.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
qwest tries to distinguish core by noting a subtle difference between its claim and core.whereas core argued that the commission was bound by c to issue a fully fledged explanation of its ruling by the deadline on pain of the petition being deemed granted,qwest argues more modestly that c requires simply a legally effective public notice with enough detail about the rulings to allow the parties to alter their course of conduct.qwest reply br.at.this situates qwest claim it says under step one in the conventional lexicon of chevron natural resources defense council,d,a claim to which congress has spoken directly.by contrast,qwest locates core claim under step two,pointing to our statement in core that we would ordinarily accord deference to the commission interpretation of c under chevron,and that petitioner failure to have raised its claim before the commission create d a problem regarding the extent of deference we owe the fcc statutory interpretation.core,at.exhaustion under a would serve no purpose here,qwest contends,because its claim is that the commission violated the plain meaning of c,a question on which a reviewing court would owe the commission no deference.
we think qwest has misread core on two levels.first,we see no evidence that the court judged core claim to fall within step two.the court never embarks on an exegesis of c,thus exercising a wholly in keeping with one of the functions of exhaustion avoid premature judicial pronouncements.moreover,the court statement quoted we would ordinarily accord deference to the commission interpretation of c makes complete sense as a simple recognition that a commission reading of c would fall within the general bailiwick of chevron analysis.
second,even if core had classified core argument as belonging to step two,exhaustion is not excused simply because we might owe an agency no deference.section a applies on its face to all questions of fact or law.a.this court has frequently required exhaustion for questions on which the commission would have received no deference.see,lutheran synod fcc,first amendment claim time warner,at collecting cases requiring exhaustion for asserted violations of administrative procedure act.in fact,we have been sticklers in requiring a exhaustion where a party complains of only a technical or procedural mistake,such as an obvious violation of a specific apa requirement.id.at.
moreover,although courts have acknowledged the relationship between administrative exhaustion and deference to administrative agencies,see mccarthy madigan,d,exhaustion serves other purposes as well.for instance,o ne of the purposes of section is to afford the commission the initial opportunity to correct errors in its decision or the proceeding leading to decision a goal equally applicable here.time warner,at quoting rogers radio communication services fcc,alterations in original see also mccarthy,at.exhaustion discourages disregard of agency procedures woodford ngo,d agency proceedings generally resolve claims much more quickly and economically than courts and may produce a useful record for subsequent judicial consideration.
qwest next attempts to distinguish core by arguing that the commission here had already provided its view on the issue,it had had an opportunity to pass for purposes of a.qwest relies primarily on the order reference to c in its effective date paragraph,fcc rcd at,and a footnote from a report unrelated to the instant proceedings,in re biennial regulatory review,fcc rcd,wl f ailure to act on a forbearance petition within the statutory period causes it to be granted by operation of law.see also petition of core communications,for forbearance under c from application of the isp remand order,fcc rcd,wl noting c requirements and the statutory consequences of failure to meet the deadline.but while the cited phrases manifest commission awareness of the statutory deadline,they can not be described as dispositions of an unmade claim that a vote and press release on the statutory deadline could not qualify as a den ial under c.see qwest br.at.moreover,qwest ignores our recent statement in the commission had employed an provision virtually identical to the one a barred us from being the first authority to construe the meaning of c.at.
finally,qwest urges us to recognize certain exceptions to the exhaustion requirement where agency action is alleged to be ultra vires,and where seeking an agency view would be futile.in fact,the parties dispute the existence of such exceptions.compare washington ass for television children fcc,watch interpreting to permit courts some discretion to waive exhaustion,and petroleum communications,fcc,discussing futility and patent violation s of the agency statutory authority as recognized exceptions to exhaustion requirement,with booth churner,d w e will not read futility or other exceptions into statutory exhaustion requirements where congress has provided otherwise,and avocados plus veneman,if the statute does mandate exhaustion,a court can not excuse it.we need not,however,resolve this disagreement even assuming the availability of such exceptions,qwest has failed to show that either applies.
in its ultra vires arguments,qwest looks to watch statement that exhaustion may be excused for challenges to agency action patently in excess of the agency authority.at quoting detroit edison nlrb,d alteration in original see also petroleum communications,at implying readiness to except patent violation s of statutory authority from a.whatever the exact meaning of c,we ca say that the commission action here falls into the outer darkness of a patent violation.see also mitchell christopher,ultra vires exception limited to challenges that concern the very composition or constitution of an agency northwest airlines,faa,failure to raise an issue will not be excused merely because the litigant couches its claim in terms of the agency exceeding its authority or jurisdiction.
as to futility,our decisions entertaining the exception have demanded a very convincing record.in omnipoint fcc,for example,we found futility only where the commission was rapidly expediting the proceeding and appeared wedded to the procedures that it had employed.at quoting city of brookings municipal.fcc.similarly,in tribune fcc,we suggested that futility was appropriate only where the commission position had crystallized or where the commission was firmly entrenched.and in science and technology network,fcc,we said that futility required a showing that an adverse decision was a certainty.
here qwest points to little more than the agency treatment of core petition,where it had taken a similar approach vote and press release on the deadline,with decision to follow.and in this case,it says,the timeliness arguments advanced in core put the commission on notice about disagreement with its reading of c.but one swallow does make a summer,and qwest points to no case and we are aware of none in which a single adverse decision by an agency,without more,demonstrated that its position had crystallized or that a future result was a certainty.
qwest adds that the c deadline would not bind the commission consideration of a petition for reconsideration.true enough,though hardly assurance that the commission would drag its feet on such a petition,especially with the potential of a mandamus action hovering in the background.moreover,the commission treatment of the deadline on core petition occurred in october,see core,at,at which point qwest petition had been pending for four months.qwest failure at that point to file a memo insisting on its view of c undermines its reliance on the risk of delay inherent in a petition for reconsideration.
thus we reject qwest claim as barred by the exhaustion requirement of a.
we next turn to the clec petitioners claims,beginning with their contention that c was not fully implemented for the purposes of d.our review of an agency interpretation of the statute it administers is governed by the familiar chevron framework,under which we ask first whether congress has directly spoken to the precise issue before us and,if it has not,whether the agency interpretation is reasonable.at.see also cellular telecommunications internet ass fcc.
section d of the act provides that the commission may not forbear from applying the requirements of section c or until it determines that those requirements have been fully implemented.d.in the order,the commission held that c had been fully implemented because the commission has issued rules implementing section c and those rules have gone into effect.fcc rcd at.the commission reasoned that the fcc itself is the entity that implements section c,noting that d requires the commission to complete all actions necessary to establish regulations to implement the requirements of.id.
the clecs dispute the commission reliance on d,and draw a contrast between that subsection requirement that the commission complete all actions necessary to establish regulations to implement c and d reference to fully implemented.d,d emphasis added.the commission reading of d,they argue,gives no meaning to the term fully,which in their view must implicate something more than the rulemaking contemplated by d.but the commission stated that c would be fully implemented only once the commission has completed its work of promulgating rules implementing section c and those rules have taken effect.fcc rcd at emphasis added.we can not say that such a reading is unreasonable.the statute does not define implemented,an ambiguity not clearly resolved one way or the other by reference to d.the commission interpretation does give independent meaning,albeit a modest one,to the term fully,that regulations have both been promulgated and taken effect.in addition,it might well be thought that completion of all actions necessary to establish regulations to implement a section would naturally add up to full implement ation of that section.we also note petitioners failure to have offered any workable alternative test.see clec br.at.
the clecs further believe that under the plain language of the commission can make a finding of full implementation of c only if it can point to implementing action by the ile
