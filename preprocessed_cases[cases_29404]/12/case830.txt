us west petitioned the federal communications commission fcc or commission,pursuant to of the telecommunications act of,stat,for forbearance from dominant carrier regulation in the provision of high capacity special access and dedicated transport for switched access services high capacity services in the phoenix and seattle metropolitan statistical areas msas.see petition of west communications,for forbearance from regulation as a dominant carrier in the phoenix,arizona msa,et,hereinafter forbearance order.in seeking forbearance,west relied heavily on evidence regarding its market share.the commission found,however,that west failed to provide the underlying raw data on which its conclusions were based,and,as a result,west findings were not verifiable.the commission thus reasonably rejected west market share evidence.
us west argues that the forbearance order should nevertheless be overturned,because the commission failed to consider evidence of supply elasticity and demand elasticity.in response to west claim,the commission held that market share data is critical to a prima facie showing of competition.id,at.in other words,because west offered no reliable data on market share,the commission determined that the petition for forbearance failed to make a prima facie showing that sufficient competition existed to satisfy the requirements of.the problem with this position,however,is that the fcc conclusion is inconsistent with its earlier decisions on this issue.in the past,the fcc has considered market share along with other factors such as supply elasticity,demand elasticity and comparative advantages in cost structure,size and resources.the fcc has even made a determination in the absence of any market share data,never suggesting that market share data is essential for a prima facie showing of competition.this case must therefore be remanded for further consideration by the agency.
and worldcom,in separate petitions for review,argue that the forbearance order should be vacated to the extent that it grants west forbearance under the pricing flexibility order.see in re access charge reform,hereinafter pricing flexibility order.in of the forbearance order,the commission stated that we grant the relief requested in the forbearance petitions to the extent that the pricing flexibility order establishes a framework pursuant to which the boc petitioners may obtain relief by demonstrating satisfaction of the competitive triggers adopted in that order.forbearance order,at.at the conclusion of the order,however,the commission explained that the pricing flexibility order establishes a mechanism by which the petitioners may receive much of the relief they seek without having to demonstrate loss of market power.id,at.the fcc therefore encourage d the boc petitioners to submit their petitions for any market,including the markets identified in their forbearance petitions,as soon as they have sufficient information to satisfy the required competitive triggers.id.and worldcom claim that,in referring west to the pricing flexibility order,the fcc effectively granted relief on a petition that was found meritless under.this is a specious claim.it is clear that,the forbearance order does nothing more than indicate that west is eligible to apply for relief under the pricing flexibility order no concrete relief was granted to west in the forbearance order.
during argument before this court,counsel for the fcc suggested that the mere availability of relief under the pricing flexibility order was itself sufficient to forestall a claim under.we reject this position.us west and other such petitioners are entitled to pursue forbearance under without regard to the pricing flexibility order.in other words,remains a viable and independent avenue of appeal for pricing flexibility.therefore,the fcc rejection of the west petition for forbearance does not survive review because of the availability of the pricing flexibility order.
background 
us west petitioned the commission to forbear from regulating it as a dominant carrier in high capacity services in the phoenix and seattle msas.petition of west communications,for forbearance from regulation as a dominant carrier in the phoenix,arizona msa,cc docket filed august,hereinafter phoenix pet,at petition of u s west communications,for forbearance from regulation as a dominant carrier for high capacity services in the seattle,washington msa,cc docket filed,hereinafter seattle pet,at iii.sbc companies,bell atlantic telephone companies,and ameritech operating companies boc petitioners also filed forbearance petitions seeking pricing flexibility in other markets throughout the united states.forbearance order,at.in seeking forbearance,west requested permissive,which would permit the filing of tariffs on one day notice with a presumption of lawfulness and without cost support,exemption from price cap and rate of return regulation,and permission to charge rates.phoenix pet.at seattle pet.at.
us west petition for forbearance rested on of the telecommunications act of.under,the commission will forbear from applying any regulation or any provision of the act to a telecommunications carrier or telecommunications service,or class of telecommunications carrier or telecommunications services,in any or some of its geographic markets,if the commission determines that enforcement of such regulation or provision is not necessary to ensure that the charges,practices,classifications or regulations by,for,or in connection with that telecommunications carrier or telecommunications service are just and reasonable,and are not unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory enforcement of such regulation or provision is not necessary for the protection of consumers and forbearance from applying such provision or regulation is consistent with the public interest.a.
in its petitions,west argued that the high capacity markets in the phoenix and seattle msas were robustly competitive,and,as a result,west did not have market power in those areas.us west based its claims primarily on reports prepared by quality strategies,power engineers pei,and economists alfred kahn and timothy tardiff.kahn and tardiff based their economic evaluation on the reports prepared by quality strategies and pei,in addition to their own research.in describing its diminished market power,west addressed several factors,including market participants,market share,demand elasticity of customers,supply elasticity of customers,and the carrier cost,structure,size,and resources.phoenix pet.at seattle pet.at.what follows is a brief review the evidence offered by west.
first,regarding market participants,west claimed that,in the phoenix msa,it faced competition from resellers and five competitors.us west emphasized that the merger of teleport communications group,one of its competitors,with tcg,and the pending merger of mci with another of its competitors,mfs worldcom worldcom,further contributed to robust competition.phoenix pet.at.in the seattle msa,west claimed to face competition from resellers and three competitors,tcg,electric lightwave,and worldcom.seattle pet.at.
second,in reference to market share,west emphasized that,based on the market analysis conducted by quality strategies,competitors have captured more than of the retail market for high capacity services in the phoenix msa.phoenix pet.at.in addition,competitors in the phoenix have captured significant portions of the growth in demand in the provider segment,high capacity services ultimately purchased by end users,and in the transport segment,high capacity services purchased by carriers for transport.id.at.in the seattle msa,west presented market analysis by quality strategies showing that competitors have almost of the retail market for high capacity services.seattle pet.at.moreover,competitors have captured about of the growth in demand for high capacity services.id.at iv.
third,in demonstrating high demand elasticity,west pointed out that,in the phoenix msa,customers for high capacity services are sophisticated businesses,some of which could migrate high capacity traffic to their own affiliated fiber networks.phoenix pet.at.us west emphasized that evidence showing that competitors hold significant portions of market share in the retail segment,and increasing portions of market share in the provider and transport segments of the market,further indicates demand elasticity.id.at.similarly,in the seattle msa,customers tend to be sophisticated businesses and governmental entities that are highly sensitive to price.seattle pet.at.in addition,as in the phoenix msa,west largest carrier customers in the seattle msa are able to migrate high capacity traffic to their own affiliated fiber networks.id.at.furthermore,kahn and tardiff explain that competitors high market share in the retail segment of the seattle market,and the rapid growth of competitors market share in the provider and transport segments of the market,reinforces demand elasticity.id.at.
fourth,in relation to supply elasticity in the phoenix msa,west explained that,based on quality strategies market reports,competitors have more than adequate excess capacity to constrain west pricing determinations.phoenix pet.at.us west five main competitors in the phoenix have put in place over route miles of optical fiber.in the phoenix msa,competitors fiber backbone networks would be able to assume west and transport traffic utilizing less than capacity.id.at.based on the pei study of the phoenix msa,west explained that if competitors invest million,they could serve almost of west high capacity customer locations within feet of their current fiber networks.id.at.kahn and tardiff pointed out that economies of scale and opportunities to bundle services make the investment to revenue comparison more favorable to competitors in the phoenix,msa.id.at.us west emphasized that the growth of competitors market share in the phoenix demonstrates that the cost of entry is not prohibitive.id.at.
similarly,in the seattle msa,competitors have in place more than route miles of optical fiber,with the capacity to service all of west end user and transport traffic.seattle pet.at.an estimated of west high capacity demand is located within feet of competitors networks.id.at iv.as a result,competitors could absorb west services relatively quickly.based on pei report,the cost to competitors of extending their fiber networks to take over most of west high capacity demand would not be prohibitive.if competitors invest million,they will be able to serve the almost of west high capacity customer locations within feet of their existing fiber networks.id.at.the significant growth of competitors market share demonstrates that the cost of entry is not prohibitive.as in the phoenix msa,kahn and tardiff emphasized that economies of scale and opportunities to bundle services make the investment to revenue ratio more favorable for potential competitors in the seattle msa.id.at.
fifth,west asserted that it did not have an advantage over its competitors in terms of relative size.in the phoenix msa,west faces five competitors,and the merged competitors tcg and worldcom have significant advantages in terms of economies of scale and access to capital.phoenix pet.at.kahn and tardiff explain that the fact that competition in the market in the phoenix has increased,while prices for services have decreased,strongly indicates that investors believe incumbents do not have absolute cost advantages in the market.id.at.
similarly,in the seattle msa,west does not benefit from comparative advantage in terms of costs,structure,size,and resources.as in the phoenix msa,tcg and have advantages based on size furthermore,increase in competitive entry into the market,despite the fact that west charges for high capacity services have declined,strongly indicates that west does not have an insurmountable cost advantage.seattle pet.at.
the commission received numerous comments arguing that west remained dominant in the markets for high capacity services in the phoenix and seattle msas,including comments criticizing quality strategies market reports.forbearance order,at.the commission denied west request for forbearance,finding west basis for evidence regarding market share,the market analysis conducted by quality strategies,could not be verified and,therefore,was not reliable.id,at.furthermore,the market share data was based on equivalents,which distorted the level of competition.finally,the commission rejected the market share analysis,because west focused on retail market share and,therefore,failed to account for the fact that even when west did not provide retail services,west still provided and received compensation for the underlying facilities.without quality strategies underlying evidence of market share,the commission found that west had failed to make a prima facie showing of competition and,therefore,did not satisfy the initial requirement for forbearance.id,at.
the commission,however,completely failed to address the evidence other than the market share data offered by west to show its diminished market,evidence relating to market participants,demand elasticity of customers,supply elasticity of customers,and the carrier cost,structure,size,and resources.it is this failing that is the focus of west petition for review.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
we review the commission order pursuant to familiar administrative procedure act standards,to determine whether it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or not in accordance with law.a.as the supreme court explained in motor vehicle manufacturers ass state farm mutual automobile insurance,d 
the scope of review under the arbitrary and capricious standard is narrow and a court is not to substitute its judgment for that of the agency.nevertheless,the agency must examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.burlington truck lines,united states,d.in reviewing that explanation,we must consider whether the decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment.bowman transportation,freight system,supra,at.citizens to preserve overton park volpe,supra,at.normally,an agency rule would be arbitrary and capricious if the agency has relied on factors which congress has not intended it to consider,entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem,offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency,or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.the reviewing court should not attempt itself to make up for such deficiencies we may not supply a reasoned basis for the agency action that the agency itself has not given.sec chenery.
id.at.in addition,the court has made it clear that when an agency determines to change an existing regulatory regime it must do so on the basis of reasoned analysis.id.at.
commission denial of forbearance 
the commission determined that it was not required to forbear from treating west as a dominant carrier solely because of three major areas of weakness in west evidence regarding market share.the commission principal concern appeared to be that the studies conducted by quality strategies analyzing west market share were not reliable.us west did not provide the underlying raw data on which the studies were based.as a result,the analysis could not be evaluated or verified.the commission noted,for example,that quality strategies failed to provide a copy of the questions and answers that were the basis of its surveys,and failed to describe how it weighted and evaluated responses to the surveys.forbearance order,at.without adequate information about quality strategies methods,the commission found that it was unable to resolve discrepancies between their market share evidence and evidence presented by other commentators.id,at.
the commission also faulted the material prepared by quality strategies insofar as it purported to measure market share by analyzing the percentage of capacity provided by various providers of high capacity services.a is a measure of capacity,and quality strategies used equivalents to measure market share.
