the telecommunications act of,pub,stat.codified at,requires incumbent local exchange carriers ilecs the bell operating companies and their successors,inheritors of local exchange facilities and lease unbundled network elements unes to their competitors,the competitive local exchange carriers clecs.see c of the act,c.the object is to enable clecs to provide telecommunications services in competition with the ilecs.petitioner competitive telecommunications association comptel is composed of clecs,many of also interexchange carriers ixcs.comptel seeks review of two interim federal communications commission orders,in re implementation of the local competition provisions of the telecommunications act of,supplemental order,fcc rcd,wl supplemental order,and in re implementation of the local competition provisions of the telecommunications act of,supplemental order clarification,fcc rcd,wl clarification,which impose some limits on comptel members access to certain unes.
specifically,the orders address clecs access to a combination of unes known as the enhanced extended link eel.eels consist of unbundled loops and transport network elements.clarification,fcc rcd at.a loop is a telephone line that runs from the customer premises to the ilec end office,which houses switches used to route calls to their destination.a transport then takes the traffic to the ixc or clec office,which will route the call to its final destination.leasing this combination of facilities enables new entrants to compete without building their own local loops and transport facilities.and it is especially desirable for them to acquire eels as unes because as such they are priced under a formula of the commission known as long run incremental cost,or telric.by contrast,the same functions are more costly if they are purchased as a part of the ilec tariffed services evidently under mandates imposed by the commission pursuant to,and known in this guise as special access services.
an eel is useful both for the provision of long distance and local service,and the commission here sought to channel clecs use of eels toward local service.in the supplemental order it limited access to firms who would use eels to provide a significant amount of local exchange service.supplemental order,fcc rcd at.in the clarification it refined this concept and embodied it in numerically defined safe harbors.clarification,fcc rcd at.
comptel contests the restriction favoring provision of local service,stating that the act does not allow the fcc to make that sort of distinction referred to as a use or a restriction.it further argues that none of the fcc justifications for the interim rules makes it acceptable.finally,it argues that the safe harbor provisions of the order are arbitrary and capricious,mainly asserting that they impose tracking burdens that are difficult or impossible for the clecs to fulfill and that they impose needless restrictions against commingling of local and long distance traffic.we first address the timeliness of this appeal.once having found jurisdiction,however,we are unpersuaded by comptel merits claims.
a petition for judicial review of a final order of the fcc must be filed within days after its entry.see also a.in this case,the petition for review was filed within days of the clarification but not within days of the supplemental order.respondent argues that it is timely only as to claims that arose from the clarification,not as to ones essentially aimed at the supplemental order.
but the clarification radically changed the supplemental order in a way we have not yet mentioned.in the supplemental order the commission said that it would issue a final decision on the eels restriction in the fourth further notice of proposed rulemaking fnprm,which notice will occur on or before june.supplemental order,fcc rcd at emphasis added.in its clarification,the fcc freed itself of this deadline,continuing to state that the order would last until the fourth fnprm but giving no time period in which that would occur.clarification,fcc rcd,at.
we hold that this extension newly aggrieved comptel and thus made its petition timely.see sam rayburn dam coop.fed.power comm n,stating that where a party was aggrieved by a later interpretation of a rule that it could not have reasonably anticipated,the time limit starts to run at the later event.cases have held that extension of a temporary order may entitle the parties to seek judicial review of the order.see public citizen nuclear regulatory comm n,holding that where a temporary order is later made permanent,the permanent order may be challenged illinois cent.gulf interstate commerce comm n,cir holding that a temporary order with no fixed time period had lasted so long as to make judicial review timely.
here the initial order appeared to present comptel with the prospect of enduring an interim order for a period of no more than six months.after six months,another order was issued extending the time period and setting no ultimate date of resolution.the rules have now been in place for over two and a half years.if we were to hold that such a petition is not timely,a party that found an order not worth litigating because of its apparently short term would have to sue for fear that it might drag on indefinitely.and we might also create a temptation for the fcc to let its deadlines slip.thus we find the petition for review timely.
comptel finds in the language of the act a bar on the commission making a distinction in deciding under what circumstances an ilec is required to lease unes.we review,of course,under the usual standard of chevron natural resources defense council,d,under which the court must give effect to the clearly expressed intent of congress,and must if the statute is ambiguous defer to any reasonable construction by the agency.the parties appear to assume that neither the act as a whole nor d b in particular requires that impairment findings be or that the une mandates be confined to services as to which such a finding has been made accordingly we do not address those issues,but rather try only to answer the question of whether the act bars such distinctions.
the first source comptel points to as a basis for barring a other words,requiring that any une be mandatory for all telecommunications services,once it is found appropriate for one telecommunications c.it says that incumbent local exchange carriers have 
t he duty to provide,to any requesting telecommunications carrier for the provision of a telecommunications service,nondiscriminatory access to network elements on an unbundled basis at any technically feasible point 
we do not see that the phrase for the provision of a telecommunications service helps comptel.if congress had spoken of the provision of any telecommunications service,the language might conceivably be taken to suggest that once an element was ordered to be made available for one telecommunications service,it must be made available for all.but the vaguer phrasing chosen by congress does not lend itself even to that suggestion.
comptel also sees hope in d b,which states that 
i n determining what network elements should be made available for purposes of subsection c of this section,the commission shall consider,at a minimum,whether 
b the failure to provide access to such network elements would impair the ability of the telecommunications carrier seeking access to provide the services that it seeks to offer.
d emphasis added.far from helping comptel cause,this passage seems to cut strongly against it.by referring to the services that the requesting carrier seeks to offer,it seems to invite an inquiry that is specific to particular carriers and services.that the commission has never gone down the path of une analysis provides no basis that we can see for making it forego limitations.
in united states telecom association federal communications commission,usta,we clearly found in the fcc an authority to make distinctions that were based on regional differences or on customer markets.see id.at.if these are permissible,it is hard to understand why the act would not allow restrictions keyed to a specific service of the requesting carriers.the clarification offers the essential and compelling reasoning 
although ambiguous,that language d is reasonably construed to mean that we may consider the markets in which a competitor seeks to offer services and,at an appropriate level of generality,ground the unbundling obligation on the competitor entry into those markets in which denial of the requested elements would in fact impair the competitor ability to offer services.
clarification,fcc rcd at.comptel theory,by contrast,would mean that once the commission found a single purpose as to which an element met the impairment standard,no matter how limited,it would be forced to mandate provision of the element for all,no matter how little potential impairment was involved in the remainder of the telecommunications field.comptel never explains what logic could have persuaded congress to lock the commission into such a scheme.
comptel also claims support in the act definition of a network element as a facility or equipment used in the provision of a telecommunications service.see.we can not discern a bar on mandates in this bland phrasing.
finally,comptel argues that past orders of the fcc make it clear that the fcc understood the statute not to allow it to make a distinction.comptel points to orders issued by the fcc both before and after the court decision in iowa utilities board,d.see in re implementation of the local competition provisions in the telecommunications act of,first report and order,fcc rcd at,wl local competition order in re implementation of the local competition provisions of the telecommunications act of,third report and order and fourth further notice of proposed rulemaking,fcc rcd at,wl une remand order.in the clarification the fcc indeed acknowledged that 
b efore the supreme court issued its decision in iowa utilities board,we sometimes approached an incumbent obligation to unbundle network elements as though it were an proposition,suggesting that,if a competitor were entitled to obtain access to an element for one purpose,it was generally also entitled to obtain access to that element for wholly different purposes as well.
see clarification,fcc rcd at.the fcc further acknowledged that it had not properly focused on the relationship between that issue and the impair standard,and that the court opinion in iowa utilities board made it appropriate to revisit the issue.id.the commission is clearly correct that iowa utilities board required it to limit its former interpretation of the necessary and impair language of d.iowa utils,at.at see also usta,at.
comptel points out that the fcc statement in the une remand order followed iowa utilities board comptel reads the statement as a reaffirmation of a prohibition on use restrictions.but the relevant section plainly does no more than accurately recount past commission conclusions,repeatedly saying,the commission found,and closing with the observation that its rule against usage restrictions was not challenged in court by any party.une remand order,fcc rcd at.other provisions of the order made it clear that the fcc did not consider the issue at all settled.see,id.at.the fcc is obviously reconsider orders that rest on faulty readings of a statute.that is all it has done here.
comptel next argues that even if the commission is authorized to place restrictions on the use of unes,it acted arbitrarily and capriciously because its justifications for doing so here were unreasonable.as we said above,all hands assume that the commission can mandate provision of a une for all telecommunications services even though its finding of d b impairment is based on only one service.but it is far from obvious to us that the fcc has the power,without an impairment finding as to nonlocal services,to require that ilecs provide eels for such services on an unbundled basis.here there is no finding by the commission that lack of access to eels would impair clecs ability to provide long distance or exchange access service.rather the fcc observed in the clarification that it had the power to inquire into whether there was any such impairment,clarification,fcc rcd at,but it then explicitly declined to reach that question without a chance to gather evidence,id.at.comptel makes no argument that the commission should have or even could have made any finding without further evidence.as both parties assume,however,that the commission can require a network element to be unbundled for all services when it only finds it to be impaired as to one service,we accept the assumption arguendo and address the question of whether it exercised reasonable judgment in withholding such a requirement here.
the fcc gives in essence two justifications for its interim restrictions on the unbundling of eels.first,it argues that the rule is necessary to avoid disruption of its reform of access charge policies and of the implicit subsidies for universal service that remain embedded in access charges.it also reasons that its restrictions are needed to promote competition.
avoidance of market disruption pending broader reforms is,of course,a standard and accepted justification for a temporary rule.see,mci telecommunications fed.communications comm n,see also acs of anchorage,fed.communications comm n.here the broader reform involves an attempt to make access charges more truly cost based and to correct the divergences from cost that have been mandated in the interest of implicitly subsidizing some users at the expense of others.see in re access charge reform,first report and order,fcc rcd at,wl access charge reform order.both of the orders that the fcc cites as part of its access charge reform policies are steps on the way to eliminating implicit subsidies.in re access charge reform,sixth report and order in cc docket and,report and order in cc docket,eleventh report and order in cc docket,fcc rcd at,wl calls order.
the link between access charge reform and unrestricted access to eels is that without the restrictions competitive carriers would use eels as an alternative to switched access services and thus avoid paying the implicit subsidy,undermining the subsidy scheme.supplemental order,fcc rcd at.
comptel does not appear to deny either that the commission can justify a policy by reference to the purposes of avoiding disruption pending a broader reform,or that the eel restriction would disrupt implicit subsidies contained in access charges.rather,it asserts that the access reform is actually complete rather than pending,so that the commission justification is pure pretext.
the first variation of this claim is an argument that a requires elimination of implicit subsidies within months of adoption of the act,by may thus,apparently,any residual implicit subsidies are illegitimate and not a permissible basis for the commission orders.this is a misreading of a.the section requires that the commission start a proceeding to assess recommendations of a joint board on the subject and complete the proceeding within months of the date of enactment,setting a timetable for the reform.a.but there is no time limit on realization of the reform.and the petitioner offers no evidence to show why the proposed timetable given by the calls order is unreasonable.
second,comptel argues that the calls order,issued two days prior to the supplemental order,immediately eliminated implicit subsidies for universal service,replacing them with an explicit mechanism of support.since the fcc has totally removed implicit subsidies,comptel claims there are none left to protect.in support comptel cites and other sections of the calls order,arguing that the fcc estimated the cost of universal support to be million per year and immediately created an explicit support mechanism of exactly that amount.see calls order,fcc rcd at.but a close look at the calls order makes clear that implicit subsidies are phased out over time.
the calls order identifies a number of elements in access charges that have been sources of revenue for implicit subsidies.see id.at.it names the business presubscribed interexchange carrier charge picc,which is a flat charge imposed by a ilec on an end user ixc,see id.at,carrier commo
