background 
bellsouth,as a telecommunications services provider,is subject to federal regulation under the federal communications act fca,et.the fca requires carriers such as bellsouth to file with the federal communications commission fcc,and make publicly available,certain schedules,or tariffs,explaining all of the charges,practices,and regulations affecting them.a.the fca also requires bellsouth and other telecommunications services providers to contribute a percentage of their revenues to a universal service fund usf,d,which is designed to provide affordable telecommunications services to rural and areas,id.b.bellsouth required contribution to the usf is listed in the tariffs bellsouth filed with the fcc.in re joint bd.on universal,fcc,wl,at,may.
under fcc regulations in place at the time hill filed her first amended complaint,bellsouth was permitted to recoup its required usf contribution from its customers,either through the rates it charged or as a separate itemized charge in re joint bd.on universal,fcc,wl,at.bellsouth chose to impose a separate itemized charge of indicated on each customer monthly bill as the federal universal service charge fusc,ex.a at.like bellsouth required contribution to the usf,the dollar amount of the fusc levied on bellsouth customers was included and explained in the tariffs that bellsouth filed with the fcc.id.at,unnumbered.
hill filed a complaint in the state court of fulton county,georgia,raising various claims regarding bellsouth recoupment,through the fusc,of an amount in excess of its required contribution to the usf.she alleged six claims based on the georgia unfair trade practices act,et fraud and negligent misrepresentation conversion unjust enrichment breach of duty of good faith and fair dealing and breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act.as for damages,the district court construed hill complaint as requesting purely monetary,recovery of bellsouth undisclosed charges in excess of its contributions to the fund.hill bellsouth,d.
bellsouth removed the action to the district court for the northern district of georgia pursuant to and,on the ground that hill causes of action raised federal questions because they either were completely preempted by the fca or raised substantial questions of federal law.based on its assertion that federal jurisdiction existed,bellsouth also filed a motion to dismiss hill claims as barred under the federal filed rate doctrine.hill,on the other hand,filed a motion to remand the case to its state court of origin on the ground that none of her claims gave rise to federal subject matter jurisdiction.
the district court agreed with bellsouth that hill claims based on conversion,unjust enrichment,breach of duty of good faith and fair dealing,and breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act gave rise to federal question jurisdiction because they were completely preempted by the fca.after finding federal jurisdiction for these claims and,thereby,impliedly denying hill motion to remand these four claims,the district court granted bellsouth motion to dismiss them pursuant to the filed rate doctrine.hill,d at.hill did not appeal the dismissal of these four claims.
the district court disagreed,however,that hill two remaining of the georgia unfair trade practices act and fraud and negligent misrepresentation also gave rise to federal question jurisdiction because it concluded that these two claims were not completely preempted by the fca.id.the district court then declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over these claims and,therefore,granted hill motion to remand them to their state court of origin thereby impliedly denying bellsouth motion to dismiss these claims.id.at.bellsouth now appeals the district court implied denial of its motion to dismiss these two claims.
ii.analysis 
before we may proceed to the merits,we must first address whether we have appropriate jurisdiction to hear the appeal.we conclude a that we have appropriate appellate jurisdiction and b that bellsouth motion to dismiss hill remaining two claims should have been granted.
appellate jurisdiction 
hill argues that our jurisdiction to consider bellsouth appeal was limited for two reasons.first,she contends that s ince bellsouth notice of appeal did not expressly address the order of remand,only that portion of the order denying their motion to dismiss the remanded claims is before this court.appellee br.at.second,she argues that,under federal rule of civil procedure b,the district court order was not a final decision under because it did not dispose of all the claims in hill action.we address each of hill misplaced concerns in turn.
bellsouth notice of appeal 
bellsouth notice of appeal states its intention to appeal from the portion of the district court order denying defendant motion to dismiss plaintiff claims for violation of the georgia unfair trade practices act and for fraud and negligent misrepresentation in their entirety.at.while it is true that t he general rule in this circuit is that an appellate court has jurisdiction to review only those judgments,orders or portions thereof which are specified in an appellant notice of appeal,osterneck barwick,cir,this circuit also embraces a policy of liberal construction of notices of appeal when unnoticed claims or issues are inextricably intertwined with noticed ones and the adverse party is not prejudiced,may marine supply brunswick,cir 
in this case,the district court implied denial of bellsouth motion to dismiss hill two remaining claims and its grant of hill motion to remand those claims are inextricably intertwined the district court impliedly denied bellsouth motion to dismiss hill claims because it expressly granted hill motion to remand those claims.since these issues are so interrelated,hill is not prejudiced by our consideration of the district court grant of her motion to remand because the propriety of the district court decision to remand and its implied decision to deny bellsouth motion to dismiss require consideration of the same legal issue whether federal question jurisdiction should have attached to hill two remaining claims.
the finality of the district court order 
under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure,in actions involving multiple claims for relief an order that finally disposes of one or more but fewer than all of the claims for relief asserted does not terminate the action in the district court and is not appealable as a final order pursuant to.huckeby frozen food express,cir.although the district court allowed two of hill claims to proceed in state court,these two claims were terminate d for purposes of further action by the district court,thereby making the district court order one that is final and appealable in this court.engelhardt paul revere life ins,cir concluding that the decision of a district court to remand claims based on a denial of supplemental jurisdiction under c is appealable.
b.the merits of bellsouth appeal 
because we have jurisdiction to hear bellsouth appeal,we now turn to a discussion of the merits of its appeal.in this discussion,we will state the proper standard of review,discuss
