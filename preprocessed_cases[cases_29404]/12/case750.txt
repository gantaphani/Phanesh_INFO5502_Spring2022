appellant communications and control,cci would no doubt agree that geographic change can make all the difference.for cci a change in longitude would have allowed its transmitter to operate from terra firma rather than not at all.instead of permitting cci to amend its license to reflect the transmitter true location,however,the federal communications commission fcc or commission cancelled the license,concluding that no station could have been authorized to operate where cci application dot on the pacific ocean.cci now appeals,claiming that the commission arbitrarily and capriciously refused to allow a correction.see a.we agree and,accordingly,reverse and remand.
following a lottery of spectrum in the megahertz mhz band,the commission in granted cci a broadcast license to operate a phase i mhz trunked radio system under the call sign cci application proposed to transmit from mount allison,milpitas,california,at a latitude of north and a longitude of west.but the longitude coordinate cci supplied in fact indicated a location one approximately of mount allison in the pacific ocean.unaware of cci error,the commission granted the application.still unaware of the error itself,cci supplied the bad longitude coordinate again when notifying the commission that it had constructed its station and was operating from mount allison.
months later,cci informed the commission of an inconsistency with the a ntenna l ongitude in its application and requested that the commission change the longitude coordinate listed on its license from west to west.deferred appendix.the land mobile branch branch of the licensing division division of the wireless telecommunications bureau wtb denied cci request,finding that cci failed to make a timely effort to correct its application.the branch further instructed cci to submit its license for cancellation,explaining that applications are processed based on the coordinate information provided by the applicant,and since there are no frequencies available at cci requested location,cci should submit its license for cancellation.
cci responded to the branch letter with another of its own.its second a second request for coordinate correction again sought to correct the coordinate and included an engineering study in an effort to show that its operation from mount allison adequately protected comtech neighboring station call sign from harmful interference.the branch again denied cci request,this time rejecting cci interference analysis as untimely and wrong.relying on its own technical analysis,the branch explained that cci failed to meet the exception for contained in section f of the commission because station does not receive of protection and the dbu contour of station overlaps the dbu contour of station by more than kilometers.
cci responded with another letter this one met a slightly different fate from the previous two.although the branch rejected cci claim that the incorrect coordinate on its license is a typographical error which has no bearing on its operations at mount allison,explaining that s ince cci did not timely request a change of its coordinates,its application was processed consistent with its stipulated coordinates,it nevertheless offered that i f cci desires to modify its license to correct those coordinates,it must wait for the filing window for mhz applications to reopen.the branch further proposed that,in the meantime,d ue to the circumstances,cci may request sta special temporary authority to obtain legal authority for its operation on mount allison.id.cci took the branch advice and the branch granted it sta for six months.
before the sta expired,cci requested an extension.the branch denied the request,however,noting that comtech had complained that cci operations were interfering with its own and that cci was not in compliance with rule f at the requested relocation.cci responded by submitting an application to modify its license to allow it to permanently transmit from mount allison and,shortly thereafter,by petitioning the branch for reconsideration of the denial of its extension request.
following the branch denial of the extension request,the commission separately advised cci of comtech interference complaint and ordered it to cease operati ng.cci responded by reminding the commission that its petition for reconsideration remained pending before the branch and stated that it would await further review before determining whether the operating status of station should be altered.
the division later denied cci petition for reconsideration along with its application for authority to permanently transmit from mount allison.the division concluded,as the branch had before,that cci failed to comply with commission rule f because it proposes to operate kilometers from comtech station and its proposed relocation failed to provide db of protection to comtech protected site.cci next applied to the commission for review of the division decision the commission was no more receptive than the division.
finding that the staff correctly instructed cci to submit its license for cancellation,the commission denied cci application for review.communications control,request for extension of special temporary authority modification of authorization of mhz system comtech communications,request for extension of special temporary authority modification of authorization of mhz system,memorandum opinion order,fcc rcd hereinafter first order.cci license was void ab initio,said the commission,because it flowed from an administrative error cci would have been granted no license had the commission realized that cci requested coordinates were for a site in the pacific ocean.id.at.the commission also rejected cci contention that it,the commission,should have discovered the error in processing the application,observing that the burden of providing accurate information rests on the the that,accordingly,the commission is entitled to rely on the site coordinates an applicant provides.id.
the commission also offered a response to cci contention that it was entitled to an opportunity to correct the error on its application.id.at.the commission first deemed cci argument irrelevant,stating that the burden is on the applicant to provide accurate site information in its application.id.the commission then noted that,even if cci original application had contained the correct coordinates,cci would not have been licensed because cci application would have been mutually exclusive with comtech application and the latter,based on its higher filing priority,would have been granted the only license.id.
further,the commission rejected cci argument that it should have been able to modify its application under the procedures outlined in the commission second report order in the amendment of part of the commission rules to provide for the use of the mhz band by the private land mobile radio service docket id.at.this procedure was unavailable to cci,the commission said,because the right to relocate was available only to an applicant holding a valid mhz license and cci,as the commission earlier concluded,had none.id.as the commission put it,because cci initial license was void,cci was effectively seeking a new license and this procedure was unavailable.id.the commission also iterated an earlier point cci would not have been authorized to operate from mount allison even had it initially applied to do so given its lower filing priority.id.the commission concluded,therefore,that the branch proper ly reject ed a modification application for a site that could not have been initially granted to the applicant.id.
the commission order did not end the matter.cci thereafter petitioned for reconsideration,which petition the chief of the commercial wireless division of the wtb dismissed as repetitious because cci presented no facts or circumstances the commission had not already considered.communications control,request for extension of special tempora
