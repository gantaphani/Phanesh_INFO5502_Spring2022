petitioners vernal enterprises,and larry schrecongost,the company president,seek review of an order of the federal communications commission fcc or the commission denying their request for refund of a filing fee paid in connection with a permit application for construction of a broadcast station.see vernal.vernal was one of a number of mutually exclusive applicants vying for a permit to construct a radio station in brookville,pennsylvania.in january,vernal and the other applicants filed a settlement agreement with the fcc pursuant to which the construction permit was awarded to another applicant.in april,two years after the fcc approved the settlement agreement and dismissed vernal application,petitioners requested a refund of the fee paid when vernal filed its application in.
the commission denied the refund request by memorandum opinion and order on july.the commission held that,under the applicable agency policy,application fees would be refunded only to applicants who had not resolved their mutually exclusive applications through negotiated agreements within days of august,and whose pending mutually exclusive applications would therefore be resolved pursuant to the agency newly implemented competitive bidding process.petitioners now seek review of the commission order,claiming that the agency denial of the refund request was arbitrary and capricious.a.
the commission first contends that the court is without jurisdiction to hear this case,because petitioners failed to appeal within the days allowed under b.see c.we reject this argument.petitioners are properly seeking review under a,and their petition for review was filed within the limitation applicable to that statutory provision.
the commission argues,in the alternative,that the agency enforcement of the disputed policy was reasonable and did not violate the arbitrary and capricious standard of the administrative procedure act.we agree.we therefore deny the petition for review.
background 
in august,congress amended j of the communications act the act to require the fcc to use competitive bidding also known as auctions,rather than comparative hearings,in connection with mutually exclusive applications for commercial broadcast authorizations.see balanced budget act of,a,stat.congress also added a new section to the communications act,l,allowing the commission to determine whether to use competitive bidding or comparative hearings in connection with mutually exclusive applications pending as of july.see a,stat.at.this new section also provided a period during which,applicants who entered into settlement agreements resolving mutual exclusivity would not be subject to fcc rules limiting the amount of settlement payments between applicants.see id.
in a notice of proposed rulemaking issued in november,the fcc tentatively concluded that the use of auctions to resolve pending comparative licensing cases would better serve the public interest than deciding them by comparative hearing implementation of section j of the communications act competitive bidding for commercial broadcast and instructional television fixed service licenses,notice of proposed rulemaking,hereinafter notice of proposed rulemaking.the commission noted that it was seeking comment on whether we should continue to use comparative hearings for some or all of these cases.id.at.in conjunction with its tentative decision to subject pending applications to competitive bidding,the commission also proposed to refund the filing fees paid by applicants who chose not to participate in the auction process.id.at.
in august,the fcc issued a report and order implementing its auction authority.see implementation of section j of the communications act competitive bidding for commercial broadcast and instructional television fixed service licenses,first report and order,on reconsideration,memorandum opinion and order,aff,orion communications,fcc,hereinafter report and order.the commission also promulgated a policy in conjunction with the report and order.the policy provided 
on or before the date for filing a application,pending applicants in all comparative licensing cases subject to resolution by competitive bidding pursuant to l may file a pleading disavowing any interest in participating in the auction and seeking the dismissal of their applications.once dismissal of any such application is final,we will entertain requests for refunds of any hearing and filing fees actually paid by such applicants.
in may,vernal enterprises,a closely held corporation owned by larry schrecongost and his wife,filed an application for a permit to construct a new fm radio station in brookville,pennsylvania.vernal payed a filing fee in connection with the application.several other parties,including robert stevens and renda radio,also filled applications to construct a station in the brookville community.because the applicants sought to use the same fm frequency,the commission was required to decide to whom the construction permit should be awarded.the brookville applications were pending in august when the relevant amendments to the communications act were adopted.
in january,within the period during which fcc limitations on settlement agreements were waived and over six months before the fcc determined that all pending applications would be subject to competitive bidding,vernal entered into a settlement agreement with the other brookville applicants.in april,the fcc issued a public notice announcing that,pursuant to the settlement,renda radio,would be awarded the construction permit and all other applications,including vernal,would be dismissed.fm broadcast settlement agreements and applications,wl.the dismissals became final in may.
in october,stevens,who,like vernal,sought dismissal of his permit application pursuant to the settlement,requested a refund of his filing fee.a staff member of the commission office of managing director omd granted stevens request in july,and notice of the refund was released in february.fee decisions of the managing director.
vernal filed a request for a refund of its filing fee in april.the omd denied the request in a january,letter order.see letter from mark reger to larry schrecongost,reprinted in joint appendix.the staff letter explained that,in implementing the competitive bidding rules,the fcc had contemplated refunds of filing fees in circumstances where a permit is ultimately awarded pursuant to the auction process,not where a permit is awarded as a result of a settlement agreement among competing applicants.id.at emphasis in the original.the letter indicated that a public notice had made the fcc intention clear and had stated that,to the extent settlements contain provisions requesting that the commission refund previously paid filing fees,those provisions are inconsistent with the commission decision in the auction proceedings concerning filing fee refunds.id.at.the staff letter acknowledged that the omd had granted a refund request made by another dismissed brookville applicant and indicated that that decision was in error.id.at.
petitioners filed an application for review before the commission on february.application for review file no,reprinted in.the commission issued a memorandum opinion and order on july,denying the application for review.vernal.citing to wade communications,the fcc explained that the policy promulgated in conjunction with the report and order made it clear that fees would be refunded only to the remaining,applicants for licenses or permits who had not resolved their mutual exclusivity through negotiated agreements during the period and whose pending mutually exclusive applications would therefore be resolved pursuant to our decision to use competitive bidding.vernal,at.the fcc concluded that vernal,whose application was dismissed pursuant to a settlement agreement entered into during the specified period and before the commission decision to subject all remaining applications to auction,was not entitled to a refund.see id.the fcc acknowledged that,prior to its decision in wade communications,staff persons in omd had granted some fee refunds to parties,like petitioners,who had withdrawn their applications pursuant to settlement agreements entered into before the applications became subject to competitive bidding.see id.at.the fcc explained,however,that wade communications made it clear that these staff actions were not authorized by the commission and that they were at odds with agency policy.see id.at.on september,within days of the issuance of the commission order,petitioners filed the instant petition for review.
ii.analysis 
jurisdiction 
as an initial matter,the fcc contends that this court is without jurisdiction to hear this case.the commission argues that petitioners incorrectly petitioned for review within the filing period applicable to a,rather than seeking review within the days applicable to b.the fcc position is unavailing.petitioners properly pursued their claim under a,and we consequently have jurisdiction to hear this matter.
section describes two mutually exclusive channels for the review of fcc decisions.see tribune fcc,friedman fcc.section b provides for appeal of fcc orders in nine enumerated situations.all but one,which is not relevant here,involve the commission licensing authority.for all other final orders of the commission,a provides that review shall be sought as provided by and in the manner prescribed in chapter of title.see.under b,an appeal must be taken within days of the date of public notice of the order at issue.see c.section a petitions for review must be filed within days of the date of public notice.see.under either provision,an appeal filed out of time must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.waterway communications,fcc,emphasis in original citation and internal quotations omitted.
the fcc admits that the refund order at issue here does not fall within one of the enumerated categories of b.however,relying primarily on the ancillary to rationale of broadcasting fcc,the agency argues that the order here is so intimately associated with the application process as to require review under b.according to the fcc,the refund order was issued solely because vernal filed an application for a construction permit the fcc would never have received the fee but for the filing of vernal application,and vernal application would not have been accepted for filing if it had not been accompanied by the filing fee.respondents br.at.the commission reliance on the ancillary to notion is misplaced.the applicable law simply is not what the fcc suggests.
national ass of broadcasters fcc,provides the initial framework for our analysis.there we held reviewable under a a variety of fee orders,including those denying refund of certain filing and grant fees that were submitted with various types of applications for grant of license or other authority.petitions for refund of fees,cited in ass of broadcasters,at.see id.at.at least some of the fees at issue in national ass of broadcasters were,like the construction permit fee at issue here,paid in connection with applications described in b.nevertheless,the court found that t he statute itself appears quite clear except for the eight specific cases listed in b none of which concerns refunds or fee assessments,a ny proceeding to enjoin,set aside,annul or suspend any order of the federal communications commission under this chapter shall be brought by a petition for review under.a id.at alterations in original.the court specifically declined to rely on tomah to require review under b,stating 
w e do not believe nor does any party allege that the order presented for our consideration here can be considered ancillary to one of the actions listed under section b,since the fees assessed were to reimburse the agency for the costs associated with rendering its services as mandated by rather than for a reason connected in any way with the purposes specified in section b.
the fcc argues that the fee order at issue here is distinguishable from the fee orders at issue in national ass of broadcasters,because the fee here was paid in connection with an application for a permit enumerated in b.in other words,the fcc suggests that none of the fees at issue in national ass of broadcasters was paid in connection with one of the application procedures enumerated in b.this is plainly wrong.although the opinion is not entirely clear with respect to all of the matters at issue in the case,there is no doubt that some of the fees at issue in national ass of broadcasters were paid in connection with application procedures enumerated in b.
in any event,if national ass of broadcasters leaves any doubt over the reach of b,makes clear that a petition for review under a is the appropriate channel for judicial review in this case.in that case,t he appellant had sought to have intervenor construction permit revoked before intervenor could commence operations,at.relying on two cases involving orders that resolved what,in effect,were requests that the commission reconsider the grant of various applications enumerated in b and a third case involving an order granting a request to allow a broadcast permit to continue in effect pending a decision in a protest filed against that authorization,the court held that the order was ancillary to the grant of the construction permit and should be reviewed under b.see id.the decision noted that because the commission had considered appellant petition on its merits its order denying the petition was in substance a of the fcc earlier grant of the construction permit.id.the court also distinguished an earlier decision in which b was apparently found not to provide the remedy for appeal on the grounds that the orders there sought to be reviewed did not grant or deny an application.id.
the order denying the request here similarly does not grant or deny an application.nor does it,in any way,reaffirm or undermine the commission decision to grant the construction permit to renda radio or otherwise affect renda radio activities with respect to the brookville permit.thus,under,the refund order can not be characterized as ancillary to an order appealable under b.
it is also noteworthy that recent decisions of the court have declined to broaden the ancillary to rationale of to extend the reach of b beyond its prescribed boundaries.see,coalition for noncommercial media fcc,freeman eng g,fcc.in freeman,the court found that the commission grant of a pioneer preference was not ancillary to the grant of a license,even though a preference effectively guarantee s the innovating party a license in the new service assuming it is otherwise qualified by permitting the recipient of a pioneer preference to file a license application without being subject to competing applications.at alterations in original quoting establishment of procedures to provide a preference to applicants proposing an allocation for new services.quoting waterway communications,at,the court explained 
r elief under b requires as a trigger the grant or denial of a license application.the commission does not grant licenses at the time a pioneer preference is awarded.nor does the grant of a preference irrevocably commit the commission to grant a license.the recipient of a pioneer preference must still be otherwise qualified in order to obtain a license.it therefore appears that our jurisdiction to review a denial of a pioneer preference application is not governed by b,but falls within a.
freeman,at citations omitted.thus,even in a situation in which the order at issue strongly foreshadow ed the grant of a b application,coalition for noncommercial media,at,we declined to apply the ancillary to rationale of in the absence of the trigger ing grant or denial of a license application.freeman,at.
the necessary triggering action was absent in this case as well.the fcc never granted or denied petitioners permit application.rather,it simply agreed,at petitioners request,to dismiss the application after vernal reached a settlement agreement with the other applicants for the brookville permit.moreover,although the fcc did grant the brookville permit to another applicant,renda,that grant can not function as the necessary triggering event with respect to petitioners refund order since,unlike in,the refund order did not and could
