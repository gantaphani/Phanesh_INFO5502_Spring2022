ranger cellular and miller communications,sometimes hereinafter referred to collectively as ranger petition for review of an order in which the federal communications commission interpreted a provision in the balanced budget act of,stat,l,to allow new applicants to apply for certain cellular telephone licenses.ranger,which had submitted an application for a cellular license several years beforehand,argues that providers of cellular telephone service are commercial radio or television stations within the meaning of l,for which the commission may not accept new applications.the petitioner also claims that,even if the statute did not bar new cellular applications,the commission departed from precedent in holding that the public interest would be served by its accepting new applications,and that the commission opened the applicant pool with the unlawful purpose of enhancing federal revenues,in violation of j b.we reject ranger arguments and deny the petition for review.
background 
prior to the commission awarded licenses for use of the radio spectrum through either a comparative hearing or a lottery.lottery entrants would file a simple application and pay a nominal fee.the commission then held the lottery and determined a winner,subject to the losing parties right to file a petition to disqualify the winner.if the winner was disqualified,then the commission held another lottery.after the commission used the lottery system exclusively to assign all cellular licenses.
the comparative hearing process,which required each party to present a detailed case to the commission showing why it should win the license,was far more complex and often led to protracted litigation.see,bechtel fcc,douglas ginsburg,michael botein,mark director,regulation of the electronic mass media law and policy for radio,television,cable and the new video technologies west ed.the commission had used the comparative hearing process to choose among competing applications for broadcast stations since the decision in ashbacker radio fcc.
ranger and miller filed applications in and respectively to participate in a lottery for certain rural service area rsa cellular telephone licenses.the commission awarded most of the licenses but by the six licenses for rsas were still pending due to the disqualification or withdrawal of the original winner.the commission then granted interim operating authority ioa to cellular telephone licensees in adjacent areas to provide service until such time as the commission awarded a permanent license.see in the matter of implementation of competitive bidding rules to license certain rural service areas,notice of proposed rule making,fcc rcd,wl.
meanwhile,the congress,in the omnibus budget reconciliation act of,a,stat,had amended the communications act of by adding j,j,which authorized the commission to award almost all spectrum licenses by competitive bidding and limited the use of lotteries.with respect to cellular telephone licenses in particular,the legislation provided that the commission shall not issue any license or permit by lottery unless one or more applications for such license were accepted for filing by the commission before july.e,stat.at.having been given the option of proceeding by lottery or by competitive bidding to award such grandfathered licenses,the commission decided initially to use a lottery,see in the matter of implementation of section j of the communications bidding,fcc rcd,wl,but then decided to study the matter further.see public notice,wireless telecommunications bureau postpones cellular telecommunications service lottery for rural service areas,mimeo.
before the commission had finally decided how to award cellular telephone licenses,however,the congress passed the balanced budget act of,a,stat,which amended j by requiring the commission to use competitive bidding except in a few specifically enumerated circumstances and terminated the commission authority to use a lottery except for a small class of broadcast licenses.see i.more important for the purposes of this case,the congress amended the communications act of by adding l,which states,under the heading applicability of competitive bidding to pending comparative licensing cases,that 
with respect to competing applications for initial licenses or construction permits for commercial radio or television stations that were filed with the commission before july,the commission shall treat the persons filing such applications as the only persons eligible to be qualified bidders for purposes of such proceeding.
emphasis added.this section bars the commission from accepting new applications for certain commercial radio or television stations.the conference report on the act described the scope of this provision as follows 
the conferees adopted a new provision with respect to the applicability of competitive bidding to pending comparative licensing cases.new section l of the communications act requires the commission to use competitive bidding to resolve any mutually exclusive applications for radio or television broadcast licenses that were filed with the commission prior to july.
conf,sess.at emphasis added.
against this background,the commission in april dismissed all pending applications for the cellular telephone licenses at issue in this case because it was without authority to process the pending mutually exclusive rsa applications pursuant to the rules and requirements of the lottery system under which they were filed.in the matter of certain cellular rural service area applications,fcc rcd,wl wtb.in the commission proposed to open eligibility with respect to the auctions it would hold for the pending rsa cellular telephone licenses.see implementation of competitive bidding rules,fcc rcd.after receiving comments the commission issued the order here under review.in the matter of implementation of competitive bidding rules to license certain rural service areas,fcc rcd,wl order.
the commission rejected ranger argument that the term commercial radio or television stations in l included cellular telephone licenses and therefore required the commission to limit the pool of bidders to those who had filed an application prior to july.the commission reasoned that the statute by its terms and in accordance with its purpose and its legislative history in using the phrase commercial radio and television stations referred only to broadcast stations and therefore did not cover cellular telephone services.the commission went on to decide that competitive bidding with open eligibility would best serve the public interest the bidder who is willing to pay the most will be highly motivated to rapidly put the license to a use that the public finds valuable because only such a use will make its investment worthwhile.id.the commission also rejected ranger comment that an auction would violate j b,which prohibits the commission,in making certain regulatory decisions,from bas ing a finding of public interest,convenience,and necessity solely or predominantly on the expectation of federal revenues from the use of a system of competitive bidding under this subsection.the commission explained our determination to permit open eligibility in the rsa auction is based on our statutory obligations to promote competition and rapid deployment of services to rural areas,not to enhance the federal treasury.id.
the commission conducted the auction for the rsa cellular licenses on june.ranger did not participate.
ii.analysis 
on appeal ranger argues first that the commission interpretation of l conflicts with the plain meaning of,and in any event,is not a reasonable reading of,the statute.second,the petitioner maintains the commission could not,consistent with precedent specifying the relevant equitable considerations,conclude that the public interest favored opening the auction to new applicants.finally,the petitioner contends the commission opened the auction unlawfully in order to maximize federal revenues.
we consider ranger first argument under the familiar analysis of chevron,natural resources defense council,d.first we determine whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at iss
