peter hall and big bad productions,collectively hall appeal from a final judgment and order of the united states district court for the southern district of new york richard owen,judge,entered december,dismissing all of hall claims by summary judgment.for the reasons specified below,we affirm the district court dismissal of hall electronic communications privacy act,breach of contract,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and tort claims.
background 
peter hall,a independent film producer,wrote and filmed his first movie,entitled delinquent,from to.hall marketed delinquent through his corporation,big bad productions incorporated.in july,hall opened an account with earthlink network incorporated earthlink,an internet service provider isp,for internet services and personal use of.hall claims that he was known in the independent film community by his earthlink username.when hall signed up for the earthlink account,he agreed to earthlink subscriber agreement contract which stipulated that california law governed the contract.
delinquent was scheduled to premiere on september,in new york city and los angeles.according to the complaint,hall planned to use his earthlink account to promote the two september,premieres at the upcoming chicago underground film festival on august.on august,uunet,which provided backbone internet services to earthlink informed earthlink that was sending mass junk,or spam.earthlink immediately terminated hall access to the account and placed the address on net abuse report,a web list of abusers.hall earthlink network,wl,at.six days later,on august,after a series of exchanges between earthlink,hall,and wired news an internet industry magazine,earthlink determined that was not a source of spam.earthlink posted a retraction on the net abuse report website and sent sixteen to hall new account.hall claims that he requested that earthlink turn his service back on but that earthlink failed to do so.earthlink claims that hall,with shouted obscenities,refused its offers to reconnect the account.hall earthlink account was not reopened,and between and july,earthlink received and stored sent to the address.in july,earthlink sent the stored to hall.
on july,hall filed a complaint in district court.the complaint included claims for a violation of the electronic communications privacy act,et.ecpa,breach of contract,libel,breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,negligent appropriation of electronic communication,intentional interference with electronic communication,and prima facie tort.following discovery,earthlink moved for summary judgment.
hall ecpa claim was that earthlink illegally intercepted his in violation of a by intentionally continuing to receive messages sent to after the termination of his account.the district court dismissed this claim,reasoning that earthlink acts did not constitute an intentional interception under ecpa.hall,wl,at.hall also claimed that earthlink sudden termination of his access to the internet and to his breached his contract with the isp.earthlink actions,hall alleged,made it impossible for him to adequately advertise delinquent in time for the chicago underground film festival and to respond to inquiries about his upcoming premieres.hall claimed that delinquent did not receive the publicity that it would have received had he not lost his internet service.
the district court did not reach the issue of whether or not the contract was breached because it found that consequential damages stemming from hall lost business opportunities were too speculative and therefore dismissed hall claim for consequential damages held that without consequential damages,hall actual damages stationery,internet service,and telephone not meet the jurisdictional amount for diversity jurisdiction,see a and therefore dismissed the claim in its entirety.hall,wl,at.the district court also dismissed hall claims for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,prima facie tort,libel,negligent appropriation of electronic communication,and intentional interference with electronic communication.id.at.on appeal,hall contends that each of these dismissals,except the dismissal of the libel and prima facie tort claims,was error.while we disagree with the district court reasoning in part,we affirm the district court dismissal of all of these claims.
discussion 
electronic communications privacy act 
we review the district court summary judgment dismissal of hall ecpa claim de novo.perry dowling,cir.we agree with the district court conclusion that earthlink did not violate a but write to further clarify the proper interpretation of this section.
through the enactment of ecpa,congress amended the federal wiretap law in order to update and clarify federal privacy protections and standards in light of dramatic changes in new computer and telecommunications technologies,at,reprinted in.ecpa is divided into title i,which governs unauthorized interception of electronic communications,and title ii,which governs unauthorized access to stored communications.organizacion jd ltda.united states dep t of justice,cir.this appeal concerns title i exclusively.
section a states that,except as otherwise provided,anyone who intentionally intercepts,endeavors to intercept,or procures any other person to intercept or endeavor to intercept,any electronic communication violates ecpa.a.the district court held that earthlink did not intentionally intercept anything in violation of section a because earthlink merely received and stored precisely where they were an address on the earthlink system.hall,wl,at.the district court did not specify whether it based this holding on a determination that earthlink actions were not an interception,not intentional,or both.we hold that earthlink continued reception of sent to did not constitute an interception under ecpa because it was conducted as part of the ordinary course of earthlink business.see a.because we hold that earthlink did not intercept electronic communications in violation of ecpa,we do not need to decide whether earthlink acts were intentional.
earthlink act did not constitute an interception 
ecpa defines the term intercept as the aural or other acquisition of the contents of any electronic communication through the use of any electronic,mechanical,or other device.emphasis added.ecpa provides an ordinary course of business exception applicable to this case within its definition of any electronic,mechanical,or other device.a.a ny telephone or telegraph instrument,equipment or facility,or any component thereof being used by a provider of wire or electronic communication service in the ordinary course of its business is not an electronic,mechanical,or other device,and therefore does not fall under the definition of intercept.id.earthlink acquired the contents of electronic communications but did so in the ordinary course of business and thus did not use any electronic,mechanical,or other device as defined by the statute.
hall reads section a ordinary course of business exception to apply only to an isp that uses telephone or telegraph instruments,equipment or facilities.appellants reply br.at.earthlink interprets the language to include isps that use any telephone or telegraph instrument or any equipment or facility.to resolve this issue,we look first to the plain language of section a.marvel characters,simon,cir.the placement of the commas could suggest that the phrase telephone or telegraph modifies instrument,equipment,and facility.according to this reading,the ordinary course of business exception would apply only to an isp using a telephone or telegraph.on the other hand,the placement of the commas could suggest that telephone or telegraph only modifies instrument.accordingly,the ordinary course of business exception would also apply to an isp using any equipment or facility.see generally united states aguilar,d.
because the plain language of section a is arguably ambiguous and we do not find guidance from the statutory structure,we may look to the legislative history to clarify congressional intent.see natural res.def.council,muszynski,cir.the legis
