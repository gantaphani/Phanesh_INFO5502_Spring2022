petitioners,for the third time,challenge the fcc policy regarding converter boxes.we again deny their petition for review.
we have explained the origins of this dispute between comcast and the commission in general instrument fcc,and charter communications,fcc.briefly put,in order to access subscription video as cable service or direct broadcast satellite their television sets,consumers generally require a converter box.the converter box performs security that only subscribers may access the may include other features such as channel tuners,program menus,video recording,and.until recently,most consumers leased their converter boxes directly from the video provider there was no competitive retail market for such devices.
congress sought to force unbundling of the security and programming functions to create a competitive market for navigation programming devices in the telecommunications act of.section a of the act instructed the fcc to adopt regulations to assure the commercial availability of converter boxes,interactive communications equipment,and other equipment used by consumers to access multichannel video programming from manufacturers,retailers,and other vendors not affiliated with any video provider.a.pursuant to this statutory directive,in the commission adopted rules requiring that the security element be made available separately from the basic navigation device.commercial availability of navigation devices,order.video providers have complied with the commission rules by introducing the cablecard,which is a credit device that contains the video provider security information.when this card is plugged into a box,it enables the customer to access the video programming and services to which he has subscribed.see charter,at.
the fcc further required that video providers stop selling or leasing integrated converter boxes containing both security and navigation features by january.order,at.in other words,converter boxes supplied by video providers must rely upon the same security technology as the boxes.we rejected various statutory challenges to this integration ban in general instrument,at.
in,the fcc postponed the implementation date for the integration ban until july,and sought additional comments about the state of the market for navigation devices.the cable industry filed comments arguing that the integration ban was unnecessary and should be repealed.in,the commission denied the requests to repeal the ban,concluding that common reliance by cable operators on the same security technology that consumer electronics manufacturers must employ in developing competitive navigation devices will help attain the goals of section of the telecommunications act.commercial availability of navigation devices,order.although it chose to retain the integration ban,the fcc again postponed the compliance date to july.the commission also stated that it would be willing to entertain waiver requests for,limited capability boxes that do not include personal video recording,broadband internet access,multiple tuner,or other similar advanced capabilities.id.at.the fcc determined that provision of devices by cable operators will not endanger the development of the competitive marketplace envisioned in section,particularly because the more advanced devices offered by cable operators will be required to rely on the same security technology as devices offered at retail by consumer electronics manufacturers.id.
in charter,we rejected various challenges to the fcc decision to retain the integration ban.at.we held that the commission reasonably concluded that i f cable operators must take steps to support their own compliant equipment,it seems far more likely that they will continue to support and take into account the need to support services that will work with independently supplied and purchased equipment.id.at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.we observed that even though the integration ban may impose costs,higher prices for boxes,the commission reasonably explained why those costs were likely to be outweighed by the benefits of a competitive equipment market,such as increased consumer choice and the spurring of technological innovation.id.at.
pursuing what it thought was a regulatory opening under both section and the commission waiver invitation in the order,comcast sought a waiver of the integration ban for three models of boxes.these are the boxes supplied by comcast,but they still contain electronic programming guides,and interactive television capabilities.the fcc media bureau denied the waiver request,holding that comcast failed to meet the requirements for a waiver under the telecommunications act,the commission,policy,or the commission general waiver authority.the full commission affirmed the media bureau denial of the waiver.comcast,order.comcast has petitioned for review,arguing that the fcc order was contrary to the telecommunications act,and arbitrary and capricious as inconsistent with the commission prior actions and policies.
comcast primary argument is that it is entitled to a waiver under section c of the telecommunications act,which states in relevant part 
the commission shall waive a regulation adopted under subsection a of this section for a limited time upon an appropriate showing by a provider of multichannel video programming that such waiver is necessary to assist the development or introduction of a new or improved multichannel video programming or other service offered over multichannel video programming systems,technology,or products.
c.comcast argues that a waiver is necessary to assist the development of new digital services.digital video services are more than analog services.thus,when customers migrate from analog to digital,comcast can reclaim the excess spectrum and use it for new or improved services.the converter boxes at issue here are the cheapest boxes that contain converters,which enable viewers with analog tvs to view digital programming.it is contended that without a waiver for integrated boxes,the price of converter boxes will rise,fewer customers will make the transition to digital cable,and comcast will not be able to roll out new digital services as quickly as it would be with a waiver.
the commission concluded,however,that a waiver was not necessary to assist the development or introduction of new services because comcast already offered digital service in all of its markets and was likely to continue deploying new services even in the absence of a waiver.order,at.the fcc also determined that granting the waiver would undermine common reliance,by reducing video providers incentive to ensure that security elements are properly designed and supported for competitive equipment manufacturers.id.at.essentially,the commission has concluded,or rather predicted,that to allow comcast to introduce an integrated box that contains security,navigation,and programming features would inhibit the development of competitive navigation and programming devices.the commission wishes to force comcast to rely on the same security element as its competitors.
we think the fcc explanation of why a waiver was not necessary to assist the development or introduction of new or improved video services was quite reasonable.comcast currently offers digital video programming in all of its markets,and of its customers are already digital subscribers.id.at.the fcc relied in part upon comcast own press releases,which showed significant growth in revenue from digital services such as and.id.cable companies do not give away their services for free as every cable customer knows,the more services and features you purchase,the higher your monthly bill will be.thus,with or without a waiver,comcast has a strong incentive to make as many services available as possible,and to continue introducing new and features.
comcast argument in support of a waiver under section c primarily turns on cost company argues that if digital conversion boxes become more expensive,then fewer customers will migrate to digital cable.but from the start,the fcc has conceded that the integration ban may impose costs on cable companies and consumers.order,at.it re
