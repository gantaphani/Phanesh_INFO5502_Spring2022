louis thibault,thibault brought suit against bellsouth telecommunications bellsouth,directional road boring,directional,and robert parker,robert parker,and parker communications llc collectively parker arising out of electrical splicing work he performed in new orleans,louisiana in the aftermath of hurricane katrina.thibault claimed violations of the fair labor standards act flsa,under a,a louisiana breach of contract,and failure to pay wages under.ann.the trial court dismissed these claims on summary judgment.thibault appeals the dismissal of the flsa claim and the breach of contract claim we address two issues first,whether thibault may maintain a claim under the flsa,and second,whether summary judgment is appropriate for his breach of contract claim 
background 
as a result of hurricane katrina,bellsouth telephone infrastructure suffered serious damage.bellsouth undertook the project of rewiring its entire new orleans area telecommunications grid.to complete this project,bellsouth employed splicers.a splicer installs,cuts,repairs,and tests various high voltage cables.because of katrina,bellsouth could not,by itself,restore phone services to the region.accordingly,bellsouth contracted with directional to provide assistance with their project.directional also employed their own splicers.but even directional additional splicers did not suffice.directional therefore contracted with parker to provide additional splicers for the project.
parker contacted bill peek,a splicer in delaware.parker informed peek that the job would require about hours of work per week at an hourly rate of dollars and a fifty dollar.he also informed him that splicers would have to provide their own bucket trucks and tools to do the work.peek was interested,and told his best friend,lewis thibault,of the job opportunity.thibault was not a splicer by profession,but had experience as a navy jet engine mechanic.he owned and operated his own business in delaware called k l sales.his business sold picnic tables,storage buildings,and golf carts.in,his business made over in gross profit.despite his success,thibault decided to accept peek invitation to travel to new orleans as it would provide a much needed break for him from his marital problems and he felt new orleans would be an opportunity to get his head clear.through peek,thibault was able to borrow a spare truck and various tools that the job required.peek also taught thibault the basics of splicing over the course of an evening thibault was able to learn the rest on the job.
in october,thibault filled his trailer home with water and food,and the two men drove to louisiana.from october,to january,thibault worked as a splicer.in that time,thibault made.everyday,thibault was required to report to kenner yard,a property rented by bellsouth.at the first meeting,thibault claims that a parker supervisor informed them that they would be paid dollars an hour,would work at least hours a week and would get a per diem and a place to park his motor home.every day,thibault showed up to kenner yard,and was assigned a specific splicing job in new orleans.bellsouth engineers created the overall rewiring plan for new orleans.bellsouth supervisors designated the specific jobs to be done daily,and assigned directional supervisors to distribute the assignments.when thibault received his assignment,he was then required to take his truck to the job and work on the problem he was assigned.when completed,thibault would return to kenner yard and would be assigned another splicing job.he worked in intervals with a break in between.while parker paid thibault,bellsouth had to approve all vacation and break time.on january,parker laid off thibault.directional offered thibault a job as a splicer,working directly for directional,but thibault declined.instead,he returned to delaware,and has not worked as a splicer since.thibault brought this suit against parker,directional,and bellsouth for overtime pay under the flsa,breach of contract,and louisiana wage law statutes.
fair labor standards act 
thibault contends that he is entitled to overtime compensation for hours worked in excess of forty hours per week pursuant to the a.the flsa gives employees certain protections from employers.the defendants contend that thibault is not an employee,but an independent contractor.we review thibault status de novo.carrell sunland,cir.in the present setting,a relevant question is whether the alleged employee so economically depends upon the business to which he renders his services,such that the individual,as a matter of economic reality,is not in business for himself.id.the contractual designation of the worker as an independent contractor is not necessarily controlling.see hopkins cornerstone,cir.instead,we generally use as a guide five,factors a the permanency of the relationship b the degree of control exercised by the alleged employer c the skill and initiative required to preform the job d the extent of the relative investments of the worker and the alleged employer and e the degree to which the worker opportunity for profit and loss is determined by the alleged employer.id.at.these factors are merely aids to analysis and no single factor is determinative.id.at.
here,we believe the holding of carrell provides substantial guidance.in carrell,this court faced the issue of whether twenty welders were employees under the flsa for purposes of overtime compensation.id.the carrell court went through each of the five factors,and decided overall that the welders were independent contractors.id.at.
a.the permanency of the relationship 
first,carrell addressed the permanency of the relationship 
during each of the years relevant to this lawsuit,none of the welders worked exclusively for sunland.to work consistently throughout the construction season,which lasts six to nine months,the welders moved from job to job,company to company,and state to state.sunland hired the welders on a basis,but made an effort to move the welders to subsequent projects.the duration of sunland construction projects averaged six weeks,but some projects lasted only a few days.the average number of weeks that each welder worked per year for sunland varied from approximately weeks to weeks.
id.at.like the welders,thibault did not work exclusively for the defendants.he had his own business selling picnic tables,storage buildings,and customized golf carts,in his home state of delaware.the nature of splicer work requires travel to different parts of the nation where the jobs are.splicers travel from and from looking for work.thibault and peek traveled from delaware to work in the aftermath of hurricane katrina.the project lasted only until the project after katrina finished.thibault intended to return to delaware after seven or eight months.
degree of control 
second,the carrell court addressed the degree of control exercised by the employer 
while working for sunland,the welders performed only work.sunland assigned the welders to specific welding work and maintained daily time records for each welder.sunland,however,did not specify the amount of time that a welder could spend on an assignment.sunland required the welders to work the same days and hours as the remainder of sunland crew,including taking the same daily break periods.
id.at.the court also relied on the fact that sunland classified the welders as independent contractors,and many of the welders considered themselves.here,the defendants considered the splicers independent contractors.many of the splicers considered themselves.the carrell welders did only welding,and similarly here thibault only performed splicing work.the defendants assigned the splicers to specific splicing work and maintained daily time records for each splicer.bellsouth required the splicers to work the same days and hours as the remainder of the bellsouth crew,including taking the same daily break periods.in carrell,sunland did not control the manner and method of pipe welding.carrell,at.likewise,thibault explained that his supervisors would only come by occasionally,and never specified how thibault should do the splicing.according to thibault,the defendants would tell him what needed to be fixed or spliced or give him blueprints,and then it was up to thibault to go out and fix the problem.once thibault finished a particular job,he would report back to be assigned another job.
skill initiative 
third,carrell examined the skill an initiative required 
pipe welding,unlike other types of welding,requires specialized skills.that the gas companies tested and certified each welder before a job demonstrates the specialized nature of the work.as for the initiative required,a welder success depended on his ability to find consistent work by moving from job to job and from company to company.but once on a job,a welder initiative was limited to decisions regarding his welding equipment and the details of his welding work.
id.at.thibault argues that he has never worked as a splicer before.thibault,however,was a jet engine mechanic in the navy.in fact,he described his abilities i aced the mechanical aptitude test in the navy.you show me how to do something one time and i can do it.thibault learned the job from his friend peek,but also learned how to splice on the job,working next to peek and other splicers.thibault explained that splicing dealt with complicated equipment 
i mean,you talking phone cables this big around coming into a cross box,and there might be six of them in there.and each wire has pairs in it,which is wires.and its all going to these terminals.and you had to make sure they were going in at the right terminal and coming out at the right terminal.
like thibault,individuals learn to splice through an informal apprenticeship.a fellow splicer testified that it took him about a year to learn the job.like the welders in carrell,the splicers success depended on their ability to find consistent work by moving from.
relative investements 
the fourth factor the carrell court examined was the relative investments of the worker and the alleged employer.carrell,at.the court in carrell recognized the overall investment by the alleged employer,but it did not focus on it,as thibault does in his brief.instead,carrell compares the amount the alleged employer and employee each contribute to the specific job the employee undertakes.id.for example,the welders supplied their own trucks,welding machines mounted on the trucks,and other specialized welding tools.id.the welders also assumed the costs of operating and maintaining the trucks and tools.id.the welders provided their own lodging and own meals.id.they often bought their own assistants,who appear to have been unskilled or laborers.id.at.the alleged employer in carrell provided general liability and worker compensation insurance.id.at.it provided the blades for the grinders that smoothed the surface of a pipe before it was welded.id.at.
like the welders in carrell,thibault provided his own bucket truck,cable splicer,pump,ventilator,ladder,climbing belt,harness,hard hat,safety vest and other miscellaneous tools such as wrenches,hammers,screwdrivers and other items one would usually find in a toolbox.in fact,the record contains a list of over different tools splicers were expected to have for the job.thibault had his own motor home,which he brought to louisiana to live in.he stocked it with enough water and food to last him at least six weeks.he drove two days to get to new orleans.we also recognize the overall investment by the defendants.carrell,at.unlike carrell,however,we could not find,nor has thibault pointed to,any evidence in the record of paying for general liability insurance.bellsouth did rent property in the area and built a shed and trailer as a base of operations.bellsouth also provided the materials used in the splicing connectors,bonding straps,ground rods,terminal blocks,pedestals,cable,and drop wire,for example.the materials that bellsouth provided were either incorporated into their network or brought back to kenner yard at the end of the day.parker,on the other hand,did not provide any materials,meals or other services.instead,parker involvement in splicing seems limited to keeping track of the men and the hours.there was some evidence to suggest that parker paid for worker compensation insurance.
worker opportunity for profit loss 
fifth and finally,the carrell court examined the degree to which the worker opportunity for profit and loss is determined by the alleged employer 
sunland did not solicit bids or proposals from the welders.it paid the welders a fixed hourly rate of,plus per day for rental of their grinders.sunland intended approximately of the hourly rate to compensate the welders for supplying their own welding equipment.sunland required the welders to submit invoices for work performed on sunland projects.on appeal,the welders stress that sunland exclusively controlled the welders compensation while they worked on a sunland project sunland rarely deviated from its hourly rate,and it controlled the number of hours that the welders worked 
a welder profits or losses as a welder depended on his ability to consistently find welding work with other companies and to minimize welding costs.
sunland exerted some control over the welders opportunity for profits by fixing the hourly rate and the hours of work.yet,the tax returns of carrell indicate that the welders profits also depended on their ability to control their own costs.moreover,the welders worked for numerous companies in each of the years relevant to this dispute.
carrell,at.thibault worked for a fixed hourly rate of per hour,plus per day per diem.the defendants required the splicers to fill out time sheets and invoices of the work performed.like the carrell welders,the splicers profits or losses depend on their ability to consistently find splicing work with other companies.thibault friend,bill peek testified that,even though he lived in delaware,splicing requires travel from across the country.the splicers here increased profits by controlling costs repairs,supply costs,food,water,housing.
f.other factors 
the determination of whether an individual is an employee or independent contractor is highly dependent on the particular situation presented.carrell,at.we do not hold that all splicers are always independent contractors.indeed,the nature of this analysis suggests that in some cases splicers might be employees,cromwell driftwood contractors,wl,at cir unpublished.in cromwell,for example,the court found the splicers were employees.id.like thibault,the cromwell splicers worked twelve hour days,were paid by the hour,provided their own tools and trucks,and were assigned specific repair jobs each day.id.at.cromwell compared that case to carrell and robicheaux radcliff material,cir holding welders were employees under the flsa.the cromwell panel aptly noted,the facts of this case lie somewhere between those of carrell and robicheaux.cromwell,wl,at.likewise,carrell,cromwell and robicheaux are useful case studies in resolving this case.we believe thibault falls squarely within carrell.cromwell made a distinction from the carrell welders that does not apply to thibault.unlike the welders,the splicers in cromwell did not have the same temporary,relationship with their purported employers.id.at.also,a relevant distinction from cromwell relates to the matter of economic independence whether thibault is in business for himself.carrell,at.
the circumstances of thibault employment reflect that he is not economically dependant on the defendants.unlike cromwell,evidence shows that thibault is a sophisticated,intelligent business man who entered into a contractual relationship to perform a specific job for the defendants.thibault worked for three months and his relationship to the defendants centered solely around the specific project.after splicing in new orleans,thibault returned to his company in delaware and has not worked as a splicer since.for tax reasons,thibault had parker make all payments directly to his company,k l sales.in,k l sales generated in profit and in gross sales when he worked as a splicer,he also oversaw k l sales operations and its multiple employees.as the owner of k l sales,thibault routinely contracted with product manufacturers,customers,and transporters.he owned
