we have for review the following question of florida law certified by the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit that is determinative of a cause pending in that court and for which there appears to be no controlling precedent from this court 
does the florida wagering act prohibit an agreement between a florida thoroughbred racetrack and an racetrack that grants the florida racetrack the exclusive right to disseminate the track simulcast signal to other florida wagering sites permitted to receive them 
gulfstream park racing ass n,tampa bay downs,cir.we have jurisdiction.see art.v,b.const.in order to fully address the issues presented for consideration,we answer the certified question in two steps whether florida law permits an agreement which restricts a florida thoroughbred track which receives simulcast signals from disseminating those signals to other florida venues and whether florida law permits an agreement that would restrict a florida track from conducting intertrack wagering on those signals.
facts and procedural history 
this is a dispute between competing venues.florida has an extensive industry,consisting of a variety of venues,including thoroughbred racetracks,harness racetracks,jai alai frontons,and greyhound tracks.chapter of the florida statutes,florida wagering act wagering act,regulates most aspects of the wagering industry in this state.see ch.stat.
the specific aspect of the industry at issue in the instant matter is a type of wagering known as intertrack wagering.an individual who visits a venue may place bets at that location both on races occurring live at that venue and also on races occurring at other venues which are broadcast live at the wagering location these races occur live either at other venues or at venues.wagers on any race not occurring live at the venue accepting the wager are known as intertrack wagers.signals of live races occurring at venues transmitted to florida venues,as well as signals of live races occurring at venues transmitted to venues,are known as simulcast signals.in addition to florida wagering act,wagering on simulcast signals with interstate implications is also impacted by the federal interstate horseracing act,iha.
florida wagering act dictates that a simulcast signal from an thoroughbred racetrack can only be directly received by an thoroughbred racetrack which is conducting live races.see.stat.currently,there are only four thoroughbred racetracks in florida that qualify to receive these simulcast signals directly from thoroughbred tracks.the remaining venues,greyhound tracks and jai alai frontons must contract with one of these four thoroughbred tracks to receive and conduct wagering on these thoroughbred races occurring live at locations.it is the competition with regard to disseminating these simulcast signals to the florida venues and the correlating revenue such agreements generate that drive the issue in the instant matter.
the federal iha removes competition with regard to many of these venues by requiring that a venue within sixty miles of a thoroughbred track must obtain the approval of that particular thoroughbred track before accepting wagers on any simulcast signals of thoroughbred races.see b a.this federal statutory requirement,coupled with the florida wagering act dictate that venues must contract with only thoroughbred venues to receive simulcast signals from thoroughbred tracks,creates a situation in which a thoroughbred track within sixty miles of a facility can require the venue to contract with only it,and not another florida thoroughbred track,to receive simulcast signals of thoroughbred races occurring live at venues.twelve of the venues in florida are located within sixty miles of one of the four thoroughbred tracks.thus,those twelve venues must contract with this single nearest thoroughbred track which is conducting live races to receive and conduct wagering on simulcast signals of thoroughbred races.the remaining fourteen venues,however,are free to contract with any florida thoroughbred track for access to these simulcast signals.
originally,the florida wagering act restricted wagering on simulcast signals.in,however,the florida legislature amended the wagering act to allow unlimited simulcasting.see ch,at,laws of.after the wagering act was amended,gulfstream park racing association,a thoroughbred track located in south florida and appellant in the instant action,began to enter into exclusive dissemination agreements with thoroughbred tracks for these signals.language in these exclusive agreements obligated the track,in exchange for gulfstream agreeing to receive and disseminate the simulcast signals from these facilities in the lucrative south florida market,to restrict the dissemination rights it granted any other florida thoroughbred track receiving the same simulcast signal to venues within sixty miles of that track.in other words,the agreements were designed to grant gulfstream the exclusive rights to contract with the fourteen venues that are not within sixty miles of any thoroughbred track for delivery of and access to the simulcast signals of these thoroughbred tracks.once these exclusive agreements were in place,tampa bay downs tbd,a thoroughbred track and appellee in the instant action,was accordingly restricted by provisions included in its contracts with these thoroughbred tracks,in conformity with the track obligations under its own contract with gulfstream,from disseminating the simulcast signals it received from these tracks to any venues outside a radius of tbd.
in may of,tbd filed a petition with the florida division of wagering dpw seeking a determination of whether these exclusive dissemination agreements with gulfstream violated florida law.on september,the dpw issued a declaratory statement finding that the exclusive agreements did violate florida law.the declaratory statement indicated that the exclusive agreements violated the clear dictates of section g,relating to simulcast signals,but specifically stated that n othing in this declaratory statement should be construed as a statement by the division that gulfstream park has,in fact,violated section relating to intertrack wagering in general.gulfstream park racing ass tampa bay downs,d,quoting declaratory statement.
after the dpw issued its declaratory statement,tbd began contracting with venues beyond the radius of tbd to disseminate simulcast signals of thoroughbred races occurring live to these facilities,contrary to the exclusivity agreements held by gulfstream.these agreements included venues for which gulfstream would have otherwise had exclusive dissemination rights under the contracts with the tracks.in response,gulfstream sued tbd in federal district court seeking a declaratory judgment that gulfstream exclusive dissemination agreements with the tracks were valid and enforceable under state law.gulfstream,at.tbd filed a motion for summary judgment,asserting that sections and g of the florida wagering act prohibited such agreements.id.although no state court had decided whether such exclusive agreements violated the wagering act,the federal district court held that the plain language of the wagering act did prohibit such agreements and,therefore,entered summary final judgment in favor of tbd.id.gulfstream sought review of the summary judgment in the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit,and this certified question has followed.
restrictions on dissemination 
section g of the florida statutes requires 
any thoroughbred permitholder which accepts wagers on a simulcast signal must make the signal available to any permitholder that is eligible to conduct intertrack wagering under the provisions of this act.
g.stat.tampa bay downs receives simulcast signals from tracks and accepts wagers on the races contained in those signals.under the clear dictates of section g,tbd must make the se signal s available to any permitholder eligible to conduct intertrack wagering.id.to the extent that gulfstream,pursuant to the terms of the exclusive dissemination agreements,attempts to prevent tbd from making these simulcast signals available to eligible intertrack wagering facilities,such action clearly collides and interferes with the obligations of tbd under this statutory provision.therefore,we conclude that section g of florida statutory scheme prohibits enforcement of the provisions in gulfstream exclusive dissemination agreements that would operate to prevent tbd from complying with this statutory requirement.
in addition to the plain meaning of section g,the dpw declaratory statement also supports tbd assertion that the exclusivity provisions of gulfstream exclusive dissemination agreements violate florida law by attempting to prohibit any dissemination by tbd of simulcast signals.as the federal district court correctly reasoned,i n florida,courts give great deference to the interpretation of a statute by an administrative agency charged with the statute enforcement.gulfstream,d at citing donato am,so d.the dpw concluded that section g requires tbd to make the simulcast signals that it receives and upon which intertrack wagers are conducted available to other facilities in the state.with this plain meaning application of section g and recognition of the declaratory statement issued by the dpw,based exclusively upon an analysis of this statutory provision,the answer to the certified question would be in the affirmative.however,we must also address other applicable statutory provisions.
restrictions on intertrack wagering on simulcast signals 
although we conclude that section g unambiguously dictates that gulfstream can not prevent tbd from making simulcast signals from thoroughbred tracks on which it accepts wagers available to other florida venues,the next issue we must address in this litigation is whether gulfstream contracts can be used to prevent tbd from contracting with the venues to which it disseminates the simulcast signals to allow these other venues to accept intertrack wagers on these simulcast signals.contractual provisions in gulfstream exclusive dissemination agreements also attempt to grant gulfstream the right to prevent other venues from engaging in intertrack wagers on the simulcast signals disseminated by tbd,which provides a monetary impact to the present dispute.tbd asserts that the dpw declaratory statement also supports the premise that section of the florida statutes prohibits enforcement of these restrictions in the agreements.however,our review of the declaratory statement reveals that this assertion is without support.
while the dpw stated in the declaratory statement that an agreement which operates to prohibit tbd from rebroadcasting these simulcast signals violates both sections and g of florida wagering act,the declaratory statement expressly declined to find that gulfstream violated section of the florida statutes.see gulfstream,d at.while we recognize that the dpw interpretation is entitled to great deference,the construction of the wagering act in the declaratory statement expressly invalidated gulfstream exclusive agreements on the basis that the agreements restricted tbd right to disseminate simulcast signals only.it did not,however,address whether an agreement which would allow tbd to disseminate simulcast signals,but prohibit the venues receiving such signals from conducting intertrack wagering on those signals,would also violate the wagering act.therefore,dpw declaratory statement impacts only one element of the certified question.however,our analysis of section leads us to conclude that the statutory provision does,in fact,prohibit enforcement of the provisions in the exclusive agreements which would restrict the right of tbd to contract with other venues to allow those venues to conduct intertrack wagering on the simulcast signals disseminated by tbd.
section states 
if a permitholder elects to broadcast its signal to any permitholder in this state,any permitholder that is eligible to conduct intertrack wagering under the provisions of this act is entitled to receive the broadcast and conduct intertrack wagering under this section 
stat.we have stated that normally,w hen the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous and conveys a clear and definite meaning,there is no occasion for resorting to the rules of statutory interpretation and construction.mclaughlin state,so d,quoting holly auld,so d.gulfstream asserts that reference to the signal of a permitholder in section restricts the application of that section to only intrastate signals of live races taking place at florida facilities and does not address simulcast signals from tracks.gulfstream further contends that because the word its modifies the word signal,the signal must be only one owned by a florida permitholder and,therefore,its signal does not include simulcast signals of racetracks which are owned by the facility conducting the live race.if,as gulfstream contends,the language of the statute is clearly limited to broadcasts of races occurring live and without ambiguity,tbd assertion that the court should look beyond the language of the statute to construe the terms is inappropriate.see mclaughlin,so d at.however,we conclude that the term its signal in the statutory context is not entirely unambiguous.
we have stated that t he title of a statute is more than an index to what the section is about or has reference to it is a direct statement by the legislature of its intent.state webb,so d,citing berger jackson,so d.the title of section is intertrack wagering.see.stat.the definitions section of the wagering act defines an intertrack wager as 
a particular form of wagering in which wagers are accepted at a permitted,track,fronton,or facility on a race or game transmitted from and performed live at,or simulcast signal rebroadcast from,another facility.
stat.if we were to conclude that the section has application to only signals of live races occurring at facilities,the phrase or simulcast signal rebroadcast from another facility in the definition of intertrack wager would be rendered totally redundant and without meaning because the words would simply refer to the same type of wager already clearly described in other language in the same statutory provision.a live race occurring at an facility which is broadcast to another facility is encompassed in the language a race or game transmitted from and performed live at another facility in the definition of intertrack wagering.id.if the language pertaining to the rebroadcast of simulcast signals also refers only to signals of live races transmitted from facilities,as gulfstream argues,this language adds absolutely nothing to the meaning of the statute,contrary to accepted rules of statutory construction.we have noted 
it is an elementary principle of statutory construction that significance and effect must be given to every word,phrase,sentence,and part of the statute if possible,and words in a statute should not be construed as mere surplusage.
hechtman nations title ins.of,so d,citing hawkins ford motor,so d.this principle dictates that the language pertaining to a rebroadcast of simulcast signals must be given some independent meaning and field of operation.
simulcasting is defined in the act as broadcasting events occurring live at an location to an location,or receiving at an location events occurring live at an location through various methods.stat.it is logical to conclude that the language in the definition of intertrack wagering pertaining to simulcast signal s rebroadcast from another facility includes the current method of disseminating simulcast signals of thoroughbred races that is at issue in the instant matter.see.stat.the words its signal in section are intended to include a simulcast signal of a race occurring live at an location if an facility disseminates that signal to other facilities.at the very least,this interpretation creates ambiguity as to the meaning of the words its signal in section.
if the meaning of a statutory provision is deemed ambiguous,it must be subject to judicial construction.see blanton city of pinellas park,so d,i f the statutory language is ambiguous the court must resort to traditional rules of statutory construction to determine legislative intent.quoting palm beach county canvassing bd.harris
