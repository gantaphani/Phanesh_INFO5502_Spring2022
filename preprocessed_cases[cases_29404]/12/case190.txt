opinion of the court 
the principal issue on appeal is whether the district court erred by retroactively increasing the amount of an injunction bond upon dissolution of a preliminary injunction.
sprint communications company is a provider of long distance telephone service.cat communications international,is a reseller of local telephone service.the underlying dispute here arises from the allegedly improper use of sprint services by cat communications customers.
telephone users typically receive their local telephone service from a local exchange carrier,which operates in a geographically defined exchange area.cat communications is a competitive local exchange carrier that leases lines from other local exchange carriers and sells local telephone service available on these lines to the public on a prepaid basis.cat communications has no telephone facilities of its own.
as a long distance carrier,sprint carries long distance calls forwarded to it by local exchange carriers.in order to bill the long distance callers using its services,sprint usually receives billing name and address information from the local exchange carriers.as an alternative,the local exchange carriers may provide billing and collecting services on behalf of sprint.
sprint contends that its network received unauthorized long distance telephone calls from cat communications local service customers.the calls originated from several states,the largest number coming from new jersey.none of these calls were paid for.
sprint asked cat communications to prevent its customers from gaining access to sprint network and also to provide a billing mechanism or billing information to facilitate sprint collection efforts.when cat communications did not respond,sprint filed suit in federal court alleging trespass,conversion,nuisance,unjust enrichment,civil conspiracy,common law fraud,and violation of the federal communications act,et.sprint also requested preliminary injunctive relief.
in may,the district court heard arguments on sprint request for a preliminary injunction to prevent the unauthorized and unpaid use of its network.sprint wanted cat communications to restrict its customers access to sprint long distance network.cat communications argued that the expense of instituting the restriction should foreclose issuing a preliminary injunction.because cat communications provided n o affidavits or similar proofs supporting its argument,the district court found that the cost to cat communications of such restriction was at that point mere conjecture.sprint communications.cat communications int l,wl,at may,dist.lexis.moreover,the district court held the possible cost of the restriction would not be significant when compared to the harm sustained by sprint.id.at the time,sprint had shown a total of in unpaid long distance phone bills attributed to the unauthorized use of its network by cat communications customers.id.at.
the district court issued an order preliminarily restraining cat communications from permitting its customers to access or place calls on sprint long distance network and directing it to take such measures as are necessary to block all its customers access.sprint communications.cat communications int l,wl at may,order.the injunction order required sprint to post a bond for payment of such costs and damages as may be incurred or suffered by cat communications if found to have been wrongfully enjoined.id.at.
soon after the order was issued,cat communications moved to modify the preliminary injunction.but it withdrew the motion after the district court amended the injunction order cat communications appealed the preliminary injunction but then withdrew its appeal.
cat communications complied with the preliminary injunction by ordering blocks on its customers access to sprint network.the blocks were actually instituted by the local exchange carriers that own the local lines,not by cat communications,a reseller of local service that does not have its own telephone facilities.in some areas,the local exchange carriers charged fees to cat communications in order to institute and maintain the blocks.particularly,in new jersey,verizon charged a fee to impose a block on each cat communications customer and a per line monthly charge to maintain the block.with these charges,cat communications began to accrue significant costs under the preliminary injunction 
but cat communications took no action until november,when it sought to terminate the preliminary injunction and increase the amount of the injunction bond.at that time,cat communications asserted that the blocking charges stood at over million and were projected to rise.in january,sprint and cat communications filed motions for summary judgment.the original district judge had by then retired and a hearing on these motions was set for april before a new district judge.
the district court granted summary judgment to cat communications on sprint nuisance,unjust enrichment,civil conspiracy,common law fraud,and federal communications act claims,but denied summary judgment on the trespass and conversion claims.the district court denied sprint motion for summary judgment on its trespass and conversion claims.it also dissolved the preliminary injunction and,at the same time,increased the injunction bond to million.the increase in the bond amount was based on the accrued blocking fees charged to cat communications.
sprint appeals the dissolution of the preliminary injunction and the simultaneous increase in the amount of the injunction bond because our focus is on the latter issue,we address the bond increase first.
we normally review district court judgments fixing the amount of an injunction bond for abuse of discretion.see,united healthcare ins.advancepcs,cir we review the amount of the injunction bond for an abuse of discretion.but here it is a question of law whether a district court may retroactively increase a bond amount,after the bond has been posted,in order to cover the asserted costs and damages incurred by the enjoined party.on this matter,we exercise plenary review.see,camden citizens in action dep t of envtl,cir stating that,in appeals from preliminary injunctions,questions of law are reviewed de novo.
generally,a bond is a condition of preliminary injunctive relief.c requires a successful applicant for a preliminary injunction to post a bond,in such sum as the district court deems proper,for the payment of such costs and damages as may be incurred or suffered by any party who is found to have been wrongfully enjoined.thus,the injunction bond provides a fund to use to compensate incorrectly enjoined defendants.instant air freight air freight,cir quotations omitted.
the injunction bond also serves other functions.it is generally settled that,with rare exceptions,a party wrongfully enjoined has recourse only against the bond.see also hoxworth blinder,robinson,cir applicants derive some protection from the bond requirement,for enjoined parties injured by wrongfully issued preliminary injunctions can recover only against the bond itself.thus,the bond generally limits the liability of the applicant and informs the applicant of the price it can expect to pay if the injunction was wrongfully issued.instant air freight,at see also id.at the bond can thus be seen as a contract in which the court and the applicant agree to the bond amount as the price of a wrongful injunction.quotations omitted 
the functions of the bond are illustrated in the course of litigation involving preliminary injunctive relief.when a court grants an applicant request for a preliminary injunction,it will generally condition this grant on the applicant posting a bond.the applicant then decides whether to accept the preliminary relief by posting the bond or to withdraw its request.the applicant may base its decision on whether it wants to expose itself to liability up to the bond amount.if the preliminary injunction takes effect and it is later determined a party was wrongfully enjoined,that party may then seek recovery against the posted bond.the recovery generally can not exceed the amount posted.
if a retroactive increase is permissible,the injunction bo
