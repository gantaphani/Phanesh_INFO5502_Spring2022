cedar rapids cellular telephone,cedar rapids cellular,davenport cellular telephone company davenport cellular,and wwc license,llc wwc,appeal the district court dismissal of their complaint,which seeks to enjoin the attorney general of iowa from enforcing state consumer protection statutes against them.we affirm in part,reverse in part,and vacate the judgment of dismissal.
background 
cedar rapids cellular,davenport cellular,and wwc all provide wireless telephone service in the state of iowa.one way they sell wireless service is through term service agreements in which customers agree to purchase cellular telephone service for periods of time,typically from twelve to months.under the term service agreements,a customer who cancels service before the expiration of the term must pay liquidated damages in the form of a cancellation fee.cancellation fees allegedly range from to over.
in january,the attorney general of the state of iowa notified several wireless service providers that their business practices violate iowa law.the companies contacted by the attorney general included appellant wwc and cellular corporation,the parent corporation of appellants cedar rapids cellular and davenport cellular.the attorney general took the position that the liquidated damages provisions of the term service agreements violate the iowa consumer credit code,iowa code chapter,which prohibits charges for default in certain consumer transactions.he also objected,among other things,to the companies alleged practice of using arbitration clauses in the term service agreements to resolve customer disputes but using small claims court to collect customer debts.
on april,after negotiations between the attorney general and cellular broke down,the appellants filed this action in the united states district court for the northern district of iowa.in their complaint,the appellants seek a declaration of the following 
the iowa consumer credit code does not apply to their cellular telephone businesses in general or,in particular,to the cancellation fees in their term service agreements.
the federal communications act preempts a application of the iowa consumer credit code to the term service agreements,b any award for money damages under iowa consumer protection statutes,and c any state attempt to regulate wireless service providers in a way that is not competitively neutral.
enforcement of the iowa consumer credit code against the term service agreements unlawfully interferes with interstate commerce.
the federal arbitration act preempts application of the iowa consumer credit code to the arbitration clauses in the term service agreements.
the provisions of the iowa consumer credit code sought to be enforced against the wireless service providers are void for vagueness under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.
the appellants also seek to enjoin the attorney general from taking any action under or to enforce the iowa consumer credit code against them.
on the same day the appellants filed this case,the attorney general brought a civil enforcement action against cellular in state district court in polk county,iowa.in the state action,the attorney general alleges cellular is violating numerous provisions of the iowa consumer credit code and the other provisions of iowa law.in particular,the attorney general enforcement action alleges the following violations of iowa law 
cellular has refused to allow customers to cancel term service agreements unless they pay a cancellation fee.
cellular has misrepresented to customers that they have no right to cancel the term service agreements without paying cancellation fees.
cellular has refused to cease billing customers under canceled term service agreements without full payment,including payment of cancellation fees.
cellular has sought to collect attorney fees under the term service agreements or has authorized the collection of such fees by others.
cellular has misrepresented that customers would receive free telephones and free minutes while using other fees to recoup the costs of these products and services.
cellular has misrepresented that customers would receive free statewide roaming while assessing roaming charges for some calls.
cellular advertised and entered into contracts for free weekend hours on friday evening and monday morning and then modified its agreements by ending free weekend hours on friday and monday.
cellular invokes the arbitration clauses in its term service agreements when it is sued by customers but uses the courts to collect unpaid accounts,penalties,and attorney fees from its customers.
the attorney general action seeks,among other things,injunctive relief against cellular and its partners,officers,employees,agents,successors,and all other persons,corporations and other entities acting in concert or participating with cellular.
cellular removed the attorney general civil enforcement action to the united states district court for the southern district of iowa.that case was subsequently remanded to state court for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
the attorney general filed a motion to dismiss this lawsuit.the district court held that it lacked jurisdiction over the appellants preemption claims,reasoning that those claims are mere federal defenses that can not form a basis for federal jurisdiction.the district court ruled that it did have jurisdiction over the appellants remaining federal arising under the dormant commerce clause and the due process clause.it also assumed,without deciding,that it had supplemental jurisdiction over the appellants state law claims.nevertheless,citing various abstention doctrines,the district court dismissed the case.
the appellants now appeal the district court dismissal of their claims.they argue that the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over all of their federal claims and that it erred in abstaining from the federal claims it did not dismiss.appellants cedar rapids cellular and davenport cellular also argue that,even if it was appropriate for the district court to abstain,their claims should have been stayed rather than dismissed.
ii.standard of review 
a district court ruling on subject matter jurisdiction is reviewed under the de novo standard.charchenko city of stillwater,cir.a district court decision to abstain is reviewed for abuse of discretion,with underlying legal decisions receiving plenary review.beavers arkansas state bd.of dental exam rs,cir.
iii.jurisdiction 
the district court ruled that the appellants preemption claims can not support federal jurisdiction because they are in the nature of federal defenses.the district court reasoning might have had force if the appellants were only seeking a declaratory judgment.see public serv.comm of utah wycoff.dictum.however,because the appellants are also seeking injunctive relief on their preemption claims,the district court has jurisdiction to hear them.shaw delta air lines,d middle south energy,arkansas pub.serv.comm n,cir.
the attorney general did not file a,but argues that the district court should have at least dismissed the appellants state law claims.the general rule is that the eleventh amendment bars federal courts from enjoining state officers from violating state law.see pennhurst state sch.hosp.halderman,d.the district court acknowledged the pennhurst rule,but expressly declined to address whether this case presents an exception to it.we leave it to the district court to decide this question in the first instance.
iv.abstention 
our finding that the district court has subject matter jurisdiction over all the appellants federal claims does not resolve this appeal.we must also decide whether the district court acted properly in abstaining from the appellants claims.as discussed below,we uphold its decision to abstain from the claims of cedar rapids cellular and davenport cellular,but not from the claims of wwc.although the district court cited three separate abstention doctrines,the only appropriate basis for abstention in this case is younger harris,d.our decision in favor of abstention applies to all of the claims raised by cedar rapids cellular and davenport cellular.
