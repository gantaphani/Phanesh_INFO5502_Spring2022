charles crawford petitions for review of the federal communications commission dismissal of two proposals he filed to amend the commission table of allotments for fm radio channels.crawford principal contention is that he lacked notice that his proposals could be precluded by another applicant submission.with respect to one of crawford proposals,we dismiss his petition as moot.with respect to the other,we conclude that crawford received adequate notice and therefore deny the petition.
the federal communications commission fcc uses a process to allocate commercial fm radio frequencies to broadcasters.first,a frequency must be allocated to a particular community in the fm table of allotments.second,a prospective broadcaster may then apply for a license or construction permit for that frequency in that community.
the table of allotments can be amended only by rule.see amendment of part,subpart c rulemaking proceedings,rules of practice and procedure,see also.the process begins with an fcc notice of proposed rulemaking nprm,often in response to a broadcaster petition.the notice sets forth the proposed instance,allot channel at houston and announces periods for initial comments and reply comments during the initial comment period,the fcc accepts comments on the initial proposal.it also accepts counterproposals that are mutually exclusive with the initial proposal see d see also,implementation of bc docket to increase the availability of fm broadcast assignments,implementation of bc docket.
because one amendment to the table of allotments may be possible only if another amendment is made,broadcasters commonly submit proposals or counterproposals that include multiple amendments.in a given docket,the fcc considers the initial proposal and any counterproposals that are filed during the initial comment period.also treated as counterproposals are any ostensibly freestanding proposals that conflict with the initial proposal or with other long as they are filed before the end of the initial comment period.see,notice of proposed rule making,amendment of section b,table of allotments,fm broadcast stations,amendment of section b,table of allotments,fm broadcast stations,see also d.
after the initial comment period,any proposals that are mutually exclusive with those considered in the proceeding are cut off from consideration pursuant to d,which states counterproposals shall be advanced in initial comments only and will not be considered if they are advanced in reply comments.this means that during the reply comment period,comments can be filed on counterproposals submitted during the initial comment further counterproposals can not be filed.see id.
the impetus for this kind of cutoff rule derives from ashbacker radio fcc,which held that mutually exclusive broadcast applications must receive a comparative hearing.see id.at.as this circuit explained in ranger fcc,
obviously,if all valid conflicting pending applications must receive a comparative hearing,late filings create procedural difficulties.particularly is this so in view of what is described in this litigation as a chain reaction.let us assume three towns,a,b and c,fifty miles apart in a straight geographical line.application for a broadcast station at a is made.grant of that application would preclude a station at b on the same or an adjacent channel it would not affect the possibility of a station at before the application for a has been acted upon,an applicant files for a license at b and asks for a comparative hearing with a.a grant in b would preclude a station at therefore potential applicants for c must file in the case in order to protect their rights.theoretically this reaction could go on indefinitely and could eventually involve every potential situs in the united states.
id.at.and as we further noted in florida institute of technology fcc,i f the filing deadline for each link of a daisy chain of applications like that described above were based on the filing date of the previous link rather than that of the lead application,i n theory,at least the chain might never end,quoting kittyhawk broadcasting,second alteration in original.
by setting a firm deadline for the filing of conflicting proposals,the fcc cutoff rule prevents this kind of daisy chain of applications from going on indefinitely.this circuit has repeatedly invoked the rationale in upholding the fcc application of cutoff rules in different broadcast contexts.see,florida inst.of technology,at ranger,at.we have not,however,previously addressed such rules in the context of an fm allotment rulemaking proceeding.
on july,nationwide radio stations petitioned the fcc to allot fm channel at quanah,texas.on august,the fcc issued an nprm proposing this change and setting october,as the deadline for initial comments and october,as the reply comment deadline.see notice of proposed rule making,amendment of section b,table of allotments,fm broadcast stations,quanah nprm.it also set out the fcc rules for counterproposals,including the cutoff rule.id.at.
on october,the last day of the initial comment period and thus the last day to submit a counterproposal,a group of broadcasters the joint parties filed a counterproposal that included changes to the table of allotments.this counterproposal conflicted with nationwide proposal for quanah because it proposed allotting the same channel at a nearby location.due to a clerical error,the fcc did not place the joint parties counterproposal in its database or otherwise make it public 
on may,charles petitioner in this the fcc to allot channel at benjamin,texas.one week later,crawford filed a second proposal,seeking to allot channel at mason,texas.each of these proposals conflicted with a piece of the joint parties counterproposal in the quanah proceeding,and so should have been precluded under the fcc cutoff rule.the fcc,however,mistakenly docketed crawford proposals and issued an nprm for each.
during the initial comment period for crawford proposals,the fcc realized that it had not given notice of the joint parties counterproposal.thereafter,it issued such notice.the notice stated that the fcc would consider the counterproposal as part of the quanah proceeding,and it set a deadline for reply comments.
on june,the fcc media bureau audio division dismissed both of crawford petitions as precluded by the joint parties counterproposal.the bureau explained that even though the counterproposal had not been publicized immediately,it had been submitted before the end of the initial comment period for the quanah proposal,and it therefore precluded conflicting proposals.crawford petitioned for reconsideration,claiming principally that the quanah nprm provided him with insufficient notice that his proposals could be precluded by a proposal as complex as that of the joint parties.after this petition was denied,amendment of section b,table of allotments,fm broadcast stations,media bureau reconsid.mem.op.order,crawford submitted an application for review by the full commission.the fcc denied that petition,amendment of section b,table of allotments,fm broadcast stations,commission mem.op.order,and crawford petitioned for review in this court.
before confronting the merits of crawford petition for review,we must consider whether this case is moot.as crawford notes,the joint parties have withdrawn the piece of their proposal that conflicts with his proposed benjamin allotment.see pet r reply br.at.for this reason,crawford brief acknowledged that there is no longer an active controversy with respect to the benjamin proposal.id.at see also id.at arguing for jurisdiction only with respect to the mason proposal.although crawford sought to resurrect his benjamin claim at oral argument,his initial position was correct.
crawford claim regarding the mason proposal may also soon become moot.for reasons unrelated to the issues before this court,the media bureau has dismissed the joint parties counterproposal and denied the joint parties petition for reconsideration of that decision.see resp t br.at.but the decision has not yet become final,and crawford mason proposal remains precluded.id.the controversy as to mason thus rema
