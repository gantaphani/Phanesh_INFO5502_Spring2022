appellant pink dot,pink dot,a grocery delivery service which relied heavily on customers telephone orders,sued respondent teleport communications group teleport,alleging that when negotiating for a centralized telephone system teleport falsely represented its reliability and falsely claimed the ability to implement caller id.pink dot further complained that after it disputed a bill and sought a new telephone service provider,teleport retaliated by intentionally discontinuing its telephone numbers without a forwarding number and by informing all callers that pink dot number had been disconnected.we reverse the judgment in favor of teleport and permit the matter to proceed to trial,since the tariff filed with the california public utilities commission puc allows limited recovery for any gross negligence by teleport and can not restrict liability for fraud and intentional misconduct 
factual and procedural summary 
in late,pink dot negotiated with teleport,a public utility regulated by the puc,to install and service a centralized telephone system.one of the important features pink dot required in its telephone system was caller id.during contract negotiations teleport represented to pink dot that its service was as reliable as pacific bell service,and that its service had an unsurpassed reliability of percent uptime.according to pink dot,teleport also asserted that its service could include caller id,which it would implement for pink dot.based upon these representations pink dot contracted with teleport for the installation and service of a centralized telephone system.
pink dot alleges that from approximately september of through april of teleport breached its agreement.specifically,teleport system was not capable of installing caller id during.teleport lacked the ability to install caller id until the second quarter of,when signaling problems in the networks of both teleport and pacific bell were corrected.as a teleport representative acknowledged during a deposition,because we could install it,we should not have been offering it to our customers at all.i mean,we ca offer a feature that we not able to do.
teleport also acknowledged that its representative asserted to pink dot during contract negotiations that,as indicated in its brochures,teleport service had an unsurpassed reliability of percent uptime.in fact,teleport promotional brochure specifically emphasized w e up and running smoothly more than of the time,making sure your vital communications are doing the same.and we employed the latest technology which enables us to provide the alternative routing,hour performance monitoring,and planning your business requires.result,we able to operate so efficiently,our clients experience less than one errored bit in the equivalent to one misspelled word in war and peace.considering that,is it any wonder that leading financial institutions,stock exchanges,medical centers,law firms,network broadcasters,advertising agencies and even yes carriers depend on teleport superior local service for their vital local communications requirements.
despite the impression that teleport customers would have percent uptime,teleport defined uptime as limited to its own network with no regard to the actual services received by the customers.teleport project manager did not consider anything that tags the customer premise equipment as part of our network,and thus excluded the outages suffered by pink dot from the percentage of uptime it guaranteed.thus,the more than hours of outages experienced by pink dot were not deemed by teleport as downtime under teleport interpretation of its representations.this conclusion,however,was contrary to the understanding of teleport own sales representative,who had assured pink dot of teleport reliability and who believed that the claim of minimal downtime included any outage time suffered by the customer.
pink dot ultimately informed teleport that it was disputing its bills,terminating its service with teleport,and switching to pacific bell.teleport did not provide any discount or credit to pink dot for any of the service problems.as teleport threatened to do,when pink dot did not pay the disputed bills,teleport refused to refer callers to pink dot new numbers but rather placed a disconnect message on pink dot old numbers.responsible personnel at teleport were specifically aware that placing the disconnect message would damage pink dot business.pink dot,in fact,lost business and incurred increased advertising expenses.
pink dot thereafter sued teleport.pink dot second amended complaint alleged breach of contract,gross negligence which pink dot acknowledged was limited by teleport tariff to recovery of,intentional misrepresentation,violation of section which by its terms permits actual and exemplary damages for willful violations of any state law or any order or decision of the puc,intentional interference with economic relations,and unfair competition.teleport moved for summary judgment or,alternatively,summary adjudication on the issue of whether pink dot damages were limited by the tariff.teleport argued that all of pink dot causes of action fell within teleport tariff,and that the trial court lacked jurisdiction based on the tariff.it urged alternatively that the trial court should limit liability for damages to a credit for service interruptions and to for any gross negligence,though it also argued no gross negligence existed from the mere failure to provide the type and quality of services represented in the tariff.
the trial court judge julius title denied teleport motion for summary judgment.it specifically found that the t ariff does not address intentional tort claims regarding matters not contained in the published tariffs and in such matters the court does have jurisdiction to consider damage claims.however,the trial court granted summary adjudication on the negligence cause of action.
pink dot also filed a motion for summary adjudication,which was heard the same time as teleport motion.pink dot urged that undisputed evidence established that teleport breached the contract by failing to install caller id and by permitting multiple service interruptions.it further urged that teleport committed fraud when it represented it could install caller id.the court denied the motion for summary adjudication,finding that factual disputes existed.
before a jury was empanelled or any evidence was presented,teleport filed a motion in limine again urging that pink dot damages fell within the provisions of teleport tariff and that pink dot claims for damages were therefore barred.the trial court judge james albracht accepted the argument that the tariff limitations applied to pink dot fraud and other intentional tort claims.the court viewed the intentional misrepresentation claims as really just another way of articulating claims for bad service,albeit having moved back earlier in the time line.it thus granted teleport motion in limine and ruled that pink dot could put on all of its evidence in support of its claims of fraud,intentional interference,and violation of section,but that even if it prevailed it would be limited to a credit for service interruptions and no money damages.
because these rulings effectively left pink dot without any remedy,the court and the parties agreed,inter alia,that pink dot would waive its right to seek a trial to collect the credit for service interruptions,and that pink dot would dismiss its remaining unfair competition claim.the court then entered judgment against pink dot and in favor of teleport.
discussion 
the standard of review 
both the trial court rulings on summary adjudication of issues as to negligence,breach of contract and fraud,and ruling restricting damages in the fraud and intentional torts claims to a credit for service interruptions,which resulted in judgment against pink dot,were based on the legal interpretation of the scope and effect of teleport tariff.because resolution of the appeal hinges on questions of law,we apply the de novo standard of review,exercising our independent judgment as to the legal effect of the facts and determining anew questions of law.buss superior court cal th,d,ghirardo antonioli cal th,d.
the puc rules and teleport tariff 
in the puc undertook,on its own motion,to investigate all tariff provisions limiting the liability of telephone companies.in its decision,filed june,re telephone corporations,cal,wl,the commission adopted findings and announced an order requiring each telephone company to adopt,as a part of its tariff,new limitation of liability rules.in substance the new rules were to provide expressly for liability for wilful misconduct,fraudulent conduct or violations of law allow liability for gross negligence to a limit of except that the limitation would be for companies having annual gross revenue of a million dollars or less limit liability for other errors or defects to a credit not exceeding the charges for the period affected.the commission declared that the report of its examiner had correctly found that the present limitation of liability rules do not apply to situations involving wilful misconduct,fraudulent conduct or violations of law,and that these exceptions should henceforth be stated specifically in future tariffs.stern general telephone d.
the puc expressly stated that the public utilities candidly concede that the rules which limit their liability do not apply to situations which involve willful misconduct,fraudulent conduct or violations of law.this is correct.civil code case citations omitted.re telephone corporations,supra,cal.at.indeed,pursuant to civil code section,all contracts which have for their object,directly or indirectly,to exempt anyone from responsibility for his own fraud,or willful injury to the person or property of another,or violation of law,whether willful or negligent,are against the public policy of the law.
we acknowledge the subsequent observation in waters pacific telephone cal d,footnote,waters that public policy considerations,such as that in the proscription of civil code section,are not necessarily applicable to the provisions of a tariff.as noted in waters,the rate specified in the tariff may have been computed with the understanding that the exculpatory clause in the tariff would relieve the utility of the expense of insuring itself against liability.in waters,however,both the utility actions complained of and the tariff filed predated the puc opinion in re telephone corporations,which required exposure to liability for any willful misconduct,fraud or violations of law by the utility.after the effective date of re telephone corporations,as here,utilities should be responsible for taking into account the economic implications of liability for willful misconduct,fraud or violations of law.
in the present case,as it was required to do by section,teleport filed a tariff with the puc.unlike the tariff found in other cases,teleport tariff was inexplicably silent as to the required liability for any willful misconduct,fraud or violations of law.compare,los angeles cellular telephone superior court th,fn,d colich sons pacific bell d,fn.but the tariff did contain clauses intended to limit teleport liability to its customers for damages caused by its conduct.the tariff provided,in pertinent part,as follows the liability of the company for damages arising out of the furnishing of these services,including but not limited to mistakes,omissions,interruptions,delays,or errors,or other defects,representations,or use of these services or arising out of the failure to furnish the service,whether caused by acts of commission or omission,shall be limited to the extension of allowances for interruption.the extension of such allowances for interruption shall be the sole remedy of the customer and the sole liability of the company.in the event an error or omission is caused by the gross negligence of the company,the liability of the company shall be limited to and in no event exceed the sum of.
we find that teleport can not eliminate its liability for willful misconduct,fraud or violations of law by merely omitting the acknowledgment of such liability from its tariff.failure to state such liability in its tariff violates the specific mandate in the puc opinion in re telephone corporations,which ordered that those exceptions to limitations of liability be stated in telephone company tariffs.see stern general telephone,supra,d at.if teleport could so simply opt out of liability for intentional misconduct or fraud,what could prevent a utility from filing a tariff with terms completely eliminating its liability for gross negligence and why have limited liability for gross negligence as stated in teleport tariff,but preclude liability for more aggravated claims involving intentional misconduct or fraud the failure,intentional or otherwise,to file a properly worded tariff thus can not insulate teleport from liability for intentional misconduct or fraud in dealing with its customers.
teleport potential liability for misrepresentation and fraud is particularly appropriate as to the caller id issue.teleport acknowledges that caller id was not a service included in its tariff in.to the extent caller id was not an included service when teleport offered to install it in or,it is difficult to envision how teleport tariff could exculpate it from liability for problems relating to a service it did not furnish.and since teleport could not then as a matter of law have furnished a service not in its tariff,fraudulently promising to provide the caller id service would be all the more egregious.
moreover,teleport suggestion is unpersuasive that the vague language in its tariff precluding liability for damages including but not limited to representations could be construed to preclude liability for intentional misconduct and fraud.even if such broad and unfocused exculpatory language in teleport tariff could be so construed,the rule has been stated many times that if there is an ambiguity in a tariff any doubt in its interpretation is to be resolved in favor of the nondrafter and against the utility.transmix southern pac.d.see masonite pacific gas electric d.
most significantly,however,attempting to preclude such liability in a tariff provision would be contrary to the puc mandate and prevailing law.as the puc explain ed,it is clear that ordinary rules permitting the limitation of liability do not apply to situations involving fraud or wilful misconduct.empire west southern california gas cal d,fn.empire west.
no california case holds that the terms of a puc tariff can insulate a public utility from its intentionally tortious conduct.accordingly,the terms of teleport tariff could not have precluded liability for willful misconduct,fraud or violations of law or for gross negligence up to in damages.
the filed rate doctrine 
teleport also focuses on the federal filed rate doctrine and various federal cases,american telephone telegraph central office telephone,d wegoland nynex cir,to support its notion that a tariff can preclude state statutory or common law claims,even claims for fraud.according to teleport,the federal filed rate doctrine does more than bar a claim alleging entitlement to services on terms contrary to the terms specified in a filed tariff.teleport essentially urges that any claim alleging inadequate service,even one based on fraudulent representations or false advertising used to induce a contract,necessarily attacks the reasonableness of tariff rates,which is prohibited by the completely binding nature of a tariff.even accepting arguendo teleport restrictive view of the federal filed rate doctrine,its reliance on the doctrine is unavailing here.
to the degree teleport seeks to apply directly the federal filed rate doctrine,it may not do so in the present case because no federal tariff is implicated.teleport filed its tariff with the california puc and not with any federal regulatory entity.since this is a state case with no tariff filed with any federal regulatory agency,the direct application of the federal filed rate doctrine is inappropriate.see knevelbaard dairies kraft foods,cir,knevelbaard.
even if teleport reasons by analogy to the federal filed rate doctrine and thereby urges the same restrictive notions of liability are inherent in the state filed r
