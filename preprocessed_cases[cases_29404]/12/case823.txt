the federal communications commission exempts noncommercial educational entities from participating in auctions for broadcast licenses when they apply for channels within the portion of the spectrum reserved for them,but not when they apply for channels in the unreserved spectrum.in this case,noncommercial educational broadcasters challenge the commission policy,arguing that the balanced budget act of requires the commission to exempt them from participating in auctions for any channel,reserved or unreserved,and that the commission adoption of this policy was arbitrary and capricious.finding the commission refusal to exempt such broadcasters from auctions for unreserved channels contrary to the act plain language,we vacate the offending portions of the commission order.
for more than fifty years,the federal communications commission has reserved part of the fm radio spectrum and several television channels exclusively for noncommercial educational use.in re applications of wqed pittsburgh cornerstone television,fcc rcd,vacated in part by fcc rcd.the commission has done this because of the high quality type of programming which would be available in such of an entirely different character from that available on most commercial stations.id.internal quotations omitted.not restricted to this spectrum,however,noncommercial educational broadcasters nces may also apply for licenses in the unreserved spectrum,known as commercial licenses.
historically,the commission allocated licenses for both reserved and unreserved channels through evidentiary hearings.seeking to lessen reliance on these hearings,congress,acting through the balanced budget act of,amended communications act section j to provide that if mutually exclusive applications are accepted for any initial license or construction permit,then,except as provided in paragraph,the commission shall grant the license or permit to a qualified applicant through a system of competitive bidding.balanced budget act of a a,j.section j states that this competitive bidding authority shall not apply to licenses or construction permits issued by the commission for,among other things,nces.j c id.
in an effort to implement the balanced budget act,the commission proposed holding auctions for all licenses for commercial channels,but not for channels reserved for nces.in re implementation of section j of the communications bidding for commercial broad.instructional television fixed serv.licenses,fcc rcd proposed.the commission would continue allocating the latter through evidentiary hearings.although nces applying for licenses to operate stations on the part of the spectrum reserved for them would thus not have to participate in auctions,those applying for commercial licenses would.because commenters disagreed about whether this approach was consistent with section j,and because the commission did not focus on the complicated nature of this issue in its notice in this proceeding,the commission solicited a further round of comment.in re implementation of section j of the communications bidding for commercial broad.instructional television fixed serv.licenses,fcc rcd.in doing so,the commission recognized that if section j barred it from requiring nces to participate in auctions for commercial licenses,several alternatives existed establishing a special track for processing nce applications adopting a hybrid approach when nces apply for instance,evaluating applicants initially on a point system and,if the nce is thereby eliminated,proceeding to an auction or even making nces ineligible to apply for commercial licenses altogether.in re reexamination of the comparative standards for noncommercial educ.applicants,fcc rcd.
in the resulting report and order challenged here,the commission answered what it called p erhaps the most difficult question posed in this proceeding how to interpret section j by adopting its initial proposal and exempting nces from competing in auctions only when they apply for licenses to operate channels in the reserved spectrum.see in re reexamination of the comparative standards for noncommercial educ.applicants,fcc rcd see also id.at.public radio,the association of america public television stations,the corporation for public broadcasting,and the state of oregon acting on behalf of southern oregon university seek review of this decision,arguing that it conflicts with the act nce exemption and that it is arbitrary and capricious.
in evaluating petitioners argument that the commission action violates the balanced budget act of,we proceed under the familiar test of chevron natural resources defense council,d.if congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.id.at.only if the statute is silent or ambiguous do we defer to the agency interpretation,asking whether it is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at.
arguing that the commission action fails step one,petitioners claim that the act unambiguously forbids the commission from requiring nces to participate in auctions to obtain licenses for any channel,reserved or unreserved.we agree.while section j first paragraph directs the commission to award licenses through a system of competitive bidding,it only does so subject to limitations set forth in the second paragraph,one of which expressly denies the commission authority to hold auctions for licenses issued for nces.j.because this paragraph denial of authority is based on the nature of the station that ultimately receives the license,not on the part of the spectrum in which the station operates,nothing in the act authorizes the commission to hold auctions for licenses issued to nces to operate in the unreserved spectrum.
this is not to say that the act language is perfectly crafted.for instance,because the exemption refers to the ultimate recipient of the license,not to applicants for the license,the commission apparently has authority to require an nce applicant to participate in an auction so long as it does not ultimately receive a license.but as petitioners noted at oral argument,to ensure that an nce never has to participate in an auction for a license that it ultimately receives,the commission must exempt all nce applicants from such auctions.inartful drafting is not the same as ambiguity.meredith fed.mine safety health review,t he presence of a difficult question of statutory construction does not necessarily render that provision ambiguous for purposes of chevron.here,the fact remains that under the act plain language the commission must exempt nces from participating in all auctions.in any event,the commission has not argued that the statute is ambiguous for this reason.
our concurring colleague,advancing another argument not made by the commission,believes that the statute is ambiguous for a different reason the word issued in section j may mean that the section applies only to licenses already issued,that is,to renewals of existing licenses.but this is not a plausible reading of the statute section j grant of bidding authority for licenses is expressly limited to initial licenses,not to renewals.j.reading j as exempting only nce renewals from this authority would thus render the section meaningless.
the commission argues not that the statute is ambiguous for any of these reasons,but rather that it is silent on the specific question before us,thus requiring us to defer to the commission interpretation under chevron step two.n othing in the text of the provision,the commission argues,evinces unambiguous congressional intent on the narrow question of competing applications filed by nces for a channel.respondent br.at see also in re reexamination of the comparative standards for noncommercial educ.applicants,fcc rcd.by failing to distinguish between reserved and unreserved channels,however,section j exempts nces that apply for commercial licenses from participating in auctions.true,nothing in the act text specifically says that nces applying for commercial licences are exempt from auctions.but general rules need not list ev
