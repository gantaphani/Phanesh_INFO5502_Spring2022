the federal telecommunications act of the act or the act,stat.codified in various sections of fundamentally restructured local telephone markets by ending the era of telecommunications monopolies and by encouraging competition among providers of local telephone service.at t iowa utils,d.to reach this objective,the act required incumbent telecommunications carriers to share their networks with competitors in various ways.nestled within the act local competition provisions is a detailed scheme for the creation of interconnection agreements that serve as the foundation for increased competition between incumbent local exchange carriers incumbents and competitive local exchange carriers competitors.see.the act regulatory scheme explicitly foresees but also clearly circumscribes the participation of state regulatory entities in the commencement and enforcement of interconnection agreements.it is within this context that we consider the extent to which a state regulatory commission can encourage competitors to enter the market independent of the act provisions governing interconnection agreements.

factual and procedural background 
factual history 
the dispute between verizon,an incumbent,and coast,a competitor,concerns telecommunications traffic connecting consumers to isps through equipment owned by verizon and coast.one of the purposes of the act was to create a mechanism that forced incumbents to provide interconnectivity with the facilities and equipment of competitors.otherwise,incumbents could halt efforts to increase competition in any local market.to this end,congress provided a statutory mechanism to encourage the development of interconnection agreements between competitors and incumbents.coast did not have any such agreement with verizon.however,coast did have an interconnection agreement with ameritech,a different incumbent,under which coast provided telephone and other services within the territory of ameritech.
when a verizon customer attempts to contact an isp that is a coast customer,the verizon customer uses a computer modem to place a local call to an isp with an number assigned to coast npa represents the area code,nxx represents the first three digits of a local number.the call is first transferred to ameritech facilities before it is routed to coast via coast pontiac exchange switch.coast eventually connects the call to the isp.the presence of ameritech as a carrier is necessary because coast neither provides local exchange service within verizon territory nor connects its facilities directly with those belonging to verizon.calls are considered to be local,and are charged for a local call only by virtue of prior pronouncements of the federal communications commission fcc on the issue.in reality,calls often travel beyond the local exchange area,and the websites accessed via the isp are often located in different states or even different countries.
the chief dispute between verizon and coast revolves around the costs of terminating telecommunications traffic.local carriers often reciprocally compensate each other for the transportation and termination of local telephone calls according to rates established in their interconnection agreements.there has been considerable debate over whether incumbents must broach the issue of reciprocal compensation for the termination of local calls when forming interconnection agreements,see infra pps,but in any event,coast and verizon had no interconnection agreement.
coast claimed that verizon was responsible for the costs of terminating traffic originating from verizon customers.coast had filed a tariff with the mpsc pursuant to which coast established a rate of cents per minute in reciprocal compensation charges.coast informed verizon that based upon million minutes of traffic between march and july,verizon owed coast almost.verizon refused to pay.consequently,on august,coast filed an application with the mpsc,requesting that the mpsc resolve the dispute.verizon argued in response that the mpsc did not possess subject matter jurisdiction over calls because they are interstate in nature.verizon also contended that it was not required to pay reciprocal compensation for the termination of calls in the absence of an interconnection agreement negotiated or arbitrated pursuant to.the mpsc denied verizon motion to dismiss on september,and held a full evidentiary hearing on november.
the mpsc made its ruling on february.it exercised jurisdiction over the dispute even though coast relied on its tariff,and not an interconnection agreement,as the basis for imposing termination charges on verizon.joint appendix at.in so holding,the mpsc relied on a past decision,bierman centurytel of,case no.pub.serv.comm,in which it ruled that interconnection between two local exchange carriers can be accomplished by interconnection agreement or by tariff.the mpsc rejected verizon argument that traffic was subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal government because it was inherently interstate.in rejecting this contention,the mpsc noted that even if the fcc did construe such traffic as being interstate in nature,the fcc did not disrupt preexisting decisions to the contrary.to further support its holding that a state tariff can supplant an interconnection agreement,the mpsc stated,although the fcc may have assumed that an interconnection agreement will be the typical setting in which reciprocal compensation disputes over isp traffic are resolved,it did not dictate that a state act only in that context.at.the mpsc concluded that verizon was responsible for the termination charges.
verizon brought an action against the commissioners and coast in the district court for the eastern district of michigan on march,seeking declaratory and injunctive relief both parties agreed to have the district court decide the case without any additional discovery,and both parties contended that they were entitled to summary judgment.the district court initially rejected verizon contention that traffic was exempted from the act reciprocal compensation requirements because the fcc regulations reaching such a conclusion had been vacated by the circuit.see worldcom,fcc.the district court agreed with verizon that the mpsc erred when it required verizon to pay coast in the absence of an interconnection agreement between the parties.the court reasoned that using a state tariff as a substitute for an interconnection agreement sidestepped the negotiation and arbitration provisions of the act.see.accordingly,the district court held,because the mpsc approved coast tariff without the parties satisfying the clear dictates of process,the mpsc acted contrary to the act.at.the district court vacated the mpsc decision and remanded the case,and the commissioners timely appealed 
on appeal,the commissioners renew the argument they presented at the district court,that state enforcement of coast tariff is not preempted by the act.they aver that interconnection agreements negotiated pursuant to are not the exclusive manner by which incumbents can be made responsible for reciprocal compensation.verizon responds by asserting that the mpsc is collaterally estopped from challenging the district court ruling because of the mpsc defeat in verizon north,strand,cir.verizon also alternatively contends that the district court was correct in its holding that the mpsc can not order a local exchange carrier to pay termination costs under a state tariff in the absence of an interconnection agreement.
jurisdiction 
verizon originally sought injunctive and declaratory relief against the enforcement of the mpsc order.based upon the supreme court ruling in verizon.pub.serv.comm of,d,the district court had subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to.in verizon,the court explained that the eleventh amendment does not bar a suit against the commissioners of a state regulatory body under the doctrine of ex parte young,when the suit is brought against the individual commissioners in their official capacities and the remedy sought is declaratory injunctive relief.verizon,at.see also.bell.mfs intelenet of,cir applying the holding in verizon.we have proper jurisdiction over the commissioners appeal of a final judgment of the district court,pursuant to.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
the standard of review is because the district court granted summary judgment in a review of a decision of a state administrative body.we review de novo a district court order granting summary judgment.mfs intelenet,at.summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as matter of law.c.the moving party has the burden of showing that there is an absence of evidence to establish the existence of an element that is essential to the nonmoving party action.celotex catrett,d.verizon and the mpsc do not dispute any of the facts in the state administrative record that the district court adopted.therefore,we must simply decide whether the mpsc order was violative of the act and thus was preempted.see united states cinemark usa,cir.
the de novo summary judgment review must also employ the proper standard or standards of review for review of the underlying state administrative ruling.mfs intelenet,at.we first review de novo whether a state public service commission orders comply with the requirements of the telecommunications act.id.we hold that the mpsc order does not comply with the requirements of the act,and thus we do not reach the point of reviewing the state commission interpretation of coast tariff under the more deferential standard of review usually accorded state administrative bodies assessments of state law principles.id.
background of the statutory scheme 
a brief foray into the mechanics of the act interconnection provisions is helpful.to further the goal of deregulating the local telephony market,the act places certain duties and obligations on various classes of telecommunication providers.all telecommunication carriers,regardless of incumbent status,have the duty to interconnect directly or indirectly with the facilities and equipment of other telecommunications carriers.a.the act creates obligations for local exchange carriers generally,including a duty not to prohibit the resale of their telecommunications services,b,a duty to provide number portability,id.at b,and most pertinent to this appeal,a duty to establish reciprocal compensation arrangements for the transport and termination of telecommunications when competitors interconnect with the incumbent network.id.at b see also a the provisions of this subpart apply to reciprocal compensation for transport and termination of telecommunications traffic between local exchange carriers and other telecommunications carriers.the act also prescribes a more specific mandate for incumbents by requiring them to share their networks with competitors through three mechanisms permit competitors to purchase local services at wholesale rates for resale to end users,see c permit competitors to lease unbundled elements of the incumbent network,see id.at c and permit competitors to interconnect their facilities to the incumbent network,see id.at c.see west communications,sprint communications,cir describing the act structure.as part of these additional obligations for incumbents,the act imposes a duty to negotiate in good faith in accordance with section of this title the particular terms and conditions of agreements to fulfill the duties described in section b and c.c.
section describes the procedures for the negotiation,arbitration,and approval of interconnection agreements.it establishes an intricate regulatory scheme with various burdens and responsibilities placed upon incumbents,competitors,and state regulatory commissions.after a competitor requests interconnection from an incumbent,an incumbent may negotiate and enter into a binding agreement with the requesting telecommunications carrier or carriers without regard to the standards set forth in b c.a.during the course of these voluntary negotiations,any party may request the state commission to mediate.id.at a.however,if no agreement is reached or if no negotiations commence within days after the competitor makes its initial request to enter into voluntary negotiations,the competitor can petition the state commission to arbitrate any open issues so long as the petition is made within days of the initial request.id.at b.the act provides detailed instructions and standards for the arbitration process and the establishment of rates,which the parties and the state commission must follow and implement during the compulsory arbitration process.id.at b,c d.
all interconnection agreements adopted by negotiation or arbitration shall be submitted for approval to the state commission.id.at e.the state commission can reject an agreement only under limited circumstances,such as when the agreement discriminates against another telecommunications carrier not a party to the agreement,id.at e a i,or when the agreement is not consistent with the public interest,convenience,and necessity.id.at e a ii.if the state commission fails to carry out its responsibilities under,the fcc can preempt the state commission jurisdiction and assume responsibility for carrying out the requirements of.id.at e.state courts do not have jurisdiction to review the action of a state commission in approving or rejecting an agreement under,id.at e,as all parties aggrieved by a state commission determination regarding an interconnection agreement must bring an action in federal district court.id.at e.
the state role in assisting the process of interconnection agreement formation is clearly bounded by the plain language of of the act.however,the act does not completely eliminate the role of the state commissions in regulating interconnection between lecs.section d provides,
in prescribing and enforcing regulations to implement the requirements of this section,the fcc shall not preclude the enforcement of any regulation,order,or policy of a state commission that 
a establishes access and interconnection obligations of local exchange carriers 
b is consistent with the requirements of this section and 
c does not substantially prevent implementation of the requirements of this section and the purposes of this part.
id.at d.thus,the mpsc order may stand if it is consistent with the requirements of,but to the extent the order is inconsistent with the act or prevents its implementation,the order is preempted.
collateral estoppel 
as a threshold issue,verizon contends that the commissioners are collaterally estopped from challenging the district court ruling because of this court holding in verizon north,strand,cir.the mpsc had issued an order that required verizon to file a general tariff offering its network elements and services on fixed terms to all potential competitors.such a tariff allowed competitors to purchase services directly off of the tariff menu from verizon without first negotiating or even requesting negotiations for an interconnection agreement.id.at.we held that the mpsc tariff requirement was preempted because it was inconsistent with the negotiation and arbitration system created by congress.id.at.
while the issues presented in verizon north are analogous,the mpsc is not collaterally estopped from bringing this appeal by our prior ruling.collateral estoppel applies,
w hen the issue in the subsequent litigation is identical to that resolved in the earlier lit
