finding that exclusivity agreements between cable companies and owners of apartment buildings and other developments have an effect on the cable market,the federal communications commission banned such contracts.the commission believes that these involve a cable company exchanging a valuable service like wiring a building for the exclusive right to provide service to the be regulated under section of the communications act as cable company practices that significantly impair the ability of their competitors to deliver programming to consumers.the commission thus forbade cable operators not only from entering into new exclusivity contracts,but also from enforcing old ones.petitioners,associations representing cable operators and apartment building owners,argue that the commission exceeded its statutory authority,arbitrarily departed from precedent,and otherwise violated the administrative procedure act.having carefully considered the parties excellent submissions,we disagree and conclude that the commission acted well within the bounds of both section and general administrative law.
understanding this controversy requires that we begin by explaining a few unintuitive statutory terms.the provision at issue here,section b of the communications act,makes it unlawful for a cable operator to engage in unfair methods of competition or unfair or deceptive acts or practices,the purpose or effect of which is to hinder significantly or to prevent any multichannel video programming distributor from providing satellite cable programming or satellite broadcast programming to subscribers or consumers.b.cable operators are just companies that deliver video programming by cable,like comcast and.see.multichannel video programming distributors mvpds are a broader set of companies that provide video programming to subscribers.mvpds include not only cable operators like comcast but also direct broadcast satellite companies like directv.see.although satellite cable programming and satellite broadcast programming differ originate from slightly different kinds of entities,compare i,and d,with i both terms essentially refer to programming,television shows transmitted to mvpds via satellite for retransmission to subscribers.for our purposes,the important point about them is this petitioners nowhere dispute the commission finding that most programming is delivered via satellite and so falls within one of these two categories.exclusive service contracts for provision of video services in multiple dwelling units and other real estate developments order.section b plain terms thus prohibit cable company practices with the purpose or effect of preventing competing mvpds,including other cable companies,from providing the two predominant types of programming to consumers.
the commission first considered exclusivity contracts between cable operators and multiple dwelling units mdus as an ancillary part of its inside wiring order.see in re telecommunications services inside wiring.that proceeding primarily concerned the ownership status of certain wiring inside mdus,and the commission order considered some thirteen different issues presented by its new wiring rules.but the commission also addressed a related issue raised in a separate notice of proposed rulemaking,namely whether it would be appropriate to cap exclusive contracts to open up mdus to potential competition on a or basis,and,if so,what would represent a reasonable cap.id.at.reviewing the evidence then available,the commission found that there was no sufficient basis in this record to ban or cap the term of exclusive contracts.id.at,see also id.at.
four years later,the commission returned to exclusivity contracts in a rulemaking devoted solely to that question.see order,at.analyzing the competitive harms and benefits of exclusivity clauses,see id.at,the commission this time concluded that exclusivity clauses cause significant harm to competition and consumers that the record did not reflect at the time of our inside wiring order,id.at,see also id.at.and because the commission found that the record now supports regulation,this time it extensively analyzed its authority to ban such contracts,concluding that both section and its ancillary authority empower it to act.id.at.the commission accordingly prohibited cable companies from enforcing existing exclusivity clauses and executing contracts containing new ones,id.at,rejecting more limited remedial options,id.at.
petitioners,a cable industry group called the national cable telecommunications association ncta and a pair of affiliated real estate groups real estate petitioners,find various faults with this regulatory turnabout.they believe that the commission failed to justify its change in policy and to consider the retroactive effects of its action.they also believe that the commission ventured into affairs over which it has no jurisdiction and should have enacted a more limited remedy.but most fundamentally,they believe that the commission exceeded its section authority in regulating exclusivity deals at all.it is to this question of statutory construction that we first turn.
because this issue involves an agency interpretation of its governing statute,chevron familiar framework applies.chevron natural res.def.council,d.first,we ask if the statute unambiguously forecloses the agency interpretation,hazardous waste treatment council epa.if so,we disregard the agency view and give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.chevron,at.if the statute is ambiguous enough to permit the agency reading,however,we defer to that interpretation so long as it is reasonable,consumer elecs.ass fcc.
conceding that on a literal reading of the statute exclusivity contracts do have the effect of preventing competing mvpds from providing satellite cable programming or satellite broadcast programming to subscribers or consumers,b see oral arg,petitioners nonetheless argue that section text,structure,and history demonstrate that it was addressed to a different evil altogether.pharm.research mfrs.of am.thompson,using all traditional tools of statutory interpretation,including text,structure,purpose,and legislative history,to ascertain congress intent at chevron step one.congress,they argue,was concerned not with barriers to service but with practices that prevent cable competitors from obtaining certain kinds of programming that the american public wants to watch.textually,they emphasize congress identification of satellite cable programming and satellite broadcast programming in particular,arguing that the commission has read these terms out of the statute.structurally,they emphasize section c,which directs the commission to implement subsection b with rules and procedures focused on fair dealing between programming vendors and mvpds,not on barriers to service generally.and for legislative history they cite the bill sponsor,who intended his legislation to require the cable monopoly to stop refusing to deal,to stop refusing to sell its products to other distributors of television programs,cong.rec,tauzin,thus addressing his concern that the hot shows are controlled by cable,id.at see also id.at t his bill says to the cable industry,you have to stop what you have been doing,and that is killing off your competition by denying it products.emphasis added.petitioners thus argue that in enacting section b,congress intended to prevent the cable industry from starving its competition of more,nothing less.
for its part,the commission concedes that congress primary purpose in enacting section was indeed to expand competition for programming,not service.but this primary purpose is hardly dispositive,it argues,because statutory prohibitions often go beyond the principal evil to cover reasonably comparable evils,and it is ultimately the provisions of our laws rather than the principal concerns of our legislators by which we are governed.oncale sundowner offshore,d.reviewing the same text,structure,and legislative history,the commission interprets section to permit regulation of exclusive service agreements as an evil that easily falls within the literal terms of the statute and is reasonably comparable to the paradigmatic practices that section specifically targets.see order,at.we agree.
beginning,as always,with the plain language of the statute,citizens coal council norton,we find nothing in section that unambiguously forecloses the commission interpretation.what the commission forbade lies within the literal terms of section b proscription.indeed,exclusivity agreements have both the proscribed purpose and the proscribed effect cable operators execute them precisely so that they can be the sole company serving a building,and as petitioners themselves put it,if you ca serve a building then you ca deliver satellite cable programming and satellite broadcast programming,oral arg.
to be sure,if congress specifically intended to forbid practices having an effect on service generally,focusing only on two particular kinds of programming would have been an odd way to accomplish that result.but the existing language would have been an equally odd way of proscribing only unfair dealing between programming vendors and mvpds as petitioners submit because the words congress chose focus not on practices that prevent mvpds from obtaining satellite cable or satellite broadcast programming,but on practices that prevent them from providing that programming to subscribers or consumers.b.mindful that statutes written in broad,sweeping language should be given broad,sweeping application,consumer,at,we note section b broad and sweeping terms,which prohibit practices the purpose or effect of which is to hinder significantly or to prevent any multichannel video programming distributor from providing satellite cable programming or satellite broadcast programming to subscribers or consumers.b emphasis added.this breadth comports with section express purpose of promot ing the public interest,convenience,and necessity by increasing competition and diversity in the multichannel video programming market,a.thus,while the specificity of section references to satellite cable and satellite broadcast programming may reveal the primary evil that congress had in mind,nothing in the statute unambiguously limits the commission to regulating anticompetitive practices in the delivery of those kinds of programming by methods addressed to that narrow concern alone.see oncale,at.
for their structural argument,petitioners emphasize that subsections c through f of section require regulations,remedies,and procedures uniquely suited to the problem of unfair dealing over television shows between programming vendors controlled by cable and competing mvpds.see c f.section c c,which requires the commission to prohibit practices including exclusive contracts that prevent a multichannel video programming distributor from obtaining such programming,well represents this point,see c c,as does section e,which specifically authorizes the commission to remedy violations by setting prices,terms,and conditions of sale of programming,e.from this,petitioners infer that the commission focus on competition for service rather than programming fits uncomfortably with congress focus on programming,not service.
but this structural argument is a sword,and its,cuts sharply against petitioners.by its terms,section c describes only the m inimum contents of regulations,c,and as the commission itself noted,congress enumeration of specific,required regulations in subsection c actually suggests that congress intended subsection b generic language to cover a broader field,see order,at.the commission remedial powers similarly extend beyond the kinds of interventions congress specifically foresaw.indeed,instead of limiting the commission to those powers,congress broadly authorized the commission to prescribe regulations to specify particular conduct that is prohibited by subsection b,c,to prescribe regulations to implement this section,f,and to order appropriate remedies including but expressly not limited to the option,e.ultimately,then,our view of section structure mirrors our view of its text congress had a particular manifestation of a problem in mind,but in no way expressed an unambiguous intent to limit the commission power solely to that version of the problem.
petitioners legislative history argument suffers from the same deficiency.although they point to considerable evidence that congress was specifically concerned with unfair dealing over programming,they offer no evidence from the legislative record to show that congress chose its language so as to limit the commission solely to that particular abuse of market power.true,representative tauzin introduced this legislation to say to the cable industry,you have to stop killing off your competition by denying it products,cong.rec,but the principal concern of one congressman helps little in locating the limits of the language chosen by all members of both houses.see oncale,at.i t is ultimately the provisions of our laws rather than the principal concerns of our legislators by which we are governed.nor is the legislative history the house of representatives preferred section b broad language to another contemporaneous suggestion expressly limited to unreasonable refusals to deal.see,cong.thus,even if legislative history could carry petitioners all the way from statutory language that literally authorizes the commission action to the proposition that the statute unambiguously forecloses the agency view,this legislative history can not.
petitioners counter with an insightful hypothetical.suppose the statute replaced the terms satellite cable programming or satellite broadcast programming with programming.could the commission still forbid exclusivity contracts by reasoning that if competitors ca serve a building,they ca provide telemundo if so,petitioners have raised the specter of a statutory grant without bounds,for one would be hard pressed to imagine any cable industry practice not having at least a marginal effect on competitors ability to provide particular kinds of programming.
we think this apparent overbreadth argument is best analyzed at chevron step claiming,in effect,that although the statute does not unambiguously limit the kinds of practices that the commission may regulate as having the proscribed effect,the commission might still act unreasonably by extrapolating from a narrow effect,an effect on spanish tv to any practice causing it,however removed,tv service generally.that argument has merit as far as it goes in proscribing an overbroad set of practices with the statutorily identified effect,an agency might stray so far from the paradigm case as to render its interpretation unreasonable,arbitrary,or capricious.see,chao,w hatever ambiguity may exist can not render nugatory restrictions that congress has imposed.that said,the argument just does go very far in this case.petitioners hypothetical derives whatever force it has from the fact that programming would rightly be understood as a fact that would lend special force to the view that the commission,in regulating all service as affecting spanish programming,was taking unreasonably overbroad action to achieve an objective congress never intended to authorize.but satellite programming is hardly a niche.indeed,petitioners nowhere dispute that it encompasses most programming,order,at.thus,in regulating exclusivity deals as having the purpose or effect of hindering delivery of these kinds of programming,the commission barely reached beyond the paradigm case at all.in this regard,we think it noteworthy that among the many narrower remedies commenters suggested,not one urged the commission to modify its rule so as to ban exclusivity deals only to the extent they affect satellite cable or satellite broadcast programming alone.
in the end,petitioners are unable to satisfy their heavy burden.to prevail at chevron step one,they must show that section b is unambiguously limited to congress principal concern with unfair program hoarding.because section actual words reach the behavior the commission prohibited,petitioners are left to argue that the commission relies almost entirely on a literal reading of the statutory the most damning criticism when it comes to statutory interpretation.consumer,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.and while the statute text,structure,and history do support the proposition that congress was,in fact,principally concerned with program hoarding,none suggests that congress chose its language to limit the commission to regulating that evil alone.indeed,having employed all available tools of statutory construction,we find little that suggests any congressional intent to limit section b to competition for programming,and so are unable to conclude that a reading literally permitted is nonetheless unambiguously foreclosed.at the very best,petitioners have demonstrated some ambiguity as to whether congress intended to allow regulation of exclusivity contracts along with unfair dealing over the commission reasonably resolved in favor of its own interpretation.thus,concluding that section b authorizes the commission action,we need not consider the commission ancillary authority.
real estate petitioners separate attack on the commission authority has little merit.they argue that the exclusivity ban impermissibly regulates the real estate industry,which lies outside the commission jurisdiction.the terms of the challenged prohibition apply only to cable companies,however,and they neither require nor prohibit any action by mdus.see order,at,we merely prohibit the enforcement of existing exclusivity clauses and the execution of new ones by cable operators.emphasis added.as we have emphasized,no canon of administrative law requires us to view the regulatory scope of agency actions in terms of their practical or even foreseeable effects.cable wireless,fcc.the alternative is untenable,as most every agency action has relatively immediate effects for parties beyond those directly subject to regulation.for just one example,no one questions the commission jurisdiction to promulgate the inside wiring order even though it dealt with myriad issues affecting the mdu industry,including such critical minutiae as whether wiring behind sheet rock is physically inaccessible and so must be opened to competing providers.at,see also cable telecomm.ass fcc,wl,at.approximately percent of americans live in mdus,and their numbers are growing.order,at.we decline to put issues relating to their cable service outside the commission authority simply because those issues also matter to their landlords.
for their primary apa claim,petitioners argue that in deciding to bar exclusivity contracts now,after affirmatively permitting them in,the commission failed to explain its change of heart and thus acted arbitrarily and capriciously.ncta opening br.of course,it is axiomatic that agency action must either be consistent with prior action or offer a reasoned basis for its departure from precedent.williams gas coast ferc,internal quotation marks and brackets omitted.yet it is equally axiomatic that an agency is free to change its mind so long as it supplies a reasoned analysis,motor vehicle mfrs.ass of the united states state farm mut.auto.ins,d internal quotation marks omitted,showing that prior policies and standards are being deliberately changed,not casually ignored,greater boston television fcc,leventhal,see also fcc fox television stations,d t he requirement that an agency provide reasoned explanation for its action would ordinarily demand that it display awareness that it is changing position.petitioners believe that the commission has neither reasonably disavowed the logic of the inside wiring order nor explained how that logic could fail to produce the same outcome on the record now presented.finding the commission extensive discussion of its change in approach more than equal to our forgiving standard of review,we disagree.
petitioners argument begins with a substantial of the inside wiring order.taking a few preferred sentences out of context,they argue that the commission committed itself to an express logic where cable already faces increasingly effective competition,it is inappropriate to interfere with exclusivity contracts.and since competition continued to increase between and,petitioners argue,the commission own logic bars it from acting differently now.
to be sure,as petitioners emphasize,the inside wiring order does conclude with the following two sentences we note that competition in the mdu market is improving,even with the existence of exclusive contracts.accordingly,we decline to intervene.at.but context matters,and here it makes clear that petitioners have confused a mere contributing factor with a sufficient condition.the uncited portions of that same paragraph note that commenters identified both and aspects of exclusive contracts,and that the commission was unable to state,based on the record,that exclusive contracts were predominantly.id.emphasis added.indeed,reading the four short paragraphs the commission devoted to the issue in their entirety,we think it quite clear that the commission based its unwillingness to intervene in primarily on the absence of a sufficient record.see id.at,w e do not find a sufficient basis in this record to ban or cap the term of exclusive contracts.id.at,the record does not indicate the extent to which exclusive contracts have been utilized id.at,t he current record is insufficient to justify caps of any length id.at,t he record does not support a prohibition on exclusive contracts.in short,the commission acknowledged in its inside wiring order that exclusivity contracts could either foster competition over entire buildings or foil competition over individual units,and that decision indicates only that the record then available was insufficient to resolve this question.contrary to petitioners claim,nothing about this logic commits the commission to abstaining from regulation whenever competition is could easily imagine that,however much competition improved despite exclusivity agreements,it would have improved more without them.
conversely,petitioners give the commission far too little credit for its extensive analysis of this issue in the order before us today.rather than merely observing,as it did in,that exclusivity agreements could theoretically have both and effects,in the commission extensively analyzed the question,see order,at,and concluded that the harms significantly outweigh the benefits in ways they did not at the time of the commission inside wiring order.id.at.the commission found that exclusivity agreements would likely raise prices,limit access to certain programming,and delay deployment of fiber optic and broadband technologies.id.at.it placed particular emphasis on triple play where phone or cable companies use modern wiring to provide video,telephone,and internet service as a bundled package.such packages are uniquely relevant,as they represent a highly effective form of competition between large,preexisting companies that has expanded since the inside wiring order.id.at.the commission found that triple play competition between phone and cable providers lowers prices,spurs deployment of advanced technology,and facilitates efficiency and simplicity in the market.id.if the incumbent has exclusive rights to video service,however,then competitors will be unable to offer a bundle,thus inhibiting new entry and denying consumers the competitive and efficiency benefits of triple play.id.at.these harms to consumers are greater than they were several years ago,the commission found,because in new entry by phone companies had not yet begun on a large scale,the recent increase in fiber construction had not yet materialized,and the popularity of triple play was unproven.id.at.
moreover,the commission fully considered contrary comments.specifically,it acknowledged the view that exclusivity contracts might spur investment by allowing cable operators some certainty that they could recoup their sunk costs,or might enable mdu residents to pool their bargaining power and thus extract cable company concessions.id.at.in the end,however,the commission meticulously rejected these arguments as unpersuasive,finding that the interests of mdu owners would not always align with those of the residents,that agreements may have been signed before competition even existed,and that,
