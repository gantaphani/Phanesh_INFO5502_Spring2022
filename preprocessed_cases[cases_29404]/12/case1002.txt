background 
on november,illinois bell telephone company referred to by both parties as at t requested the commission to reclassify certain residential local services as competitive.the details of the underlying request are not necessary to understand the question before this court,as the question here is purely procedural and does not require a discussion on the merits.it is sufficient to note the commission had jurisdiction over the matter pursuant to the public utilities act ilcs west.on august,after discovery and hearings,the commission issued an order partially approving at t request original order.that document was dated august and served on the parties the following day.that document was titled post exceptions proposed order.
on september,the commission served a second document on the parties.the second document was also dated august.both parties acknowledge that the sole difference between the original order and the september document is that the words post exceptions proposed were removed from the title so that the title of the second document contained only the word order.
the commission docket describes both documents.it describes the original order as a final order.the docket describes the september document as a corrected final order.the docket entry for both documents is dated august.the docket lists no other order between august and september.
pursuant to the public utilities act ilcs a west all parties had the opportunity to file an application for rehearing within days of the commission order.
the parties dispute whether the due date for filing was october,days from the service of the commission original order dated august,or october,days from the commission corrected order served september 
the parties also dispute whether the attorney general application for rehearing was timely filed on october.various commission documents indicate different filing dates for the attorney general application.the commission docket entry lists a filed date of october.the administrative law judge recommendation of october,states the attorney general application as filed on october.the order denying the attorney general application for rehearing indicates an october filing.
although the parties dispute the actual filing date,both parties acknowledge the date and times at which they each transmitted their applications to the commission.at t,using the commission system,transmitted its application at on september.the attorney general office transmitted its application for rehearing,at issue in this case,at on october.
the commission accepted and considered both the attorney general and at t applications for rehearing and denied them both on october.on october,at t submitted a petition for review with the appellate court,fourth district,and a second petition for review with that same court on october.the fourth district consolidated those appeals.on october the attorney general submitted its own petition for review with the appellate court,first district.at t moved to transfer the attorney general appeal to the fourth district or,in the alternative,to dismiss the attorney general appeal based on its untimely filing of its application for rehearing.the cause was transferred to the fourth district,which dismissed at t appeals as premature.the fourth district also dismissed the attorney general appeal for lack of jurisdiction,because it determined that the attorney general application for rehearing was not timely filed.the attorney general then sought leave to appeal in this court.
effect of the commission september,order 
we first consider the attorney general argument that its application was timely because the order served on september constituted an amended order that reset the time period for filing a petition for rehearing.
the attorney general contends that the public utilities act applies to any and all alterations in a commission order.the attorney general cites section,which authorizes the commission to rescind,alter or amend any order or decision made by it.ilcs west.the act provides that any alteration or amendment shall have the same effect as the commission original order.we review questions of statutory interpretation de novo.wisniewski kownacki.
although the issue is one of first impression for this court,the united states supreme court has considered this precise issue in federal trade comm regulator.
in a dispute arose over whether the appellant timely filed a petition for writ of certiorari.the appellant claimed,as in this case,that a second order issued two months after the first renewed the time period from which the parties could petition for certiorari.the appellate court had made no substantive change to the original order and,instead,made a change to the title of the document.the first document was labeled decree,while the second document was labeled final decree.
in answering this question,the supreme court recognized that the mere fact that a judgment previously entered has been reentered or revised in an immaterial way does not toll the time within which review must be sought,at.at.at.only when the lower court changes matters of substance,or resolves a genuine ambiguity,in a judgment previously rendered should the period begin to run anew,at.at.at.the court also noted the test is a practical one.the question is whether the lower court has disturbed or revised legal rights and obligations which,by its prior judgment,had been plainly and properly settled with finality,at.at.at.although does not bind this court,we find its reasoning sound and persuasive.
the factual similarity between and the present case is apparent.the only change to the commission august order was removal of three words from the document title.rather than read order the commission original order read post exceptions proposed order.as the court concluded in,the question of whether the time was to be enlarged can not turn on the adjective which the court below chose to use in the caption of its second judgment,when the first judgment was for all purposes final,at.at.at.
here,the record and argument before us indicate that the august order was for all purposes final.the september document did not disturb or revise either party legal rights and obligations that had been plainly and properly settled with finality.the parties understood the august order to be a final order.indeed,at oral argument,counsel for the attorney general acknowledged that the attorney general had been proceeding with the original order in mind,and suggested that an application for rehearing based on either order would be proper.
rather than affect the parties legal rights,the alteration here was de minimus,as removing three words from the document heading merely corrected a trivial,clerical error.as such,the change did not serve to extend the parties opportunity to file an application for rehearing.
we further conclude that section does not change this analysis.section is a formal procedure the commission must follow if it intends to rescind,alter or amend one of its decisions.however,the record indicates that the commission did not rely on section when it served the september document.although served on september,the second document was also dated august.the commission shows that the two orders were both entered on august.the docket lists the first as a final order,and the second as a corrected final order.the docket likewise contains no entry of an order on either september or.
further,nothing indicates the commission intended to rely on its statutory authority to rescind or amend its decision.section requires that the commission notify the public utility,and provide the utility an opportunity to be heard,if it decides to rescind or amend an order.here,the commission did not serve notice,nor did it provide an opportunity to be heard.
the legislature,in enacting section,intended to provide for notice and opportunity to the parties in the event that the commission decided to reconsider its decision.the procedure ensures that any amendment to a commission decision will not be undertaken without serious consideration.it is equally evident that the legislature did not intend to require notice,and an opportunity to be heard,for mere clerical mistakes that do not materially affect the decision.
section can not be read to apply to nonsubstantive corrections to the commission orders.therefore,we hold that the commission september order did not extend the time in which the attorney general could file its application for rehearing.
ii.whether outside business hours results in an untimely application 
we next turn to whether the attorney general electronic transmission of an application for rehearing,transmitted at on the last day of filing,was timely filed,and therefore whether the appellate court has jurisdiction over the attorney general appeal.the timeliness of the attorney general application for rehearing turns on whether the commission rules require filing during business hours.
administrative rules and regulations have the force and effect of law,and must be construed under the same standards which govern the construction of statutes.union electric department of revenue.the interpretation of a statute is a question of law,which we review de novo.kownacki,at.thus,de novo review is also required here.
in interpreting an agency regulation,our primary objective is to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the agency,in this case,the commission.md electrical contractors,abrams.the surest and most reliable indicator of intent is the language of the regulation itself.md electrical,at.in determining the plain meaning,we consider the regulation in its entirety,keeping in mind the subject it addresses and the apparent intent of the commission in enacting it.md electrical,at.where the language of the regulation is clear and unambiguous,we must apply it as written,without resort to extrinsic aids of statutory construction.md electrical,at.
the regulation at issue states that t he filing of an electronic document is effective upon acceptance of the complete document and,if applicable,any required original paper verification or affidavit pages by the chief clerk of the commission.b added at.reg,eff.october.the attorney general argues that the commission regulation does not require filing during business hours.at t contends that the regulation requires physical acceptance of any electronic filing.at t further reasons that there can be no acceptance if the chief clerk or his personnel are not present in the building.at t therefore concludes that electronic documents must be filed during business hours when commission personnel are present.
looking first to the plain and ordinary meaning of the language,we note that acceptance means favorable reception,or the act of accepting.webster third new international dictionary.accept means to receive with assent.webster third new international dictionary.these definitions suggest that acceptance requires something more than mere transmittal,but the word acceptance alone does not provide guidance as to how a document may be accepted.
however,the word acceptance does not stand alone.the regulation,read in its entirety,establishes that electronic documents may be accepted by the chief clerk of the commission.neither party argues that chief clerk,as used in this regulation,means only the chief clerk.at t acknowledges that the regulation extends at least to the chief clerk personnel,who may also accept.this position reflects the reality of modern administrative agencies that department heads must necessarily delegate certain authority and responsibility in order for the agency to function properly.both parties agree that the intent of the regulation was not to require the chief clerk to personally accept every.
because chief clerk can not be read literally,the language of the statute gives rise to an ambiguity as to who,or what,may accept electronic filings.an ambiguity exists where the regulation is capable of more than one reasonable interpretation.see general motors state of illinois motor vehicle review board.at t reasonably interprets chief clerk to mean the chief clerk or a member of his staff.however,interpreting chief clerk to refer to the office of the chief clerk,and not to any particular person,an interpretation more in line with that of the attorney general,is also reasonable.implementing an system,like delegating responsibility to the chief clerk staff members,serves the same purpose of promoting efficiency,and reducing the burden on the commission employees.under that interpretation,the commission system is authorized to accept filings from the various parties having business with the commission.we find the regulation ambiguous because on its face it contains no indication whether filing requires actual physical acceptance by a human being in the chief clerk office.
if the language of a particular regulation is ambiguous,we then look to the purpose and necessity of the regulation,the evils sought to be remedied and the goals to be achieved.alvarez pappas.in doing so,we view all provisions of an enactment as a whole.in this case we look to the commission formal rules for electronic filing,enacted on october,in their entirety.when there is still doubt as to a regulation meaning,we also properly consider extrinsic matters in order to determine legislative intent.land board of education of the city of chicago.
in its overview of electronic filing,the commission affirms its commitment to facilitating the filing,distributing,and accessing of documents electronically,subject to the commission rules of practice.added at.reg,eff.october.the commission allows all documents initiating a proceeding,or filed in a docketed proceeding,to be filed electronically.added at.reg,eff.october.the commission rules also provide for service by electronic means.added at.reg,eff.october.
the rest of the commission regulations reinforce this overall purpose of facilitating.for example,the commission system accepts a variety of document formats.although the commission encourages parties to submit documents in pdf format,it will accept both microsoft word and corel wordperfect documents,as well as ascii text.added at.reg,eff.october.the commission also accepts two spreadsheet formats.added at.reg,eff.october.
thus,while the commission rules do not require parties to file electronically,the rules reflect the commission intent to encourage,rather than restrict,the practice.the commission rules do contain restrictions on electronic filing.for example,only registered account holders may use the system,and only members of the service list for a docketed case may file documents electronically in that case.added at.reg,eff.october.however,these practices ultimately encourage electronic filing by instilling confidence in the security and efficiency of the system.in light of the regulations emphasis on facilitating,we can not say that the regulations themselves indicate an intent to restrict to business hours.
still,at t suggests that the disclaimer printed on the attorney general electronic receipt confirming the transmission of its application for rehearing reveals the intent of the commission to restrict filing to actual office hours because a person must physically review the filing.the disclaimer reads 
electronic file s are not officially filed with the illin
