the key issue in this appeal is whether the florida public service commission complied with the telecommunications act of and corresponding federal regulations when it approved substantial parts of the pricing plan for the lease of telecommunications equipment urged by bellsouth telecommunications.bellsouth and the florida commission appeal a declaratory judgment that invalidated part of the pricing plan approved by the florida commission.they argue that the district court erroneously held that the bellsouth telecommunications loop model failed to adhere to the telecommunications act and federal regulations because the pricing plan used multiple scenarios instead of the single most efficient,lowest cost network configuration to calculate the rate for the lease of wire loops.mci worldcom communications,and florida digital network,and argue that the district court erroneously approved the inflation factor used in the bellsouth model.florida digital network also argues that the district court erroneously approved the geographic deaveraging model adopted by the florida commission.
we conclude that the district court erred when it determined federal law forbids the use of multiple scenarios,and we remand this action to the district court to evaluate whether each scenario in the pricing model approved by the florida commission complies with federal law.we also conclude that the florida commission did not err when it approved the inflation factor and the geographic deaveraging model.we reverse and remand in part and affirm in part.
background 
to explain the background of this appeal,we address four matters.first,we describe the technology relevant to this appeal.second,we provide an overview of the regulatory scheme.third,we describe the pricing model adopted by the florida commission.fourth,we outline the procedural history of this appeal.
a.an overview of the relevant technology 
a local telephone network consists of several elements,and three of these components are central to this appeal.the first element of a local telecommunication network is its wire loops,also known as local loops.wire loops are the telephone wires that connect each residential customer to the network of the local carrier.loops are made of either copper or fiber optic wire,and the capabilities and cost of the loop are dependent on its type.although copper wire is less expensive than fiber optic wire for short loops,fiber optic is more for longer loops.some services such as digital subscriber line technology dsl,a type of internet service,can be offered only over copper wire,notwithstanding its potentially higher cost.
the second element of a local telecommunications network is its switches.local loops connect to switches,which are computers that route calls on the network.when the wire loop is fiber optic,the combination can be either integrated or universal.in an integrated digital loop carrier,the switch and wire loop operate as one unit because the wire loop is integrated directly into the switch.in a universal digital loop carrier,the local loop and the switch are independent.for universal digital loop carrier technology,the lessee of the loop may provide its own switch,but for integrated digital loop carrier technology,the lessee must use the combination of the lessor because it is to decouple the wire loop from the switch.
the third element of a local telecommunications network is its wire centers.wire centers are where the switches are located.wire centers act as a bridge between the wire loops and the central office of the carrier,which allows long distance calls to be placed.
b.the telecommunications act 
before the telecommunications act became law,most areas were served by a single local exchange carrier,now known as the incumbent local exchange carrier.see iowa utils,d.over the years,the incumbent local carrier constructed hardware networks to deliver residential and commercial telephone service to the area.id.because they were without competition and were often compensated based on how much they spent the method,incumbent local carriers had an incentive to construct networks that were inefficient.see rural telecom ass fcc.
the telecommunications act was enacted to uproot the monopolies that traditional methods had perpetuated.verizon commc ns fcc,d.the act preempted state laws that protected local monopolies,and it imposed on local carriers affirmative duties to facilitate market entry by new local carriers,known as competitive local exchange carriers.see,at.at.central to this appeal is the duty of an incumbent local carrier to provide access to its network to competitive local carriers.see.
the telecommunications act requires incumbent carriers to make available to potential competitors their unbundled network elements.id.c.the act encourages incumbent and competitive local carriers to negotiate access rates.id.c.in the event an agreement can not be reached,any party may petition the state telecommunications commission to arbitrate any open issues.id.b.once arbitration has been invoked,the state commission must adhere to federal law when it sets the rates.see id.e verizon cal.peevey,cir citing,at.at.
congress delegated to the federal communications commission the authority to promulgate regulations that govern the setting of rates.see d.the methodology the fcc selected is called the total element incremental cost method.the telric of an element is the cost over the long run of an element,taking as a given the incumbent lec provision of other elements.id.b.the telric must be measured based on the use of the most efficient telecommunications technology currently available and the lowest cost network configuration.id.b.the regulations also require rates state commissions shall establish different rates for elements in at least three defined geographic areas within the state to reflect geographic cost differences.id.f.congress delegated to each state commission the authority to approve the interconnection agreement,including the pricing of unbundled network elements.see e.
the telecommunications act also allowed incumbent local carriers to participate in the service market upon approval of the fcc.id.d.in a section proceeding,the fcc permits the incumbent local carrier to enter the market only after the carrier implements the competitive checklist,one item of which is n ondiscriminatory access to network elements in accordance with the requirements of sections c and d of this title.id.c b ii.section proceedings are streamlined the fcc must approve or deny the petition of the local carrier within days of receiving it.id.d.
c.the pricing model adopted by the florida commission 
this appeal arises from the pricing model approved by the florida commission that sets the rates for the use of the network elements of bellsouth.the pricing model adopted by the florida commission is largely based on the bellsouth telecommunications loop model.three aspects of the model adopted by the florida commission are relevant to this appeal.first,the bellsouth model employs three scenarios that model the different types of wire loops instead of a unitary network comprised of all three types of wire loops.second,the bellsouth model incorporates an inflation factor to account for its cost of capital.third,the model approved by the florida commission creates three tiers for geographic deaveraging.
the first aspect of the bellsouth model is its use of three scenarios to compute the telric of each unbundled network element.the first scenario is copper only all loops in this hypothetical network are required to be copper.bellsouth maintains that this scenario reflects the type of network that a competitive local carrier would require to provide dsl service.
the second scenario is.the scenario uses copper for wire loops up to feet and uses fiber optic for loops of longer lengths.in the scenario,all fiber optic combinations are universal rather than integrated.this technology allows the competitive local carrier to lease the loop but to supply its own switch,the loop stands alone.bellsouth maintains that this scenario reflects the type of network that a competitive local carrier would require if it sought to provide its own switches and wished to lease only the wire loops of the incumbent local carrier.
the third scenario is referred to as the combo scenario.the combo scenario uses only integrated digital loop carrier technology for its fiber optic combinations.the competitive local carrier must lease both the wire loop and the switch under this scenario.
for each scenario,the average cost per unit for the unbundled network element was calculated by dividing the total cost for the wire loops in the scenario by the total number of wire loops in the scenario.bellsouth thus treats its wire loops as three separate unbundled network elements copper,universal digital loop carrier,and integrated digital loop carrier.bellsouth charges the competitive local carrier based on which technology it requests.
the second aspect of the pricing model approved by the florida commission that is relevant to this appeal is the use of an inflation factor.when calculating the telric for each unbundled network element,the bellsouth model also adds an inflation factor,which bellsouth contends reflects inflation that will affect the cost of equipment that bellsouth will purchase over a period of several years.bellsouth maintains that the inflation factor is independent of the cost of capital factor that the bellsouth model also takes into account in its pricing model.
the third relevant aspect of the pricing method approved by the florida commission is its methodology for geographic deaveraging.the wire centers were divided into three zones in the following manner.first,the wire centers were divided into five groups such that the average rate in each zone is no more than higher or lower than the cost of providing that element.these five groups were then reduced to three by combining the two zones and combining the two zones.
d.the background of this appeal 
in december,several competitive local exchange carriers petitioned the florida commission to hold a hearing to establish rates for the unbundled network elements owned by bellsouth in florida.in october,the florida commission held the hearing,and bellsouth introduced the bellsouth telecommunications loop model.
the competitive local carriers objected to the bellsouth model on several grounds relevant to this appeal.their first objection was to the use of three scenarios instead of one to compute the telric of each unbundled element.according to the florida commission,mci advocated the use of a single scenario,the combo scenario.the second objection challenged the use of an inflation factor.mci argued that the use of the inflation factor amounted to double counting because the bellsouth model already accounted for inflation under its cost of capital factor.the third objection challenged the method used for geographic deaveraging.the bellsouth model proposed three zones based solely on geography.mci proposed the sprint approach,which constructed six rate zones in which the rate of each element in the zone was within of the average rate for that zone.
the florida commission concluded its proceedings on september.the florida commission determined that the approach of the bellsouth model was consistent with federal law.the florida commission also approved the inflation factor used in the bellsouth model.the florida commission rejected both the bellsouth and sprint approaches to geographic deaveraging and adopted its own methodology.the florida commission used a modification of the sprint approach to generate five groups with variance,but the florida commission then consolidated the two most expensive zones and the two least expensive zones to create three deaveraged geographic cost groups.the order stated that it reduced the number of groups to alleviate administrative burden.
mci filed suit against bellsouth and the florida commission in federal district court seeking declaratory and injunctive relief under section.see id.e.florida digital network was permitted to intervene.mci and florida digital network raised three arguments relevant to this appeal.first,mci and florida digital network argued that the bellsouth model violated federal law because the use of multiple scenarios to model the wire loops of the network failed to comply with telric.second,mci and florida digital network argued that the use of the inflation factor in the pricing plan violated federal law because it certain expenses.third,florida digital network argued that the method adopted by the florida commission to allocate geographic deaveraging zones was not supported by the record.
the district court concluded that the bellsouth model conflicted with federal law.the district court found that the approach of the bellsouth model was contrary to fcc regulations for two reasons.first,the bellsouth model failed to take as a given the incumbent lec provision of other elements,b,and instead focused on a particular loop type or combination to the exclusion of others.second,the model was based on scenarios where the particular unbundled network element occupies the entire network as opposed to what is likely to be requested and used.see id.a.
the district court affirmed other portions of the order of the florida commission.first,the district court upheld the use of the inflation factor by the bellsouth method.the district court concluded that the inflation factor neither resulted in double counting nor was contrary to federal regulations because it reflects the growth costs of the hypothetical network during the rate period,which is typically three to four years.second,the district court upheld the geographic deaveraging method adopted by the florida commission.the district court noted that federal law does not require the florida commission to use more than three zones and found that there was sufficient record evidence to support the florida commission approach.
ii.standard of review 
this court reviews de novo questions of law.commc ns of the states,bellsouth,cir.federal courts generally accord no deference to the state commission interpretations of federal law.commc ns of,bell,cir accord commc ns of,pac.bell,cir we also consider de novo whether the agreements comply with the act and its implementing regulations.internal quotations omitted mci telecomms.bell,cir.the factual findings of the state agency will not be disturbed unless they are arbitrary and capricious or not supported by substantial evidence.see sw.bell.waller creek commc ns,cir accord gte,morrison,cir.
iii.discussion 
this appeal presents three issues.first,bellsouth and the florida commission argue that the district court erroneously concluded that the use of multiple scenarios in the bellsouth model violates telric.second,mci argues that the district court erroneously approved of the use of the inflation factor in the bellsouth model.third,florida digital network argues that the district court erroneously approved the geographic deaveraging methodology adopted by the florida commission.we address each argument in turn.
a.the district court erroneously concluded that telric forbids multiple scenarios.
bellsouth and the florida commission argue that the district court erroneously concluded that the use of multiple scenarios in the bellsouth model conflicts with telric.bellsouth and the florida commission argue that the district court failed to credit fcc precedents,in section proceedings,that found the use of multiple scenarios compliant with telric.they alternatively argue that,even without deference to the fcc,the district court erroneously concluded that the bellsouth method violates telric.
our review of the multiple scenarios is divided in two parts.we begin by addressing the level of deference we afford to statements made by the fcc regarding telric in section proceedings.because we conclude section proceedings provide little or no guidance as to the requirements of telric,we then conduct our own review of whether telric prohibits the use of multiple scenarios.we explain why the use of multiple scenarios is not forbidden by telric so long as each scenario complies with telric.
section proceedings are not precedent for section proceedings.
section permits incumbent local carriers to enter the market upon approval of the fcc.d.the fcc may approve the application only if fourteen requirements are met.see id.c i xiv.one requirement is that the incumbent local carrier must offer n ondiscriminatory access to network elements in accordance with the requirements of sections c and d.id.c ii.the fcc must evaluate each of these requirements and render its decision within days of the filing of the petition.id.d.
bellsouth and the florida commission argue that this court must defer to decisions of the fcc that found the use of multiple scenarios was consistent with telric for purposes of the section c ii requirement.see,interlata servs.in.order,see also,interlata servs.in.order,interlata servs.in,order,hereinafter the order.further,bellsouth and the florida commission argue that the florida and tennessee order endorsed the very pricing scheme challenged in this appeal.these arguments fail for at least three reasons.
first,the section decisions cited by bellsouth and the florida commission are far from a clear endorsement of the use of multiple scenarios by the fcc.in the georgia and louisiana order,the fcc considered the application of bellsouth to enter the market in georgia and louisiana.see generally.the fcc discussed the multiple scenario approach of the bellsouth model and concluded that the parties opposing the application ha d not presented evidence sufficient to show that the louisiana commission erred in its decision or to overcome the current evidence bellsouth has presented as to why the use of multiple scenarios is appropriate.id.at.the fcc elaborated,w e have never held that an appropriate application of telric precludes such an approach.accordingly,we can not conclude that the louisiana commission committed any clear error in adopting it.id.this statement of the fcc is not an approval of the multiple scenarios approach the fcc stated instead that it had never disapproved of the use of multiple scenarios in a section proceeding.see id.
closely related is the second reason the arguments of bellsouth and the florida commission fail the standard of review applied by the fcc in a section proceeding is highly deferential to the state communications commission.see,order,at we defer to the analyses of the state commissions,and we therefore reject worldcom criticism of the multiple scenario approach.bellsouth has stressed the deferential standard of review applicable to section proceedings in its filings before the fcc the commission should place great weight on the state commissions determinations that bellsouth rates are.as the commission has explained,it does not engage in de novo review of rates in section proceedings.brief for bellsouth at,tenn,order,internal quotations and citations omitted.this court,in contrast,exercises de novo review of the decision of the state commission.see commc ns of the states,at accord bell,at holding that we accord no deference to the state commission interpretations of federal law bell,at a state utility commission interpretations of the act are reviewed de novo because the state commissions are not federal agencies to which deference is due.if this court were to defer to the fcc,which had,in turn,deferred to the state commission,it would render our de novo review of the state commission meaningless.
third,the fcc has itself disavowed the precedential value of its opinions in section proceedings.see,interlata servs.in.order.in the kansas and oklahoma order,the fcc explained that section proceedings are streamlined and should not be delayed by questions best resolved in other fora 
as the commission stated in the swbt texas order,despite the comprehensiveness of our local competition rules,there will inevitably be,in any section proceeding,new and unresolved interpretive disputes about the precise content of an incumbent lec obligations to its that our rules have not yet addressed and that do not involve per se violations of requirements of the act.the section process simply could not function as congress intended if we were generally required to resolve all such disputes as a precondition to granting a section application.congress designed section proceedings as highly specialized,proceedings for examining the performance of a particular carrier in a particular state at a particular time.such,narrowly focused adjudications are often inappropriate forums for the considered resolution of local competition questions of general applicability.second,such a requirement would undermine the congressional intent of section to give the bocs an incentive to open their local markets to competition.that incentive would largely vanish if a boc opponents could effectively doom any section application by raising a host of novel interpretive disputes in their comments and demanding that authorization be denied unless each one of those disputes is resolved in the boc favor.finally,simply as a matter of statutory construction,few of the substantive obligations contained in the local competition provisions of sections and are altogether they rely for their content on the commission rules.
id.footnotes omitted citing,interlata servs.in.order.that the fcc occasionally reaches the same conclusion in a section proceeding as it had in a section proceeding does not undermine this clear language.see,metro teleconnect,verizon.
we join our sister circuits and conclude that section proceedings provide,at most,persuasive guidance when evaluating an appeal under section.see,mcimetro access transmission,bellsouth,cir fcc.what matters instead is the text of the federal regulations regarding telric.we next conduct a de novo interpretation of whether the telric regulations allow the use of multiple scenarios.
telric permits the use of multiple scenarios,so long as each scenario complies with telric.
bellsouth and the florida commission argue that,even without deference to the section proceedings,this court should find that the pricing model adopted by the florida commission complies with telric,but mci and florida digital network argue,as the district court concluded,that the use of multiple scenarios violates telric.mci and florida digital network argue,alternatively,that,even if multiple scenarios are permissible under telric,the scenarios adopted by the florida commission violate telric.to resolve this controversy,we first consider whether telric permits the use of multiple scenarios,an issue of first impression for the federal courts.because we conclude that it does,we then review the standard each scenario must meet to comply with telric and remand the evaluation of each scenario,under that standard,to the district court.
a.the use of multiple scenarios is consistent with telric.
the telric value of an unbundled network element is the cost over the long run of the total quantity of the facilities and functions that are directly attributable to,or reasonably identifiable as incremental to,such element,calculated taking as a given the incumbent lec provision of other elements.b.this cost should be measured based on the use of the most efficient telecommunications technology currently available and the lowest cost network configuration,given the existing location of the incumbent lec wire centers.id.b.the economic cost per unit is then determined by dividing the telric for the network element by the sum of the total number of units of the element that the incumbent lec is likely to provide to requesting telecommunications carriers and the total number of units of the element that the incumbent lec is likely to use in offering its own services.id.a.
the telric methodology requires that the per unit cost of an unbundled network element be calculated by finding the total cost for the element in a hypothetical most efficient network and dividing by the number of units that will be put into use by the incumbent or a competitive local carrier.bellsouth and the florida commission argue that no single scenario for wire loops can be most efficient because different services require different types of wire loops.to support this position,bellsouth and the florida commission argue that a competitive local carri
