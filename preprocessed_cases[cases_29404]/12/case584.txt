at t wireless services,at t appeals from the district court grant of summary judgment affirming the agreement arbitrated by the state of washington utilities and transportation commission the commission pursuant to the telecommunications act of act.at t contests the agreement provision providing the reciprocal compensation rate for west communications,traffic transported and terminated on at t network.at t argues that it should be compensated at the higher tandem rate and not the lower rate as determined in arbitration.the district court affirmed the commission arbitrated agreement.we hold that the commission erred when it concluded that at t should be compensated at the rate for west traffic terminating on at t network and,therefore,we reverse.
background 
the telecommunications act is designed to foster competition in local and long distance telephone markets by neutralizing the competitive advantage inherent in incumbent carriers ownership of the physical networks required to supply telecommunication services.sections and of the act require incumbent local exchange carriers ilecs to allow commercial mobile radio service providers cmrs providers to interconnect with their existing networks in return for fair compensation.the act directs the ilecs and cmrs providers to negotiate in good faith to reach an interconnection agreement.c,a.if an ilec and a cmrs provider are unable to agree,the act provides for the state public utilities commission to conduct binding arbitration.b.after the state commission approves an arbitrated agreement,any party to the agreement may bring an action in district court to determine whether the agreement meets the requirements of the act.e.
west is an ilec authorized to provide telecommunication services in washington state.at t is a cmrs provider authorized to provide wireless telecommunication services in washington state.in october,at t requested interconnection negotiations with west pursuant to a,but the ensuing negotiations failed to provide an interconnection agreement.after at t filed a timely petition to have the commission arbitrate an interconnection agreement pursuant to b,the commission arbitrator conducted a hearing and filed a report and decision in july.
the arbitrator used west network architecture as the standard for setting the appropriate reciprocal compensation rate,he imposed a reciprocal compensation rate for at t calls terminated on west network depending on whether a tandem or switch is involved,and he imposed the rate on all west calls terminated on at t network.specifically,the arbitrator set the following termination rates and an average transportation rate an termination rate of per minute of use a tandem switching termination rate of per minute of use and an average transportation rate of per minute of use.the arbitrator determined that when local traffic from an at t mobile telephone travels through a west tandem switch and a west switch before terminating on a west telephone,at t must pay west the tandem rate of,which is the termination rate of per minute of use,plus the tandem switching termination rate of per minute of use,plus the average transportation rate of per minute of use.when local traffic from an at t mobile telephone only travels through a west switch before terminating on a west telephone,at t must pay west the termination rate of per minute of use.however,when local traffic from a west telephone travels through an at t mobile switching center msc before terminating on an at t mobile telephone,west must pay at t the termination rate of per minute of use.
the commission instructed the parties to submit an interconnection agreement in accordance with the arbitrator decision.west filed a timely petition for reconsideration and,in august,the arbitrator denied west petition for reconsideration.
the commission held an open public meeting in september to review the arbitrator report and decision and the subsequent proceedings.the commission adopted the arbitrator report and decision,denied both parties requests for modification,and approved the interconnection agreement with some minor changes.
west sought review of the commission decision in the district court pursuant to e,and at t filed an answer,counterclaim,and.the parties then filed for summary judgment.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the commission on west and at t claims and dismissed one of west claims without prejudice.west appealed and at t filed a.west subsequently dismissed its appeal.only at t remains before this court.in this appeal,at t argues that it should be compensated at the tandem rate and not the rate for terminating west traffic.
ii.jurisdiction 
the commission acquired jurisdiction under b to arbitrate the interconnection agreement between west and at t.the district court reviewed the commission decision under e and.
the district court entered a final judgment granting summary judgment to the commission on all of west and at t claims.at t filed a timely notice of appeal pursuant to fed.a,and,therefore,this court has jurisdiction pursuant to.
iii.standard of review 
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment.west communications mfs intelenet,cir,cert.denied,d.we review de novo whether the arbitrated agreements are in compliance with the act and the implementing regulations,and we review all other issues under an arbitrary and capricious standard.see also mci telecomm.west communications,cir.reviewing de novo compliance with the act and regulations and all other issues under an arbitrary and capricious standard,cert.denied,d.
iv.discussion 
at t argues that the district court erred in affirming the commission reciprocal compensation rate for west traffic transported and terminated on at t network.in particular,at t argues that west should compensate it at the tandem rate and not the termination rate because its mscs serve a comparable geographic area to the area served by west tandem switches.in support of its argument,at t relies on the regulations promulgated by the federal communications commission fcc pursuant to the act and on the fcc first report and order,both of which interpret the act reciprocal compensation requirements.
west and the commission argue that the arbitrator correctly determined that west should compensate at t at the termination rate for transporting and terminating west traffic because at t mscs perform switching functions.
a.the telecommunications act of 
the basic principles for setting the reciprocal compensation rate are laid out in the statute itself.the act requires the parties to an interconnection agreement to pay each other reciprocal compensation.each carrier must pay the other for transporting and terminating calls that originate on their network.b,d a.the act provides,in relevant part 
a state commission shall not consider the terms and conditions for reciprocal compensation to be just and reasonable unless 
i such terms and conditions provide for the mutual and reciprocal recovery by each carrier of costs associated with the transport and termination on each carrier network facilities of calls that originate on the network facilities of the other carrier and 
ii such terms and conditions determine such costs on the basis of a reasonable approximation of the additional costs of terminating such calls.
d a.therefore,the reciprocal compensation rate must be based on the carrier costs incurred transporting and terminating the call and on a reasonable approximation of the additional costs incurred terminating calls originating on the other carrier network.id.
in this case,the arbitrator imposed a reciprocal compensation rate for at t calls terminated on west network depending on whether a tandem or switch is involved and he imposed the rate on all west calls terminated on at t network.the arbitrator reasoned that tandem switching costs more than switching because tandem switching involves two switching functions and switching involves one switching function.the arbitrator concluded that at t should pay west for terminating at t traffic depending upon whether at t hands off its traffic at west or tandem switch.then,the arbit
