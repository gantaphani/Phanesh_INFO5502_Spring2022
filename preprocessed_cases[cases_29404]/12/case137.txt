we are asked to decide whether plaintiffs have stated a cause of action against their service provider and its credit card company for allegedly transmitting and using certain information contained in plaintiffs bill for purposes of collecting credit card debt.plaintiffs edward and eileen conboy allege that defendant at t at t improperly disseminated proprietary information about them to defendant at t universal card services ucs to help ucs collect credit card debt.plaintiffs claim that,in disseminating this information,at t violated section of the telecommunications act of telecommunications act or act,stat.two and by the federal communications commission fcc under the act,and the fair debt collection practices act,et.plaintiffs also claim that,in using the disseminated information,ucs violated section of new york general business law and new york common law prohibiting intentional infliction of emotional distress.
in a thoughtful and comprehensive opinion,the united states district court for the southern district of new york robert ward,judge dismissed plaintiffs entire amended complaint pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.see conboy.at t,d.it held that plaintiffs failed to allege recoverable damages under the telecommunications act had no private right of action to seek monetary relief for alleged violations of and were not entitled to injunctive relief under the telecommunications act were not consumers for purposes of their claim under the fair debt collection practices act failed to allege deceptive conduct to support their claim under new york general business law and failed to allege extreme and outrageous conduct to support their common law claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress.the district court also declined to grant plaintiffs request to file a second amended complaint containing a claim of conspiracy to violate the telecommunications act.on appeal,plaintiffs challenge each of these holdings.for the reasons stated below,we affirm.
background 
because this is an appeal from a motion to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b,we review the district court decision de novo,taking all factual allegations in the amended complaint as true and construing all reasonable inferences in favor of plaintiffs.see conley gibson,d lee bankers trust,cir.
this case arises out of a claim that at t disseminated,and continues to disseminate,proprietary information about its customers to ucs and other unidentified companies in order to help them collect credit card debt.prior to this suit,at t served as plaintiffs telephone carrier.during this time,at t had access to information contained in plaintiffs telephone bill,such as their names,unlisted phone number,billing address,and the details of their calls.plaintiffs never authorized the release of this information to ucs or to anyone else,and even paid a monthly fee for service,the purpose of which was to prevent the release of their names,address,and telephone number to any directory or anyone who directed inquiries to directory assistance.
plaintiffs adult,maria conboy,held a mastercard issued by ucs when ucs was a subsidiary of at plaintiffs were neither the guarantors of their credit card,nor otherwise obligated to pay her debt to ucs.plaintiffs also did not agree to be contacted by ucs regarding their account,and maria conboy never provided ucs with their names,address,or telephone number.
from may to june,representatives of ucs telephoned plaintiffs at their unlisted home telephone number between thirty and fifty times seeking information about maria conboy whereabouts.the telephone calls were made repeatedly,and some were made at unusual hours.plaintiffs informed the ucs representatives that maria conboy did not reside with them and requested that the telephone calls cease.nonetheless,the phone calls continued.during one call,a representative revealed that he knew plaintiffs unlisted personal information and the details of their telephone bill.plaintiffs surmised that at t had provided ucs with this information to help ucs collect credit card debt.
in may,plaintiffs filed an amended complaint against at t and ucs.they claimed that,by disseminating information contained in their bill,at t violated section c of the telecommunications act two fcc c iii and c the fair debt collection practices act fdcpa section of new york general business law and new york common law prohibiting intentional infliction of emotional distress.they also contended that ucs committed the fourth and fifth violations concerning new york general business law and intentional infliction of emotional distress,by calling their residence at all hours in an attempt to collect credit card debt.
the district court dismissed the entire amended complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.see conboy,d at.with respect to the claims against at t,the district court held that plaintiffs failed to allege recoverable monetary damages under sections and of the communications act of communications act,et,which govern private rights of action against common carriers under the telecommunications act had no explicit or implied right of action to seek monetary damages for alleged violations of and could not seek injunctive relief under the circumstances of this case and failed to qualify as consumers for purposes of their claim under the fdcpa.having dismissed these federal claims,the district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiffs claims against at t.the district court also dismissed both claims against ucs on the ground that ucs alleged conduct of calling plaintiffs in an attempt to collect credit card debt was neither deceptive,as defined by new york general business law a,nor extreme and outrageous,as required to state a common law claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress.the district court also declined to grant plaintiffs motion to amend their complaint for a second time to include a claim against at t and ucs for conspiracy to violate the telecommunications act.
on appeal,plaintiffs challenge each of these holdings.we discuss each issue in turn.
ii.discussion 
damages under sections and of the communications act for violations of section c of the telecommunications act 
plaintiffs first argument is that at t disseminated their customer proprietary network information cpni in violation of section c of the telecommunications act and that they can recover damages as a result under sections and of the communications act.as an initial matter,we need not decide which types of information allegedly disseminated by at t constitutes cpni because,even if we assume arguendo that at t disseminated plaintiffs cpni in violation of section c,we agree with the district court that plaintiffs failed to allege recoverable damages under sections and.
the district court provided three reasons for why plaintiffs failed to allege recoverable damages.see conboy,d at.first,plaintiffs monthly telephone bill clearly indicated that their payments for service had gone to their carrier bell atlantic,not defendant at see id.at.the telephone bill attached to plaintiffs amended complaint was divided into two for bell atlantic charges and the other for at t charges.plaintiffs monthly payment of for service fell on the bell atlantic section of the bill.accordingly,plaintiffs could not seek to recover these payments from at 
second,plaintiffs monthly payments to at t for service did not include an explicit or implicit payment for the privacy protections of the telecommunications act.see id.as the district court explained,there is no monetary value attached to at t compliance with the telecommunications act.id.by paying their at t bill monthly,plaintiffs got what they paid for,namely,long distance service.id.these payments therefore could not serve as a basis for damages.
third and finally,damages are not presumed to arise from violations of section.see id.at.the district court explained that sections and of the communications act are based on provisions of the interstate commerce act ica,and that courts have consistently held that the ica does not permit recovery of presumed damages.accordingly,in the district court view,such damages are not available in the analogous provisions of the communications act.see id.
on appeal,plaintiffs challenge all three bases for the district court holding.even though plaintiffs do not challenge the finding that they had paid bell atlantic,not at t,for service,they argue that they lost the value of this service because of at t violation of section c.
moreover,plaintiffs argue that their monthly payments to at t for service contained an implicit payment for at t compliance with the telecommunications act,and that disclosure of plaintiffs private information deprived them of the full value of these payments.
finally,plaintiffs contend that,even if they failed to allege specific economic damages,sections and permit recovery of presumed damages for emotional distress and mental anguish arising from violations of section.according to plaintiffs,congress passed section c of the telecommunications act in to protect consumer privacy,and presumed dignitary damages are traditional remedies for privacy violations.plaintiffs argue that congress therefore implicitly expanded the scope of sections and to include such damages when it passed section c.
we disagree with all three of plaintiffs arguments.first,plaintiffs can not use their payment to bell atlantic for service as the basis for their claim for damages against at t,because these payments represent the value of bell atlantic at t the terms of the service agreement.plaintiffs have not alleged that at t had an obligation to provide plaintiffs with service,nor have they alleged that at t somehow had led bell atlantic to disclose plaintiffs information in violation of the service agreement.accordingly,plaintiffs can not seek recovery of their payments for service in the case at hand.
second,as the district court correctly noted,plaintiffs did not make monthly payments to at t for compliance with the telecommunications act rather,they paid at t for telephone service,which they received.at t alleged failure to comply with the telecommunications act did not deprive them of the value of this service.
moreover,we agree with the district court that at t must comply with the telecommunications act not because it receives monthly payments from its customers,but because it is a common carrier governed by that statute.see conboy,d at.indeed,even if plaintiffs had failed to pay their regular monthly telephone bills,at t would still have had an obligation to comply with the provisions of the act.accordingly,it can not be argued that plaintiffs monthly payments were,in part,consideration paid to at t for compliance with section.
third and finally,we agree with the district court that plaintiffs can not recover presumed damages for emotional distress and mental anguish arising from violations of the act.as a preliminary matter,it is clear to us that plaintiffs explicitly abandoned any claim for emotional distress damages.after at t filed its reply brief in support of its motion to dismiss,plaintiffs filed a surreply letter stating that they have not alleged emotional distress nor similar damages for violation of the telecommunications act.see letter to robert ward from daniel hughes at,emphasis in original.this statement constitutes an express and binding abandonment of plaintiffs claim for such damages.bellmore mobil oil,cir holding that a plaintiff waived his right to a jury trial where he disclaimed this right in a memorandum of law provided to the trial court.
even if we assume arguendo that plaintiffs did not abandon their claim for presumed damages,we hold that such damages are nonetheless unrecoverable.as noted by the district court,sections and of the communications act were expressly modeled on the enforcement provisions of the ica.see,at sections and of the communications act are the present law in sections and of the interstate commerce act.not surprisingly,therefore,we have held that decisions construing the ica are persuasive in establishing the meaning of the communications act,see american.united artists payphone,aff,cir,and the supreme court has held that the ica does not authorize the recovery of presumed damages,see,icc united states ex rel.campbell.keogh chicago ry.see also overbrook farmers union coop.ass missouri pac,cir explaining that a number of supreme court decisions limit carrier liability under section of the ica to actual damages ajayem lumber penn cent.transp,cir explaining that recovery under the ica is limited to damages actually suffered.based on these authoritative interpretations of the ica,the fcc has concluded that the communications act also does not permit the recovery of presumed damages.see in re communications satellite,at i t is beyond doubt that under both title ii of the communications act and its predecessor,the interstate commerce act ica,damages are not presumed to flow from violations of the acts.accordingly,a private party seeking relief under sections and of the communications act must allege and prove specific damages flowing from violations of the act,and can not recover presumed damages.id,at 
when congress enacted section in,it provided no evidence that it intended to expand the scope of recoverable damages under sections and.it neither amended the language of section or,nor added language in section suggesting that presumed damages would now be available under the communications act.it is unlikely,therefore,that congress intended to change the scope of damages typically recoverable under the communications act.see generally south dakota yankton sioux tribe,d w e assume that congress is aware of existing law when it passes legislation.citation omitted.this view is supported by the existence of other provisions of the communications act that expressly provide for a remedy.see,e c i ii providing for the recovery of presumed,or statutory,damages from carriers who divulge the contents or substance of communications in violation of a.congress,therefore,clearly knew how to permit the recovery of presumed damages for a violation of the telecommunications act if it had intended to so for section,it would have done so expressly.
moreover,as a general matter,federal law permits the recovery of presumed damages only in limited circumstances.as the supreme court has explained,presumed damages are generally available only where the offense,by its very nature,is virtually certain to cause mental and emotional distress,so there arguably is little reason to require proof of this kind of injury.carey piphus,d 
in the case at bar,it is not reasonable to assume that every violation of section,no matter what the circumstances or how minor,inherently is likely to cause mental and emotional distress.id.at.many customers will not notice when their personal information is disseminated in violation of section.moreover,those who learn of a violation may not even care.violations of section,therefore,are not virtually certain to cause some type of serious injury,id.at,making presumed damages an inappropriate remedy for such violations.accordingly,the district court properly denied plaintiffs claim for such damages.
private right of action for damages under and 
plaintiffs assert next that at t violated two fcc regulations issued under the telecommunications act c iii and c and that they can recover monetary damages as a result.the district court rejected this argument on the ground that the telecommunications act neither provides for an explicit nor implicit private right of action for a violation of these regulations.see conboy,d at.
we agree.the question of the existence of a statutory cause of action is,of course,one of statutory construction.touche ross redington,d.in this case,the text of the telecommunications act contains no language that explicitly provides a private right of action for damages for violations of the two fcc regulations at issue here.section b of the communications act permits private parties to enforce fcc orders,but it does not provide authority for the recovery of damages 
moreover,no private right of action for money damages can be implied.in cort ash,d,the supreme court established a test to determine whether a federal statute creates an implied right of action whether the statute was enacted to benefit a special class whether the drafters intended to create a private right of action whether a private right of action would be consistent with the purposes of the statute and whether the cause of action is one not traditionally relegated to the states.id.at.the court thereafter instructed that the second the critical inquiry,see touche ross,at.see also mcclellan cablevision of,cir explaining that the other factors are treated as proxies for congressional intent,and that the burden of demonstrating congressional intent rests with the plaintiff,see suter artist,d see also new york city envtl.justice alliance giuliani,cir the person seeking a private remedy bears the burden of demonstrating that congress intended to make one available.
plaintiffs failed to meet their burden here.as the district court correctly noted,
the fcc is primarily responsible for the interpretation and implementation of the telecommunications act and fcc regulations.these broad powers granted to the fcc to enforce the act would be inconsistent with a private right of action because p rivate litigation tends to transfer regulatory interpretation and discretion from the agency to the courts.
conboy,d at alteration in original citations omitted quoting caceres agency,trans world airways,cir.
indeed,a private right of action would place the fcc interpretative function squarely in the hands of private parties and some federal district judges,instead of in the hands of the commission the result would be to deprive the fcc of necessary flexibility and authority in creating,interpreting,and modifying communications policy.new england.public utils.comm n,cir breyer.it is highly unlikely,therefore,that congress intended to create a private right of action for violations of fcc regulations.such a right would threaten the sound development of a coherent nationwide communications central objective of the communications act.id.at.
the text of the telecommunications act also suggests that congress did not intend to provide a private right of action.it is a principle of statutory construction that when legislation expressly provides a particular remedy or remedies,courts should not expand the coverage of the statute to subsume other remedies.national passenger national ass of passengers,d.here,sections and of the communications act grant private parties,in circumstances other than the one presented here,an express right of action against common carriers that improperly disseminate their cpni.it is unlikely,therefore,that congress intended to provide parties with another,merely implied right of action against common carriers that violate the two fcc regulations at issue here,which seek to prevent similar conduct.see transamerica mortgage advisors,lewis,d in view of these express provisions for enforcing the duties imposed,it is highly improbable that congress absentmindedly forgot to mention an intended private action.quotation marks omitted.
this conclusion is bolstered by the existence of other provisions in the telecommunications act that explicitly provide for a private right of action for a violation of fcc regulations.for example,section b of the act requires the fcc to implement regulations prohibiting any person from making a call with an automatic telephone dialing system or an artificial prerecorded voice to,inter alia,an emergency telephone line such as or a patient room in a hospital.see b,supp.if a person violates these regulations,a private party is expressly authorized under section b to bring suit in state court.see id.b.another c contains similar language.under section c,the fcc must prescribe regulations to protect consumers from unwanted telephone solicitations.section c expressly permits any person who has received more than one telephone call within any period in violation of these regulations to bring a private action in state court.id.c.obviously,then,as the supreme court has observed,when congress wished to provide a private damage remedy,it knew how to do so and did so expressly.touche ross,at.the absence of any comparable language with respect to the statutory underpinnings of and indicates that congress did not intend to create a private right of action with respect to these regulations.accordingly,the second strongly against implying a private right of action.
the remaining factors do not change this result.as the third circuit has explained,the purpose of the telecommunications act is not to benefit individual plaintiffs but to protect the public interest in communications.lechtner brownyard,cir quoting radio,fcc.airways,hope,cir finding that the federal aviation act was designed to benefit the general public and not any particular class.it can not be said,therefore,that plaintiffs are members of a class for whose especial benefit the statute was enacted.cort,at.the first cort the statute was enacted to benefit a special class of which plaintiffs are weighs against implying a private right of action.
inasmuch as the first two cort factors indicate clearly that congress did not intend to create a private right of action,we need not consider the remaining factors because,alone or together,they can not constitute sufficient evidence of congressional intent.see health care plan,aetna life ins,cir see also touche ross,at.brennan,concurring t he third and fourth cort factors can not by themselves be a basis for implying a right of action.accordingly,no private right of action under and can be implied,and the district court properly dismissed these claims.
private injunctive relief under the telecommunications act 
the next issue is whether plaintiffs can seek injunctive relief for the alleged violations of section and and.the district court denied this relief on the ground that the telecommunications act does not authorize private injunctive relief under the circumstances of this case.on appeal,plaintiffs challenge this conclusion,arguing that the district court had the right to grant this requested relief under section b of the communications act and the federal courts inherent equitable powers.we find both of plaintiffs arguments unconvincing.
first,plaintiffs abandoned any claim for injunctive relief under section b,which allows the fcc and private parties to enforce fcc orders by seeking injunctive relief in a district court,see ante note.in their papers in opposition to at t motion to dismiss,plaintiffs expressly stated that,for purposes of their claim for injunctive relief,they were asserting their rights to bring causes of actions for violations of the act under section,not section b.plaintiff opposition to defendant at t corporation motion to dismiss first amended class action complaint at filed,emphasis in original.plaintiffs explained that they were relying on section,rather than section b,because section did not limit the court jurisdiction to grant injunctive relief and its inherent equitable power to issue injunctions.id.at.plaintiffs therefore have abandoned any possible claim under section b for injunctive relief.
second,we are not persuaded by plaintiffs argument that the district court could enter an injunction based on its inherent equitable authority.federal courts generally have inherent power to grant injunctive relief,but this power can be limited by statute.as we explained nearly a quarter century ago,s ubject to due process limitations,congress may grant jurisdiction over particular subject matter of the federal courts while withholding the power to give certain remedies.in re letourneau,cir.to do this,however,congress must speak clearly of its intent to interfere with the historic equitable powers of the courts otherwise,no diminution in the courts remedial powers may be inferred.id.
congress has spoken clearly here.according to the supreme court,congress restricts a court equitable power when a statute limits that power in so many words,or by a necessary and inescapable inference.porter warner holding.accord mitchell robert demario jewelry,d.the communications act creates such an inference with respect to private parties seeking injunctive relief for violations of the act.section a permits injunctive relief for violations of the telecommunications act,but it does so only upon application by the attorney general at the request of the fcc.see a see also new england.public utils.comm n,section reflects the c ongressional mandate given the fcc it does not empower private enforcement of the act.peter huber et,federal telecommunications law,at ed.a private party has no right to seek injunctive relief to enforce provisions of the communications act.section a reserves that authority to the commission.under sections and,a private party can seek damages for violations of the act,but it does not permit a party to seek injunctive relief.finally,under section b,a remedy which plaintiffs abandoned here,private parties can seek injunctive relief only for fcc orders.see ante note.the communications act,therefore,is not silent on the remedies available under that statute.franklin gwinnett county pub,d a ll appropriate relief is available in an action brought to vindicate a federal right when congress has given no indication of its purpose with respect to remedies.emphasis added.rather,it establishes a comprehensive scheme of remedies available under its scheme that does not include a general right to seek private injunctive relief for violations of the act.
the existence of these remedial provisions,in combination with the absence of any provision mentioning a general right to seek private injunctive relief for violations of the act,clearly indicates that congress did not intend to permit private parties to seek such relief for a violation of section.see transamerica mortgage advisors,at.when a statute limits a thing to be done in a particular mode,it includes the negative of any other mode.citation omitted.this conclusion is necessary and inescapable,especially because congress provided for private injunctive relief for violations of other provisions of the act.see,providing for private injunctive relief where a party is prevented from receiving service in interstate or foreign communication by wire or radio id.e providing for private injunctive relief where a bell operating company violates the electronic publishing restrictions of 
we therefore hold that the district court properly rejected plaintiffs request for injunctive relief.plaintiffs abandoned any possible relief under section b to enforce the fcc regulations at issue here,and they had no standing to request injunctive relief under the communications act for violations of section c.accordingly,plaintiffs request was properly denied.
we pause to note that,although plaintiffs were properly denied monetary and injunctive relief,they could have sought relief through a different,by filing a complaint with the fcc.see id.any person claiming to be damaged by any common carrier may make complaint to the federal communications commission.see also id.no complaint made to the fcc shall at any time be dismissed because of the absence of direct damage to the complainant.if the fcc had determined that at t had violated section or the two fcc regulations at issue,the fcc could have sought or imposed a number of penalties for the violations.see,id.a permitting the fcc to seek,through the attorney general,injunctive relief for violations of the act id b permitting the fcc to assess civil forfeitures and fines for violations of the act and fcc regulations issued under the act.plaintiffs therefore had a forum in which to complain about the behavior alleged in their amended complaint,and to obtain relief if appropriate however,they chose to seek relief elsewhere.
d.the fair debt collection practices act 
plaintiffs next claim invokes the fair debt collection practices act fdcpa,et.in their amended complaint,plaintiffs allege that at t violated the fdcpa,by mailing or causing to be mailed telephone bills to plaintiffs without providing a clear warning that the debt collector is attempting to collect a debt and that any information obtained will be used for that purpose.
section of the fdcpa provides,in relevant part 
a debt collector may not use any false,deceptive,or misleading representation or means in connection with the collection of any debt.without limiting the general application of the foregoing,the following conduct is a violation of this section 
the failure to disclose in the initial written communication with the consumer that the debt collector is attempting to collect a debt and that any information obtained will be used for that purpose,and the failure to disclose in subsequent communications that the communication is from a debt collector 
id.emphasis added.
the district court dismissed plaintiffs claim on the ground that none of the plaintiffs qualified as a consumer under.see conboy,d at.according to the fdcpa,a consumer is any natural person obligated or allegedly obligated to pay any debt.id.plaintiffs admit that they were in no way obligated to pay the debt of their,maria.accordingly,the district court correctly concluded that they had no cause of action under.
plaintiffs argue that their fdcpa claim should nonetheless survive because their amended complaint alleged that at t violated the fdcpa in general.according to plaintiffs,their amended complaint should be read more broadly,to include other possible claims under the fdcpa that may be asserted by a person other than a consumer.
we disagree.the amended complaint specifically refers to when invoking the fdcpa.although the amended complaint makes a general statement that at t acts violate the fdcpa,it does not point to any specific substantive provision of the fdcpa other than plaintiffs even admit that,in the district court,w hether the facts support claims under sections other than of the fdcpa were sic not raised or briefed by the parties.because plaintiffs gave no indication in the district court that they were asserting a violation of fdcpa other than,and all parties proceeded on the assumption that the only violation claimed was under,we hold that all other claims under the statute were abandoned.see gurary winehouse,cir having failed to make the present argument to the district court,plaintiff will not be heard to advance it here.accordingly,the district court properly dismissed this cause of action 
claims against ucs 
the next two issues involve claims against ucs.although these claims were also raised against at t,the district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over them after it dismissed the federal claims against at accordingly,we address them only as they relate to defendant ucs.
new york general business law 
the first issue involves new york general business law,which prohibits a creditor from engaging in d eceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any business,trade or commerce or in the furnishing of any service.bus.law a.plaintiffs argue that ucs engaged in a deceptive act within the meaning of section by violating new york general business law,which prohibits a creditor from communicating with the debtor or any member of his family or household with such frequency or at such unusual hours or in such a manner as can reasonably be expected to abuse or harass the debtor.id.
the district court properly rejected this argument.the new york court of appeals has stated unequivocally that section does not supply a private cause of action.see varela investors ins.holding,explaining that article h of the general business law,which includes section,authorizes only the attorney general or a district attorney to commence an action for violation of its provisions.plaintiffs can not circumvent this result by claiming that a section violation is actionable under section.as the district court well explained 
allowing plaintiffs to plead a cause of action under section by alleging that a violation of that statute necessarily constitutes a deceptive act under section appears contrary to the new york legislature intent and inconsistent with the statutory scheme.the legislature,by creating a private right of action to enforce section,clearly did not intend to authorize private enforcement of section,especially where section contains
