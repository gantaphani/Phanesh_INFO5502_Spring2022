whenever someone makes a call on a telephone or a cell phone,that person telecommunications carrier receives information about who was called,when,and for how long.carriers also have records about the kinds of services and features their customers purchase.more than twenty years ago,the federal communications commission required carriers to maintain the confidentiality of such information if their customers so requested.in re furnishing of customer premises equipment and enhanced services by american telephone telegraph.the telecommunications act of also imposed on carriers a duty to protect the confidentiality of proprietary information of consumers.a.although permitted carriers to use customer information within the confines of the existing service relationship,it prohibited carriers from otherwise using,disclosing or allowing access to such information except as required by law or with the approval of the customer.id.c.the issues presented in this petition for judicial review deal with the validity of the commission latest order specifying how carriers are to obtain their customers approval.
under the act,customer proprietary network information consists of information relating to the quantity,technical configuration,type,destination,location,and amount of use of a telecommunications service subscribed to by any customer of a telecommunications carrier.h.this statutory definition of what we will refer to as customer information encompasses customers particular calling plans and special features,the pricing and terms of their contracts for those services,and details about who they call and when.some carriers may use this information to market specific services or upgrades to their customers,tailored to individual usage patterns.other carriers,especially smaller ones and new market entrants,may find it more efficient to enter into agreements with joint venturers or independent contractors to conduct such targeted marketing.
in its order implementing the confidentiality mandate of the act,the commission interpreted as setting out two categories of uses of customer information those uses to which customers implicitly consent simply by subscribing to a carrier services,and those for which the carrier would have to obtain express customer approval.implementation of the telecommunications act of telecommunications carriers use of customer proprietary network information and other customer information,order.to delineate the bounds of implicit customer approval,the commission adopted the total service approach,which turned on a distinction between three traditional categories of telecommunications services local telephone service,interexchange primarily long distance calling service,and commercial mobile radio services primarily mobile or cellular phone service.id,see also a.the order provided that carriers could infer customer approval within the confines of existing service in one or more of the categories above.order.implicit approval also extended to customer information sharing with carriers affiliates who provide one of the other service types within the existing service relationship between the customer and the carrier.id.but if carriers wished to use or disclose customer information outside of the existing relationship,even in communications with their customers,the commission determined that customers had to consent,affirmatively and explicitly,ahead of time.id.this approach became known as the method.
in west,fcc,cir,the court of appeals held that the order consent requirement amounted to an unconstitutional restriction on the carriers first amendment right to speak to their customers.id.at.relying on central hudson gas electric public service commission of new york,d,the court ruled that the commission had not satisfied its burden of showing that the customer approval regulations restrict no more speech than necessary to serve the asserted state interests.west,at.the court cited a lack of evidence that customers do not want carriers to use their information even if there were such evidence,the court thought the commission had failed to show that an strategy would not sufficiently protect consumer privacy.id.
in response to the tenth circuit decision,the commission initiated a new rulemaking proceeding and issued an order modifying its regulations.see implementation of the telecommunications act of telecommunications carriers use of customer proprietary network information and other customer information,order.the commission stated that in light of west we now conclude that an rule for use between a carrier and its affiliates can not be justified based on the record we have before us.id.the commission took into account customers interest in learning of their carriers service offerings and what it perceived as a lower risk of infringement of personal privacy when customer information is shared within an organization.the commission therefore required only approval for the sharing of customer information between a carrier and its affiliates for purposes.id.the commission prescribed the content,form,and frequency of the notice and process,pursuant to which the approval of customers would be presumed unless they specifically told their carriers not to share the information.id.
the order also allowed carriers to share customer information with joint venture partners or independent contractors for marketing services.order.but the commission recognized a heightened personal privacy risk associated with these third parties because they did not qualify as carriers under the telecommunications act and thus were not subject to confidentiality requirements.id.the commission therefore ordered carriers and their joint venture partners or independent contractors to enter into confidentiality agreements to safeguard customer information,in addition to the notices sent to customers.id.carriers were apparently content with this state of affairs no challenges were mounted against the order.
the electronic privacy information center petitioned in for further rulemaking to modify the commission customer information sharing rules.the petition noted the increasing number of data brokers organizations that sell private information about individuals expressed concern about how easily these organizations are able to obtain the information from carriers and other entities.pet.for rulemaking at.the petition suggested that data brokers might obtain the information from customer service representatives by pretending to have proper authority to receive it known as pretexting,by gaining unauthorized access to consumers online accounts with carriers by hacking,for example,or through dishonest insiders working for the carriers.id.at.concerned that inadequate privacy protections contributed to the data broker problem,the commission initiated a new rulemaking proceeding,received comments,and issued the order at issue in this case.see implementation of the telecommunications act of telecommunications carriers use of customer proprietary network information and other customer information,order.
two months before the commission adopted the order,congress passed the telephone records and privacy protection act of,stat.codified at.the statute imposed criminal penalties for pretexting,a unauthorized access to consumer accounts online,id.a selling or transferring customer information,presumably by either data brokers or dishonest company insiders,id.b and knowing purchase or receipt of fraudulently obtained customer information,id.c.congress found that unauthorized disclosure of customer information not only assaults individual privacy but,in some instances,may further acts of domestic violence or stalking,compromise the personal safety of law enforcement officers,their families,victims of crime,witnesses,or confidential informants,and undermine the integrity of law enforcement investigations.telephone records and privacy protection act.
in its order the commission changed,for the third time,its requirements for the form of customer approval necessary to satisfy.relying on new circumstances to justify its altered approach,the commission now required carriers to obtain consent
