opinion of the court 
mark leyse brought an action under the telephone consumer protection act after receiving a prerecorded telemarketing call on the landline he shares with his roommate.leyse was not the intended recipient of the call his roommate was.for this reason,the district court dismissed the complaint for lack of statutory standing.we find that it was error for the district court to consider the motion to dismiss,which raised an argument that could have been raised in an earlier motion to dismiss.as the procedural error was harmless,however,we reach the merits and conclude that leyse has statutory standing.his status as a regular user of the phone line and occupant of the residence that was called brings him within the language of the act and the zone of interests it protects.
background 
a telemarketer seeking to advertise credit cards for bank of america called the phone shared by mark leyse and his roommate,genevieve dutriaux.it is undisputed that dutriaux was the telephone subscriber and intended recipient of the call,as the number was associated with her name in the telemarketing company records.when the phone was answered the complaint does not specify whether either roommate or the answering machine picked up a prerecorded message played.
this message allegedly violated the advertising restrictions of the telephone consumer protection act of,as well as its associated regulations.the act prohibits any person from,among other things,initiat ing any telephone call to any residential telephone line using an artificial or prerecorded voice to deliver a message without the prior express consent of the called party,unless the call is initiated for emergency purposes or is exempted by rule or order by the federal communications commission.id.b b as a result of the prerecorded message,a lawyer representing dutriaux and leyse filed several lawsuits against bank of america in multiple districts.the action on appeal before us is from the district of new jersey.leyse is the only named plaintiff.
bank of america filed a rule b motion to dismiss on grounds of collateral estoppel,arguing that one of the prior lawsuits had been decided against leyse in a manner that precluded further litigation.the district court agreed and further found that leyse complaint was.on appeal,a panel of this court initially affirmed,then changed its mind on panel rehearing.the panel found that the statute of limitations was tolled,and that collateral estoppel was inapplicable because it was unclear whether the dispositive issue here was actually adjudicated in the prior lawsuit.in vacating the dismissal,the panel noted that on remand,bank of america might be able to argue that leyse lacked statutory standing as the unintended recipient of the automated call.
bank of america did just that.it filed a second rule b motion to dismiss,arguing that leyse was not the called party identified in b b and therefore did not have statutory standing to bring suit.leyse responded that the motion was procedurally improper under rule,as the bank could have raised its statutory standing argument in its previous motion but chose not to.he also contended another part of the statute,b,gives a private right of action to any person or entity injured by the violation not merely the called party.
the district court sided with bank of america on both questions and dismissed leyse complaint.it reasoned that leyse was not the called party,which it defined as the intended recipient of the call,and therefore did not fall within the class of plaintiffs authorized to sue under the telephone consumer protection act.leyse appealed 
ii.discussion 
rule restrictions on successive motions to dismiss 
leyse first argument on appeal is that the district court erred in considering bank of america second motion to dismiss,which he contends was filed in violation of the federal rules of civil procedure.his claim of error is valid,but it does not warrant reversal.
the rules impose restrictions on the filing of successive motions to dismiss except as provided in rule h or,a party that makes a motion under rule must not make another motion under rule raising a defense or objection that was available to the party but omitted from its earlier motion.g.this consolidation rule is intended to eliminate unnecessary delay at the pleading stage by encouraging the presentation of an omnibus motion in which the defendant advances every available rule defense simultaneously rather than interposing these defenses and objections in piecemeal fashion.charles alan wright arthur miller,fed.prac.proc.civ.ed.
bank of america first motion to dismiss,which asserted collateral estoppel,was expressly brought under rule.see also metro.edison.pub.util.comm n,cir noting that collateral estoppel is a permissible basis for a rule b motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.as bank of america concedes,it could have argued in this motion that leyse lacked statutory standing,but it did not.thus,unless one of the exceptions specified in rule g applies,those established in rule h and the bank subsequent rule motion to dismiss on statutory standing grounds was procedurally barred.
the second motion to dismiss does not qualify for the rule h exception,which exempts only motions to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.unlike article iii standing,statutory standing is not jurisdictional.see lexmark int l,static control components.statutory standing goes to whether congress has accorded a particular plaintiff the right to sue under a statute,but it does not limit the power of the court to adjudicate the case.see id.as a result,a dismissal for lack of statutory standing is effectively the same as a dismissal for failure to state a claim,and a motion to dismiss on this ground is brought pursuant to rule b,rather than rule b.baldwin of pittsburgh med,cir see also sullivan db,cir 
the motion does not fall within the rule h exception either.under this provision,a successive motion to dismiss for f ailure to state a claim may be raised a in any pleading allowed or ordered under rule a b by a motion under rule c or c at trial.h.bank of america second motion to dismiss was plainly neither a rule a pleading nor a motion raised at trial.nor was it a rule c motion for judgment on the pleadings,which may be filed only a fter the pleadings are closed.c.thus,because no exception to rule g covers bank of america successive motion,it was improper to consider that motion.
the district court conclusion to the contrary was error.following other district court decisions,the district court held that it could consider bank of america second motion to dismiss because the previous motion had not examine d the substance of leyse claims but rather challenged it on collateral estoppel grounds.app.quoting walzer muriel siebert,civ.drd,wl,at,aff sub nom.walzer muriel siebert,app x cir.the procedural bar of rule g,however,covers all motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim,regardless of the grounds asserted.the district court provided no basis for concluding otherwise,and we see none.indeed,bank of america easily could have included its statutory standing argument in the same motion as its collateral estoppel argument,which is the sort of consolidation that rule g is meant to encourage.if it had done so,it is likely that one of the two appeals could have been avoided 
we also recognize that the court of appeals for the seventh circuit would find no error on the facts before us.in ennenga starns,the defendants filed two motions to dismiss under rule b,only the second of which argued that the plaintiffs claims were untimely.in finding the second motion proper,the seventh circuit held that rule g does not prohibit a new rule b argument from being raised in a successive motion because rule h specifically excepts defenses from the rule g consolidation requirement,cir.we respectfully disagree.like the tenth circuit,we find that ennenga logic fails to address the language from rule h that arguably limits a party to presenting successive arguments in a pleading,a motion for judgment on the pleadings,or at trial.see albers bd.of cnty.comm rs of jefferson,cir.the sixth circuit would likely agree with us as well.see english dyke,cir.
despite the district court error,it does not follow that we must vacate its decision.when considering an appeal,we must give judgment without regard to errors or defects which do not affect the substantial rights of the parties.a district court decision to consider a successive rule b motion to dismiss is usually harmless,even if it technically violates rule g.so long as the district court accepts all of the allegations in the complaint as true,the result is the same as if the defendant had filed an answer admitting these allegations and then filed a rule c motion for judgment on the pleadings,which rule h b expressly permits.
requiring these additional steps would serve little purpose here.if we vacate and remand without ruling on the merits,bank of america will inevitably raise its arguments in a rule c motion,and the case will come up on appeal a third time.creating such delay seems contrary to the purposes of rule g we note that in so holding,we are in agreement with the tenth circuit,which declined to reverse on similar facts because the asserted rule g error was harmless.see albers,at.we therefore proceed to the merits.
statutory standing under the telephone consumer protection act 
background 
the telephone consumer protection act was intended to combat,among other things,the proliferation of automated telemarketing calls known as robocalls to private residences,which congress viewed as a nuisance and an invasion of privacy.see mims.at.to this end,the act makes it unlawful to initiate any telephone call to any residential telephone line using an artificial or prerecorded voice to deliver a message without the prior express consent of the called party,unless the call is initiated for emergency purposes or is exempted by rule or order by the commission.b b.in the same subsection of the act,the paragraph captioned private right of action provides that a person or entity may bring an action to enjoin violations of the statute and recover actual damages or in statutory damages per violation.id.b.
district courts throughout the country have split over the question of who is entitled to sue under the statute,and they fall into various camps.some district court cases hold that statutory standing is limited to the called party,which they define as the intended recipient of the call others indicate that statutory standing is limited to the called party but define that term as the subscriber or regular user of the phone several cases do not invoke the statutory term called party but nevertheless find it prudent to limit statutory standing to the subscriber or primary user.and many cases reject the called party approach on the ground that the act authorizes any person or entity to sue 
the district court here falls into the first camp.it dismissed leyse claim on the ground that,as the unintended and incidental recipient of a call directed to his roommate,he was not the called party and therefore had no right to sue under the act.app.we,however,do not agree that the caller intent circumscribes standing,and we find that leyse falls within the class of plaintiffs congress has authorized to sue.
the zone of interests protected by the act 
the paragraph that establishes the p rivate right of action for violations of the act robocall provisions permits any person or entity to file a lawsuit.b.the text of this provision does not limit the universe of plaintiffs who may file suit in federal court 
even if this were all the act said which it is not,congress broad grant of statutory standing would not enable every person or entity to sue under the act.article iii of the constitution imposes its own standing requirements,and only certain plaintiffs will have suffered the particularized injury required to maintain an action in federal court for a statutory violation.see raines byrd,doe bd.of med.examiners,cir someone with a generalized interest in punishing telemarketers,for example,would not qualify on that basis alone.lujan defenders of wildlife.
but here,article iii is not the only barrier faced by potential plaintiffs.congress surely did not intend,for example,to enable a plaintiff to sue merely because she learned that a friend or neighbor had received a robocall.this commonsense judgment is embodied in an interpretive doctrine of special importance here the presum ption that a statutory cause of action extends only to plaintiffs whose interests fall within the zone of interests protected by the law invoked.lexmark int l.at quoting allen wright.
the supreme court decision in lexmark is instructive.there,the court was called upon to construe the lanham act,which authorizes suit by any person who believes that he or she is likely to be damaged by a defendant false advertising.id.at quoting a.read literally,that broad language might suggest that an action is available to anyone who can satisfy the minimum requirements of article iii.id.the supreme court,however,found it unlikely that congress meant to allow all factually injured plaintiffs to recover.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
instead,the court invoked the presum ption that a statutory cause of action extends only to plaintiffs whose interests fall within the zone of interests protected by the law invoked.id.quoting allen,at.because congress is assumed to legislate against the background of this zone of interests limitation,it applies to all statutorily created causes of action.id.the breadth of the zone of interests depends on the provisions and purposes of the statute being analyzed.see id.in lexmark,the court analyzed the lanham act detailed list of purposes and concluded that a plaintiff must allege an injury to a commercial interest in reputation or sales,rather than injury to its interests as a consumer of a product.id.at.
we apply a similar analysis here.within the subsection of the act at issue in this appeal,b entitled restrictions on use of automated telephone equipment,the first paragraph sets forth p rohibitions,id.b the second discusses the fcc authority to promulgate r egulations,id.b and the third creates a p rivate right of action for a violation of this subsection,id.b in order to delineate the zone of interests protected by the statute,it makes sense to start by looking at the prohibitions that the private right of action is intended to enforce.
the prohibitions paragraph makes it unlawful for any person within the united states,or any person outside the united states if the recipient is within the united states,to transmit certain types of telephone calls and facsimiles.id.b.it contains four subparagraphs,each of which identifies the recipient and type of communication at issue.id.
the first subparagraph forbids using an automated telephone dialing system or an artificial or prerecorded voice without the consent of the called party when calling emergency telephone lines,hospital patient rooms,pagers,cell phones,or any service for which the called party would be charged.id.b a.the second subparagraph,which bank of america is accused of violating,proscribes using an artificial or recorded voice when calling any residential telephone line without the consent of the called party.id.b b.the third prohibits sending unsolicited advertisement s by facsimile to a recipient.id.b c.and the fourth prohibits using an automatic telephone dialing system to tie up two or more telephone lines of a business simultaneously.id.b d.
in the subparagraph at issue here,the called party is relevant because its prior consent to receiving robocalls provides a defense to liability.id.b b.thus,although congress did not expressly limit standing to the called party,its primary concern in enacting b b was to protect that party from unwanted robocalls.this necessarily means that the called party is within the zone of interests protected by the act.
the district court determined that the term called party refers to the intended recipient of the robocall,rather than the actual recipient.and,because leyse was not the intended recipient,the court held he lacked standing.there are good reasons to doubt the equation of intended recipient with cal
