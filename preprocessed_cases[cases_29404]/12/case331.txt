procedural history 
in,sports illustrated published an article implicating cobb as a participant in a fixed or arranged boxing match.the article also suggested that cobb had used cocaine with his opponent,sonny barch,and the promoter,rick parker.the article was based largely on statements given by barch to si reporters.cobb sued si for libel.si filed a motion for summary judgment,which was granted in part and denied in part.the court ruled that si could not be held liable for certain statements contained in the article because there was no evidence of actual malice,as required in a public figure libel case,with respect to those statements.first,the court held that si could not be liable for the statement that the fight had been fixed,because si possessed evidence,other than barch account,that corroborated that statement.next,the court determined that cobb claim must fail as to a statement in the article that cobb had told barch prior to the fight that he had a shoulder injury because that statement was substantially true.cobb had argued to the district court that he did not,in fact,have such an injury,but rather had a rib injury.the court,in granting summary judgment as to this statement,noted the point is that cobb entered a boxing match knowing that he had an injury which would likely impair his ability to box.at.finally,the court granted summary judgment as to an implication in the article that cobb had tested positive for cocaine after the fight.cobb conceded that he was suspended for testing positive for marijuana use,but denied that he ever tested positive for cocaine use.the wording of the article,however,made it seem as though cobb positive test was for cocaine use.nonetheless,the court concluded that the implication was substantially true,because the sting of the statement was that a professional boxer ingested an illegal drug prior to fighting and that such drug would likely affect his ability to box.at.
the court denied summary judgment,however,as to two statements in the article.first,that cobb had knowingly participated in the fixed fight since barch could have agreed to take a dive without cobb knowledge or participation in the scheme.second,that cobb had used cocaine with barch after the fight.the jury was permitted to consider cobb libel claim insofar as it was based on these two statements,and returned a verdict in cobb favor.the trial court then denied si renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law or for a new trial or for remittitur and entered judgment in favor of cobb.si appeals.
ii.factual background 
because this court is required to independently review the evidence of actual malice,discussed below,a detailed review of the si investigation is necessary.in september,si senior editor steve robinson received an unsolicited telephone call from a relatively unknown boxer named sonny barch.barch told robinson that he had participated in a fixed fight promoted by parker in fort lauderdale,florida in.barch told robinson that he had given sworn testimony to don hazelton,the executive director of the florida state athletic commission fsac,regarding this fight,as well as another fixed fight that barch had been involved with as a manager.barch asked robinson if he could be paid for giving si his story.robinson told barch that si would not pay for information,but that it would pay for a account of events,if barch story checked out.robinson and barch agreed that si would pay barch to hold the story from other publications for ten days so that si could investigate.robinson promised barch an additional at the end of the ten day period if the story checked out.
this story was not hot news.nothing about it required immediate dissemination.however,the si reporters planned to investigate the story within the day deadline and close on the story in time to publish it in the october issue.robinson first step was to call don hazelton,the executive director of the fsac.there is no dispute about hazelton credentials.he had been the director of the fsac for nearly five years,had attended the match and every other boxing match in florida during his tenure,had conducted an investigation of the match in question,and had previously served as the president of the national association of boxing commissions and the north american boxing union,as well as the executive director of the international boxing organization.hazelton told robinson that barch had indeed given sworn testimony to the fsac about the cobb barch match and the improprieties as far as that fight was concerned.at.hazelton also told robinson that it was his opinion that the fight had been fixed.robinson then spoke with marty dardis,an si investigator who knew hazelton and confirmed that he was a reliable source.
robinson next step was to assign sonja steptoe to investigate the story.steptoe had over eight years of reporting experience for the wall street journal and si,but was not a boxing expert.steptoe conducted a lengthy interview of hazelton in person.hazelton told steptoe that parker was a promoter with a reputation for corrupt practices.hazelton then told steptoe about the fight in question.hazelton said that the fight was originally scheduled to feature cobb versus a boxer named tim anderson.when hazelton arrived at the,however,parker sought to substitute barch for anderson.parker told hazelton that he preferred barch because he could trust anderson.at.hazelton also stated that parker had complained that anderson was refusing to fight unless he got paid more than.hazelton,however,said that he spoke to anderson,who told hazelton that he was willing to fight for or less.
hazelton also told steptoe that he saw cobb arrive at the venue very twenty minutes before the fights were to begin.cobb claims that this was due to the transportation arrangements made by the promoter.at.hazelton also told steptoe that barch appeared bone dry when he stepped into the sign that he had not warmed up before the fight.at.hazelton also found it odd that barch did not have anyone working in his corner.hazelton and steptoe then watched the fight film,and hazelton told steptoe that barch performance was one of the worst he had seen.he told her that he thought tex performance lacked enthusiasm and was quite what he had thought it should be after making a comeback and a television shot this early.at.hazelton then told steptoe that he had spoken with the ringside officials about the fight,and they were of the opinion that the fight had been arranged.immediately after the fight,hazelton had cobb and barch submit to a surprise drug test.barch tested positive for cocaine,while cobb tested positive for marijuana.hazelton imposed an indefinite suspension on both boxers as a result of the positive drug tests.hazelton also suspended barch for either being in a pitiful physical condition for the fight or for not giving maximum effort.cobb was not similarly suspended for his performance.
barch then contacted hazelton in the summer of.according to hazelton,barch told him that parker had convinced barch to take a dive in the cobb fight,that cobb and barch had discussed how this would happen in barch hotel room before the fight,and that barch and cobb had used cocaine together after the fight in parker hotel room.hazelton told steptoe about this conversation,and indicated that barch had repeated these allegations in a sworn statement before the fsac.hazelton then told steptoe that he believed barch and that he thought that the information he received from barch was accurate.at.hazelton concluded that the film bears out everything that was said.at.steptoe found hazelton to be a very credible witness.
steptoe also interviewed rob russen,rick parker former business partner,who had been a partner in the promotion of the september fight card.russen told steptoe that cobb comeback was a smoke mirage,at and that everyone in the know at the promotion knew that barch was going into the ring with cobb to take a dive.russen told steptoe that when he went to parker hotel room after the fight he smelled marijuana smoke and saw barch and cobb come out of the bathroom in a cloud of marijuana smoke.he also told steptoe that there had been cocaine in the room,and that they had it.at.steptoe interpreted russen statement that they had cocaine to refer to cobb and barch.cobb,however,later testified that he was in parker hotel room after the fight only because he had to go there in order to get paid for the fight.steptoe found russen extremely credible and knowledgeable regarding parker operation.
next,steptoe interviewed tim anderson,cobb originally scheduled opponent,by telephone.anderson told steptoe that parker had substituted barch for him at the.anderson said that parker purported reason for the anderson was demanding more false,and that the real reason for the substitution was that barch would lay down for cobb.
finally,steptoe and si reporter william nack interviewed barch in person.barch told them the same story he had told robinson over the phone,providing more details.some portions of barch account,however,are notable because they arguably cast some doubt on barch veracity.first,barch told them that cobb came into his hotel room to discuss how the fight would play out.barch said that at that meeting cobb told barch that his shoulder was injured.barch told the si reporters that he did not believe cobb,but that he assured cobb that he would not hit him in the shoulders.the si investigators agreed that it did not appear from the videotape of the fight that cobb had a shoulder injury at the time.however,the si staff decided to print barch statement regarding the injury,concluding that they were not reporting that cobb,in fact,had a shoulder injury,but simply that he had told barch he had a shoulder injury.second,barch told the si reporters that he was puzzled that his drug test had come back positive for cocaine,because he had filled his specimen bottle with tap water.the si investigators acknowledged that it would be impossible for the test to come back positive if he had submitted only tap water.the si journalists acknowledged that this story was bizarre,and they decided to simply present barch tap water story to the readers in the article,allowing readers to draw their own conclusions.robinson testified that the only explanation he could come up with was that barch had added tap water to urine in an unsuccessful attempt to doctor the sample,rather than simply filling the specimen bottle entirely with tap water.the si staff sought out information about barch criminal history.barch volunteered some information,including that he had been arrested for passing bad checks,had used drugs,and had once been accused of rape.si later found out that barch had recently been arrested for intent to deliver a controlled substance,a fact that barch had not mentioned.when robinson confronted barch with this information over the telephone,barch hesitated and asked if he could call back.si investigator subsequently discovered that barch had become an informant for the narcotics division and was working on a case undercover.nack and steptoe ultimately concluded that they believed barch,because barch had been consistent regarding the details of the story.they also noted that barch had incriminated himself in his statements,and that barch did not seem to harbor any animosity toward cobb.
steptoe then met with parker,who denied most of barch allegations.parker did mention,however,that he had substituted barch for anderson because he did not want to allow anderson to derail him by beating cobb 
steptoe never interviewed cobb in person,but she did repeatedly try to contact cobb in order to hear his side of the story.steptoe asked each person she interviewed for information on how to contact cobb.she asked parker to have cobb contact her.she left messages for cobb handler and his hollywood agent.she called cobb wife,sent faxes to cobb home,and called a friend of cobb.on september,cobb telephoned steptoe.cobb denied the allegation that the fight was fixed and told steptoe to watch the videotape of the fight.when steptoe offered to fly to nashville to interview him personally,cobb declined.steptoe did not ask cobb any questions concerning the drug use allegations.she testified that she was unable to,because cobb rushed her off the phone.at.following this phone conversation,steptoe made efforts to contact cobb again,to give him another chance to respond to the allegations,including the drug allegations.at.steptoe left voice messages for cobb,but was unable to speak with cobb again.
aside from the interviews,the si journalists repeatedly reviewed the videotape of the fight.robinson,nack,and steptoe each reviewed the tape and independently concluded that cobb was fighting in a contrived fashion.in addition,si sally guard reviewed the tape.although steptoe and guard did not have extensive experience with the sport of boxing,robinson and nack did.nack had covered dozens of fights since for various publications.robinson had served as si boxing editor for nine years,and had seen hundreds of boxing matches 
as cobb notes,however,the si investigation was by no means exhaustive.si never directly interviewed the referee who worked the match or the ringside judges.nor did si ever obtain the transcript of barch sworn testimony before the fsac.nor did si ever consult a boxing expert other than their own experienced boxing journalists concerning cobb performance.further,the si investigators never expressly and directly asked anyone other than barch whether cobb was a knowing participant in the sham.
iii.legal analysis 
si challenges the jury verdict on several grounds.first,si argues that cobb failed to prove,by clear and convincing evidence,that si acted with actual malice.second,si argues that the district court improperly excluded evidence regarding other fixed which si claims provided additional corroboration for barch story.third,si argues that the trial court improperly instructed the jury that cobb needed to prove the actual falsity of the statements in the article by a preponderance of the evidence,rather than by the higher standard of clear and convincing evidence.fourth,si contends that the statement regarding cobb cocaine use after the fight was substantially true,and thus,can not be the basis for liability.finally,si argues that it is entitled to a new trial on liability and damages because the compensatory damage award was grossly excessive.because we find that the record does not support a finding of actual malice we consider only si first argument,and reverse the district court order and judgment.
