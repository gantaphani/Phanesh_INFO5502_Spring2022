on may,the governor of minnesota signed into law article of house file,entitled wireless consumer protection.article imposes several requirements on cellco and other providers of wireless telecommunications services.the statute forbids the providers to implement changes in the terms and conditions of subscriber contracts that could result in increased rates or an extended contract term,unless they first obtain affirmative written or oral consent from the subscriber,subd.see id,subd.d.article also requires providers to deliver copies of the subscriber contracts to the subscribers,subd,and,in the event a subscriber proposes a change to the contract,to disclose clearly any rate increase or contract extension that could result from the change,subd.the statute further requires providers to maintain recorded or electronic verification of the disclosures required by the law.article was scheduled to take effect on july,but on june,cellco filed suit in the district of minnesota seeking a declaration that,among other things,article was preempted by the communications act of,and invalid under several provisions of the united states constitution.cellco also sought an injunction against enforcement of article.
the district court first granted a temporary restraining order against enforcement of article,ruling that cellco had shown an initial likelihood of success on at least a portion of its preemption argument.add.at.on consideration of cellco request for a preliminary injunction,however,the court reached a different conclusion.the district court concluded that cellco had not satisfied the standard for preliminary injunctions set forth in dataphase systems,c l systems,cir en banc,with respect to its claim that article is preempted,except to the extent that article applied to cellco attempts to pass along the costs of contributions to the universal service fund pursuant to a.the district court also determined that cellco did not meet the dataphase test with respect to its claim that article is unconstitutionally vague.as a result,the district court dissolved its temporary restraining order effective september.we granted a stay pending appeal.
although the district court analyzed the preemption question under the likelihood of success on the merits prong of the test for granting preliminary injunctions,see dataphase,at,cellco now proposes without objection from the state that there are only legal issues unresolved on appeal.accordingly,we consider cellco motion as one for a permanent injunction.see bank one guttau,cir.
cellco urges that article is expressly preempted by a federal statute,c a of the communications act of,which provides in relevant part 
n o state or local government shall have any authority to regulate the entry of or the rates charged by any commercial mobile service or any private mobile service,except that this paragraph shall not prohibit a state from regulating the other terms and conditions of commercial mobile services.
c a.a mobile service is defined as a radio communication service carried on between mobile stations or receivers and land stations,and by mobile stations communicating among themselves,id.see id.d,and it is undisputed that cellco is a commercial mobile service cmrs or provider.the parties also agree that article does not regulate market entry,so whether any part of article is expressly preempted by c a turns on whether the statute regulates rates charged by providers.our interpretation of the scope of an express preemption clause must rest primarily on a fair understanding of congressional purpose,medtronic,lohr,d internal quotation and emphasis omitted,and we presume that congress does not intend preemption of historic police powers of the states unless that was its clear and manifest purpose.id.at.
section c was added to the communications act in,see an act to amend the communications act of,pub,a,stat,and its original preemption language provided that n o state or local government shall have any authority to impose any rate or entry regulation upon any private land mobile service,except that nothing in this subsection may be construed to impair such jurisdiction with respect to common carrier stations in the mobile service.c.an amendment in gave c a its current form,introducing the mobile service distinction and providing for state regulation of other terms and conditions.see omnibus reconciliation act of,pub,stat.
the legislative history of the amendment speaks only briefly and indirectly about the meaning of rate regulation.a report from the house budget committee elaborated on the meaning of other terms and conditions,which the statute distinguishes from the regulation of rates and market entry 
by terms and conditions,the committee intends to include such matters as customer billing information and practices and billing disputes and other consumer protection matters facilities siting issues,zoning transfers of control the bundling of services and equipment and the requirement that carriers make capacity available on a wholesale basis or such other matters as fall within a state lawful authority.this list is intended to be illustrative only and not meant to preclude other matters generally understood to fall under terms and conditions.

as the agency charged with administering the communications act,see,the fcc has interpreted c a on several occasions,often relying on the aforementioned legislative history the fcc has determined that a state review of the rates charged by providers prior to implementation of the rates,where the review often occasioned delays of days before new rate offerings could take effect,is rate regulation for purposes of c a.pet.on behalf of the state of hawaii,pub.util.comm n,wl.the commission also has ruled that regulation of rates includes regulation of rate levels and rate structures,such as whether to charge for calls in increments and whether to charge for both incoming and outgoing calls,and that states are prohibited from prescribing the rate elements for cmrs and from specify ing which among the cmrs services provided can be subject to charges by cmrs providers.southwestern bell mobile,wl.
in light of the legislative history classifying billing information,practices,and disputes as other terms and conditions,however,the fcc has concluded that state law claims stemming from state contract or consumer fraud laws governing disclosure of rates and rate practices are not generally preempted under section.id.at.the fcc later clarified that while c does not generally preempt the award of monetary damages by state courts based on state consumer protection,tort,or contract claims,whether a specific damage calculation is prohibited by section will depend on the specific details of the award and the facts and circumstances of a particular case.wireless consumers alliance,wl.in reaching that conclusion,the commission noted that the indirect and uncertain effects of damage awards pursuant to state contract and tort law are not the same as the effects of direct rate regulation,and that although such awards may increase the costs of doing business,these costs fall no more heavily on cmrs providers than on any other business.id.at internal quotation omitted.
