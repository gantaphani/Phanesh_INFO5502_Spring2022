john prather,a longtime state prosecutor,brought a qui tam action alleging that the largest telecommunications telecom companies in the united states were fraudulently overcharging the federal government for surveillance services.the district court dismissed prather action under the false claims act fca public disclosure bar,which states that once allegations of fraud have entered the public domain a person may not bring a qui tam action unless he can prove that he was an original source of those allegations.see e.for the reasons set forth below,we agree that prather did not qualify as an original source and affirm.
factual background 
prather served as an attorney in state government for over thirty years.he began his service as an assistant attorney general in his native state of north carolina,then moved to new york and joined the office of the manhattan district attorney.in he became the deputy chief of the frauds bureau in that office,and in was appointed senior investigative counsel in the rackets bureau.he joined the new york office of the attorney general nyoag in.from to,prather served as the deputy attorney general in charge of the nyoag organized crime task force octf.when he initiated this qui tam action,he was serving as the deputy inspector general for investigation in the metropolitan transportation authority,office of the inspector general.
during his many years as a government attorney,prather supervised hundreds of wiretaps.the octf alone conducted over wiretaps per year.as head of the octf,prather was authorized to determine when it was necessary to seek court permission to use wiretaps,and to personally apply for eavesdropping warrants.he also reviewed telecom companies rate sheets and developed surveillance budgets.
until the,most wiretaps required the manual bugging of a phone or phone line.to bug a phone line,law enforcement would either physically attach a device to the phone wire or place a bug inside the phone itself.the phone company would then set up a separate line into which law enforcement could dial and listen to the conversations taking place over the bugged line.the separate line was essentially the same as any other business or residential phone line provided by the phone company.
with the emergence of cellular phones,this method of bugging telephones was no longer effective.in,congress passed the communications assistance to law enforcement agencies act calea,authorizing the payment of million to telecom companies for investment in the hardware and software necessary to maintain law enforcement ability to effectively eavesdrop despite technological developments in telecommunications.see.prather alleges that as a result of these upgrades,phone companies can now,by a simple flick of a switch,duplicate and forward to law enforcement both a call audio content and its associated information,such as caller identification.er.
by law,the government is required to pay the telecom companies for their assistance with eavesdropping procedures.the omnibus crime control and safe streets act of occssa,as amended,requires phone carriers to furnish the applicant requesting eavesdropping forthwith all information,facilities,and technical assistance necessary to accomplish the interception unobtrusively and with a minimum of interference with the services that such provider is according the person whose communications are to be intercepted.in turn,law enforcement must compensate carriers for the reasonable expenses incurred in providing such facilities or assistance.id.
the occssa does not define reasonable expenses.nor does the enacted calea reference the reimbursement provision in the occssa.in,the federal communications commission fcc issued an order and final rule stating that carriers can recover at least a portion of their calea software and hardware costs by charging to law enforcement agencies,for each electronic surveillance order authorized by the calea,a fee that includes recovery of capital costs,as well as recovery of the specific costs associated with each order.in re commc ns assistance for law enforcement act,fcc rcd.
prather claims that the telecom companies have used calea to overcharge law enforcement agencies for wiretaps and related surveillance assistance.he asserts that although the work involved in providing a wiretap has decreased since the technological changes funded by calea,charges for such services have generally increased tenfold since the law was passed.prather allegedly witnessed these price increases himself through his work as a prosecutor,and as a result of information he obtained from telecom company representatives.
prather claims that he spoke with his superiors at the nyoag about the suspected overcharges as early as.he reportedly raised similar concerns with the manhattan district attorney office.there is no allegation that he spoke to or otherwise alerted the federal government prior to,when the fcc requested input from law enforcement agencies about their wiretap costs.the fcc inquiry was spurred by a joint petition submitted by the doj,fbi,and dea seeking a review of those costs.among the issues identified by the petition was the need to clarify the cost methodology and financial responsibility associated with intercept provisioning.er.the petition also asked the fcc to reverse its order allowing carriers to recover costs,including capital investments,through intercept charges.
the fcc issued a formal request for comment on the joint petition on march.new york attorney general elliot spitzer was among those who submitted comments.prather contends he had to convince the person who was preparing the nyoag comments,susanna zwerling,to include allegations of overcharging.zwerling eventually requested that prather submit affidavits as part of the nyoag official submission,the first of which was dated april,and received by the fcc on april.er,ser.while the affidavits were generated during prather work hours,on his work computer,and submitted in his official capacity,ser,prather submits that nothing in his role as the head of the octf compelled him to raise the issue of overcharging with either the new york attorney general or the fcc.
other law enforcement agencies also offered comments in response to the fcc request.some of those comments were submitted before those of the nyoag.ser.several comments expressed concerns about excessive charges.id.on april,the doj,fbi,and dea replied with their own concerns about intercept fees.on august,the fcc issued a second request for comments.in response,the nyoag and prather reiterated their concerns.
appellees submit that while prather alleges overcharges,his claims are speculative.in his work as a prosecutor,prather received rate sheets from telecom companies listing pricing for services.those rate sheets did not include information about the companies internal costs,and prather conceded in his deposition that he did not know what a carrier actual costs were for wiretapping.ser q you do know what,in fact,the carriers actual costs that they do incur on wiretap provisional services are correct a i do.appellees also submit that prather viewed only one invoice a charge for a intercept from a wiretap.after calea,he reportedly viewed,at most,five other invoices,but does not recall the dates,carriers,amounts,or services involved.ser.
on may,the fcc issued an order stating that 
its prior statement regarding the ability of carriers to recover a portion of their calea capital costs through electronic surveillance order charges imposed on government agencies was made without the benefit of a complete and full record on the issue we now conclude that,while carriers possess the authority to recover through intercept charges the costs associated with carrying out an intercept that is accomplished using a intercept solution,they are prohibited by calea from recovering through intercept charges the costs of making modifications to equipment,facilities,or services or the costs of developing,installing,and deploying intercept solutions 
ser in re commc ns assistance for law enforcement act broadband access,fcc rcd,footnotes omitted.prather alleges that despite the fcc updated position with respect to recoverable costs,telecom companies have continued to overcharge.
procedural history 
prather filed his initial complaint on june.the complaint was unsealed on july,the same day the united states submitted notice of its election not to intervene.
appellee telecom companies filed a joint motion to dismiss.dist.dkt.the district court granted the motion to dismiss with leave to amend,and allowed limited discovery on prather status as an original source of his fraud allegations.
prather filed an amended complaint on july.after he was deposed,appellees filed a joint motion to dismiss the amended complaint.the district court granted the motion to dismiss on november,concluding that it lacked jurisdiction because the amendments to the fca did not apply to prather action prather did not have direct knowledge of the alleged fraud his disclosures were not voluntary in light of his duties as a state prosecutor and he did not have a hand in commencing an investigation.the district court also dismissed prather state law claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under c.prather appealed.

discussion 
application of the amendments to the false claims act 
prather brought his claims under the fca in.on march,the patient protection and affordable care act amended the public disclosure bar of the fca.prior to,the fca stated 
no court shall have jurisdiction over an fca qui tam action based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions in a criminal,civil,or administrative hearing,in a congressional,administrative,or government accounting office report,hearing,audit or investigation,or from the news media,unless the action is brought by the attorney general or the person bringing the action is an original source of the information.
e a.in,amendments to the fca removed the reference to jurisdiction and adopted the following language 
the court shall dismiss an action or claim under this section,unless opposed by the government,if substantially the same allegations or transactions as alleged in the action or claim were publicly disclosed 
i in a federal criminal,civil,or administrative hearing in which the government or its agent is a party 
ii in a congressional,government accountability office,or other federal report,hearing,audit,or investigation or 
iii from the news media,unless the action is brought by the attorney general or the person bringing the action is an original source of the information.
pub,j,stat,amendments.courts have held that these amendments transformed the public disclosure bar from a jurisdictional bar to an affirmative defense.see,united states ex rel.beauchamp academi training,cir,the bar is a grounds for dismissal effectively,an affirmative defense rather than a jurisdictional bar.united states ex rel.osheroff humana,cir.we conclude that the amended e creates grounds for dismissal for failure to state a claim rather than for lack of jurisdiction.see also rockwell int l corp united states,t he jurisdictional nature of the requirement prior to the amendments is clear ex visceribus verborum.
prather submits that the changes to the public disclosure bar were jurisdictional rather than substantive,and that the usual presumption against statutory retroactivity does not apply to jurisdictional changes.accordingly,he contends that the district court should have applied the amended statute retroactively and placed the burden on defendants to assert public disclosure as an affirmative defense.
the supreme court has determined that the amendments to e are not retroactive.graham cty.soil water conservation dist.united states ex rel.wilson,the legislation makes no mention of retroactivity,which would be necessary for its application to pending cases given that it eliminates petitioners claimed defense to a qui tam suit.in so holding,the supreme court did not differentiate between substantive and jurisdictional provisions.in hughes aircraft united states ex rel.schumer,however,the court discussed jurisdictional amendments,contrasting those that affect only where a suit may be brought with amendments that impact whether it may be brought at all.id.at emphasis in original.an amendment that creates jurisdiction where none previously existed speaks not just to the power of a particular court but to the substantive rights of the parties as well.such a statute,even though phrased in jurisdictional terms,is as much subject to our presumption against retroactivity as any other.id.emphasis in original.
like the amendments to the fca public disclosure bar discussed in hughes aircraft,the amendments said nothing about where a suit must be brought,and instead addressed the power of a district court to assert jurisdiction.specifically,prior to the amendments,a district court lacked jurisdiction to hear a case that was barred by the public disclosure provision.after the amendments,a court could assert jurisdiction over the relator complaint and entertain public disclosure as a defense.under the hughes aircraft analysis,the amendments impact the substantive rights of parties.as substantive changes are not applied retroactively,the district court properly determined that the amendments do not apply.
ii.whether prather is an original source 
the fca imposes civil penalties on any person who defrauds the federal government.a.the statute provides that,in addition to enforcement actions brought by the attorney general,a private person may bring a qui tam action on behalf of the government and himself as the relator.id.if the relator prevails,he receives a percentage of the recovery,with the remainder being paid to the government.united states ex.rel.biddle bd.of trs.of leland stanford,cir.
as discussed above,a relator action brought under the fca is jurisdictionally barred if it is based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions unless the person bringing the action is an original source of the information.e a.prather concedes that his claims were publicized before he filed suit,and that the public disclosure bar may therefore apply.he can avoid application of the bar,however,if he qualifies as an original source of the disclosed information.see id.
there is no dispute that the definition of an original source applies to prather claims.the amendments substantively changed the original source definition,and the new language does not apply retroactively to actions brought prior to the amendment,see united states ex rel.hartpence kinetic concepts,cir.en banc.prior to,the statute defined an original source as an individual who has direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based and has voluntarily provided the information to the government before filing an action based on the information.id.at quoting version of e b in effect prior to prather fails to satisfy either of those requirements.
direct and independent knowledge of fraud 
to have direct knowledge under the statute,a person knowledge must be firsthand,obtained through his own labor,and unmediated by anything else.united states ex rel.meyer horizon health,cir,overruled on other grounds by hartpence,at.the person must also have true knowledge,as opposed to guesswork or suspicion,since the purposes of the act would not be served by allowing a relator to maintain a qui tam suit based on pure speculation or conjecture.united states ex rel.aflatooni kitsap physicians,cir.malhotra steinberg,cir.concluding that generalized suspicion did not constitute knowledge of a kickback scheme.
prather contends that he had firsthand knowledge of fraud based upon his review of invoices sent to the octf,his knowledge of average wiretap charges,and his experience setting investigation budgets.he claims to have learned about wiretapping technologies,both pre and,in conversations with octf technology personnel about the octf own syste
