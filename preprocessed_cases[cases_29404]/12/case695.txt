in this consolidated proceeding,networks,challenges two related decisions of the federal communications commission fcc or commission.first,it appeals the dismissal of its application for a nationwide,exclusive license to the megahertz mhz spectrum to provide wireless broadband internet access.second,it petitions for review of the denial of its petition for forbearance on that application.despite the ingenious arguments of petitioner,we affirm the order of the fcc in all respects,dismissing application without prejudice and denying its expansive petition for forbearance.
background 
the fcc has designated mhz of spectrum for advanced wireless services,to provide wireless internet access and other voice and data services.in re service rules for advanced wireless services in the mhz band nprm.service rules have been adopted for one mhz range,now called.in re service rules for advanced wireless services in the ghz and ghz bands.service rules for a second,mhz,band called have been proposed but not approved.see in re service rules for advanced wireless services in the mhz,mhz,mhz and mhz bands.in september,the fcc designat ed the mhz band for aws use,in what came to be called.in re amendment of part of the commission rules to allocate spectrum below ghz for mobile and fixed services to support the introduction of new advanced wireless services,including third generation wireless systems.service rules were not proposed for this band until september.see nprm,at.
on may,networks filed an application with the fcc for a license to the entire band.before us,claims that the band had lain largely fallow since it was first identified by the commission in to provide for emerging telecommunications technologies.see in re redevelopment of spectrum to encourage innovation in the use of new telecommunications technologies notice.this characterization may not be entirely accurate,as there were active licenses in the mhz band in september.nprm,at.these incumbents consist ed primarily of fixed microwave service fs and broadband radio services brs licensees,who are subject to relocation by emerging technology et licensees including future licensees.id.though may imply that the commission has dragged its feet,the commission counters that it has long recognize d the difficulty of replacing old licensees with emerging technology licensees.notice,at.because the incumbents provide important and essential services,the commission proposed to pursue this reallocation in a manner that w ould minimize disruption of the existing operations.id.
plan was to deliver basic wireless broadband access to most of the country free of charge,ultimately making money by charging for premium service.according to the petitioner,for the plan to work,it needed an exclusive,nationwide license to the entire segment for years.in september,amended its application with a petition for forbearance under c and.asked the commission to forbear from applying b,c,and any other rule,provision of the act,or commission policy to the extent such rules,statutory provisions,or policies would impede the acceptance and grant of its application.
in january,the fcc found application acceptable for filing,without assessing the merits.typically,applications for broadcast licenses are processed according to preexisting service rules.but,because there were no service rules for the proposed band,the commission accepted the application pursuant to its general statutory authority under a.upon accepting the application for filing,the fcc invited petitions to deny the application,and additional applications for the same band of spectrum.the commission received voluminous comments,and six new applicants sought licenses for the spectrum.
on august,the commission dismissed without prejudice all applications for access to the mhz band,denied petition for forbearance,and found that the public interest is best served by first seeking public comment on how the band should be used and licensed.in re applications for license and authority to operate in the mhz band order.
ii.analysis 
in this case,we review the fcc application of its own procedures when granting licenses and its interpretation of related statutory provisions.in particular,we ask whether the commission was reasonable in denying certain procedural advantages in its quest for a bandwidth license.
before proceeding to the merits,we will briefly address the commission contention regarding administrative exhaustion.the fcc claims that we lack jurisdiction over seven distinct arguments advanced by.the administrative procedure act apa does not pose a barrier to jurisdiction because judicial exhaustion requirements under the apa are prudential only.see darby cisneros,d.but the fcc contends that bars our consideration of any question of fact or law upon which the commission has been afforded no opportunity to pass.a.ordinarily,however,disgruntled parties are not required to seek administrative reconsideration before challenging a commission order in this court,and exceptions to this general rule are to be construed narrowly.ass for better broad.fcc nabb.most importantly,governing precedent dictates that section a constitutes an exhaustion requirement,rather than a jurisdictional prerequisite.petroleum commc ns,fcc.additionally,in freeman engineering associates,fcc,we recognized that section contains the traditionally recognized exceptions to the exhaustion doctrine,like futility,quoting omnipoint fcc.the exhaustion requirement ensures that the commission has the opportunity to pass on all issues in the case before the issues are presented for review by the court.importantly,we construe each of objections to address the substantive content of the fcc legal conclusions that would necessarily have been implicated in their application and petition,rather than merely to protest procedural imperfections.ordinarily petitioners must give agencies an opportunity to cure technical defect s before seeking review by this court.nabb,at.because we conclude that the commission has had an opportunity to pass on each of arguments that we discuss today,we may proceed to the merits.
forbearance under 
we review the fcc interpretation of its statute with deference under the familiar framework of chevron,natural resources defense council,d.see earthlink,fcc.in addition,the commission judgments on the public interest are entitled to substantial judicial deference.fcc wncn listeners guild,d.
in,congress provided that the commission shall forbear from applying any regulation or any provision of the relevant statute if the commission determines that forbearance from applying such provision or regulation is consistent with the public interest.a.petitioned the commission to forbear from applying b and c.section b requires the commission to wait days before acting on applications for licenses not subject to competitive bidding.b.section c requires,among other things,that all license applications granted without a hearing must be from applicants who are legally,technically,financially,and otherwise qualified.c.therefore,argues that the commission should have granted its petition to for forbear from two provisions.the first provision would have required the fcc to wait days after it accepted application for filing this was mooted months before the order issued.the second would have required the fcc to hold a hearing unless it could officially notice qualifications.
forbearance and the public interest 
also petitioned the commission,in a strikingly broad and inclusive request,to forbear from applying any other rule,provision of the act,or commission policy to the extent such rules,statutory provisions,or policies would impede the acceptance and grant of its application.emphasis added.under the statute,the commission should forbear from applying those rules if it determines that forbearance is consistent with the public interest.a,however,makes the startling assertion that the commission should forbear from applying those rules if application is consistent with the public interest.it argues that,because both statutory provisions discuss the public interest,the fcc may only make one inquiry to answer
