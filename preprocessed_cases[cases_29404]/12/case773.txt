corporation and sprint spectrum sprint pcs or sprint,along with cellco partnership,petition this court for review of a declaratory ruling of the federal communications commission fcc or commission responding to a primary jurisdiction referral from the united states district court for the western district of missouri.the referral arose during the course of litigation between and sprint in missouri in which sprint sought compensation from for its use of sprint wireless network.removed the case from state court to the federal district court,which then referred specific questions to the fcc under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction.in its referral order,the district court inquired of the fcc whether sprint may charge access fees to for access to the sprint pcs wireless network and,if so,the reasonableness of sprint charges.
after receiving petitions for declaratory rulings from both and sprint,along with public comments,the commission held that sprint is entitled to collect access charges from only to the extent that a contract between the parties imposes a payment obligation on.the fcc declined to determine the reasonableness of any rate until after the district court determined whether the parties are bound by a contract.both and sprint raise numerous challenges to the commission ruling,none of which are properly before this court for review.accordingly,we dismiss the petitions for review.
background 
the facts underlying this case are largely undisputed.because this information is adequately set forth in the commission ruling that is the subject of review here,see in the matter of petitions of sprint pcs and for declaratory ruling regarding cmrs access charges,at,wl,reported at fed.reg.hereinafter declaratory ruling,we will simply summarize the most important facts to highlight what is at issue.
in,petitioner sprint pcs,a commercial mobile telephone service cmrs provider,started billing for the costs of terminating interexchange traffic bound for its customers.refused to pay the sprint invoices.declaratory ruling,at.on august,sprint sought to enforce payment by filing suit in state court in missouri seeking a monetary judgment against on three causes of action breach of contract,quantum meruit,and action on account.id.then removed the case to federal district court in the western district of missouri.sprint moved to remand the case back to state court,which opposed.sprint denied the existence of diversity between the parties and claimed that its claims in no way raised any federal question.plaintiff motion to remand at,sprint spectrum,d,joint appendix.in its opposition,argued,inter alia,that sprint claims were wholly preempted by,because they would require the court to establish a rate for terminating access.defendant suggestions in opposition to plaintiff motion to remand at,sprint spectrum,d.
the district court denied sprint motion to remand,holding that it had jurisdiction based upon the diversity of the parties without addressing whether or not sprint action raised federal claims.sprint spectrum communications,order denying sprint motion to remand,reprinted in.then asked the district court to refer the case to the commission under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction.see sprint spectrum,d.sprint opposed that motion,arguing that it was simply seeking payment for services rendered using theories that do not involve the communications act or the fcc special expertise.id.at.
on july,the district court referred two issues to the commission under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction.id.at.the court was very precise in setting forth the terms of its referral 
ordered that defendant corporation motion for referral of issues to the fcc under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction and for dismissal or a stay proceedings pending the referral is granted.the questions of whether sprint may charge access fees to for access to the sprint pcs wireless network and,if so,the reasonableness of sprint charges for such services are referred to the fcc for further consideration.it is further 
ordered that defendant corporation is directed to prepare and submit the appropriate filings to bring these issues before the fcc by friday,august.
on october,and sprint filed separate petitions seeking declaratory rulings from the fcc.the commission described these filings,as follows 
in its petition,sprint pcs asks the commission to find that there is no federal law or commission policy that bars sprint pcs from recovering its call termination costs from.sprint pcs also asks the commission to find that refusal to pay access charges to sprint pcs is unreasonably discriminatory under section a of the communications act of,as amended the act,and unjust and unreasonable under section b of the act.in its petition,asks the commission to find that cmrs carriers should continue to recover their costs from their end users,not by imposing access charges on ixcs.if cmrs carriers are permitted to impose access charges,asks that those charges be capped at the reciprocal compensation rate for local traffic and assessed only prospectively.
declaratory ruling,at.
because the parties petitions for declaratory rulings were much wider in scope than the district court referral order,the fcc declaratory ruling is somewhat in its discourse.as a consequence,there are numerous observations in the declaratory ruling that do not purport to respond to the district court referral order or to otherwise pass judgment on any issue.cut to its core,however,the fcc declaratory ruling is fairly precise in responding to the referral order.the principal terms of the declaratory ruling are as follows 
sprint pcs is correct that neither the communications act nor any commission rule prohibits a cmrs carrier from attempting to collect access charges from an interexchange carrier.
that sprint pcs may seek to collect access charges from does not,however,resolve the question whether sprint pcs may unilaterally impose such charges on.
we find that there is no commission rule that enables sprint pcs unilaterally to impose access charges on.
there being no authority under the commission rules or a tariff for sprint pcs unilaterally to impose access charges on,sprint pcs is entitled to collect access charges in this case only to the extent that a contract imposes a payment obligation on.while it is preferable for carriers to memorialize such contracts in a written agreement,the parties here agree that there is no written agreement or any express contract between and sprint pcs.nevertheless,the law recognizes as has the commission that an agreement may exist even absent an express contract.
turning to the question whether there was such an agreement here,we believe that it is an issue that should be resolved by the court.we interpret the court primary jurisdiction referral as seeking our input on the federal communications law questions related to this dispute.because the existence of a contract is a matter to be decided under state law,we defer to the court to answer this question 
paragraph of the declaratory ruling rejects sprint claims under b and a as premature 
we need not address sprint pcs claims under sections b and a at this time.until the court determines the respective obligations of the parties,in particular whether has any obligation to pay sprint pcs under a contract,the commission has no basis on which to assess whether is subject to sections b or a in these circumstances and,if so,whether its actions violate those statutory provisions.
id.at.the commission also declined to entertain issues relating either to the prospective treatment of interconnection or to issues beyond the scope of those presented for commission resolution in the primary jurisdiction referral.id.rather,the commission firmly stated that the declaratory ruling merely clarifies requirements under the fcc existing rules.id.
in its petition for review,argues that the declaratory ruling is contrary to law,because,in allegedly allowing a state court to determine whether it owes access charges under an implied contract or quantum meruit,the commission departed from its precedent holding that states are preempted by c a from setting rates for intercarrier compensation.sprint contends,in its petition,that the declaratory ruling is arbitrary and capricious in not requiring to pay access charges.sprint also argues that the fcc favored one set of providers and one type of communication technology over another in violation of the communications act.and,finally,sprint challenges observations in the declaratory ruling that appear adverse to sprint interests but which have no binding legal effect.we deny both petitions,because neither nor sprint claims are ripe for consideration by this court.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
in order to succeed in their challenges,and sprint must demonstrate that the declaratory ruling is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.see a.
highly deferential,the arbitrary and capricious standard presumes the validity of agency action,requiring us to determine whether the agency has considered the relevant factors and articulate d a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.motor vehicle mfrs.ass of the united states,state farm mut.auto.ins,d internal quotation marks omitted.we may reverse only if the agency decision is not supported by substantial evidence,or the agency has made a clear error in judgment.kisser cisneros.
the court reviews commission constructions of the communications act in accordance with chevron usa natural resources defense council,d,and its progeny.under chevron,i f the intent of congress is clear,the court must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.chevron,at.if congress has not directly addressed the precise question at issue,the agency statutory interpretation is entitled to deference,as long as it is reasonable.id.at.chevron deference is due,however,only if the agency has acted pursuant to delegated authority and the agency action has the force of law.see christensen harris county,d united states mead,d.
in applying these standards,t he job of judges is to ask whether the commission made choices reasonably within the pale of statutory possibility.verizon communications fcc,d.
the commission initially argues that has suffered no actual or imminent injury as a result of the declaratory ruling and,therefore,lacks standing to challenge it.we reject this argument.the declaratory ruling holds that may be obligated to sprint pursuant to an contract and it leaves the matter to the district court to determine whether a contract exists.this portion of the declaratory ruling clearly causes a cognizable injury to which would be redressed with a favorable ruling from this court.
in fcc,we held that had standing to challenge an fcc order determining that was liable for access charges to a local exchange carrier,even though the order did not require payment,because the order exposed to liability in pending litigation.similarly,has standing in this case because the declaratory ruling exposes it to liability for access charges in its pending litigation with sprint.
the commission argues,in the alternative,that section c a preemption claim is unripe for review,because,first,the issue is presently unfit for decision by this court and,second,a delay in judgment will cause no hardship to.likewise,the commission argues that it reasonably deferred resolution of sprint section b and a claims until after the district court in missouri decides whether has a contractual obligation to pay access charges.the fcc also contends that sprint remaining claims relate to matters with respect to which the agency has issued no final judgment thus,according to the commission,these matters surely are not subject to judicial review.
the framework for assessing ripeness was established in abbott laboratories gardner,d,in which the supreme court provided a test that requires a reviewing court to evaluate both the fitness of the issue for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.as we noted in city of houston department of housing urban development,the primary focus of the ripeness doctrine is to balance the petitioner interest in prompt consideration of allegedly unlawful agency action against the agency interest in crystallizing its policy before that policy is subject to review and the court interest in avoiding unnecessary adjudication and in deciding issues in a concrete setting.id.at citing industries epa.
under the fitness of the issues prong,the first question for a reviewing court is whether the disputed claims raise purely legal questions and would,therefore,be presumptively suitable for judicial review.better gov t ass dep t state,see also payne,united states,at.we next consider whether the court or the agency would benefit from postponing review until the policy in question has sufficiently crystallized by taking on a more definite form.see better gov t,at.
the hardship prong of the abbott laboratories test is not an independent requirement divorced from the consideration of the institutional interests of the court and agency.payne,at.thus,where there are no institutional interests favoring postponement of review,a petitioner need not satisfy the hardship prong.see,consol.rail united states.however,where there are strong interests militating in favor of postponement,we must weigh the potential hardship of delay on the appellant.city of houston,at.under the hardship prong,we consider a claimant interest in immediate review.better gov t,at.if t he only hardship a claimant will endure as a result of delaying consideration of the disputed issue is the burden of having to engage in another suit,this will not suffice to overcome an agency challenge to ripeness.city of houston,at.
in applying these standards to the instant petitions for review,we agree with the commission that the matters at hand should be dismissed as unripe.
as noted above,the commission declaratory ruling responded to the two questions referred by the district court whether sprint may charge access fees to for access to the sprint pcs wireless network and,if so,the reasonableness of sprint charges for such services.see sprint spectrum,d at.as to the first question,the commission held that was not required to pay such charges absent a contractual obligation to do so.as to the second question,the commission responded,until the court decides whether there was a contract,it is premature to address the court second question regarding the reasonableness of any rate charged.declaratory ruling,at.
principal claim is that the fcc declaratory ruling implicitly suggests that a state court might properly determine that sprint is entitled to access fees on the basis of an contract with no fixed price term which would require a state court determination of the reasonableness of the access charges or on the basis of quantum meruit which is an equitable claim not based on a contractual commitment.argues,in particular,that,because all of sprint claims would require the district court to set a reasonable price for sprint pcs services,those claims are expressly preempted by c a.therefore,according to,the failure of the declaratory ruling to hold sprint claims preempted is both contrary to law and arbitrary.also contends that,in failing to declare sprint claims preempted,the declaratory ruling is an unexplained departure from the fcc ruling in in the matter of wireless consumers alliance,wl also cited as cmrs preemption order interpreting c a to preempt state courts from determin ing the reasonableness of a prior rate.
the problem with argument is that it rests on faulty premises first,the commission did not,as suggests,declare that the district court was free to determine the reasonableness of a prior rate.second,the commission did not purport to depart from its ruling in wireless consumers alliance.and,third,the commission did not resolve the preemption issue,either explicitly or implicitly.
the declaratory ruling says that,b ecause the existence of a contract is a matter to be decided under state law,we defer to the district court to answer this question.declaratory ruling,at.the commission also noted that an agreement may exist even absent an express contract.id.on this la
