invoking section of the communications act of,sbc communications filed a petition with the federal communications commission requesting that the commission forbear from applying title ii common carrier regulation to ip platform services.fifteen months later,the commission denied the request for two independent reasons the petition was procedurally defective because the commission had yet to determine whether common carrier regulations even applied to ip platform services,and sbc failed to identify with sufficient precision the regulations and services it intended the petition to cover.arguing that the first rationale conflicts with section and the second is arbitrary and capricious,renamed at t for review.because we agree that the commission lacks section authority to reject a petition as procedurally improper just because it requests forbearance from uncertain regulatory obligations,we reject the commission first rationale for denying sbc petition.and because the commission has failed to explain how its second rationale is consistent with the specificity standard it has applied in other contexts,we remand the case for further explanation and consideration consistent with this opinion.
congress enacted the telecommunications act of to encourage the rapid deployment of new telecommunications technologies by promot ing competition and reduc ing regulation among telecommunications providers.telecommunications act of,stat.critical to congress deregulation strategy,the act added section to the communications act of.that section requires the federal communications commission to forbear from enforcing communications statutes and regulations in certain specified circumstances.in particular,section a provides that 
the commission shall forbear from applying any regulation or any provision of federal telecommunications law to a telecommunications carrier or telecommunications service,or class of telecommunications carriers or telecommunications services,in any or some of its or their geographic markets,if the commission determines that 
enforcement of such regulation or provision is not necessary to ensure that the charges,practices,classifications,or regulations by,for,or in connection with that telecommunications carrier or telecommunications service are just and reasonable and are not unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory 
enforcement of such regulation or provision is not necessary for the protection of consumers and 
forbearance from applying such provision or regulation is consistent with the public interest.
a.section b requires that in determining whether forbearance is consistent with the public interest,the commission shall consider whether forbearance from enforcing the provision or regulation will promote competitive market conditions,including the extent to which such forbearance will enhance competition among telecommunications providers.id.b.section c allows telecommunications carriers to petition the commission for forbearance with respect to particular services or facilities.id.c.should the commission fail to respond within one year,the petition shall be deemed granted,although the commission may extend the period by an additional days if it finds that an extension is necessary to meet the requirements of subsection a.id.
on february,sbc communications filed a section petition requesting forbearance from title ii common carrier regulation for ip platform services,petition of sbc communications for forbearance,wc docket,at filed,forbearance petition,which it defined as those services that enable any customer to send or receive communications in ip format over an ip platform,and the ip platforms on which those services are provided,id.at acknowledging some general uncertainty as to whether title ii actually covers these services,sbc urged the commission to eliminate any doubt concerning the unregulated status of ip platform services by expressly forbearing from applying title ii regulation to the extent that such regulation might otherwise be found to apply.id.at.in a second,simultaneously filed petition,sbc requested a declaratory ruling confirm ing that ip platform services are not subject to title ii regulation.petition of sbc communications for a declaratory ruling i filed,declaratory ruling petition.
one month after sbc filed its two petitions,the commission issued an services notice of proposed rulemaking nprm raising many of the same issues presented in sbc petitions.see services,wl,fcc proposed.the commission consolidated sbc declaratory ruling request with the rulemaking proceedings and,given the substantial overlap between the issues presented in the sbc forbearance petition and the services nprm,extended the period for comment on the forbearance petition to coincide with the nprm comment cycle.wireline competition bureau extends comment deadlines for sbc ip platform services forbearance petition,wl,public notice.during the following year,sbc and other interested parties filed comments and ex parte submissions relating to both the rulemaking proceeding and sbc two petitions.
after extending the period by an additional ninety days,the commission denied sbc forbearance petition.the commission order explains 
we find that the petition is procedurally defective because it asks us to forbear from the application of statutory provisions and regulations that may or may not apply to the telecommunications carrier or telecommunications service at issue.in addition,the evidence and arguments set out in sbc petition and subsequent pleadings are insufficiently specific to permit a finding that forbearance is appropriate.

sbc filed a petition for review with this court,see a allowing parties aggrieved by a commission order to appeal to this court and,during briefing,merged with at t to form a new company,at t.at t argues that nothing in section permits the commission to reject,as procedurally improper,petitions seeking forbearance from regulatory obligations that may or may not apply to the facilities and services in question and the commission acted arbitrarily and capriciously in denying sbc petition on the alternative ground that the petition lacked sufficient specificity to determine whether section a requirements were satisfied.
we begin with the commission first reason for rejecting the the commission had yet to determine the extent to which title ii actually covers services.in its order denying sbc petition,the commission relied on language from two different parts of section to explain why it may reject as procedurally improper any conditional forbearance petition,that is,any petition seeking forbearance from uncertain regulatory obligations.
first,section a uses the word forbear,which means,the commission says,to desist from or cease.forbearance order,wl,at.because it would be impossible to forbear from applying a regulation that does not apply,the commission concluded,section do es not govern petitions seeking such relief.id.in other words,according to the commission,it lacks authority to consider conditional forbearance requests because section neither contemplates nor permits grants of forbearance relating to obligations that may or may not apply to the service at issue.id.in its opening brief,at t offered a forceful rebuttal to this interpretation of section,but we need not consider the issue because the commission,in addition to failing to defend its position in its brief,affirmatively withdrew it at oral argument.oral arg.
we thus focus on the second provision the commission relied on to support its conclusion that conditional forbearance petitions are procedurally defective,namely,section a public interest requirement.the commission reasoned 
w e find that the grant of a petition seeking forbearance from a requirement that does not unambiguously apply is contrary to the public interest,and therefore does not satisfy the requirements for granting forbearance under section a of the act.it is not in the public interest to forbear from requirements before the commission has fu
