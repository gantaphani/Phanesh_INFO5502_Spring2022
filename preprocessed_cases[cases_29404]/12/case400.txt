qwest corporation challenges an order issued by the nebraska public service commission setting the rates that competitors must pay to lease elements of qwest local telephone network in nebraska.the district court applying a deferential standard of review,affirmed the commission order.for the following reasons,we affirm in part and remand to the district court with instructions to remand to the commission for further proceedings concerning how qwest will implement the order.
background 
the telecommunications act of requires established local telephone companies such as qwest to lease elements of their networks to rival companies seeking to enter a local market.the established companies are conventionally called ilecs,which stands for incumbent local exchange carriers.the ilecs rivals are called clecs,which stands for competitive local exchange carriers.and the network elements that ilecs are required to lease to clecs are called unes,which stands for unbundled network elements.
the act allows ilecs to negotiate and contract with clecs regarding the rates for leasing unes.see a.in the event that carriers can not reach an agreement,the act authorizes state public utilities commissions to set rates.see id.b see also implementation of the local competition provisions in the telecommunications act of.state commissions must,in turn,follow implementing regulations issued by the federal communications commission.see mpower commc ns.bell,cir.
two fcc regulations are particularly relevant here.the first regulation provides that rates for unes must be based on a standard known as total element incremental cost,or telric.a see also verizon commc ns fcc,d holding that the fcc has authority under the act to require state commissions to set rates based on telric.under telric,rates are calculated according to what it would cost today to build and operate an efficient network that can provide the same services as the ilec existing network.qwest koppendrayer,cir.in other words,telric obliges state regulators to set prices based on the costs that would be incurred to produce the services in question using the telecommunications technology now available,and the most efficient network configuration.at t commc ns of.bell,cir.telric thus differs from rate regulation,in which a commission simply determined how much capital a utility ha d reasonably invested in its plant and then set the reasonable rate of return on that investment.mpower commc ns,at.as other courts have noted,telric is a very flexible standard.see,id.at because the endeavor is hypothetical and prospective,it is impossible to find right answers there are only better and worse estimates.at t commc ns of,at telric is a framework rather than a formula there is considerable play in the joints.at t fcc,e normous flexibility is built into telric.
the second regulation requires state commissions to establish different rates for elements in at least three defined geographic areas within the state to reflect geographic cost differences.f.the process of establishing different rates for unes in different areas is called geographic deaveraging.according to the fcc,rates must be deaveraged to more closely reflect the actual costs of providing unbundled elements.implementation of the local competition provisions.
in,the nebraska public service commission set the leasing rates for qwest local loops,a term of art referring to the last mile of copper wire or cable that connects customers to the local network.in docket,the commission used three economic cost studies to determine telric for qwest loops.the commission then used a statistical technique called cluster analysis to place wire centers the connecting point for local loops and the carrier central office with similar cost characteristics into three zones.the commission application of this methodology resulted in the following monthly leasing rates for individual loops in each zone zone,zone,and zone.qwest later moved to reduce these rates by percent the commission granted qwest motion,resulting in monthly rates of,and.the parties agree that these rates complied with the telric standard.
in addition to its responsibilities,the commission is responsible for administering nebraska universal service fund,which is intended to ensure that all nebraskans,without regard to their location,have comparable accessibility to telecommunications services at affordable prices.the commission supports universal access by allocating subsidies to service providers.in,the commission adopted a new method of allocating these subsidies.the universal service funding mechanism that the commission adopted in docket was designed to target subsidies to rural,areas where the costs of providing service are highest.in particular,the commission developed a model using econometric regression another form of statistical analysis to calculate subsidies based on the relationship between household density and costs.the commission also ordered certain subsidies for leased unes to be ported,transferred from the ilec to a clec.the commission adjusted the size of portable subsidies linked to loops providing service to residential customers and eliminated portable subsidies linked to many loops providing service to business customers while this proceeding did not affect the leasing rates for qwest loops,the new method of allocating subsidies led to a competitive imbalance in zone and zone 
in,the commission opened an investigation into whether the three zones established in docket remained appropriate in light of the funding mechanism announced in docket.in docket,the commission staff proposed adding and designations to the existing zones.according to the staff,further deaveraging leasing rates would account for geographic cost differences on a more targeted basis.furthermore,the staff suggested that adding and designations would restore competitive neutrality by harmonizing leasing rates with portable subsidies.
the commission adopted the staff proposal to deaverage leasing rates into four zones zone zone zone and a zone encompassing areas.the commission defined areas as cities,villages or unincorporated areas with or more households and densities greater than households per square mile and defined areas as the remaining areas in each zone that have not been assigned to a town.
the commission also adopted the staff proposed deaveraging method,which had four basic steps.first,the existing leasing rates were multiplied by the number of loops in each zone to determine the total cost in each zone.second,the percentage of expected cost,calculated using the econometric regression model from docket,was allocated to and areas.third,the total cost in each zone determined in step one was allocated to and areas according to the percentages determined in step two.fourth,the aggregate costs for and areas were divided by the number of and loops to determine per loop costs for and areas in each zone.the commission application of this methodology resulted in the following monthly leasing rates for loops in each zone,zone,zone,and zone,
the commission ordered qwest to implement its order by identifying and customers as proxies for and loops using the distribution model developed in docket.qwest moved for reconsideration and rehearing,asserting that the distribution model did not contain the data needed to classify many of its customers addresses as or.qwest requested permission to use municipal tax records,which were already integrated into qwest billing system,instead of the distribution model.qwest described this alternative method of implementing the commission order as a reasonable approximation of the commission definition of and areas.the commission denied qwest motion because it was untimely.qwest then moved for clarification,modification,or waiver of the commission order,renewing its request for permission to use municipal tax records instead of the distribution model.the commission granted qwest request for clarification,stating that qwest may use the municipal tax information in its existing billing systems in the implementation of the four zone methodology.
qwest filed this action under e,which authorizes any party aggrieved by the rates set by a state commission to seek judicial review in federal court.the district court found that qwest made a good case for setting aside the rate s set by the commission in docket.qwest commc ns vap,wl,at,unpublished.specifically,the court noted that it was doubtful whether the commission deaveraging method resulted in rates.id.at.nevertheless,the court construed qwest challenge as raising a mixed question of law and fact,subject to review under the arbitrary and capricious standard.id.the court held that the commission order did not violate the act or applicable fcc regulations and was not arbitrary and capricious.id.at.accordingly,the court concluded that e ven though it is a close question,i will defer to the commission judgment,confident that it will take prompt corrective action in the event the marketplace discloses that there is a n imbalance between rates and costs in any zone.id.at.qwest appeals.
ii.discussion 
qwest makes five principal arguments for overturning the commission order.although there is some overlap between these arguments,we find it convenient to address them in turn.at the outset,however,we will recite the general principles governing our standard of review.
we review the district court decision de novo,applying the same standards as the district court.ace.ass koppendrayer,cir.thus,we review a state public utilities commission interpretation of federal law de novo.id.citing qwest.pub.utils.comm n,cir.recognizing the state commission superior technical expertise,however,we review its factual determinations under the arbitrary and capricious standard.id.citing qwest.pub.utils.comm n,at.the scope of review under the arbitrary and capricious standard is narrow the standard does not permit a court to substitute its judgment for that of the agency.connect commc ns sw.bell,cir quoting in re core commc ns.
we have applied the arbitrary and capricious standard in reviewing commissions decisions concerning issues.see,wwc license,boyle,cir citing qwest koppendrayer,cir.for instance,the court in wwc license applied the arbitrary and capricious standard in reviewing a challenge to a commission cost estimates.id.likewise,the court in qwest koppendrayer applied the arbitrary and capricious standard in reviewing challenges to a commission adoption of cost models.at.these cases appropriately focused on concrete issues rather than abstract methodological principles.see at t commc ns of.bell,cir congress provided for federal judicial review of rates set by state commissions it did not provide for review of individual factors that influence those rates.given the nature of,applying a deferential standard of review makes good sense.see wwc license,at.
on the other hand,we have said that we review a commission decision for compliance with federal law de novo.see,connect commc ns,at citing qwest.pub.utils.comm n,at.the meaning of compliance in this context is not entirely clear.presumably,our statements concerning review for compliance with federal law refer to purely legal questions rather than the mixed questions that we have elsewhere described as issues.for instance,the court in wwc license applied the de novo standard in reviewing a dispute about an ilec statutory duties,noting that resolution of the issue requires only interpretation of the act.at.as we mentioned above,the court went on to apply the arbitrary and capricious standard in reviewing a challenge to the commission cost estimates.id.at.the challenged cost estimates in wwc license were based on the commission application of federal pricing standards.id.at.thus,we can state with confidence that not every challenge to a commission application of federal law is reviewed de novo we do not want to bog down in a standard of review quagmire,connect commc ns,at,so we will not attempt a more comprehensive exegesis of these general principles 
turning to the merits,qwest first argues that the commission order violates federal law because it sets rates based on a mathematical equation rather than a telric cost study.qwest relies almost exclusively on e,which provides in pertinent part that a n incumbent lec must prove to the state commission that the rates for each element it offers do not exceed the economic cost per unit of providing the element,using a cost study that complies with the methodology set forth in this section.
the parties disagree about whether this challenge to the commission deaveraging method raises a pure question of law or a mixed question of law and fact.qwest contends that the commission compliance with the act and applicable fcc regulations is a question of law and that n o deference is owed to the cost methodologies a state commission adopts to set rates.appellant br.at.the commission contends that the question whether its deaveraging method complies with the act and applicable regulations depends in part on its underlying factual findings and in turn on whether the record contains sufficient evidence to support those factual findings.appellee br.at.
this challenge is difficult to classify because it assumes a crucial fact that the commission deaveraging method nullified the results of the three cost studies that the commission used in docket.that assumption fails to account for the limited scope of the current proceeding before the commission.recall that the commission avowed purpose in docket was to deaverage the leasing rates for qwest loops by adding and designations to the existing geographic zones.the commission deaveraging method started with the existing leasing rates in each zone.those rates satisfied the requirements set out in e because they were based on the averaged results of three cost studies the commission used those cost studies to determine telric for qwest loops.as the district court noted,the commission division of the existing zones into and areas necessitated a change in rates,but the loop costs that were used in the rate calculation remained unchanged.qwest commc ns vap,wl,at,unpublished.hence,a new study of loop costs would have been superfluous 
qwest suggests that there is a hole in this logic because the deaveraged rates bear no resemblance to the original rates.reply br.at.in particular,qwest asserts that a ll rates for loops have increased between and,and rates for loops in zones and have decreased between and.reply br.at.that is quite obviously an invalid comparison one should expect the rates to differ,perhaps by large amounts,based on the number of geographic zones four versus three and the use or not of and designations.notwithstanding those differences,the key loop the same for both sets of rates.the whole point of further deaveraging the existing rates was to account for geographic cost differences on a more targeted basis.the magnitude of the increases and decreases in rates that qwest identifies only goes to show that the model was obscuring large differences in loop costs in versus areas.
once the current proceeding is placed in proper context,the relevant question of law becomes whether a new cost study is required every time a state commission wants to further deaverage existing rates that comply with the telric standard.section e does not mention geographic deaveraging,so it is inapposite on this point.qwest has not identified any other authority for the proposition that deaveraging existing rates that comply with the telric standard requires a new cost study,and we have found none.because the commission deaveraging method did not nullify the results of the three cost studies that the commission used in docket,a new cost study was not required.accordingly,we reject qwest first argument for overturning the commission order.
qwest next argues that the commission order violates federal law because the rates it sets are inaccurate and not.qwest relies almost exclusively on the following sentence in the fcc order on proposed rulemaking where costs differ,rate differences that accurately reflect those differences are not discriminatory.implementation of the local competition provisions in the telecommunications act of.the relevance of this sentence is not immediately apparent,for qwest does not contend that the rates violate the act provision.see d a ii providing that t he just and reasonable rate for network elements shall.instead,the crux of qwest argument is that the rates violate the act requirement that prices must be based on estimates of costs that are accurate.appellant br.at see d a i providing that t he just and reasonable rate for network elements shall on the cost determined without reference to a or other proceeding of providing the network element.on this view,inaccurate rates are,ipso facto,not.
qwest frames the issue as a pure question of law.specifically,qwest asserts that it is undisputed that the rates are at least inaccurate and are more likely inaccurate.reply br.at.according to qwest,these inaccuracies are an unavoidable consequence of the regression model use of household density to allocate costs between and areas.reply br.at.the question therefore becomes whether rates with that level of error meet the act requirement of accurate,rates.reply br.at.
we reject the premise that the rates suffer from an undisputed level of error.appellant br.at.qwest apparently defines error as any deviation from the estimates of true loop costs derived from its preferred cost study,the benchmark cost proxy model,or bcpm.reply br.at.but we see no reason to treat the bcpm as the gold standard the commission certainly was not required to do so.the real benchmark here is telric,and telric is a flexible standard.we will not proceed as if there is a single right answer when it comes to estimating loop costs.see mpower commc ns,at.thus,qwest assertion that the rates are at least percent inaccurate amounts to an exercise in semantics with little or no practical significance.
moreover,since qwest has failed to provide any objective criteria for evaluating the accuracy of the regression model or the rates that it produced,its second argument turns out to be an ipse dixit.the commission expert,david rosenbaum,testified that the regression model explained percent of the variation between household density and the natural logarithm of loop costs and percent of the variation between household density and loop cost estimates under the bcpm.qwest asserts that an error rate of more than percent is too high.but the fact that a regression model does not explain a certain amount of variation between two variables does not necessarily mean that the model is inaccurate in any legally meaningful sense.in this instance,the amount of unexplained variation in the relationship between household density and loop cost estimates,percent does not necessarily mean that the resulting rates deviate from telric,much less that the rates deviate from telric by at least percent.
qwest also points to testimony from its own expert,william fitzsimmons,who testified that the results obtained using the regression model deviate from loop cost estimates under the bcpm by percent.the commission found that qwest did not provide any alternative statistical criteria for evaluating whether or not the fit of the regression model was poor or the variation substantial.put differently,qwest expert failed to provide adequate context for the commission to assess the significance of his findings.as a result,the commission determined that the regression model was sufficiently accurate.
in our view,the dispositive question is whether the commission adoption of the deaveraging method proposed by its staff was arbitrary and capricious.accord mci worldcom commc ns,bellsouth telecommc ns,cir reviewing a state commission decision to adopt a certain method of geographically deaveraging rates under the arbitrary and capricious standard.the applicable fcc regulation is f,which provides that s tate commissions shall establish different rates for elements in at least three defined geographic areas within the state to reflect geographic cost differences.as the eleventh circuit has recognized,section does little to cabin the discretion of a state commission when devising a geographic deaveraging method.mci worldcom commc ns,at.
qwest has not shown that the commission deaveraging method violated the general requirements set out in section f and we are not convinced that the commission adoption of that method was arbitrary and capricious.on the contrary,rosenbaum testimony leaves little doubt that household density was the single most significant cost variable.qwest commc ns vap,wl,at.qwest has not proven that the rates are unreasonable,unsupported by substantial evidence,or otherwise inconsistent with the telric standard.see mpower commc ns,at.nor has qwest offered a viable alternative method of further deaveraging the existing rates.qwest koppendrayer,at upholding the commission adoption of a potentially flawed cost model,in part because the ilec failed to provide a satisfactory alternative.qwest conclusory assertion that the deaveraged rates are inaccurate and not is not enough to justify setting aside the commission order accordingly,we reject qwest second argument.
qwest third argument is that the commission order violates federal law because the rates it sets will undermine competition in nebraska.qwest variously describes competition as t he act ultimate objective,reply br.at,and,more modestly,as one of the act central purposes,appellant br.at.qwest asserts that the new leasing rate for loops in areas underestimates loop costs.the rate will discourage competition,the argument runs,because clecs would rather lease qwest loops at an artificially low price than invest in building a parallel network.reply br.at.qwest claims that the commission order creates the opposite problem in areas because it is simply uneconomic for clecs to compete at the rates.appellant br.at.
we will review this challenge under the arbitrary and capricious standard,keeping in mind that if the commission order contravenes federal policy then the order must give way see at t iowa utils,d.initially,we reject the proposition that promoting competition is the sine qua non of valid under the act.the supreme court has noted that the act authorizes clecs to pursue three strategies for competing in a local market 
first,a competitor entering the market may decide to engage in pure competition,that is,to build its own network to replace or supplement the network of the incumbent at the other end of the spectrum,the statute permits an entrant to skip construction and instead simply to buy and resell telecommunications service,which the incumbent has a duty to sell at wholesale between these extremes,an entering competitor may choose to lease certain of an incumbent network elements,which the incumbent has a duty to provide on an unbundled basis at terms that are just,reasonable,and nondiscriminatory.
verizon commc ns fcc,d citing and quoting a c.the act thus recognizes the practical difficulties of promoting competition,id.at,and allows for an entrant that may have to lease some unnecessarily expensive elements in conjunction with building its own elements to provide a telecommunications service to consumers,id.at.quoting id.at.breyer,concurring in part and dissenting in part.indeed,the fcc has acknowledged that entrants may need to share some facilities that are very expensive to duplicate say,loop elements in order to be able to compete in other,more sensibly duplicable elements say,digital switches or technology.id.at.emphasis added recounting the fcc position on competition.assuming,then,that the commission order will limit competition in areas,that result is not necessarily at odds with federal policy,for the act does not require clecs to construct parallel networks of loops if leasing the ilec existing loops would be equally or more efficient.
to the extent the act does embody a federal policy of promoting competition wherever possible,qwest has not proven that the commission order will not do so.qwest insists that the new rate for loops in areas will discourage competition because the rate underestimates loop costs here again,qwest compares the new rate for loops in areas to the rates for those loops under the model.as we have said,that comparison is invalid since the point of further deaveraging the exist
