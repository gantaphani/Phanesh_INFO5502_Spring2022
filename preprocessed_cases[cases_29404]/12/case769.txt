in these consolidated cases,we consider challenges to the federal communications commission ruling that local telephone companies unreasonably imposed certain charges on independent payphone providers from to.one set of petitioners,local telephone companies,argues that the commission had no basis for finding them liable.another set of petitioners,independent payphone providers,challenges the commission application of the communications act statute of limitations to limit their recovery to charges paid during the two years prior to the filing of their complaints.concluding that both decisions are consistent with law and neither arbitrary nor capricious,we affirm the commission in all respects.
this dispute between local telephone companies known as local exchange carriers or lecs and independent payphone providers ipps has a long pedigree in this court.two prior opinions describe the background in detail.see verizon.fcc,communications fcc.
the history begins in,when the commission issued access charge rules authorizing lecs to recover certain nontraffic sensitive costs such as the cost of installing phone lines through flat monthly charges called end user common line eucl charges.in re mts and wats market structure,third report and order,modified on,access charge recons,modified on further,aff in part and remanded in part sub nom.ass of regulatory util.comm rs fcc.under those rules,lecs could assess eucl charges only on end users,defined by the commission rules as any customer of telecommunications service or a person or entity that offers telecommunications services exclusively as a reseller if all resale transmissions originate on the premises of such reseller.m.
of particular significance to the issue we face here,the access charge rules applied differently to public and semipublic payphone service.the commission explained a pay telephone is used to provide public telephone service when a public need exists,such as at an airport lobby,at the option of the telephone company and with the agreement of the owner of the property on which the phone is placed.access charge,at emphasis added.by contrast,a pay telephone is used to provide semipublic telephone service when there is a combination of general public and specific customer need for the service,such as at a gasoline station or pizza parlor.id.at emphasis added.because end users of public payphones are the transient general public,rather than identifiable subscribers,the commission rules exempted public payphone service from eucl charges and instead allowed lecs to recover public payphone costs from long distance carriers.see id.at.payphone service,however,was subject to eucl charges because the lecs fixed costs could be recovered from an identifiable business end user through flat charges.id.at.
at the time the commission issued its access charge rules,all payphones were owned and operated by lecs.in,the commission allowed ipps to enter the market and compete with lec payphones.because the access charge rules were established at a time when only lecs provided payphone service,the rules said nothing about how eucl charges would apply to payphones.acting entirely on their own,however,the lecs began assessing eucl charges on all ipp payphones,both public and semipublic,as soon as ipps entered the market.the ipps objected,and in their trade association filed a petition with the commission challenging the lawfulness of the charges.also in,one ipp,communications corporation cfc,filed a complaint with the commission,arguing that its payphones should be exempt from eucl charges because it was not an end user and because it provided public payphone service.
denying cfc complaint,the commission ruled that the lecs had properly assessed eucl charges under the access charge rules.cfc,the commission explained,met the regulatory definition of end user because it was a reseller whose resale transmissions originate d on its premises.in re communications century of,quoting m internal quotation marks omitted.the commission also found that cfc payphones were not public telephones but rather payphones subject to eucl charges.see id.at.relying on that order,the commission denied complaints filed by several other ipps challenging the imposition of eucl charges.
in communications fcc,however,we reversed the commission cfc decision,concluding that the commission erred in determining that cfc was an end user within the meaning of its rules.at.we found the commission interpretation of the word premises,a real property term,to encompass ipp payphones,items of personal property,to be so far removed from any established definition of that word that it was plainly erroneous.id.at.we also found the commission decision not reasoned because by permitting eucl charges on but not public payphones even though both provided indistinguishable telephone service,the commission improperly discriminated between similarly situated phone services without a rational basis.id.at.
following our lead,the commission reversed itself on remand,concluding that the lecs had imposed an unreasonable charge in violation of agency regulations and b,which requires that charges for communications services be just and reasonable.see in re communications century of,cfc remand order.according to the commission,cfc and the other ipps could not be considered end users under the definition of that term because they owned the payphones but not the premises from which payphone calls were made.id.the commission went on to state,however,that irrespective of whether cfc was an end user,the primary determination the commission should have made was whether cfc payphones were public or.id.at.viewing the rules this way,the commission concluded that lecs had unreasonably imposed eucl charges on ipp public payphones.see id.at.
the lecs then petitioned for review,arguing that liability was unfounded because they had acted in reliance on the commission prior ruling approving the charges.observing that the commission decision was under unceasing challenge before progressively higher legal authorities until ultimately being overturned in communications,we upheld the commission.verizon,at.
in the meantime,following communications,ipps that had not participated in those proceedings filed some informal complaints with the commission seeking damages for the lecs imposition of eucl charges from the time ipps entered the payphone market until,when the commission revised its access charge rules to require the prospective application of eucl charges to both independent payphones and to payphones.communications,at emphasis omitted.thirteen of those complaints,filed in late and early,are the subject of this case.in their complaints,the ipps alleged that the lecs imposition of eucl charges violated section b because the ipps were not end users,irrespective of whether their payphones were public or.after bifurcating the proceedings and deferring the calculation of damages to a later phase,the commission issued the liability order now on review,granting the ipps complaints in part.see communications vending of citizens communications,order.for reasons explained further in each section below,the commission concluded that because the ipps were not end users under commission regulations,they were not subject to eucl charges for either their public or their payphones,and because the ipps cause of action accrued when they incurred eucl charges,the communications act statute of limitations barred them from recovering charges paid more than two years before they filed their complaints.see id.at.
both the lecs and the ipps now challenge the commission order.the lec petitioners dispute the finding of liability,while the ipp petitioners argue that the statute of limitations does not limit their recovery.each group of petitioners has intervened on behalf of the commission to oppose the other group petition,and additional ipps,whose complaints before the commission were stayed pending resolution of this proceeding,see id.at,have intervened in support of the ipp petitioners.we address the lecs arguments in part ii and the ipps in part iii.
the commission found that because the ipps were not end users within the meaning of its regulations,they were not within the scope of the eucl rule,and charges levied against of whether the payphones were public or unlawful.id.at.in so ruling,the commission rejected the lecs argument that because the ipps were acting as agents of the owners of the premises on which their payphones were located,eucl charges were reasonable.see id.at.the commission explained that as to public payphones,whether the ipps were acting as agents was irrelevant because under the access charge rules public premises owners were exempt from eucl charges.see id.at.in any event,as to both public and payphones,the commission concluded that the lecs ha d established no basis for imputing any liability of the premises owner to the ipps.id.at.according to the commission,neither the written agreements nor the circumstances of the payphone service arrangements detailed in the record subjected the ipps to the premises owners control.to the contrary,the commission found that the ipps paid the owners for the use of their space and,although the ipps needed authorization to install the payphones,they maintained the phones at their own discretion and in their own interests.
in reviewing the lecs challenges to the commission order,we follow familiar principles of administrative law,affirming the commission conclusions of law unless they are arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law,a,and accepting its findings of fact so long as they are supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole,see,fcc.we give controlling weight to the commission interpretation of its own regulations unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.capital network,fcc.
the lecs challenge the commission liability determination on two grounds.first,they argue that the commission erred in holding that because ipps were not end users they were exempt from eucl charges on their payphones.during the period at issue the fcc regulation establishing eucl charges stated that a charge shall be assessed upon end users that subscribe to local exchange service or coin telephone service.a.thus,as the commission explained,u nder the plain language of the rule only end users were subject to eucl charges.order,at.as mentioned above,section m defined end user as 
a ny customer of an interstate or foreign telecommunications service that is not a carrier except that a carrier other than a telephone company shall be deemed to be an end user when such carrier uses a telecommunications service for administrative purposes and a person or entity that offers telecommunications services exclusively as a reseller shall be deemed to be an end user if all resale transmissions offered by such reseller originate on the premises of such reseller.
m emphasis added.expressly following communications reasoning,which it had adopted in the cfc remand order,the commission again found that the ipps here,like cfc,were not end users under that definition because,although they were resellers of telecommunications services,they did not own the premises from which the payphone transmissions originated.see order,at.
we see nothing unreasonable in the commission analysis.indeed,largely ignoring the regulations language and the precedent on which the commission relied,the lecs essentially contend that the commission got it right in the cfc remand order,which concluded that lecs were liable only for eucl charges assessed on ipp public payphones.citing communications,they argue first that the commission erred by applying section m definition of end user to the assessment of eucl charges on ipp payphones,claiming it was adopted in a different context.lec pet rs br.at.in communications,however,we did not find the definition inapplicable to the ipp payphone context,but rather remanded the case so that the commission could correct its erroneous interpretation of section m definition with respect to ipp payphones.indeed,throughout the history of these proceedings,the petitioners,the commission,and this court have looked to that definition to evaluate the assessment of eucl charges on ipps,and the lecs offer no reason why it was unreasonable for the commission to continue to do so here.
the lecs next charge that the commission inadequately explained its change in position from the cfc remand order.we disagree.recognizing that making lec liability turn on ipp status deviated from its prior decision,the commission provided a thorough review of the relevant rules and precedents before conclud ing that its prior focus on the distinction,rather than the threshold end user determination,was incorrect.order,at.the commission explained that because of its focus on that distinction,it had previously determined that ipps were not end users but that it had never before addressed the ipps argument about the consequences of that determination in view of the fact that section made clear that eucl charges could be assessed on end users only.see id.at,explaining that a charge that may be levied only on end users may not be assessed upon entities that explicitly have been found not to be end users.this is more than sufficient to provide the reasoned explanation we require of an agency that changes its position.see amax land quarterman.
the lecs other arguments on this score rest on a misreading of the commission order.they claim that by holding that a premises owner that ordered payphone service from a lec was liable for the eucl charge while a premises owner ordering the same service from an ipp enjoyed an access charge exemption,the commission ignored the access charge policy of recovery of costs from an identifiable subscriber and create d precisely the type of unreasonable discrimination that prompted this court to grant the petition for review in communications.lec pet rs br.at.but as the commission points out,its order states only that the ipps were not subject to the eucl charges,and does not consider whether the identifiable end users,premises owners of semi public payphones would have been liable for eucl charges.resp ts br.at emphasis omitted.thus,the commission determination that ipps were not end users with respect to their payphones does not run counter to the access charge rules that authorized lecs to collect eucl charges from identifiable subscribers who qualified as end users of ipps payphones.indeed,given that lecs paid no eucl charges on their own payphones,but rather imposed them on premises owners receiving their payphone service,the commission order treats competing ipps in precisely the same way.therefore,unlike in communications,the commission revised interpretation of its rules does not treat similar payphone services differently.it was the lecs who chose to assess eucl charges on their ipp competitors rather than on those premises owners who may have qualified as identifiable end users.thus,any disparate treatment of payphone services stems from the lecs actions,not from the commission ruling.
for their second line of attack,the lecs contend that even if status is determinative,they properly assessed eucl charges on both public and payphone service because the ipps were serving as agents of the premises owners who,according to the lecs,were end users subject to eucl charges under the commission regulations,premises owners were customer s of telecommunications service,m,that subscribe d to local exchange telephone service.a.like the commission,however,we fail to see how the existence of any such agency relationship could matter for public payphone service.the commission determination that the lecs can not use an agency theory to avoid liability for eucl charges assessed on public payphones,order,at,emphasis omitted,follows directly from its regulations and controlling precedent.as the commission explained,its access charge rules,communications,and the cfc remand order all clearly established that end users of public payphones are exempt from the eucl charges,exemption that applies with equal force to ipp and payphones.under those rules and precedents,premises owners having ipps public payphones were not subject to eucl charges bec
