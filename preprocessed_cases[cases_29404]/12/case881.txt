background 
ericsson owns the patent,which is directed to an apparatus for supplying power to a telephone set in a telecommunications system.the patent discloses a subscriber line interface circuit slic,which acts as an interface between a telephone exchange and individual subscriber telephone sets.the claimed invention is designed to reduce the idling power that is dissipated by the amplifiers that transmit speech signals across the subscriber line.the device thus conserves power by switching between an active mode,during which the relatively large speech signal amplifiers supply power to the telephone set when it is in use,and a standby mode,during which the smaller auxiliary amplifiers supply power to the telephone set when it is not in use.according to claim,a loop sensing circuit detects whether the telephone receiver is in its lifted position or its cradled position.the loop sensing circuit then sends a corresponding signal to a control circuit,which in turn sends a control signal to both the speech signal amplifiers and the auxiliary amplifiers.when the loop sensing circuit determines that the telephone receiver is in its position,the control signal enables the speech signal amplifiers and disables the auxiliary amplifiers.patent,ll.conversely,when the loop sensing circuit determines that the telephone receiver is in its position,the control signal disables the speech signals sic amplifiers and enables the auxiliary amplifiers so that the speech signal amplifiers,which require power,only supply power to the telephone set when the receiver is off its cradle and a call can be made.id.at,ll.emphasis added.claim depends from claim.
harris manufactures and sells three accused devices the slic,the slic,and the slic.each of the accused devices has a standby mode.
in november,ericsson filed suit against harris for infringement of claims and of the patent.during the claim construction phase of litigation,both parties agreed that the claim language requiring that the speech signal amplifiers only supply power to the telephone set when the receiver is off its cradle and a call can be made,id.at,ll.the only supply power limitation,should be given its ordinary meaning.jmol order,slip op.at,wl.after a trial,a jury found that harris three accused devices did not literally infringe the patent but did infringe claims and under the doctrine of equivalents.id.at,wl.the jury awarded ericsson damages in the amount of million for lost profits due to lost sales for lost profits due to price erosion and as a reasonable royalty.
the district court,however,granted harris motion for jmol of noninfringement.after reviewing the testimony of several witnesses,the court found that the uncontroverted evidence showed that the speech signal amplifiers in the accused devices supply some power to the telephone set in the position.id.at,wl.in particular,the court cited the testimony of several of harris witnesses,who testified that the speech signal amplifiers in the accused devices have three transistors the qra transistors that always supply a small amount of power to the subscriber line in order to prevent corrosion and also supply power to enable functions such as.id.at,wl.in addition,the court found that ericsson expert witness,thomas rhyne,acknowledged that the accused devices supply power to the telephone set in the position,testifying only that the power supplied to prevent corrosion is an insubstantial amount and that any power supplied for transmission would be present for only a few seconds at a time.id.at,wl.however,because claim requires that the speech signal amplifiers only supply power to the telephone set in the position,the court concluded that a determination that the scope of equivalence included the accused devices would vitiate the only supply power limitation.id.at,wl.the court accordingly found no infringement as a matter of law and granted harris motion for jmol of noninfringement.id.the court then dismissed the case with prejudice and summarily denied harris motion for jmol relating to the amount of the damages award.final judgment,slip op.at.

infringement 
on appeal,ericsson argues that the district court erred in granting harris motion for jmol of noninfringement.ericsson first contends that the jury reasonably could have found that the only supply power limitation was met literally and that some other limitation was met equivalently in light of the substantial evidence that it presented to show that the speech signal amplifiers in the accused devices do not supply power to the telephone set when the receiver is in the position.ericsson also asserts that the court erred in holding that the only supply power limitation is entitled to no scope of equivalence,arguing instead that it is a temporal or range limitation and is not vitiated by a slic that is in standby mode of the time.in addition,ericsson maintains that it offered substantial evidence of equivalence by showing that both and the corrosion current present only insubstantial differences from the claimed invention.finally,ericsson argues that the fact that the accused devices can optionally be used for does not negate infringement.
harris responds that the district court did not err in entering jmol of noninfringement.harris first argues that ericsson failed to provide substantial evidence that the accused devices literally satisfy the only supply power limitation.harris also contends that the court correctly construed the only supply power limitation to exclude the accused devices because a contrary finding would vitiate that limitation.according to harris,the speech signal amplifiers in the accused devices always supply power to the phone when it is,both through the qra transistors and when engaging in transmission for.
we agree with ericsson that the district court erred in granting harris motion for jmol of noninfringement.as discussed above,claim of the patent requires that the speech signal amplifiers,which require power,only supply power to the telephone set when the receiver is off its cradle and a call can be made.patent,ll.emphasis added.focusing on the word only,the district court held that there could be no infringement under the doctrine of equivalents because there was uncontroverted evidence that the speech signal amplifiers in the accused devices supply some power to the telephone set in the position.jmol order,slip op.at,wl.we agree that the only supply power limitation would indeed be vitiated by an accused device whose speech signal amplifiers always supply power to the telephone set when the receiver is.see moore,standard register,holding that a minority can not be equivalent to a majority,its very antithesis.however,for the reasons set forth below,we disagree with the factual premise that the speech signal amplifiers in the harris devices necessarily behave in that manner.instead,we conclude that substantial evidence supports the jury finding that the accused devices infringe the patent under the doctrine of equivalents and that that finding does not vitiate the only supply power limitation 
to begin with,ericsson presented substantial evidence to show that the power supplied by the qra transistors in the accused devices does not vitiate the only supply power limitation.the only supply power limitation refers only to power supplied by the speech signal amplifiers.although harris argued that the qra transistors in the accused devices are part of the speech signal amplification circuitry,ericsson argued that they are instead part of the control circuitry,which merely switches the speech signal amplifiers on and off.to support its position,ericsson presented the following evidence at trial expert testimony stating that the qra transistors are part of the control circuitry that enables and disables the speech signal amplifiers a harris engineer notes labeling the disputed transistors as shutoff transistors,and harris data sheets describing the speech signal amplifiers as disabled and powered down in the standby power state.we conclude that that evidence was sufficient to support a reasonable jury finding that any power supplied by the qra transistors in the accused devices is not supplied by the speech signal amplifiers and therefore does not vitiate the only supply power limitation.
nor does the fact that the accused devices could be used in conjunction with functions such as vitiate the only supply power limitation.ericsson points to evidence,which harris does not dispute,to show that the accused devices switch into active mode when the phone is for just four seconds during the function.that brief change of mode occurs only when a subscriber who has enabled the function receives a call,and according to ericsson expert,amounts to less than of the time.such a trivial difference does not vitiate the only supply power limitation because,even under the scenario,the speech signal amplifiers in the accused devices are very close to only supplying power to the telephone set when the receiver is in the position.thus,the jury reasonably could have found that,even when used with,the accused devices are insubstantially different from the claimed invention and consequently infringe under the doctrine of equivalents 
despite the dissent contrary view,festo is not a part of this case because prosecution history estoppel,even if applicable,would not have precluded the jury verdict of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents.the jury might still have found that claim was infringed equivalently,even while finding that the amended limitations,of concern to the dissent,were met literally.under the theory that we attribute to the jury,the qra transistors are not part of the speech signal amplifiers and the accused speech signal amplifiers are thus literally disabled when the telephone receiver is.the only equivalence issue thus concerns when the speech signal amplifiers supply power,not whether they are enabled or disabled as opposed to actively connected or effectively disconnected,which was the subject of the amendment.in other words,the equivalence question relates to whether the speech signal amplifiers only supply power to the telephone set when the receiver is.that limitation was never amended and therefore can not be subject to the festo presumption.the district court even agreed that festo was inapplicable when it granted jmol of noninfringement on the basis of the all limitations rule,and not prosecution history estoppel,as the dissent states.in fact,the district court never even mentioned the amendments to the enabled and disabled limitations,but specifically noted that the disputed limitation was not amended during prosecution.jmol order,slip op.at,wl 
we therefore conclude that the district court erred in determining that a finding of infringement would vitiate the only supply power limitation.moreover,we conclude that substantial evidence supports the jury verdict of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents.accordingly,we reverse the district court grant of jmol of noninfringement.
having reversed the jmol of noninfringement,we turn next to the issue of damages.harris conditionally from the court denial of its motion for jmol relating to the amount of the damages award for lost profits due to lost sales and price erosion.harris does not,however,contest the jury award of as a reasonable royalty.
jurisdiction 
as a preliminary matter,ericsson challenges the propriety of harris.citing bailey dart container,order,ericsson argues that harris should be dismissed because harris does not seek to expand its rights under the district court judgment.ericsson is mistaken.a is appropriate when a party seeks to enlarge its own rights under the judgment or to lessen the rights of its adversary under the judgment.id.at.in other words,a party may file a when acceptance of the argument it wishes to advance would result in a reversal or modification of the judgment rather than an affirmance.id.that is precisely the situation before us harris requests that we reverse the district court denial of its motion for jmol and reduce the amount of the damages award entered against it.harris thus seeks to lessen ericsson rights under the district court judgment by reducing ericsson monetary recovery.harris,although conditional,is therefore properly before us.
lost profits due to lost sales 
on the merits of the,harris objects to the jury award of million for lost profits due to lost sales.first,harris argues that ericsson failed to provide sound economic proof of its market definitions and market share estimates.harris contends that ericsson damages expert,an accountant named daniel jackson,improperly based his definition of the harris market on one witness testimony,rather than on market research and recognized economic principles such as the of demand between the infringing product and available substitutes.with respect to the narrower ericsson market,harris maintains that jackson again failed to calculate the of demand,improperly assumed that switching costs were so high as to prevent customers from purchasing slics that were not with their existing line cards,and ignored that the slic industry is characterized by.second,harris argues that jackson arbitrarily allocated harris sales between the harris market and the ericsson market,neglecting to consider that many of ericsson customers purchased from harris as a second source to ericsson and that customers might redesign their line cards.finally,harris asserts that ericsson failed to establish the but for causation necessary to recover damages for lost profits because jackson analysis failed to take into account available standby slics that were noninfringing substitutes for those covered by the patent.
ericsson responds that jackson used an approved methodology for determining lost profits,that set forth in panduit stahlin.fibre works,cir,and that his expert opinions were independently supported by testimonial and documentary evidence.first,ericsson argues that jackson appropriately segmented the market to reflect differing barriers to entry depending on whether a customer had already a harris slic or an ericsson slic.ericsson defends jackson harris market definition and his market share figures as supported by the estimate of a harris employee.similarly,ericsson argues that jackson ericsson market definition and his corresponding market share calculations were supported by actual sales records and evidence relating to the costs associated with redesigning a line card.ericsson also maintains that a lost profits analysis need not include calculations.second,ericsson argues that it proved causation of lost profits.ericsson adverts to internal harris emails,customer testimony,harris marketing materials,and harris sales of infringing products as evidence of customer demand for the patented standby feature.ericsson further argues that jackson accounted for noninfringing substitutes in his analysis of the harris market but that noninfringing substitutes were necessarily excluded from the ericsson market because that market segment consisted only of slics that were and replacements of the ericsson slic.
we agree with ericsson that substantial evidence supports the jury damages award for lost profits due to lost sales.to recover lost profits,a patent owner must prove a causal relation between the infringement and its loss of profits.bic leisure,windsurfing int l.more specifically,the patentee must show a reasonable probability that but for the infringing activity,the patentee would have made the infringer sales.crystal semiconductor tritech microelecs.int l.to show but for causation,the patentee must reconstruct the market to determine what profits the patentee would have made had the market developed absent the infringing product.grain processing am.such market reconstruction must be supported by sound economic proof of the nature of the market and likely outcomes with infringement factored out of the economic picture.id.
we have affirmed lost profits awards based on a wide variety of reconstruction theories in which the patentee has presented reliable economic evidence of but for causation.crystal semiconductor,at.we believe that ericsson has done just that.ericsson presented its damages theory at trial through jackson expert testimony.jackson reconstructed the but for market by segmenting the market and determining ericsson lost profits based on its market share,a method that has met with this court approval on previous occasions.see,id.at state.specifically,jackson identified two markets the harris market and the ericsson market.jackson defined the harris market as consisting of sales to customers that had not previously an ericsson slic.jackson identified ericsson,amd,and others as the competitors in that market and,based on documents and the testimony of various witnesses,estimated that ericsson would have had a market share in the harris market.jackson defined the narrower ericsson market as consisting of only those slics that were compatible with a customer existing line card.jackson identified ericsson and amd as the only competitors in that market and,based on actual sales records and the switching costs that a customer would incur to redesign a line card,estimated that ericsson would have had a market share in the ericsson market.jackson then allocated harris infringing sales in the reconstructed market as follows to the harris market and to the ericsson market.finally,jackson calculated ericsson lost profits due to harris infringement to be million.
based on our careful review of the record,we conclude that ericsson market definitions and allocations were supported by substantial and economically sound evidence.we also conclude that ericsson market share analysis adequately compensated for the effects that any noninfringing substitutes would have had on ericsson lost profits.see bic leisure,at stating that a patentee may rely on proof of market share in lieu of proof of noninfringing substitutes in a lost profits analysis state,at same.moreover,we point out that ericsson failure to present all of the economic evidence that harris now identifies does not mean that ericsson failed to present sound economic evidence.harris was entitled to present its own damages theory regarding,for example,how calculations and would have affected the but for market.it was ultimately up to the jury,however,to weigh the credibility of the parties opposing theories and evidence.see micro,at.we will not overturn a jury determination as to the amount of a damages award when,as in this case,that verdict was supported by substantial evidence.
lost profits due to price erosion 
harris also challenges the jury award of for lost profits due to price erosion,arguing that ericsson failed to provide sound economic proof for those damages.in particular,harris contends that jackson improperly concluded that both the harris market and the ericsson market were totally inelastic and that he failed to consider that ericsson would have lost sales in response to an elevated price.harris also asserts that jackson relied on a flawed benchmark,the obsolete ericsson slic,in his price erosion calculation.
ericsson responds that an elasticity calculation is not required to recover for price erosion when the patent owner instead establishes barriers to entry.ericsson points out that it presented evidence of two barriers to entry the patent and the costs associated with redesigning a line card,the latter of which prevented customers from switching to other manufacturers slics that were not.in any event,ericsson argues,any issues with elasticity were presumably resolved by the jury when it awarded ericsson in damages for price erosion instead of the requested million.finally,ericsson maintains that the ericsson slic was an ideal benchmark for the price erosion calculation because it experienced the same market conditions as the ericsson slic,except that there was no harris clone of the slic.
we agree with ericsson that substantial evidence supports the jury damages award for lost profits attributable to price erosion.to recover lost profits on a theory of price erosion,a patentee must show that but for infringement,it would have sold its product at a higher price.see bic leisure,at.the patentee must also present evidence of the presumably reduced amount of product the patentee would have sold at the higher price.crystal semiconductor,at.moreover,the patentee price erosion theory must account for the nature,or definition,of the market,similarities between any benchmark market and the market in which price erosion is alleged,and the effect of the hypothetically increased price on the likely number of sales at that price in the market.id.
to make out its theory of price erosion,ericsson again relied on the expert testimony of jackson,who used a benchmark methodology to assess price erosion.jackson compared the performance of the patented product,the ericsson slic,in the market affected by infringement with that of a similar product,the ericsson slic,in a market free of infringement.he ultimately determined that ericsson was entitled to million in damages for price erosion.
despite harris contention,we can not say that ericsson theory of an inelastic market precludes it from recovering price erosion damages.in crystal semiconductor tritech microelectronics international,we stated that a patentee must produce credible economic evidence to show the decrease in sales,if any,that would have occurred at the higher hypothetical price.id.at emphasis added.ericsson addressed that point at trial in its price erosion analysis,submitting that the unique market conditions in this case would not have resulted in decreased sales at an increased price.namely,ericsson presented evidence of the high switching costs associated with redesigning a line card,the relatively low costs of slics,and jackson expert opinion that those two conditions would produce an inelastic market.although we have recognized that an inelastic market may be rare,it was for the jury to determine whether this was such a case based on the evidence before it.
moreover,harris has not shown that the slic was an inappropriate benchmark for the slic.on the contrary,ericsson offered substantial evidence of the similarities
