this appeal is an outgrowth of two federal corruption cases involving city officials in providence,rhode island.one set of glancy tax officials joseph pannone,david ead,and rosemary glancy.see in re special proceedings,d.the second corrente named pannone in addition to frank corrente,who was providence mayor vincent cianci,administrative director a superseding indictment handed down in the corrente case on april,added the mayor and three other defendants.id.
on august,while corrente was awaiting trial and the grand jury investigation of other,later named defendants was continuing,the district court entered a protective order prohibiting counsel in the corrente case from disclosing the contents of audio and video surveillance tapes that had been made by law enforcement officials and furnished to defense counsel during discovery.the aim was to safeguard the grand jury investigation of cianci and to avoid pretrial publicity that could prejudice the defendants right to a fair trial.in re special proceedings,d at.
the order,assented to by both sides,read 
upon motion of the government,and with the consent of all parties,and for good cause having been shown,it is hereby ordered that the consensual audio and video recordings recordings discoverable in the matter shall be subject to the following protective order.counsel are hereby ordered not to disclose the contents of said recordings to any persons other than the defendant or those deemed essential by counsel for the preparation of their client defense,or in the case of the government,in the preparation for trial or as part of any continuing investigation.all motions or other filings which cite any portion of the recordings other than by reference shall be filed under seal until further order of this court.nothing in this order shall prevent any party from moving for relief from this order for good cause shown.
the order was entered by judge lagueux.on april,just after the handing down of the superseding indictment,the case was transferred to chief judge torres.
on february,while the grand jury investigation of cianci was still in progress,james taricani,an investigative television reporter,and his employer wjar channel,a providence television station owned and operated by nbc,aired one of the videotapes.in re special proceedings,d at.the tape in question showed a government witness handing corrente an envelope that allegedly contained a cash bribe for corrente cianci.id.at.who leaked the tape was not disclosed taricani said he had given the source a pledge of confidentiality.
defendants then asked the district court to investigate whether any participant in the case had violated the protective order by leaking the tape to taricani and,if so,to impose appropriate sanctions.on may,the district court issued an order stating in part 
the release disclosure of the contents of the aforesaid videotape is a serious matter.such acts,if continued,could threaten the rights of all parties to a fair trial.in addition,the release disclosure appear to have violated both the confidentiality of grand jury proceedings and the august,protective order.if so,such release disclosure may constitute criminal contempt.see.e.
the order continued by explaining that such a matter would ordinarily be referred to the department of justice for investigation but because government prosecutors were involved in the pending case against corrente and others,the court decided to appoint marc desisto,a private attorney who had formerly been a prosecutor,to act as special prosecutor to investigate the disclosure and to prosecute for criminal contempt anyone against whom adequate evidence was uncovered.
after interviewing approximately fourteen individuals and deposing several,and h aving exhausted what he believed to be all other means of obtaining the information necessary to conclude his investigation,desisto sought and received the issuance of a subpoena by the court requiring taricani to appear for a deposition.in re special proceedings,d at.at the deposition,taricani refused to answer any questions regarding the identity of the person from whom he had received the tape,asserting a newsman privilege not to reveal confidential sources.id.at.desisto then filed a motion to compel,which the district court granted after a hearing on october.id.at.
following an abortive appeal from the order compelling testimony,which this court dismissed as premature,taricani appeared at a february,deposition.again he refused to answer questions about his source for the tape.after a hearing,the district court on march,found taricani in civil contempt,gave him until noon the following day to purge himself of the contempt order by answering the questions posed by the special prosecutor,and ordered him to pay a sum of a day for each day thereafter until he complied.
taricani then sought review,and a stay,of the civil contempt order.we granted a stay of the order pending expedited review our stay order expressed doubts about taricani prospects in light of branzburg hayes,d,but said that the claimed threat to first amendment interests justified a stay,given our expedition of the appeal and the lack of demonstrable harm from a brief further delay in the investigation.
on appeal,taricani first argues that because the district court failed to ask the government to pursue the criminal proceeding,the appointment of the special prosecutor violated.a,the supreme court decision that prompted it,young united states ex rel.vuitton et fils,d,and separation of powers principles said to underlie the young decision.
young overturned a lower court decision appointing a special prosecutor to pursue a contempt proceeding.young,at.however,the young decision also said that the rationale for a court to appoint its own prosecutor was necessity and therefore a court ordinarily should first request the government to prosecute contempt actions,and should appoint a private prosecutor only if that request is denied.id.at.rule was amended in to reflect the holding in young,advisory committee note by adding the following language 
appointing a prosecutor.the court must request that the contempt be prosecuted by an attorney for the government,unless the interest of justice requires the appointment of another attorney.if the government declines the request,the court must appoint another attorney to prosecute the contempt.
taricani,of course,has been held in civil criminal contempt governed by rule the civil contempt arose out of the investigation by,and at the request of,desisto who was appointed to conduct a criminal contempt investigation governed by rule and young.taricani view is that the supposed rule violation is so fundamental that it undermines the district court authority to compel by civil contempt answers to questions propounded by such a prosecutor in a criminal proceeding even if the court wants them answered.
some case law suggests that taricani may not be entitled to resist a court otherwise lawful order to answer by pointing to some antecedent defect in the proceedings.see united states catholic conference abortion rights mobilization,d blair united states.and,despite taricani claim to the contrary,no defect in the special prosecutor commission affects the subject matter jurisdiction of the district court over a proceeding to detect and punish violations of its orders.
nevertheless,taricani has a direct and immediate interest in whether he is held in civil contempt and the alleged flaw could be judicially redressed,so a case or controversy exists within the meaning of article iii.see steel citizens for a better environment,d mangual,cir.whether taricani can contest the prosecutor authority is primarily a matter of prudential standing article iii,secretary of state of joseph munson,d,and desisto authority vel non should be resolved.
young says that the government should ordinarily be asked to handle contempt prosecutions rule a,which the supreme court approved as a gloss on young,says that it must be asked to do so unless the interest of justice requires the appointment of another attorney.a.so the district court was entitled to appoint desisto without asking the go
