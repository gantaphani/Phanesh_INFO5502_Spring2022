jamie sanders,denise coffey,and karie brooks appeal the district court entry of summary judgment in favor of southwestern bell telephone,swbt on their claims of age and sex discrimination.they also appeal the court dismissal of southwestern bell communications sbc for improper service.we have jurisdiction under,and we affirm in part and reverse in part.
background 
swbt experienced a significant loss in customers after september.as a result,swbt oklahoma construction and engineering c e organization underwent three separate reductions in force rifs of managers.the rifs were conducted in the fall of,spring of,and fall of.the plaintiffs survived the first two rifs but not the third,which is the only rif at issue in this appeal.
dan mcneely headed the oklahoma c e organization during the fall rif.managers in the oklahoma c e organization reported to their area managers,who in turn reported to mcneely.in the fall of,swbt determined that the oklahoma c e organization had managers and one area manager more than business needs required.the plaintiffs do not dispute the business necessity of the resulting rif.
swbt management staffing guidelines msg set forth procedures for conducting rifs.as part of the fall rif,and in accordance with the msg,all managers in the oklahoma c e organization were first grouped by job title and work location.mcneely,with input from the area managers,then determined the geographic areas where a smaller number of managers could handle the existing workload.the groups with surplus workers,or affected work groups,included in the oklahoma area,in the oklahoma area,and in the enid area.
to determine which managers would be selected for the rif,and consistent with the msg,managers in each affected work group were placed into one of four bands bands a,b,c,and on their most recent performance evaluations.band a was the highest band d was the lowest.no manager within any affected work group,however,fell into band 
next,five area managers ranked all band c managers in each affected work group against one another.those managers who ranked lower than the number of managers designated for retention in the affected work group were considered to be at risk for a layoff,or surplus.the manager,however,could be saved from being laid off if a manager in her affected work group either voluntarily quit or accepted a job in a work group,or a different organization within the company.
as a in the oklahoma area,sanders fell into an affected work group.she was placed into band c based on her performance evaluation.sixteen other people in this affected work group were also placed into band c.the five area managers ranked sanders fifth from the bottom.because only four managers were designated as surplus,sanders was not considered to be at risk at that time.later,however,and pursuant to the msg,one area manager accepted a voluntary demotion to.this demotion necessitated the layoff of an additional manager from this affected work group,which caused sanders to be at risk for surplus 
coffey position was in the affected work group consisting of in the oklahoma area.her most recent performance evaluation placed her in band c.the area managers ranked coffey last out of the six people in band c,which put her at risk of being surplussed 
brooks was one of two people in the affected work group consisting of in the enid area.she was placed in band c the other manager,a younger man,was placed in band because it had previously been determined that one person in this work group would be laid off,brooks was considered at risk.
on november,sanders and brooks met individually with their supervisor,area manager rick wooten.coffey met with her supervisor,area manager mike harris.the supervisors informed the plaintiffs that their positions were being eliminated or consolidated with another position,and gave them the option of either terminating their employment immediately or staying on for thirty days to apply for other positions within the company.according to sanders,wooten told her during this meeting that she was being surplussed because of her age.
sanders ultimately accepted another position with swbt in plano,texas.coffey and brooks were unable to locate another position and were laid off in december.sanders was years old,coffey was,and brooks was.
the plaintiffs filed suit against swbt and sbc,alleging that they were surplussed because of their age in violation of the age discrimination in employment act adea,and because of their sex in violation of title vii of the civil rights act,et.after discovery,swbt and sbc moved for summary judgment.before ruling on the motion,the district court sua sponte dismissed sbc for insufficient service of process.the court then granted summary judgment in favor of swbt,reasoning that the plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate that swbt nondiscriminatory justification for their layoffs was pretextual.the plaintiffs appeal the order of summary judgment and the dismissal of sbc 
ii.summary judgment 
standard of review 
we review summary judgment decisions de novo,applying the same legal standard as the district court.simms ex rel.dep t of mental health substance abuse,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.when applying this standard,we view the evidence and draw reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.simms,at.
proof of discrimination 
a plaintiff alleging discrimination may prove her case by direct or circumstantial evidence.see stone autoliv asp,cir.direct evidence is evidence from which the trier of fact may conclude,without inference,that the employment action was undertaken because of the employee protected status.see riggs airtran airways,cir direct evidence is evidence,which if believed,proves the existence of a fact in issue without inference or presumption.quotations omitted.for example,we have stated that an employer policy,discriminatory on its face,is direct evidence of discrimination.see ramsey city and county of denver,cir.
usually,however,a plaintiff will not have direct evidence of discrimination and will establish her claims through circumstantial evidence.in that instance,we analyze the plaintiff claims under the mcdonnell douglas framework to determine whether the defendant is entitled to summary judgment.see mcdonnell douglas green,d adamson multi community diversified,cir applying mcdonnell douglas to discrimination claims brought pursuant to the adea and title vii.under the mcdonnell douglas analysis,a plaintiff bears the initial burden of setting forth a prima facie case of discrimination.sanchez denver pub,cir.after the plaintiff makes a prima facie case,the burden shifts to the employer to give a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for its employment decision.see morgan hilti,cir.if the employer comes forward with a nondiscriminatory reason for its actions,the burden then reverts to the plaintiff to show that there is a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether the employer proffered reason for the challenged action is,unworthy of belief.id.quotations omitted.a plaintiff who demonstrates pretext gets over the hurdle of summary judgment.id.
sanders has produced direct evidence that she was surplussed because of her age.she testified that wooten,who had been part of the team responsible for ranking her fifth from the bottom among band c managers in her affected work group,told her that her her job the cause of her surplus.
it is undisputed that when wooten informed sanders that her job was being eliminated,he provided her with a document that listed,by job title and age,the number of employees selected for layoff and the number who were being retained.this information is required to be given to employees by the older workers benefit protection act,which is part of the adea.according to sanders,however,and contrary to the purpose of the adea paperwork,wooten pointed to the document,explained that she was being surplussed because of her age,and stated that this was necessary to prevent age discrimination.
although swbt has put forth evidence that calls sanders recollection of events into question,it is not our province at the summary judgment stage to weigh the evidence or make credibility determinations.utah ministry found.for apologetic info,cir.if the jury believes sanders testimony,it could,without the aid of any favorable the reason for her surplus was her age.accordingly,swbt is not entitled to summary judgment on sanders claim 
the plaintiffs remaining claims are supported by circumstantial evidence and therefore must be analyzed under mcdonnell douglas.as to these claims,we agree with the district court that the plaintiffs have established prima facie cases of both sex discrimination and age discrimination we also agree with the district court that swbt has articulated a legitimate,reason for the plaintiffs surplus the rif.the central issue in this appeal,then,is whether the plaintiffs have provided evidence of pretext.we conclude they have not.
generally,a plaintiff demonstrates pretext by producing evidence of such weaknesses,implausibilities,inconsistencies,incoherencies,or contradictions in the employer proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable factfinder could rationally find them unworthy of credence and hence infer that the employer did not act for the asserted reasons.jaramillo.judicial dep t,cir quotations omitted.when the employer proffered reason for its action is a rif,evidence tending to show that the rif is merely a pretext for the plaintiff surplus may take several forms.first,the evidence may demonstrate that the plaintiff surplus is inconsistent with the rif criteria articulated by her employer.see beaird seagate,cir see also sanchez philip morris,cir it is conceivable that a plaintiff could be so overwhelmingly better qualified than another applicant that on this evidence alone a trial court could properly find pretext beaird,at citing sanchez for the proposition that t here may be circumstances in which a claimed business judgment is so idiosyncratic or questionable that a factfinder could reasonably find that it is pretext for illegal discrimination.relatedly,evidence showing that the employer inconsistently applied its rif criteria may also support a finding that the plaintiff was terminated for discriminatory reasons.see beaird,at.other procedural irregularities in the rif process may similarly evince unlawful discrimination.see whittington nordam group,cir.this,of course,is not an exhaustive list of the types of evidence that may support a finding of pretext,and we do not limit a plaintiff to any particular method of proof.rather,when assessing whether a plaintiff has demonstrated pretext such that a jury could conclude that discrimination was the true reason for the adverse employment action,we consider the evidence as a whole.see danville reg l lab,cir.
we understand the plaintiffs in this individually or argue that the rif was only a pretext for unlawful discrimination because their qualifications did not warrant their placement in band c swbt inconsistently applied its ranking criteria an area manager was permitted to take a voluntary demotion that resulted in sanders job loss and women and older employees were disproportionately affected by the rif.
band placement 
sanders and brooks contend that swbt was not justified in placing them in band c based on their performance and qualifications relative to employees who were placed in higher bands.it is undisputed,however,that swbt determined band placement based on an employee most recent performance evaluation that a notation on the performance evaluation from the employee manager stating that the manager concur s with the employee accomplishments as written or the achievements as documented was viewed by the area managers as demonstrating average performance warranting placement in band c and that the performance evaluations of sanders and brooks contained this notation.unlike the evaluations of managers who were placed in band a or band b,neither of these plaintiffs evaluations included comments from their supervisors indicating their performance was superior or above average as compared to peers.to the extent these plaintiffs contend that they are more qualified or for other reasons should have been placed in a higher band,we have held that i t is the manager perception of the employee performance that is relevant,not plaintiff subjective evaluation of his own relative performance,furr seagate,cir,and that a plaintiff can not defeat summary judgment by claiming that she would have been retained if different rif criteria had been used.beaird,at.thus,the plaintiffs claims on this point are not sufficient to demonstrate pretext.
because this is brooks only argument on pretext,we affirm the district court entry of summary judgment on both her age and sex discrimination claims.further,because coffey was the youngest person in the construction group band c,and because there is no evidence that her band placement was determined by her age,we affirm the district court entry of summary judgment on her age discrimination claim thus,the only remaining claims are sanders and coffey sex discrimination claims.
inconsistent application of rif criteria 
sanders argues that the area managers did not consider rif criteria uniformly when they were determining employees rankings within band c of her affected work group.we have stated that the selective use of rif evaluate some employees potential but not others,for example constitutes limited evidence of pretext.beaird,at.the record,however,does not support sanders assertion.
swbt policy,as articulated by the msg,is to rank employees subject to the rif in this case,those falling into band c according to their performance,skills,experience,and training.in addition,mcneely circulated a guide to his area managers that listed subsets of the msg categories.for skills,the guide listed management skills,technical skills,supervisory skills,effectiveness with others,ability to handle a broader scope,and promotional possibility.id.mcneely also stated in his affidavit that the skills category included consideration of skills above and beyond those required for the job.similarly,area manager mike harris testified that skills would be the things that you had that made you capable of doing your job,including any that you might have.as to the msg other two ranking categories,mcneely memo stated that the experience category encompasses ncs and equivalent work experience.the training category includes formal company training and formal technical or trade school.
on september,the area managers held a meeting and ranked all of the band c employees in affected work groups.their ranking decisions were unanimous.because there is no contemporaneous document detailing the reasons for each employee particular ranking,of the area managers who participated in the ranking an affidavit in this case that explained why each employee was ranked higher or lower than sanders.
for example,the employee in band c in sanders affected work group had been in his engineering position longer than sanders,and his skill level was considered to be greater than sanders.the employee had construction experience and was considered to be more versatile than sanders.the employee had been promoted from his cable splicing technician job.even though he had not been an engineer as long as sanders,he was able to learn his job very quickly due to his outside technical background.his skills were considered to be greater than sanders.these explanations are consistent with swbt rif policy,as outlined in both the msg and the guide provided by mcneely.
sanders appears to argue,however,that swbt did not apply its rif criteria consistently and uniformly across all of its employees.as evidence,she points out that she had been in an engineering position for more time than at least one person ranked ahead of her in band c.she thus concludes that swbt did not consider her tenure when ranking her against that employee.
there is,however,no evidence to suggest that swbt failed to consider her tenure.according to wooten affidavit,she was ranked lower than the other employee because he had an outside construction background and prior supervisory experience his outside construction background enabled him to independently complete jobs.sanders was not as autonomous.although sanders may have been in an engineering position longer than the other employee,an employee tenure as an engineer was only one of many possible ranking criteria in the msg categories of performance,skills,experience,and training.
we therefore do not agree with sanders position.the descriptors used in wooten affidavit are entirely consistent with the criteria set forth in mcneely ranking instructions.this fact distinguishes the present case from beaird because swbt ranking method did not deviate from its stated policy.see beaird,at.
moreover,wooten affidavit is not evidence that swbt inconsistently applied the rif criteria.his affidavit purpose is merely to illustrate why a specific employee was ranked higher than sanders,not to provide a comprehensive list of all the ranking criteria assessed by swbt area managers.that the affidavit is selective in its detail is no indication that the rif was similarly selective.again,this fact distinguishes this case from beaird.see id.explaining that selective use of rif criteria in identifying employees to be laid off is evidence of pretext.
voluntary demotion of an area manager 
sanders also takes issue with the voluntary demotion of rick griffith from an area manager to a.we do not consider this to be evidence of pretext.
the area managers,including griffith,knew that swbt would be retaining only thirteen of the seventeen band c in the oklahoma area.at the area managers ranking meeting in september,the managers unanimously ranked sanders thirteenth.thus,at that time,she was considered safe from the rif.after the ranking meeting,swbt enacted a policy whereby an area manager who is subject to a rif may take a voluntary demotion to an engineer position rather than risk being laid off.also at this time,the area managers who had ranked the engineers knew that one of them the area managers would be laid off pursuant to the fall rif.as the most junior area manager,griffith considered himself to be the most likely candidate to lose his job,so he volunteered to be demoted to a.this demotion necessitated the surplus of an additional engineer from the group.sanders,as the ranked engineer,was selected to be surplussed.
although sanders contends that griffith basically was able to pick who was going to be surplussed as a result of his stepping down,we find nothing about his decision or the enactment of the policy itself that is indicative of pretext.because the policy was not enacted until after the ranking meeting,at the time griffith ranked sanders he thought she would be retained.further,there is no evidence that suggests griffith took a demotion because he wanted sanders,as a woman,to be surplussed.therefore,his transfer into sanders engineering group does not call into question the nondiscriminatory purpose of the rif as asserted by swbt.
statistical evidence 
there were managers in the oklahoma c e group prior to the fall rif.nineteen were women and were men.ten of the nineteen women,or,were surplussed.eleven of the men,or,were surplussed.sanders and coffey suggest that sex discrimination can be inferred because a greater percentage of women were selected for the rif.
statistics taken in isolation are generally not probative of age discrimination.doan seagate,cir quotations omitted.specifically,s tatistical evidence which fails to properly take into account nondiscriminatory explanations does not permit an inference of pretext.see id.thus,s tatistical evidence that does not adjust for the various performance evaluations and departmental rankings of the employees included in the statistical pool is insufficient to establish pretext.see pippin burlington res.oil gas,cir.
the district court correctly noted that the plaintiffs statistical evidence does not take into consideration nondiscriminatory explanations for the example,differences in various individuals job performance,experience,and training.because the statistics fail to account for these variables,they do not constitute evidence of pretext.see id.in rif case,statistical evidence that fourteen of nineteen terminated employees were over forty years old is not evidence of pretext because the statistics do not account for individuals skills or prior performance see also rea martin marietta,cir plaintiff statistical evidence compares only the ages of employees retained with the ages of those laid off plaintiff statistical evidence fails to eliminate nondiscriminatory explanations for disparate,that those laid off had lower performance evaluations and rankings than those therefore does not permit an inference of pretext.furr seagate,cir not permitting an inference of pretext where p laintiffs statistics grouped all employees together regardless of specialty or skill and failed to take into account nondiscriminatory reasons for the numerical disparities.
iii.dismissal of sbc 
a plaintiff must serve a defendant with a summons and a copy of the complaint within days after the filing of the complaint.m.if service is not made within days,the court 
on motion or on its own after notice to the plaintiff,must dismiss the action without prejudice against that defendant or order that service be made within a specified time.but if the plaintiff shows good cause for the failure,the court must extend the time for service for an appropriate period.
id.we review for abuse of discretion the district court dismissal of a defendant for improper service.see scott hern,cir.
here,the district court sua sponte dismissed sbc for insufficient service of process and was therefore required to give prior notice to the plaintiff under rule m among other things,the notice requirement affords the plaintiff the opportunity to show good cause for improper service.see espinoza united states,cir the preliminary inquiry to be made under rule m is whether the plaintiff has shown good cause for the failure to timely effect service.if good cause is shown,the plaintiff is entitled to a mandatory extension of time.if the plaintiff fails to show good cause,the district court must still consider whether a permissive extension of time may be warranted.id.indeed,a court must expressly consider a plaintiff argument regarding good cause,because w ithout anything in the record to indicate how the district court made its determination with respect to the good cause exception appellate review is impossible.arw exploration aguirre,cir.
in this case the district court did not notify the plaintiffs of its intention to dismiss sbc for improper service.in its order of dismissal,the district court also concluded,without explanation,that the plaintiffs had not served sbc and had not shown good cause regarding their failure to do so.because the district court did not give the plaintiffs an opportunity to argue that they did,in fact,serve sbc or that they had good cause not to,the district court abused its discretion in sua sponte dismissing sbc.
iv.conclusion 
we reverse the entry of summary judgment in favor of swbt on sanders age discrimination claim.because none of the plaintiffs have demonstrated that swbt rif was a pretext for sex discrimination,we affirm the district court entry of summary judgment in favor of swbt on those claims.we similarly affirm the summary judgment order as to coffey and brooks age discrimination claims.finally,we reverse the district court sua sponte dismissal of sbc as a defendant and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
in this summary judgment case,i view the applicable law and the record differently from the majority and must,therefore,respectfully dissent.i agree with the majority that this is a circumstantial case,and i agree with the majority disposition of all claims except the gender discrimination claims of sanders and coffey,and i conclude sanders has established sufficient circumstantial evidence of age discrimination in addition to her direct evidence to survive summary judgment.
we are required to consider the totality of the circumstantial evidence when considering claims of pretext.beaird seagate technology,cir.if the proffered evidence,when viewed in the aggregate,is sufficient to raise a genuine doubt about a d efendant motivation,we may conclude a plaintiff has met the requirements necessary to a showing of pretext.garrett,cir internal quotation marks omitted.a showing that the employer justifications for its behavior are pretextual permits a finding of intentional discrimination,but does not compel it.exum olympic,cir.
generally,a plaintiff demonstrates pretext by producing evidence of such weaknesses,implausibilities,inconsistencies,incoherencies,or contradictions in the employer proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable factfinder could rationally find them unworthy of credence and hence infer that the employer did not act for the asserted reasons.jaramillo.judicial dep t,cir internal quotation marks omitted garrett,at.e vidence of pretext may include,but is not limited to prior treatment of plaintiff disturbing procedural irregularities,falsifying or manipulating criteria and the use of subjective criteria.garrett,at final alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.
specifically,in beaird seagate technology,we delineated three principal ways a plaintiff can demonstrate pretext in a rif case.at.in my view,two of them apply in this instance.first,a plaintiff can argue that her own termination does not accord with the rif criteria supposedly employed,even when an employer gives a business judgment reason for changing its rif criteria midstream.id.although an employer may choose to conduct its rif according to its preferred criteria rather than criteria previously documented by the employer,the employer application of or deviation from the documented rif criteria is not immune to judicial review and may be so idiosyncratic or questionable that a factfinder could reasonably find that it is a pretext for illegal discrimination.id.at.selective application of documented or undocumented rif criteria may indicate pretext.see id.at.
here,as in beaird,defendant claims to have followed its written rif criteria.specifically,defendant four main rif criteria are listed in the msg as performance,skills,experience,and training.at,management staffing guidelines at.the msg expressly allows defendant to add rif criteria,and mcneely did so in a ranking considerations instruction sheet he sent to area managers.the ranking considerations sheet listed specific subcategories of the four general rif criteria listed in the msg for area managers to consider when ranking band c managers.after litigation ensued,defendant provided affidavits from several managers listing rif subcategories previously undocumented in the msg or on the ranking considerations sheet as their reasons for ranking certain employees above others within band although these reasons were certainly related to the four main rif criteria,in my view,they were not consistent with the written subcategories found in mcneely ranking instructions.i refer to these criteria as the undocumented rif criteria because they were not specifically documented in any of the contemporaneous documents relied on by defendant when ranking employees.
the second method a plaintiff can employ to demonstrate pretext in a rif case is to present evidence that her evaluation under a defendant rif criteria was deliberately falsified or manipulated to affect her employment status negatively.id.at.one method of demonstrating manipulation or falsification of evaluation is to produce evidence that a supervisor responsible for assessing her performance displayed ageist or gender animus.id.
in addition to these principal methods for demonstrating pretext,our cases explain three other relevant indications of pretext.first,w hen an employer rif criteria include job categorization,an employer must explain the basis for that categorization or risk a finding of pretext.id.at.second,the extent of apparent procedural irregularities with respect to the employee selection for the rif may indicate pretext.whittington nordam group,cir see also plotke white,cir garrett,at.third,inconsistencies in an employer explanation of the reasons for its negative employment action may also indicate pretext.id.
thus,in analyzing plaintiffs claims,the court should focus its pretext analysis on the aforementioned five categories selective application of rif criteria,manipulation of employee evaluations under rif criteria,inadequate employer explanation for job categorizations,rif procedural irregularities,and inconsistent employer reasons for surplussing.
circumstantial evidence as to sanders 
sanders produced circumstantial evidence related to age and gender discrimination in four of the five pretext categories the court should consider.i conclude sanders has produced evidence supporting a finding of pretext in three of those four categories.
selective application of rif criteria 
to survive summary judgment in this category,sanders needed to show defendant application of or deviation from its rif criteria was so idiosyncratic or questionable that a factfinder could reasonably find that it is pretext for illegal discrimination.beaird,at.deviation from documented rif criteria alone does not support an inference of pretext.however,selective or application of either documented or undocumented criteria may be sufficient to support such an inference.
when an employee provides sufficient circumstantial evidence to support a finding of pretext due to an employer selective application of its chosen rif criteria,the employer may then attempt to meet the reeves burden of providing abundant and uncontroverted evidence that no discrimination occurred to rebut the employee pretext claim and to preserve the employer claim of being entitled to summary judgment.i would hold that an employer has provided abundant and uncontroverted evidence of its rif criteria application if the employer can document an observable pattern of rif criteria application that shows the employer applied the same criteria to a large majority of its employees.when,as i see in this case,an employer selectively applies any rif criteria favoring a minority of employees,who then finish with a higher rank than those surplussed,i would hold an employer did not meet its burden of presenting abundant and uncontroverted evidence of no discrimination to preserve its claim for summary judgment.
in this case,defendant msg states repeatedly that managers should use criteria such as performance,skills,experience and training as benchmark rif criteria early in litigation,defendant explained managers ranked band c employees from high to low based on their performance,skills,experience,and training.at,def.swbt mot.for summ.and br.in supp.at.mcneely claims he followed the msg process for the rif and instructed area managers to rank band c employees using performance,skills,experience,and training criteria.two of defendant area managers,alfred saenz and mike harris,also claimed they used the four primary documented rif ranking criteria.
mcneely also sent managers a ranking considerations sheet with a list of subset categories for the four main criteria to use when ranking their band c managers the ranking considerations sheet explained that,because defendant had already used the performance criterion to calculate the band ratings,managers should use only the remaining three rif criteria and their subcategories for ranking purposes.the ranking considerations sheet expressly instructed area managers to u se the skills,experience and training sections below in order to help in determining the ranking of the c band.at,ranking considerations at.
defendant claims it used its rif criteria to rank sanders and the other employees in her group.however,defendant specific explanation,proffered after litigation ensued,for why certain employees were ranked above sanders included several factors not listed in either the msg or on the ranking considerations sheet provided by mcneely.specifically,defendant proffered twelve categories of undocumented criteria and one category of documented criteria to explain why twelve of sanders peers,four of whom were younger and male,six of whom were older and male,and two of whom were younger and female,were ranked ahead of her.although this fact alone does not support an inference of pretext,the record strongly supports an inference that defendant did not apply these criteria uniformly to each employee when ranking twelve employees ahead of sanders.in my view,using criteria not listed on the ranking considerations sheet and not considering all three content areas as instructed constituted a deviation from the rif criteria supposedly employed.beaird,at.i conclude defendant then applied its chosen rif criteria selectively.
the highest level of selectivity defendant employed was when it applied six of the twelve undocumented criteria only once to six different employees ranked above sanders and did not apply any of those six undocumented categories to any of the other eleven employees ranked ahead of sanders defendant applied three of the undocumented criteria to only two other employees defendant applied one undocumented criterion to three other employees who outranked sanders at best,the largest number of employees out of the twelve ranked ahead of sanders that defendant applied undocumented criteria to was five employees 
moreover,i am of the view that this inference of a selective,approach is uncontroverted by the record.indeed,there is little to no evidence from the area managers meeting indicating they discussed the undocumented criteria at all.the sketchy notes from that meeting support an inference that they did not uniformly apply their chosen criteria to a large majority of employees.
specific examples of employees who outranked sanders according to these undocumented criteria are as follows.first,defendant ranked michael heatley higher than sanders using the undocumented criteria of having greater skills.even though heatley did not have an extensive engineering background,he was considered to have greater skills because he learned quickly.at,harris aff.yet the record indicates defendant used sanders to train new engineers rather than heatley,whom defendant indicated had greater skills.
second,defendant listed outside construction background as the undocumented criteria for ranking alton miller ahead of sanders.sanders trained miller in when he was on a pip for misconduct in his prior supervisory position.miller had less time in his engineering position than sanders.he had three months experience in and eight months in contrasted with sanders ten years as an engineer.length of time as an engineer was one of the undocumented criteria area managers used to place sanders below some of her other peers,yet they did not uniformly apply that same criteria when comparing her to miller.in addition,sanders productivity was nearly three times higher than miller.productivity was another undocumented rif criterion defendant used in its considerations when ranking employees because it appeared in handwritten notes from the ranking meeting next to sanders name.
third,like sanders,woody harjo had no outside plant technical experience,but defendant retained him.defendant ranked harjo higher than sanders and nancy bounds,who was also surplussed.according to the undocumented criteria,bounds,like sanders,was ranked lower because of having no outside plant experience.even though neither sanders,bounds,nor harjo had outside plant technical experience,harjo was retained for his drafting and cad background which defendant claimed made him more versatile than either sanders or bounds.at,harris aff.bounds had a drafting background,and as noted above,sanders supervised drafting clerks.the record does not indicate if sanders or bounds drafting experience included cad work.
thus,the application of undocumented rif criteria when employees during ranking,little to no evidence from the area managers ranking meetings indicating that they discussed the undocumented criteria at all and,finally,the existence of only sketchy notes regarding the criteria they did discuss when ranking employees all would combine to provide a reasonable juror with sufficient circumstantial evidence to support a finding of pretext in this area.in my view,sanders circumstantial evidence of this selective application strongly supports an inference of pretext.
finally,because defendant applied each of its chosen rif criterion to less than a large majority of ranked employees,i conclude it did not provide abundant and uncontroverted independent evidence of and,therefore,can not preserve its claim for summary judgment in this area.
rif procedural irregularities 
i am of the view that sanders provided circumstantial evidence of rif procedural irregularities in two areas.first,sanders points to griffith participation in the ranking meeting in which sanders was ranked thirteenth in the band c pool of employees.the area managers knew before the ranking meeting defendant would retain a specified number of managers in bands.in fact,defendant planned to retain all band a and b managers but only thirteen band c managers.the evidence supports an inference that griffith knew he was likely to be surplussed from his position as an area manager because he was the least senior area manager.after participating in the ranking meeting,griffith requested,pursuant to a policy adopted after the ranking meeting,a voluntary demotion from an area manager to a manager in sanders group to avoid being surplussed as an area manager during the rif.even though he was demoted,griffith experienced no change in salary.i agree with the majority that griffith demotion does not,by itself,provide support for a finding of pretext under irregular rif procedures because defendant is entitled to use its business judgment to create policies regulating transfers and to transfer employees according to those policies for legitimate business purposes.moreover,the record provides no evidence that griffith demotion was not conducted pursuant to a legitimate business decision.
nevertheless,in my view,an inference of pretext arises from griffith participation in the area managers ranking meeting at a time he knew his job was vulnerable and knew he might be transferring into the group of employees he helped to rank.griffith was a decision maker at the meeting in which defendant ranked sanders thirteenth,after twelve other individuals who were either male or younger than sanders,or both.i find griffith involvement in the decision to rank sanders thirteenth to be irregular when he knew she would be the next person surplussed if the total size of her manager group increased.that knowledge and griffith subsequent request for a transfer to sanders group combine to constitute a procedural irregularity that provides some support for a finding of pretext under the totality of the circumstances standard.
second,sanders provided circumstantial evidence of a procedural irregularity with respect to one topic of possible discussion at the area managers ranking meeting.that topic was age.wooten claimed he did not know the ages of the engineers who reported to him and that age was not a factor in the rankings,yet his notes from the meeting indicated six employees with a star.although pension eligibility is not necessarily connected to age,it is sufficiently related under the circumstances of this case,to allow a reasonable juror to infer the area managers discussed age when discussing pension eligibility during the meeting.while this evidence,standing alone,would be insufficient to support a finding of pretext,under the totality of the circumstances standard,a reasonable juror could examine it along with the other evidence and infer from it that the area managers discussed age at the meeting.
inconsistent employer reasons for surplussing 
if an employer offers inconsistent reasons for surplussing,we consider the timing of the change in position and the evidentiary basis for the new rationale.jaramillo,at.a change in explanation occurring after significant legal proceedings have occurred supports an inference of pretext.id.
defendant gave numerous reasons at different times for surplussing sanders.first,wooten allegedly told sanders directly that she was surplussed because of her age.however,in his affidavit and on his ranking notes,wooten indicated sanders productivity was the problem.defendant elsewhere stated that sanders lack of outside plant technical experience,work experience,and technical skills were the factors that led to her being surplussed.for instance,harris stated that sanders ranking was primarily attributable to her background.a technical background is extremely valuable to an engineer working knowledge of outside plant facilities.sanders was at a disadvantage since she did not have outside plant experience.at,harris aff.
defendant provided its age and productivity reasons during the rif process both in wooten conversation with sanders and in the notes from the ranking meeting.however,defendant later,inconsistent explanation was provided after sanders filed suit.i find this change in explanation supports a finding of pretext because defendant rationale changed after significant legal proceedings had occurred.
conclusion as to sanders 
viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to sanders and under the totality of the circumstances standard,i conclude sanders has produced a strong case of circumstantial evidence to support a finding of pretext.i am of the view that defendant has not produced abundant and uncontroverted evidence showing discrimination did not occur and can not preserve its claim of being entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.therefore,i would reverse and remand on both sanders age and gender discrimination claims.
circumstantial evidence as to coffey 
coffey produced circumstantial evidence of discrimination in four of the five categories the court should analyze.however,because coffey was not ranked against any younger employees,i agree with the majority that her age discrimination claim can not survive summary judgment.i therefore analyze the circumstantial evidence only with regard to her gender discrimination claim.
selective application of rif criteria 
in coffey case,as in sanders,i find defendant explanation for its rankings is based on specific criteria undocumented in the msg or on the ranking considerations sheet.like sanders,coffey claims defendant selectively applied its undocumented rif criteria to preserve jobs for male employees.
the five undocumented criteria defendant proffered for ranking five men ahead of coffey were having engineering experience,managing the job well,being more versatile,getting along better with a boss,and having outside technical experience.defendant also considered supervisory experience,one of the documented criteria found on the ranking considerations sheet.like sanders,coffey provides sufficient circumstantial evidence to support a finding of pretext in defendant selective application of its chosen rif criteria.
specifically,defendant applied three of the five undocumented criteria only once to three different employees ranked ahead of coffey and did not apply those same criteria to the other two employees ranked ahead of coffey defendant applied the other two criteria to only two employees ranked ahead of coffey defendant applied none of these undocumented criteria to a large majority of employees.
specific examples of the selective applications are as follows.defendant ranked roger cox ahead of coffey using one undocumented criterion.it stated cox had a diverse working background and was thus more versatile than coffey.defendant cites to this criterion only one other time,when describing steven parrot.there is no mention of this undocumented criterion for any of the other three candidates ranked ahead of coffey.thus,the court has no way of knowing whether any of the other candidates ranked ahead of coffey also had a more diverse work background.in my view,therefore,it was not uniformly applied.
defendant also ranked rolland king higher than coffey because he managed his job well and because his boss was not having problems with him like harris claimed he was having with coffey.these two undocumented rif criteria do not appear in the record in regard to any other person ranked higher than coffey.thus,they were not uniformly applied.in addition,harris statement that he was having problems with coffey is possibly in conflict with harris evaluation of coffey just nine months before when he wrote,coffey continues to learn and grow in her job.she works well with others and is a team player.at,exhibit at.
finally,defendant ranked john starwalt higher than coffey because he had more engineering experience and an outside technical background.the record indicates defendant applied the engineering experience criterion only to starwalt,and it applied the outside technical background criterion only to one other person ranked higher than coffey.again,i conclude defendant selectively applied undocumented rif criteria.
accordingly,i am of the view that coffey has provided sufficient circumstantial evidence to support a finding of pretext in defendant selective application of undocumented rif criteria.because i see no observable pattern of rif criteria application to a large majority of defendant employees,i conclude defendant has not produced abundant and uncontroverted evidence of and thus can not preserve its claim for summary judgment in this area.
manipulation of employee evaluation 
a reasonable juror can draw an inference that an employer has manipulated its evaluation of an employee under its rif criteria if the record indicates evidence of gender animus on the part of a supervisor with power to assess an employee job performance.see beaird,at.inherent gender animus can warp a supervisor evaluation of an employee.in this case,harris was coffey immediate supervisor,and kaylan collins stated that she personally overheard harris make sexist remarks about female.at,collins aff.collins statement alone is sufficient to support a finding of pretext in this area.
moreover,coffey presented other evidence that,viewed in the light most favorable to her and under the totality of the circumstances,provides some support for an inference of pretext in this category.for instance,coffey stated in her affidavit that harris scrutinized female employees more closely than male employees.she claimed a male employee noticed the same behavior in harris and mentioned it to her.coffey also claimed that harris rarely encouraged her in her work,and she believed he did not want to deal with women.finally,coffey stated in her deposition that another female employee had been told by harris that she was a nice looking woman,and that if she dressed up and went for an after hours interview with the hiring manager,he thought she could probably get the job she was seeking.at,coffey dep.
inadequate employer explanation for job categorization 
defendant grouped employees in coffey job category by job title.that job title included two subsets construction managers,who supervised defendant internal cable technician employees,and contract coordinators,who oversaw outside independent contractors in fulfilling defendant cable work orders.coffey was a contract coordinator,as were three of the five employees against whom she was ranked.the record indicates that a fourth employee was a construction manager,but there is a dispute regarding whether the fifth employee was a construction manager or a contract coordinator.
the defendant msg required it to group employees according to their affected work group,which the msg defined as a portion of the organization at the same level,job title,similar job function,geography,and line of organization.at,p.combined resp.to d.mot.for summ.at at,msg at note.defendant argues it permissibly grouped construction managers and contract coordinators under the same job title because they had the same job function.coffey asserts her functions as a contract coordinator differed significantly from that of a construction manager.for example,construction managers worked with defendant internal crews of cable technicians and provided supervision for them.whereas coffey,as a contract coordinator,had no supervisory authority and worked with several independent contractors at various job sites on any given day to ensure their compliance with defe
