the issues in these consolidated cases center on the federal communications commission conversion of its system for awarding licenses in the ghz gigahertz band from a comparative application process to a public auction.the ghz band,comprising the to ghz frequencies on the electromagnetic spectrum,appears to have attracted little commercial interest until the,when newly developed technology became available.until late,the commission processed exclusive applications that is,applications having no competition for the same frequency and territory but resolved mutually exclusive applications by holding a comparative hearing.
increased commercial interest in the ghz band rendered the comparative application system impracticable.from january to november alone,the commission received more than applications for licenses.in late the commission also received a telecommunications industry association petition for rulemaking.in response to the petition and the growing number of applications,the commission considered changing its method of allocating licenses and eventually adopted a competitive bidding system.
the commission commenced the transition on november,by imposing,without notice and opportunity for comment,an application freeze.see.in the course of two notices of proposed rulemaking and two reconsideration orders issued between december and july,the commission implemented interim licensing procedures and disposed of applications still pending under the comparative application system.it dismissed without prejudice applications that were not filed at least days before the november,freeze date,or,in commission parlance,that were not ripe.it also dismissed ripe filed at least days before the freeze were mutually exclusive with other applications on the freeze date and whose mutual exclusivity had not been resolved by amendment or voluntary dismissal by december,the date for amendments.see,july.conversely,the commission processed applications filed at least days before november,and that were not mutually exclusive on that date or that had their mutual exclusivity resolved by amendment or voluntary dismissal by december,
the private appellants and to the commission dismissal of their pending applications,to the ripeness period,and to the amendment.they do not contest the application freeze itself or the commission adoption of a competitive bidding system.
dismissal of applications 
once the commission decided to adopt new licensing rules for the ghz band,it had to choose the effective date of the rules and dispose of applications still pending under the old regime.as appellants see it,the commission decision to dismiss all pending mutually exclusive applications was arbitrary and capricious.naturally,they hoped to avoid having to start the application process all over again in a public auction.we have,however,recognized the commission authority to change license allocation procedures midstream.see maxcell telecom plus,fcc,upholding change from comparative application system to lottery directv,fcc,upholding change from pro rata distribution policy to competitive bidding.
in deciding to dismiss applications that either did not satisfy the ripeness requirement or were mutually exclusive,the commission balanced the need to implement the new regulatory regime against the effect of upsetting the expectations of appellants and others.we perceive no error in its resolution of these opposing interests.the commission reasonably feared that processing mutually exclusive applications under an antiquated and burdensome comparative application system would diminish the efficiency gains expected from competitive bidding.see at.
in appellants view,their side of the balance weighs much heavier because they obtained rights against prospective competitors who were foreclosed from applying by the commission rules.under rules existing when appellants filed,public notice of the filing of the first application for a given license triggered a filing window that is,competing applicants had to file within days of the public notice or lose their right to file.see b i several applicants for ghz licenses filed more than days before the freeze order,yet saw their applications dismissed because of mutual exclusivity.upon reaching the sixtieth day following public notice of the first application but before the freeze order,the filing rule theoretically should have closed the application pool to competing filers,protecting these applications from additional competition.appellants complain that the application freeze and subsequent dismissal of pending mutually exclusive applications defeated the rule by permitting people who would have been closed out of applicant pools in the comparative application system to bid for the same licenses in the public auction in their words,the commission decision effectively required pending mutually exclusive applicants to bid against new applicants filing years after the established dates.brief for appellants at.
appellants claim that mcelroy electronics fcc,renders the commission actions arbitrary.see brief for appellants at.in mcelroy,we recognized that as against latecomers,timely filers who have diligently complied with the commission requirements have an equitable interest in enforcement of the rules.at.that equitable interest arose in circumstances not present here.the appellants in mcelroy filed cellular applications even though the commission had not yet formulated rules for those licenses.see id.at.the commission dismissed the applications as premature and later established a filing window.on the filing date,which was approximately five years after the appellants had filed,applicants filed for the los angeles licenses and filed for the minneapolis licenses.see id.at.the first time mcelroy came to this court,we ordered the commission to reinstate,nunc pro tunc,the applications previously dismissed as premature.see mcelroy fcc.the commission then decided that the reinstated applicants would have to enter a lottery with those who filed under the later window,reasoning that the public notices announcing appellants applications did not establish a deadline for competing applications.see at.we reversed,citing the commission notice and procedure under which the applications at issue were filed,wherein competing applicants were entitled to participate in a comparative hearing or lottery only if they filed their applications within sixty days after the date of the public notice listing the first of the conflicting applications as accepted for filing.id.at.the issue was whether the public notices gave sufficient notice of the commission acceptance of appellants applications for filing to cut off third parties rights.id.we found the public notice sufficient to trigger the period.see id.at.
mcelroy stands for the proposition that the commission must follow its own rules.see,reuters fcc.it does not create some generalized right to exclude competitors.the equitable interest in mcelroy was the applicants interest in the commission enforcing its filing and notice rules,not an interest in preventing the commission from changing them.as we have recognized before,the commission may make midstream rule adjustments,even though it disrupts expectations and alters the competitive balance among applicants.see maxcell,directv.
moreover,any interest in enforcement of rules is just interest,not a vested right timely applicants have no vested right against challenge from untimely competitors,in the sense of precluding the fcc from ever granting a waiver,but they certainly have an equitable interest whose weight it is manifestly within the commission discretion to consider.florida inst.of tech.fcc.the commission authority to change rules that affect pending applications is bounded by principles of retroactivity,not by an abstract interest in excluding competitors.mcelroy holds only that if the commission decides to process timely applications,it generally may not also process competing applications filed out of time.the case does not govern the present situation in which the commission decides,without violating its rules,not to process pending mutually exclusive applications at all 
even if mcelroy stood for all that appellants read into it,they could not have obtained any equitable interest to immunize their applications against dismissal.the most they could have obtained is the relief we granted in order requiring dismissal of applications filed after the date.see at.mcelroy does not require the commission to process all applications pending under an obsolete license allocation system just because applicants who were otherwise cut off might in a new system 
b.the ripeness period 
the commission imposed a ripeness period with the time period in which competitors had the right to file competing applications.the point apparently was to avoid granting applications under the old system when the time period for others to file a mutually exclusive application had not yet expired.the commission originally used a period,representing the period during which prospective applicants could file competing applications under the commission rules.see b but see supra note contemplating shorter filing period under some circumstances.it later shortened the period to days,explaining that it is our practice to process applications as soon after the close of the public notice period as possible.see at see also c commission can not grant application until days after application appears on public notice.
the communications act,with a few exceptions not relevant here,forbids the commission to grant an application earlier than thirty days following issuance of public notice by the commission of the acceptance for filing of such application or of any substantial amendment thereof.b.the commission reasonably determined that its ripeness period will assure fairness to potential applicants who were precluded by the freeze from filing competing applications in time to be entitled to comparative consideration.at.had the commission granted applications filed less than days before the freeze date,it would have denied potential competing applicants the filing period the act guarantees them.
the supreme court long ago recognized the procedural rights the communications act guarantees to those who file mutually exclusive applications.ashbacker radio fcc,held that the commission could not grant one mutually exclusive application without holding the comparative hearing required by the communications act.see also mcelroy,at.in kessler fcc,we decided that ashbacker procedural rights apply also to potential applicants whose applications would have been mutually exclusive but for an application freeze.in kessler,the commission froze applications effective on may.appellants in that case filed applications between may and june.some of the late applicants claimed their applications were mutually exclusive with applications on file.unlike the present case,the commission employed no ripeness period it processed all applications pending on the freeze date.we held that the commission refusal to process mutually exclusive applications filed after the freeze but that were otherwise timely denied those applicants their ashbacker rights those appellants who tendered applications which are,or become,in fact mutually exclusive with an application pending on may,or one accepted for filing since that date,are entitled to participate in a comparative hearing on that application under the ashbacker any grant is to be the commission may not deprive them of this right when their applications were timely but were rejected only because of a temporary freeze on accepting new applications.at.we reasoned that the substantial effect of a contrary view would be not only to freeze the acceptance for filing of a timely application but to freeze new applicants permanently out of a right of comparative hearing on the pending application to which they are entitled when their application is timely.id.at.
kessler reasoning applies here.without the ripeness period,the commission could have granted applications filed less than days before the freeze date,abrogating the ashbacker rights of prospective applicants who could have filed timely competing applications but for the freeze.the ripeness period quite sensibly guarantees that all applications that are granted were on public notice for the days required by the communications act.see b 
c.the amendment 
the commission apparently intended the november,freeze to cut off amendments as well as applications.but the freeze order specified only the latter.see.despite this oversight,the commission,in the first notice of proposed rule making and order it issued on december,stated that the november freeze applied to amendments,except for a limited class of license modification amendments.see at.in its first reconsideration order,issued on january,the commission changed the date for amendments of right from november,the application freeze date,to december,the date it promulgated the interim licensing procedures the commission recognized that it was the december order,not the november order,that suspended any further action on these amendments.at.
the amendment precluded private resolution of mutual exclusivity after december.it was no longer possible for amendments or,apparently,voluntary dismissals to cure mutual exclusivity and render an application eligible for processing under the old regime.appellants claim they had a substantive right to cure mutual exclusivity that may not be abrogated without notice and comment.relying on ashbacker,they insist that the right of competing applicants to simultaneous consideration under ashbacker is a right of substance and that equally of substance is an applicant right to avoid consolidated treatment and its unintended consequences by means of minor amendments and voluntary dismissals.brief for appellants at.
the right to avoid consolidated treatment finds no support in ashbacker or any other authorities the appellants have brought to our attention.the right to amend is no more substantive than the right to file an application in the first place,which we have previously held the commission may suspend without notice and comment.see kessler,at neighborhood tv fcc.like the rules governing the filing of applications,rules permitting or suspending amendments are rules of agency organization,procedure,or practice exempt from the administrative procedure act notice and comment requirement.see b a james hurson,glickman,jem broad.fcc,fcc hard look rules prohibiting amendment did not require notice and comment we conclude that a license applicant right to a free shot at amending its application is not so significant as to have required the fcc to conduct notice and comment rulemaking,particularly in light of the commission weighty efficiency interests.maxcell,at stating but not deciding that a rule arguably may be understood as an interpretive rule,a rule of agency procedure or of agency practice,any of which is exempt from the notice and comment requirements.
we also reject appellants claim that the amendment was arbitrary and capricious appellants panoply of arguments in this regard reduce to a central premise refusal to accept amendments after december,artificially preserved mutual exclusivity with respect to ghz applications,creating the fiction that applications that were mutually exclusive before december,remained so even after their frequency conflicts had been resolved in violation of ashbacker.brief for appellants at emphasis omitted.appellants read ashbacker far too broadly in the court words we only hold that where two bona fide applications are mutually exclusive the grant of one without a hearing to both deprives the loser of the opportunity which congress chose to give him.ashbacker,at.see also maxcell,at ashbacker therefore simply is irrelevant to a situation where a license applicant complains that its application was not considered due to a regulation that for orderly administration,requires an application to be filed within a certain date.reuters,at criticizing an attempt to bootstrap a fairness argument onto ashbacker narrow holding.ashbacker constrains only the grant of mutually exclusive applications it does not touch the commission authority to dismiss or suspend amendments of
