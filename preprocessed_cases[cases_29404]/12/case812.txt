an unlicensed operator of a fm radio station challenges a federal communications commission order directing him to cease broadcasting.he contends the order and an ancillary forfeiture are unenforceable because the commission ban on fm stations,in place until january,contravened the communications act of and the first amendment,and because the forfeiture is unreasonable,excessive,and beyond his ability to pay.we reject these claims and affirm.absent a demonstration that the ban was indisputably unlawful or unconstitutional,the commission had no obligation to reconsider the ban in the context of an enforcement proceeding against a single unlicensed operator.moreover,the forfeiture is reasonable under the circumstances of this case,and the operator waived his claim.
section of the communications act of makes it unlawful to operate a radio station without a license from the federal communications commission.historically,the commission elaborate licensing scheme included four classes of,b,c,and on the basis of such factors as station location,antenna height,and transmission power.until,the commission allocated class d licenses to microbroadcast stations,so called because they operate at power levels of less than one hundred watts and reach listeners within a two to radius of the point of transmission.in,however,choosing to str ike the balance in favor of licensing stations to ensure that large audiences were served,the commission adopted a microbroadcasting ban pursuant to which it stopped awarding class d licenses.creation of a low power radio,rcd,wl reconsideration discussing changes in the rules relating to noncommercial educ.fm broad.stations,wl codified at d.
at all times relevant to this case,appellant jerry szoka knew of both the licensing requirement and the microbroadcasting ban.yet from until,szoka operated grid radio,an unlicensed station in cleveland,ohio.he never applied for a license because he believed applying would be futile given the microbroadcasting ban.
in early,after receiving a complaint about grid radio,the commission sent szoka two successive letters warning him that if he continued to operate the station,he could face fines,forfeitures,or criminal sanctions.responding to the first letter,szoka urged the commission to ignore his unlicensed operations because grid radio is top quality,provides a much needed community service without commercials,and does not interfer e with other stations.jerry szoka,rcd,wl order to show cause.nothing in the record indicates whether szoka responded to the second letter.
despite the commission letters,szoka continued operating grid radio.id.at.in response,the commission issued an order directing szoka to show cause why he should not be ordered to cease and desist from violating section.the order specified two issues for consideration at an upcoming hearing whether szoka was transmitt ing radio energy without appropriate authorization,and if so,whether he should be ordered to cease and desist from that activity.jerry szoka,fcc,fcc lexis,wl alj summary decision.the order also indicated that the commission was considering whether szoka should forfeit the maximum daily penalty adjusted for inflation for a continuing violation of the act.id.at,citing b c see also b detailing how to adjust forfeitures for inflation.
the chief of the commission compliance and information bureau moved for summary decision of the issues identified in the order.although szoka conceded he had no license to operate grid radio,he objected to the summary judgment motion,arguing he had no obligation to comply with commission licensing rules because the microbroadcasting ban was both unlawful and unconstitutional.he also challenged the forfeiture as unreasonable and excessive in violation of the fifth and eighth amendments to the united states constitution.
in light of szoka concession that he lacked a license to operate grid radio,the administrative law judge concluded that no substantial issues of material fact remained,granted the commission motion for summary decision,issued a order,and imposed the forfeiture.jerry szoka,fcc lexis,at.in so doing,the alj rejected szoka constitutional challenges to the microbroadcasting ban on two alternative grounds on the merits because the right of free speech does not include the right to use radio facilities without a license and for lack of standing because szoka failed to apply for either a license or a waiver of the microbroadcasting ban.id.at citing nbc united states.united states dunifer,stephen paul dunifer,rcd,wl.rejecting szoka fifth and eighth amendment claims,the alj found that imposition of a forfeiture is civil and not a criminal penalty,and that the statutory scheme authorizing the commission to enforce forfeitures contains appropriate safeguards which satisfy due process requirements id.at.
the commission affirmed the alj order,finding szoka without standing to challenge the licensing regulations and rejecting his constitutional challenges to the microbroadcasting ban and forfeiture.jerry szoka,rcd.the commission informed szoka that he could file a claim of inability to pay the forfeiture by submitting tax returns or other financial statements covering the previous three years.id.at.
szoka filed petitions for reconsideration and for a stay of the orders against him,claiming,among other things,that he was unable to pay the forfeiture.in support,szoka submitted a financial statement and tax returns for through showing in assets and an annual adjusted gross income averaging about.jerry szoka,rcd,wl reconsideration.the commission denied szoka petitions for reconsideration and for a stay,and also rejected without a hearing his claim of inability to pay,finding that although szoka stated assets and income do not appear to be large,he failed to submit sufficient objective evidence and supporting information to sustain his claim that they are so inadequate as to render him unable to pay a forfeiture.id.the commission pointed out that although its compliance and information bureau had invited szoka to file further documentation in support of his financial claims,he failed to do so.id.at.
following the commission rejection of szoka motion for reconsideration and for a stay,the order became effective.because szoka continued to operate grid radio,the commission filed suit in the united states district court for the northern district of ohio to compel compliance.see b authorizing commission to apply to the appropriate district court of the united states for the enforcement of most orders of the commission.finding the order regularly made and duly served,the district court ordered szoka to stop broadcasting by march.united states szoka,cir citing district court affirmance of the commission order against szoka internal quotation marks omitted.the sixth circuit affirmed,declining to reach szoka constitutional challenge to the microbroadcasting ban because in its view,the circuit has exclusive jurisdiction to nullify a order based on unconstitutional regulations promulgated by the commission.id.at.
in the meantime,szoka filed this appeal of the order and forfeiture.he alleges that prior to issuing the order,the commission was obligated to demonstrate that shutting down grid radio would further the public interest the microbroadcasting ban contravened the act requirement that the commission regulate in the public interest,g the ban violated the first amendment the forfeiture constitutes an excessive fine in violation of the eighth amendment and finally,the forfeiture is not the product of reasoned and should be reduced in light of szoka financial hardship.although the commission recently abandoned its microbroadcasting ban and adopted new rules authorizing the licensing of stations,see ruggiero fcc,szoka has not applied for a license under the new regime,nor does he challenge that regime here.
the commission argues that because szoka failed to apply for a license or to seek a waiver of the microbroadcasting ban,he lacks standing to raise his constitutional and statutory challenges.since this argument implicates our jurisdiction,we consider it first.
