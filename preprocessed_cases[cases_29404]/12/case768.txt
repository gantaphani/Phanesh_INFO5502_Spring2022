for nearly a decade the federal communications commission has attempted to restructure payphone compensation in compliance with the telecommunications act of,stat.the act required the commission to establish a per call compensation plan to ensure that all payphone service providers are fairly compensated for each and every completed intrastate and interstate call using their payphone.b a.on three prior occasions we have ruled on various aspects of the commission payphone compensation plan.illinois pub.telecommunications ass fcc,supplemented at mci telecommunications fcc,am.pub.communications council fcc,apcc.petitioner and intervenors mci and sprint,all carriers,now challenge the commission latest revision of the compensation amount.
at the heart of these proceedings is the compensation of coinless calls those calls in which the caller,instead of depositing money in the payphone,dials an access number or a toll free number.in the commission designed a system in which the carrier handling the coinless call reimburses the payphone service provider on a,per phone basis implementation of the pay telephone reclassification and compensation provisions of the telecommunications act of,report and order,wl,first order.calculating a per phone compensation figure requires multiplying two numbers a set price per call and an average volume of calls per phone.id.the commission expected that reimbursement would switch to a per call basis once tracking technology was in place.id.call tracking would eliminate the need for an average call volume estimate.the first order determined the price of a call to be cents and the average number of calls from a payphone to be per month,equaling per phone.id.the commission intended this rate to apply from november,to october,when it expected the tracking technology to have been fully implemented.id.this interval has become known as the interim period.the commission also set the cent per call rate as the default rate for the first year of compensation after october.id.
in response to the petitions of various parties challenging the first order,we vacated and remanded the cent per call compensation rate for coinless calls.illinois,at,clarified at at.no party challenged the call volume estimate.on remand,the commission,using a different methodology,adjusted the per call compensation rate to cents per call.implementation of the pay telephone reclassification and compensation provisions of the telecommunications act of,second report and order,wl,second order.the commission established this rate for two years beyond october.because call tracking had not yet been fully implemented,the new rate served both as a default rate for tracked calls and as a basis for compensation.the commission also tentatively applied this rate to the interim period,although it deferred full reconsideration of the interim period rate as ordered in illinois until a later time.id.finding this rate deficient as well,we remanded but did not vacate the cent rate,giving the commission six months to adopt a different figure.mci,at.on remand the commission again established a new rate,this time cents per call,which it applied retroactively to both the interim period and the interval between october,and april,the effective date of the rate.in re implementation of the pay telephone reclassification and compensation provisions of the telecommunications act of,third report and order,and order on reconsideration of the second report and order,wl,third order.this latter interval is considered the intermediate period.the commission also stated that the cent price would serve as the default rate for coinless calls through january,id.we affirmed the commission per call compensation rate.apcc.
in the commission,still addressing the illinois remand,further revised the per call estimate to cents per call for the interim and intermediate periods.implementation of the pay telephone reclassification and compensation provisions of the telecommunications act of,fourth order on reconsideration and order on remand,wl,fourth order.due to the availability of new call volume data,the commission,inter alia,adjusted the average call volume figure from to for both periods.id.as it did in the previous orders,the commission also applied the revised figures prospectively this time from april,forward,an interval the parties call the period.id.app.no party asked the commission to reconsider the cents per call figure.mci petitioned for reconsideration on the ground that the data and methodology the commission used to reach the call estimate were faulty and that the commission should have applied a decline factor for and beyond to take into account decreasing payphone call volume.filed comments on mci petition.the commission,in refusing to reopen this aspect of the fourth order,defended the quality of the data it used to reach the figure and its decision not to adopt a decline factor in light of insufficient evidence demonstrating a decrease in per payphone call volume.implementation of the pay telephone reclassification and compensation provisions of the telecommunications act of,fifth order on reconsideration and order on remand,wl,fifth order.
then filed this action seeking judicial review of the fifth order in which the commission denied mci petition for reconsideration.
the general rule is that an agency denial of a petition for reconsideration is not subject to judicial review.icc of locomotive engineers,d southwestern bell.fcc,beehive.fcc,microwave communications,fcc.admits that it sought review only of the commission fifth order denying reconsideration.but the general rule does not apply here,so argues,because the commission had no discretion to deny reconsideration reconsideration was mandatory under b of the act.this section states that the commission,within months after february,shall take all actions necessary including any reconsideration to prescribe regulations to ensure that all payphone service providers are fairly compensated b.the use of the word shall,according to,removes the commission discretion to deny a reconsideration petition,at least when the commission believes granting the petition is necessary to ensure fair payphone compensation.
interpretation of b is impossible.on the face of it,the provision simply established a temporal mandate months.section b says nothing about the decision whether to grant a petition for reconsideration.it speaks only to how long the commission may take for its initial actions and for proceedings,if any,after it has granted a petition for reconsideration.the evident purpose of congress was to speed things up.yet version of b would only slow things down.we therefore can not read b as departing solely for the purpose of restructuring the payphone market from the rule that the commission may in its discretion deny a petition for reconsideration.
the fifth order,as a denial of reconsideration,is thus not subject to judicial review unless it falls within some exception to the general rule.the supreme court described such an exception in locomotive engineers when the request for agency reconsideration rested on new evidence or changed circumstances that rendered the agency original order inappropriate.at.at internal quotations omitted.the court was there interpreting the interstate commerce act,which contained three grounds for rehearing material error,new evidence,or substantially changed circumstances.at.at citing g current version at c.here,the rehearing statute a does not use those words.it specifies no grounds for rehearing,leaving the matter to such general rules as the commission may establish.the commission rules provide that a petition for rehearing relying on facts not presented in the original proceeding may be granted if the facts relate to events occurring after the last opportunity to present such matters,or if the petition relies on facts unknown to petitioner which could not,through the exercise of ordinary diligence,have been learned prior to such opportunity.c b.in southwestern bell,at,and beehive,at,we assumed that the commission rehearing rules were comparable to those recited in the court locomotive engineers opinion
