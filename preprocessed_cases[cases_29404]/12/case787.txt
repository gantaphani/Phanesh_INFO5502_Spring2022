the federal communications commission granted intervenor verizon application seeking approval under of the telecommunications act of,to provide service to callers in pennsylvania,where verizon is the incumbent local exchange carrier.verizon pennsylvania,rcd,wl.communications,a competitive local exchange carrier,challenges the resulting order,maintaining the commission erred in finding that verizon provides competitors nondiscriminatory access to its wholesale billing services,as required by the commission pursuant to.we affirm the order.
background 
we presented a detailed history of in fcc,which we shall not repeat here.suffice it to say that in order for a bell operating company boc to obtain authority to provide service to callers in a region where it provides local exchange service,it must first obtain approval from the commission.one method of obtaining approval,and the one verizon pursued in this case,requires the boc first to apply to the state regulatory agency,which makes an initial determination of the boc eligibility.if the state agency approves,then the boc may file an application with the commission,which has days in which to evaluate whether the application establishes the boc compliance with,among other things,the competitive checklist in c b.the checklist incorporates by reference many of the substantive requirements of the act local competition provisions,at,which in turn require the boc to take various steps to open its market to competitive local exchange carriers clecs.in particular,the checklist requires the boc to provide clecs with n ondiscriminatory access to unbundled network elements unes.c b ii.
the only une relevant to this appeal is the operation support systems oss element,which the commission has described as the various systems,databases,and personnel that the bocs use to provide service to their customers.sbc communications,rcd,wl.the oss element itself consists of five functions,of which billing is one.bell atlantic new york,rcd,wl.the billing requirement in turn has two components the boc must provide clecs with complete and accurate reports on the service usage of competing carriers customers in substantially the same time and manner that it provides such information to itself,and it must provide wholesale bills in a manner that gives competing carriers a meaningful opportunity to compete.sbc communications,rcd,wl.the latter component is the subject of the present dispute.
in june the pennsylvania public utility commission approved verizon application to provide services to callers in pennsylvania,conditioned upon verizon taking certain further action.in particular,the puc expressed concern that verizon be able to provide timely and accurate electronic bills,and required verizon to take steps to alleviate that concern.
verizon provides clecs in pennsylvania with bills in two formats a bill,generally printed on paper,and a billing output specification bill data tape,or bos bdt,which is designed to be.verizon has always provided bills,and their accuracy is not at issue in this appeal.verizon began offering bos bdt bills in january,but it experienced problems,including incorrect charges appearing on the bills,that caused it to suspend bos bdt billing for several months.it reintroduced bos bdt bills in october,but some problems remained despite verizon continuing effort to fix its software.
in april verizon implemented a process to manually review and adjust the bos bdt bills to match them to the bills and to reconcile internal inconsistencies.order.verizon then contracted with pricewaterhousecoopers pwc to compare its bos bdt bills with its bills and to test the readability and auditability of the bos bdt bill.id.pwc studies showed that the bos bdt bill is largely comparable to the bill.id.meanwhile,verizon had sponsored a separate study,completed in december by kpmg consulting,that found its bills were accurate.based upon these studies,in may verizon offered clecs the option of treating the bos bdt bill as their bill of record.it also continued working to fix its billing system,making changes to its software through june.
verizon filed its application with the commission on june.the commission thereafter received the comments of and of other interested parties verizon reply comments the report of the department of justice required by d a and numerous ex parte submissions.
in their comments and certain other clecs claimed that verizon had not demonstrated it could deliver an accurate bos bdt bill and indeed that as of june it never had delivered such a bill.also claimed that certain performance metrics verizon had submitted in support of its application were inadequate to measure the accuracy of verizon billing performance.
verizon replied on august in an ex parte letter containing additional data and arguments,three aspects of which are noteworthy.first,verizon provided a table showing the rates of error in its bills had decreased from approximately in february to about in may and june.second,verizon data showed the error rates in what the commission called verizon historic problem areas had also dropped over time.finally,verizon submitted a recalculation of certain of the billing performance metrics.
in the order approving verizon application,the commission found that despite some historical problems in producing a readable,auditable and accurate wholesale bill verizon now provides a wholesale bill that gives clecs a meaningful opportunity to compete.order.although the commission considered commercial performance data to be the most persuasive form of evidence,it determined that in this case it could not rely exclusively upon such data because verizon has made significant changes to its wholesale billing systems in the most recent months leading up to its application.id.the commission did consider verizon commercial performance data to the extent that,in response to the commenters objections based upon the bills they had received from verizon,it cited the february through june downward trend in error rates as evidence that verizon software fixes had improved its performance to the point where error rates no longer differ materially from wholesale billing data for those states in which bocs have already received section authority.id.the commission also relied upon the pwc and kpmg studies,id,verizon recent software fixes,and its manual review process,id,as evidence that verizon had brought its billing performance up to an acceptable level.
ii.analysis 
in this appeal,maintains that for several reasons the order was arbitrary,capricious,and contrary to law.we consider and reject each of arguments below.
complete when filed 
claims the commission violated its own procedural rules by considering evidence that was not properly before it.the commission stated policy is as follows 
we expect that a section application,as originally filed,will include all of the factual evidence on which the applicant would have the commission rely in making its findings thereon.in the event that the applicant submits factual evidence that changes its application in a material respect,the commission reserves the right to deem such submission a new application and start the review process anew.
procedures for bell operating company applications under new section,public notice,rcd,wl.this formulation,known as the complete when filed rule,reserves to the commission considerable discretion to determine whether to reject evidence.bell atlantic new york,rcd,our precedent makes clear that this rule is a discretionary one.moreover,the rule contains an exception 
an applicant may submit new factual information after the application is filed,if the sole purpose of that evidence is to rebut arguments or facts submitted by other commenters and the new evidence cover s only the period placed in dispute by commenters 
sbc communications,rcd.see updated filing requirements for bell operating company applications under section of the communications act,public notice,wl common carrier bureau updated filing requirements restating the rule and exception.
claims the commission violated the complete when filed rule by considering verizon august submission as a basis for granting its application.instead of forcing and other interested parties to attempt to tailor their comments to a moving target,it complains,the commission should have required verizon to withdraw its application and submit anew.also argues that verizon august submission was objectionable because it included billing data for the month of june,which verizon generated after it had filed its application with the commission.
the commission addressed each of these objections in the order.with respect to the complaint that consideration of evidence in the august submission violated the complete when filed rule,the commission ruled the data were admissible because they fell within the exception described above the evidence we rely on was submitted by verizon to rebut competitors assertions and pertains only to the may and june billing cycles.order.with regard to the inclusion of june data that the filing of verizon application,the commission pointed out that it ha d previously considered performance that covered a time period slightly beyond the comment filing date,and it believe d it was appropriate to do so here.id.citing sbc communications,rcd.in fact the performance data for june did not extend beyond the date for filing comments,which was july,but some of it did cover a period beyond the date of the application june,which no doubt explains the commission understanding,further discussed below,that it was departing from strict adherence to the complete when filed rule.
verizon submission of august clearly comes within the exception to the complete when filed rule.and other commenters had challenged verizon billing performance for the months of may and june,comments of july,rubino decl.reply comments of,and verizon was merely responding,defending its billing performance for those months by showing its error rate was lower than it had been before.the submission therefore met the commission requirements that evidence rebut arguments or facts submitted by other commenters and cover only the period placed in dispute by commenters.
contends that even if the commission could properly consider verizon august submission under the exception to the complete when filed rule,the exception limits the commission to considering data solely for the purpose of rebuttal.therefore,argues,verizon submission could at best rebut complaints from commenters that its billing performance in may and june was inadequate the commission could not rely upon the data to find verizon billing performance was adequate.as authority for this proposition cites the commission prior statements to the effect that an applicant should include in its application all of the factual evidence on which the applicant would have the commission rely.procedures for bell operating company applications under new section,rcd.at updated filing requirements,at see also id.at it generally will not be appropriate for an applicant to make any part of its initial prima facie showing for the first time in reply comments or in ex parte submissions,although there may be limited exceptions to this rule.
the statements cites all indicate the commission might refuse to grant a application if the applicant first presents evidence of its compliance with a checklist item in its reply comments,but they also indicate the commission retains the power to make reasoned exceptions to the rule.in this case,the commission chose not to segregate the evidence before it into data that may permissibly be used to establish a prima facie case and data that may be used only in rebuttal.because n either the june performance data nor the data reflecting verizon june billing performance could be generated until the end of the calendar month,and because no party to the proceeding was prejudiced by its consideration of the data,order,the commission indicated that it would waive the aspect of the complete when filed rule providing that information can be used only for the purpose of rebuttal.we find this approach eminently reasonable.it is neither arbitrary nor capricious for the commission to consider any evidence that is properly before it for any purpose as to which it is probative.see greyhound lines,icc,the courts have long recognized that evidentiary rules used in judicial proceedings do not control the more flexible administrative process.
billing metrics 
also argues the commission acted arbitrarily and capriciously by not giving any weight to the recalculated billing metrics verizon submitted as part of its august submission.according to,they show verizon made many more errors in billing clecs than it made in billing its own customers.
in the order the commission noted both that the clecs had challenged the soundness of certain of the billing metrics and that verizon itself acknowledges some of the metrics flaws.order.the commission concluded by noting 
until july the billing accuracy and timeliness metrics did not apply to verizon bos bdt bills.verizon generally does not rely on its wholesale billing performance metrics to establish its affirmative case.in these circumstances,we do not rely on the billing accuracy metrics in considering verizon section showing.
id.complaint is that the commission can not ignore evidence unfavorable to an applicant merely because the applicant itself did not rely upon it rather,claims,the commission must consider all probative evidence properly put before it,regardless whether the applicant has relied upon it.
point,which may well be correct as a general proposition,does not advance its cause here because the billing metrics in question were not,as calculated,indicative of the contemporaneous error rate.to be specific,the billing accuracy metrics,which are the metrics claims undermine verizon application,are calculated as fractions 
the numerator of the bill accuracy metrics is the total amount of dollars credited to clecs as a result of billing errors in the reporting month,regardless of when the clec submitted the claim for the error or what month s the error occurred in.the denominator is the current charges billed to clecs in the reporting month t his means that the credits reported in a month do not relate to the charges billed in that month 
reply decl.as itself as well as other commenters pointed out,the result of this arrangement is that the billing metrics wo capture failures for many months.ex parte,at.and as became clear at oral argument,the numerator for a given month may contain credits issued for that month,for one or more prior months,or for no months,depending upon the vintage of the billing disputes verizon and the clecs happened to resolve that month.because of this and other limitations,informed the commission that verizon billing performance metrics produce no substantive information.id.
although later argued to the commission that the recalculated billing metrics verizon submitted on august remedied some of the problems with those metrics in particular,verizon placing clec billing errors in the wrong performance reports,ex parte,at it did not claim that verizon had solved the underlying structural problem with the metrics.the commission did not go into great detail about its reason for not relying upon the billing metrics,but what it did say is both clear and sound competitive lecs allege the billing metrics are inaccurate,order verizon itself acknowledges some of the metrics flaws,verizon generally does not rely upon the metrics,therefore neither would the commission rely upon them.
in its reply brief to this court now claims that verizon recalculation of the metrics corrected their primary problem.it appears to us,however,that the structural problem with the metrics,namely the unpredictable but possibly significant lag between any error and its reflection in the billing metrics,is at least as serious.certainly did not indicate in its comments to the commission that this was a lesser problem.under these circumstances,we do not fault the commission for declining to rely upon data that the parties agreed had significant problems.
