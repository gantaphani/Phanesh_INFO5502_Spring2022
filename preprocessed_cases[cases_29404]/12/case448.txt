this dispute under the telecommunications act of pits one telephone company against another with two state regulatory commissions caught in the middle.we must determine whether the matter is subject to binding arbitration,and,if so,what rules apply.
these appeals involve two consolidated cases,one from the district of arizona,the other from the district of oregon.the lawsuits were brought by north county communications corporation of arizona and north county communications corporation of oregon collectively referred to as north county,except when necessary to distinguish one from the other.north county is a local exchange carrier that provides telecommunications services to its customers.north county sued qwest corporation,a rival local exchange carrier,and,in their official capacities,commissioners of two state commissions the arizona corporation commission arizona commission and the public utility commission of oregon oregon commission state agencies whose responsibilities include regulating contracts between such carriers.
as many courts have explained,congress passed the telecommunications act of,pub,stat.codified as amended in scattered sections of chapter of the united states code the act,to promote competition in the provision of telecommunication services.see,iowa utils.as relevant here,the statute classifies local exchange carriers into two categories incumbent local exchange carriers ilecs,and competitive local exchange carriers clecs.quick commc ns.bell,cir.ilecs are those entities that enjoyed a monopoly on local phone service in a particular geographic area prior to the act.id.for both the arizona and oregon cases,qwest is an ilec,and north county is a clec.
the act subjects ilecs to a host of duties intended to facilitate market entry.foremost among these duties is the incumbent local exchange carrier obligation under c to share its network with competitors,at.doing so ensures that the clec customers can call the ilec customers,and vice versa.under the act,a clec may access an ilec network by requesting to interconnect its facilities with the ilec network.see also a.
section a of the act declares that u pon receiving a request for interconnection,services,or network elements pursuant to section of this title,an incumbent local exchange carrier may negotiate and enter into a binding agreement with the requesting telecommunications carrier.a.section b then provides that d uring the period from the to the day inclusive after the date on which an incumbent local exchange carrier receives a request for negotiation under this section,the carrier or any other party to the negotiation may petition a state commission to arbitrate any open issues.b.section e states that a ny interconnection agreement ica adopted by negotiation or arbitration shall be submitted for approval to the state commission.a state commission to which an agreement is submitted shall approve or reject the agreement,with written findings as to any deficiencies.e.
in,north county first requested to interconnect with qwest in arizona and oregon.one provision of the resulting agreement ica between qwest and north county,section xxxiv v,stated 
this agreement shall be effective for a period of years,and thereafter the agreement shall continue in force and effect unless and until a new agreement,addressing all of the terms of this agreement,becomes effective between the parties.the parties agree to commence negotiations on a new agreement no later than two years after this agreement becomes effective.
notwithstanding this provision,no new icas had been entered into until the events which gave rise to this dispute.
at the time qwest and north county first interconnected,the telecommunications industry was undergoing a transition from analog signaling technology,known as mf signaling,to digital signaling technology,known as signaling.these signaling technologies are important because they transmit information with a call as the call crosses a carrier system.much of this information is necessary for local carriers to know so that they can properly bill one another for the costs generated by transmitting calls between their networks.unsurprisingly,signaling has many advantages over mf signaling it is more efficient,more flexible,and more reliable,and it has a greater capacity to track and to record information relevant for billing purposes.
central to the parties dispute is the fact that north county continues to use the increasingly outdated mf signaling to exchange local traffic with qwest.from the record,it appears that every other clec that interconnects with qwest uses signaling to exchange local traffic.that choice has important consequences when it comes to billing.in particular,north county is entitled to bill qwest for some of the local traffic that qwest sends to it when telephone users on qwest network call users on north county network,but north county reliance on mf technology makes it difficult for qwest to verify the accuracy of the bills north county sends over.at the same time,north county does not currently send much traffic to qwest in arizona,for instance,north county primarily provides telephone services to businesses that take incoming calls,but does not transmit outbound calls.if,however,north county were to begin sending traffic to qwest via mf signaling using a service provider,qwest would be unable to identify and measure the traffic being routed from north county network to qwest.
in,qwest suspected that north county was overbilling it.qwest,spurred on by the billing dispute,requested north county to negotiate successor icas in arizona and oregon.north county agreed to enter into negotiations,which lasted more than a year.importantly,during that time north county agreed to a series of extensions of the arbitration window to file a petition for arbitration under b in each of the extension agreements dated january,february,april,and may,north county specifically agreed to extend the period during which either party may file for arbitration under section b l of the act.emphasis added.the negotiations ultimately were not successful.
on august,qwest petitioned for arbitration in both arizona and oregon.north county raised a number of objections.first,north county moved each state commission to dismiss qwest petition for arbitration,arguing that did not give the commissions authority to arbitrate new icas because qwest,not north county,had requested the underlying negotiations.both state commissions denied north county motions to dismiss.in the arizona commission and the oregon commission each approved a new ica icas based on the results of the arbitration hearings.
north county then sought declaratory and injunctive relief in federal district court in arizona and oregon.north county argued that the icas must be declared void ab initio because,north county reiterated,the state commissions lacked authority to arbitrate them.the district courts rejected this argument,although they accepted north county characterization that the relevant negotiations had been requested and initiated by qwest.the arizona district court noted that n o court has directly considered whether the language of sections a and b applies to requests to negotiate made by ilecs to clecs.despite agreeing that the text of the act supported north county and only north county the district courts reasoned that a literal interpretation would be unacceptable because it would frustrate the act two main purposes,which the district courts said were to encourage competition in the telecommunications industry by requiring the good faith negotiation of icas by ilecs and clecs,and to give state commissions a prominent role in overseeing negotiated icas.north county also challenged a number of the icas specific provisions,which the district courts likewise rejected across the board.
each district court granted summary judgment to qwest.north county timely appealed in both cases.

north county first contends that the state commissions lacked authority to arbitrate the icas.qwest does not dispute north county premise that qwest initiated the relevant negotiations.hence,the question is whether qwest,upon deciding it wanted to scrap the existing icas and replace them with a pair of new ones,had the power to initiate negotiations with north county and thereafter to force north county into binding arbitration.if qwest lacked such power,north county contends,then the state commissions had no authority to resolve the parties disagreements.
qwest responds to north county argument by urging that authorized it to request negotiations with north county to replace their existing icas and to petition for binding arbitration when those negotiations hit a snag.aside from the district courts here,however,it appears that no federal court has directly ruled on whether,of its own force,empowers an ilec like qwest to initiate negotiations with a clec and thereafter to force the clec into arbitration if the negotiations fail.
the relevant statutory text does not appear hospitable to the reading qwest proposes.specifically,a,concerning v oluntary negotiations,states that u pon receiving a request for interconnection,services or network elements pursuant to section of this title,an ilec may negotiate and enter into a binding agreement with the requesting telecommunications carrier or carriers.a l emphasis added.section b l then declares that d uring the period from the to the day inclusive after the date on which an ilec receives a request for negotiation under this section,the carrier or any other party to the negotiation may petition a state commission to arbitrate any open issues.b emphasis added.
as all parties acknowledge,both sections refer only to situations where an ilec receives a request for interconnection or negotiation.the statute does not mention requests for negotiations initiated by an ilec or mutually agreed upon by the two carriers.and as everyone also agrees,in this case,the relevant negotiations the ones that led to the icas were requested by qwest,not north county.that circumstance,says north county,means that the telecommunications act could not have functioned as the source of any power in qwest to compel arbitration.
qwest responds in two basic ways.the first and potentially most devastating is that the fcc has definitively interpreted the relevant statutory provision and that such interpretation governs the situation here.qwest argument depends on a footnote in a fcc order called the triennial review order tro in which the fcc stated that a lthough section a and section b refer to requests that are made to incumbent lecs,we find that in the interconnection amendment context,either the incumbent or the competitive lec may make such a request.in the matter of review of the section unbundling obligations of incumbent local exchange carriers,vacated in part and remanded,telecom ass fcc,cir.qwest asserts that the language establishes that qwest had the power to compel arbitration in this case,after it requested north county to negotiate successor icas and those negotiations reached an impasse.furthermore,qwest maintains that the hobbs act,forbids us from reviewing the fcc interpretation 
naturally,the strength of qwest hobbs act argument depends on whether the tro actually addresses the scenario that transpired here if it does not,we could not say that north county attack on qwest is also an attack on the fcc order,because the validity of the tro would simply not be drawn into question at all.qwest hobbs act argument would therefore be neutralized.this question may be close,and it is certainly complicated giving footnote number its proper reading in the context of the surrounding fcc order is no simple task 
second,in addition to relying on the tro,qwest defends its preferred reading of on the merits by invoking the traditional tools of statutory construction,above all by emphasizing the statute supposed purposes and the need to avoid results qwest deems absurd.as noted,qwest position is in some tension with the text of,and we are aware of no federal court to have read the statute in the way qwest proposes.
we may not need to decide whether b on its own gave qwest the power to commence negotiations over the icas and then to force north county into arbitration,because even if the statute did not grant qwest such power,that would not inevitably mean qwest lacked such power qwest would just have to trace such power to a different source.
but what about the icas themselves,which,as private agreements,are capable of defining the parties rights and obligations like any other contracts as we have explained,o nce the terms of an ica are set,either by agreement or arbitration,and the state commission approves the agreement,it becomes a binding contract.pac.bell,at see also coretel,llc verizon,llc,cir.a n ica is a private agreement,which courts must interpret l ike any other contract.tro at permitting voluntary negotiations for binding interconnection agreements is the very essence of section and section.as such,we have held that the agreements themselves and state law principles govern the questions of interpretation of the icas and enforcement of their provisions.pac.bell,at quoting sw.bell pub.util.comm n,cir.
qwest relies heavily on section xxxiv v of the icas.as we noted at the outset of this opinion,section xxxiv v stated 
this agreement shall be effective for a period of years,and thereafter the agreement shall continue in force and effect unless and until a new agreement,addressing all of the terms of this agreement,becomes effective between the parties.the parties agree to commence negotiations on a new agreement no later than two years after this agreement becomes effective.
qwest position is that section xxxiv v not only gives each party the power to initiate negotiations,but also gives each party the power to achieve a new agreement by compelling arbitration before the state commissions if those negotiations fail to resolve all of the parties disputes.in effect,qwest interprets section xxxiv v to make reciprocal what would otherwise be a unilateral power to invoke the process.both state commissions agreed with qwest interpretation of the icas 
we agree as well,and we therefore conclude for the following reasons that the state commissions had authority to arbitrate the icas because the icas themselves gave qwest both the power to initiate negotiations and the power to compel arbitration.
in the first place,north county briefing before this court does not address the argument that the icas authorized qwest to compel arbitration.given that north county is a party to the contract,its silence is damning.so,too,is the course of conduct north county engaged in during the period before qwest petitioned for arbitration.as the parties explained in the joint statement of agreed facts,filed with the district court in the oregon proceeding below,north county and qwest agreed to a series of extensions of the arbitration window to file a petition for arbitration under b in each of the extension agreements north county specifically agreed to extend the period during which either party may file for arbitration under section b of the act.in addition,in january north county agreed to set a date for arbitration.north county does not argue that it took any of these actions under a reservation of rights or the like.
north county behavior under the icas is highly probative of those icas meaning.see,abrams horizon,where an agreement involves repeated occasions for performance by either party with knowledge of the nature of the performance and opportunity for objection to it by the other,any course of performance accepted or acquiesced in without objection is given great weight in the interpretation of the agreement.quoting restatement second of contracts emphasis deleted tarlow arntson,or.en banc how the original parties and their successors conducted themselves in relation to the agreement is instructive in our determination of what must have been intended.to be sure,north county later objected to the state commissions authority to arbitrate.but its failure to do so at any point during the lengthy period of time leading up to litigation casts doubt on whether its current position reflects the proper reading of the icas.further,one might be able to argue that the icas,read as a whole,give qwest only the power to request negotiations,but not the additional power to force arbitration.but north county has not attempted to advance such argument here.
in sum,given the language of the icas negotiation clause and the way it was interpreted by both state commissions below north county conduct in the time leading up to the arbitration proceedings and north county lack of any rebuttal argument before this court we are satisfied that the state commissions had authority to arbitrate the icas because the icas themselves gave qwest the power to invoke the mechanism set forth in.
north county next challenges six specific provisions of the icas themselves the requirement that north county interconnect with qwest directly rather than through a tandem provider the icas relative use factor the requirement that north county employ signaling if and when it originates calls to qwest the requirement that north county pay qwest for certain call detail records the cap on the number of minutes for which north county can bill qwest and the icas failure to allow north county to interconnect using voice over internet protocol.
the operative terms of the oregon and arizona icas are similar or identical,except as indicated herein.we examine each of north county objections in turn.
north county principal claim is that sections and of the icas,which require north county to interconnect with qwest directly rather than indirectly,as in,through a tandem provider,are illegal and unenforceable against it 
section of the icas provides that,u nless otherwise agreed to by the parties,via an amendment to this agreement,the parties will directly exchange traffic between their respective networks without the use of third party transit providers.north county claims this provision is unlawful.north county position appears to be rather strange,given that the icas contained nearly identical language and yet north county has repeatedly stressed that the icas are fully lawful.
equally troubling is the near total lack of support for north county argument.north county cites only one authority for the proposition that federal law requires that it be able to force qwest to interconnect via tandem provider.that authority is a fcc order in which the fcc stated that competitive telecommunications carriers that have the obligation to interconnect with requesting carriers may choose,based upon their own characteristics,whether to allow direct or indirect interconnection.in the matter of implementation of the local competition provisions in the telecommunications act of,hereinafter first report and order.from this,north county concludes that qwest had a clear obligation to allow north county to select indirect interconnection with qwest when qwest submitted its ica negotiation requests.
we are not persuaded that the first report and order renders section unlawful because the fcc ruling is not on point.
in particular,when the fcc language highlights a clec leeway to choose direct indirect,it does so for the limited purpose of illustrating that clecs have different statutory obligations from ilecs.specifically,the order explains,c requires ilecs but not clecs to interconnect directly with requesting carriers.first report and order at section is clear in imposing different obligations on carriers depending upon their classification for example,section c specifically imposes obligations upon incumbent lecs to interconnect,upon request,at all technically feasible points.this direct interconnection,however,is not required under section a of all telecommunications carriers.clecs,by contrast,are not subject to c clecs are governed by a and b,which do not require them to interconnect directly if direct interconnection would be uneconomical or technically infeasible for them.indeed,the major conclusion reached by the fcc order was that indirect connection satisfies a telecommunication carrier duty to interconnect pursuant to section a.first report and order.the fcc emphasized that telecommunications carriers should be permitted to provide interconnection pursuant to section a either directly or indirectly,based upon their most efficient technical and economic choices.id.
in other words,the first report and order merely clarified that clecs are permitted to use indirect interconnection in order to meet the statutory interconnection obligations imposed on them by a.but just because the statute permits clecs to interconnect indirectly with other lecs,does not mean that each clec has the absolute right to demand indirect interconnection of other lecs under any and all circumstances.whatever else it says,the first report and order does not condemn the default rule the icas establish.
hence,the first report and order does not give north county the unilateral right to demand indirect interconnection from qwest.nor does the text of the telecommunications act itself give north county that right.for those reasons,north county can not establish that the icas violate the act simply because they require north county to use direct interconnection for the time being.if north county is to succeed in establishing that it was entitled to indirect interconnection,it must show that the arizona commission acted arbitrarily and capriciously in approving the ica provisions that set direct interconnection as the parties default.
the arizona commission decision to approve the ica direct interconnection provisions may be set aside as arbitrary and capricious only if north county demonstrates that such decision was not supported by substantial evidence,or represents a clear error of judgment on the commission part.radio servs.qwest,cir.quoting verizon,peevey,cir.
north county makes a single argument that if north county were allowed to interconnect indirectly with qwest,specifically through a tandem provider that utilizes signaling,then north county use of mf signaling would become irrelevant.recall that the impetus for qwest request to negotiate the icas was qwest claim that north county had been overbilling it and obscuring the inclusion of inflated costs by using the more opaque mf signaling data.north county argues that interconnection through a tandem provider would render qwest reasons for wanting new icas moot,and the direct interconnection icas forced on north county unnecessary.
north county argument does not establish that the arizona commission committed a clear error of judgment.in the first place,north county has offered no evidence whatsoever to substantiate its assertion that qwest legitimate concerns would evaporate if only north county were permitted to connect through a tandem provider.on the contrary,north county president testified before the commission that he had no clue what kind of call information its tandem provider gives to qwest when it passes a call from north county.moreover,in testimony before the commission,qwest explained that the parties would need to answer numerous questions about the terms and conditions of indirect interconnection,which were not raised during the parties negotiations,before they could interconnect through a tandem provider.finally,section of the icas expressly allows north county to renegotiate this issue in the future.the arizona commission was well within its discretion to approve the provisions requiring direct interconnection for the time being.
north county next objects to the icas relative use factor.
in simplified terms,when someone from qwest network calls someone in north county network or vice versa the traffic must be transmitted through certain facilities,called trunk facilities.but transmitting lo
